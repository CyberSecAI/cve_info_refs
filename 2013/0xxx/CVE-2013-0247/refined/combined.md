# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

### Bug Description

A remote unauthenticated keystone user could potentially fill up the disk on a Keystone server by running the following python script:

-----------------------

from keystoneclient.v2\_0 import client

PASSWORD='foobar'

TENANT='blah'

USER = '00000' \* 9999999

keystone = client.Client(username=USER,

                         password=PASSWORD,

                         tenant\_name=TENANT,

                         auth\_url='[http://localhost:5000/v2.0'](http://localhost:5000/v2.0%27))

-----------

Running this script will increase the log file size by 100 MB per request. NOTE: This happens when running keystone at the default log levels:

# verbose = False

# debug = False

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):

openstack-keystone-2012.2.1-1.el6ost.noarch (Red Hat)

How reproducible:

\*always\*

@ttx: yes. I think it would. I can also look at backporting it there...

----

Also, in addition to these patches I would like to go ahead and put in a 'size\_limit' middleware (same thing we did in Nova) to guard against really large requests in Keystone in general. Any issues with me pushing that patch separately upstream (outside of the scope of thise security issue)?

My immediate concern on reviewing the patches is that they are neither necessary nor sufficient to address the issue: Instead of looking at the token size, we should look at the overall request size, as you can stuff any cookie to blow out the memory. The Token should not be getting logged anywhere, so it should not be an issue in filling up logs.

To your other point the fact that keystone isn't checking these token sizes up front is arguably sloppy and is in fact directly related to this specific issue which is caused by letting allowing really large tokens to go all the way to the database layer. I guess my take is that validating the size of an input parameter (a token) is something we should be doing regardless of whether or not we have a generic request size limiter in place.

Right. If <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/19567/> is not sufficeint, then juchecking Token size won't be,either, as any of the IDs probably can be exploded this way. If I understand the underlying problem, it is that we are logging the whole URL, and the Token ID is in the URL body.

Thus, the fix we need for this is limiting the size of the URL. not justthe size of the token.

I would actually be OK with limiting token size even further. We currently allow a validation of an entire token, with an optimization that we will validate a Hash of the token as the ID. This is actually the PKEY of the token in the database. We can shorten token length for validation to the length of the Hash.

what specifically don't you like about these patches? All I'm doing is:

Add size validations to token controller.

Updates token controller so that it explicitly checks the max

    size of userId, username, tenantId, tenantname, token, and password

    before continuing with a request.

I don't see what is so bad about this? I've tested it manually and it certainly fixes the issue I describe up top.

Also, the request to /tokens we are talking about in this ticket is a POST where the body is really large. (not the URL).

I suspect Adam means that the fix is correct, but does not fully address the class of issues you uncovered, in particular we are still logging the full URL which may be stuffed outside of the userId/username/tenantId/tenantname/token/password parameters.

Since the new size-limiting middleware would only go to Grizzly, if we are indeed logging the full URL somewhere it would probably be a good move to check the size of it in the security fix too (or log only the first n characters).

ayoung/ttx:

Where are we logging request URL's (with verbose/debug logging disabled)?

Also, AFAIK eventlet defaults are going to cover us in terms of limiting both the request URL size and the max size of HTTP headers.

Looking at the source for Eventlets wsgi.py shows:

url\_length\_limit=MAX\_REQUEST\_LINE (which is set to 8192 by default...)

MAX\_HEADER\_LINE = 8192

MAX\_TOTAL\_HEADER\_SIZE = 65536

----

Perhaps I've misunderstood something but if this is in fact what you are concerned about it would appear that eventlet's WSGI defaults cover us here.

----

The issue I'm talking about in this ticket is only caused by a really large request body (100 MB+) where the large data inputs go all the way to the keystone backends and only then get logged to disks.

And by doing that I am able to increase the log file size by 100MB per request at a production logging level. At that rate it isn't going to take that many requests for me to fill up a disk.

@dolph

See the attached keystone.conf and logging.conf above.

Also, If you are interested here is the first snippet of the 96M log message (a single line) after performing the request above:

2013-01-22 11:53:32 ERROR [root] (OperationalError) (2006, 'MySQL server has gone away') 'SELECT user.id AS user\_id, user.name AS user\_name, user.password AS user\_password, user.enabled AS user\_enabled, user.extra AS user\_extra \nFROM user \nWHERE user.name = %s \n LIMIT %s' ('000000000000000000000000000000<snip>

The gist of this patch is that we check value lengths up front in the API layer before passing into the various backends (SQL, LDAP, etc.)

The attack listed above has a couple assumptions:

1. The attack is against an URL that will process unauthenticated requests

2. Limiting the size of values that are sent to the database will prevent them from being logged upon failure.

This patch was just approved for master

<https://review.openstack.org/#/c/19567/>

It does the overall size limiting of the request header. It defends against the attack above and a wider array of attacks: any place where overflowing a field can cause an error.

That patch should be backported to Folsom and Essex as it defends against a wider range of attacks.

The above patch has a few issues with it.

The max values are coded in python. They should be config file values, so they can be tuned in a deployment.

It limits the size of the tokens, which is probably OK, but could be an issue for very large tokens in a limited usage scenario. I would suggest instead that we limit the size of the value that is sent to the backend for looking up a token instead. This number can be much smaller: the length of a UUID/SHA1 hash, and can likely be MAX\_PARAM\_SIZE, not 8K.

My recommendation is that we focus on getting review 19567 backported, and then apply the above patches as good programming practices, but not as a response to a CVE.

The only problem with backporting <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/19567/> is that it requires people to revise their pipelines in order to deploy the new middleware. The patch here definitely fixes a relatively narrow vulnerability specifically exposed on :5000.

+1 for moving MAX\_PARAM\_SIZE, etc, into keystone.conf; the appropriate values will vary among deployments and need to be controlled by the end user.

Dolphm: I think you are spot on. Obviously both of these patches are important... but I do feel like the immediate exploit might be better handled by this patch which takes a more fined grained approach.

Both this patch and what I did in <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/19567/> prevent the issue however. I did 19567 as a catch all to prevent other things we might not know about... not necessarily to supplant the checks here.

-----

I'll look into making MAX\_PARAM\_SIZE a config variable. I suppose I based this roughly on the max size of the SQL backend (which to me seemed like a reasonable default).

ayoung: I do think the MAX\_TOKEN\_SIZE is going to need to be larged than MAX\_PARAM\_SIZE so it warrants either an extra config or global.

I'll look into making MAX\_PARAM\_SIZE a config variable. I suppose I based this roughly on the max size of the SQL backend (which to me seemed like a reasonable default).
ayoung: I do think the MAX\_TOKEN\_SIZE is going to need to be larged than MAX\_PARAM\_SIZE so it warrants either an extra config or global.

The new middleware approach is not acceptable for stable backport, it's basically a new feature. We need to address specific known cases for the security backports, so we need separate patch(es).

Okay. See the latest patches which make a config variable for max\_param\_size and max\_token\_size.

Note that in Essex I made the max\_token\_size match the max\_param\_size since there was no PKI support at that release.

It's basically inconsequential, but in the essex backport for TokenController, there's a redundant three lines validating:

len(tenant\_id) > CONF.max\_param\_size

Also, there's some trivial refactoring (pulling CONF into the local namespace) in the grizzly patch that you backported to folsom. +1 for the refactoring, but I'm not sure it should be included in the backport?

Grizzly patch looks good. I'll defer to Dolph on the others regarding the refactoring, but they look good to me.

Are the config.CONF.signing -> CONF.signing changes in the grizzly patch actually necessary for the fix ? Minimal fix is preferred for security patches.

About to push patchsets to downstream stakeholders with following impact description:

----------

Title: Keystone denial of service through invalid token requests

Reporter: Dan Prince (Red Hat)

Products: Keystone

Affects: All versions

Description:

Dan Prince of Red Hat reported a vulnerability in token creation error handling in Keystone. By requesting lots of invalid tokens, an unauthenticated user may fill up logs on Keystone API servers disks, potentially resulting in a denial of service attack against Keystone.

# USN-1715-1: OpenStack Keystone vulnerability

5 February 2013

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [keystone](/security/cves?package=keystone) - OpenStack identity service

## Details

Dan Prince discovered that Keystone did not properly perform input

validation when handling certain error conditions. An unauthenticated user

could exploit this to cause a denial of service in Keystone API servers via

disk space exhaustion.

## Topic

Updated openstack-keystone packages that fix one security issue and two
bugs are now available for Red Hat OpenStack Folsom.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

The openstack-keystone packages provide Keystone, a Python implementation
of the OpenStack identity service API, which provides Identity, Token,
Catalog, and Policy services.

It was found that an excessive amount of information was logged when
invalid tokens were requested, resulting in large log files. An attacker
could use this flaw to consume an excessive amount of disk space by
requesting a large number of invalid tokens. (CVE-2013-0247)

The CVE-2013-0247 issue was discovered by Dan Prince of Red Hat.

This update also fixes two bugs that could have caused 'keystone' commands
(such as 'keystone endpoint-delete' and 'keystone service-get') to fail
with a 'No handlers could be found for logger "keystoneclient.v2\_0.client"'
and 'Authorization Failed' error. (BZ#857290, BZ#888328)

All users of openstack-keystone are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which correct these issues. After installing the updated
packages, the Keystone service (openstack-keystone) will be restarted
automatically.
