{
  "CVE-2013-0212": {
    "Description": "The vulnerability lies in Glance's error reporting mechanism when using Swift as a backend, specifically in single-tenant mode. If an image cannot be retrieved from Swift due to a misconfigured endpoint or an unusable endpoint for a previously active image, Glance could expose the operator's Swift credentials in the error message.",
    "Root cause": "The root cause of the issue is that the Swift store can raise NotFound exceptions that include the backend location URI, which contains credentials in single-tenant mode.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insecure error handling",
       "Exposure of sensitive information"
    ],
    "Impact": "An authenticated user could gain access to the Glance operator's Swift credentials for a specific endpoint.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "By creating an image in Glance by URL that references a mis-configured Swift endpoint.",
      "If the Swift endpoint that a previously-ACTIVE image references for any reason becomes unusable"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with access to the Glance server to trigger the vulnerable error reporting.",
       "Affected products": [
      "OpenStack Glance (all versions)",
        "Red Hat OpenStack Folsom",
        "Ubuntu 12.10",
         "Ubuntu 12.04",
         "Ubuntu 11.10"
