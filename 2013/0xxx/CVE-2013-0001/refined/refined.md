{
  "CVE-2013-0001": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to the .NET Framework improperly initializing the contents of a memory array.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper initialization of a memory array, leading to information disclosure.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can bypass Code Access Security (CAS) restrictions and obtain data from unmanaged memory locations, which may include sensitive information.",
    "Attack vectors": "Two attack scenarios are possible:\n\n1.  Web browsing: An attacker hosts a malicious webpage with a specially crafted XBAP (XAML browser application) that exploits the vulnerability. The user needs to be convinced to visit the website.\n2. Windows .NET applications: A malicious Windows .NET application exploits the vulnerability to bypass CAS restrictions.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "For the web browsing scenario, the attacker needs to host a malicious website and convince users to visit it. For the Windows .NET application scenario, the attacker needs to execute a malicious .NET application on the target system."
  },
  "CVE-2013-0002": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to the .NET Framework improperly validating the number of objects in memory before copying them into an array.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Buffer overflow vulnerability due to improper validation of object counts during memory copy operations.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can gain complete control of the affected system, enabling them to install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "Attack vectors": "Two attack scenarios are possible:\n\n1.  Web browsing: An attacker hosts a malicious webpage with a specially crafted XBAP (XAML browser application) that exploits the vulnerability. The user needs to be convinced to visit the website.\n2.

   "CVE-2013-0004": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to the .NET Framework improperly validating the permissions of certain objects in memory.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper permission validation of memory objects leading to elevation of privilege.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can gain complete control of the affected system, enabling them to install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.",
