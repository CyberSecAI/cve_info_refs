Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2013-0716:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from improper input validation within the VxWorks Web Server. Specifically, it arises when the server parses and processes command strings received in a crafted URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation (CWE-20):** The web server fails to adequately validate the command strings within a URL, leading to the possibility of a denial-of-service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By sending a specially crafted URL, an attacker can cause the VxWorks Web Server to crash, rendering it unavailable until restarted.
*   The impact is described as "partial" in the CVSS v2 score, which implies a degradation of service, but not complete loss.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The attack vector is network-based, meaning the attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely over the network.
*   **Malicious URL:**  The vulnerability is triggered when a user accesses the VxWorks Web Server with a specially crafted URL containing malicious command strings.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote:** The attacker can be remote and doesn't need to be on the same local network.
*   **No Authentication:** No authentication is needed to trigger the vulnerability; the server can be accessed anonymously.
*   **Low Skill Level:** The attack is considered to have a low complexity, suggesting that little expertise is required to carry it out.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Products:**  VxWorks versions 5.5 through 6.9 are affected.
*   **CVSS Score:** A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L) and CVSS v2 score of 5.0 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P) have been assigned to the vulnerability.
*  **Mitigation:**  The vulnerability can be fixed by applying a software patch provided by Wind River.
*   **Discovered By:** Hisashi Kojima and Masahiro Nakada of Fujitsu Laboratories Ltd. discovered this vulnerability.
