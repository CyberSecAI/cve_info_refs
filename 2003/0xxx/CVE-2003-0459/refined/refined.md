    "content": "The provided content contains information about a security vulnerability in Konqueror, a web browser within the KDE desktop environment. This vulnerability is identified as CAN-2003-0459, which is the older ID for CVE-2003-0459.\n\nRoot cause of vulnerability: \nKonqueror may leak authentication credentials through the HTTP-referer header.\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present:\nThe vulnerability occurs when a user includes their username and password directly in a URL (e.g., http://user:password@host/). When Konqueror navigates to another site from that page, it can unintentionally send these credentials in clear text within the HTTP Referer header. This is a weakness because the Referer header is meant to inform the destination server of the origin of the request, not to transmit authentication data.\n\nImpact of exploitation:\nAn attacker who can intercept network traffic or control a website can obtain the user's credentials, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the password-protected website. This includes:\n\n*   Third parties obtaining credentials through links on a password-protected website.\n*   Eavesdropping on the network communication to get the credentials.\n\nAttack vectors:\n*   The attack vector involves navigating to a site after having entered credentials directly in the URL within Konqueror.\n*   An attacker can obtain credentials by being a malicious third party who hosts a link on a password protected site, or by eavesdropping network traffic.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position:\nAn attacker needs to be in a position to:\n\n*   Either be the malicious third party who hosts a link on a password protected site, or\n*   Eavesdrop network traffic to intercept the HTTP Referer header containing the credentials.",
    "additional_details": "The advisory provides a clear description of the vulnerability, its impact, and how to mitigate it, which matches the CVE description.\nThe advisory also provides links to patches that address this vulnerability for different versions of KDE, and provides a timeline of vulnerability disclosure and fixes."
