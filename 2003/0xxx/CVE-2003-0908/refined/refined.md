      "text": "## Utility Manager Vulnerability - CAN-2003-0908:\nA [privilege elevation](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21142) vulnerability exists in the way that Utility Manager launches applications. A logged-on user could force Utility Manager to start an application with system privileges and take complete control of the system.\n\n#### Mitigating Factors for Utility Manager Vulnerability - CAN-2003-0908:\n\n*   An attacker must have valid logon credentials to exploit the vulnerability. The vulnerability could not be exploited by anonymous users.\n*   Windows NT 4.0, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 are not affected by this vulnerability. Windows NT 4.0 does not implement the Utility Manager.\n*   The [Windows 2000 Hardening Guide](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=15e83186-a2c8-4c8f-a9d0-a0201f639a56&displaylang;=en) recommends disabling the Utility Manger service. Environments that comply with these guidelines could be at a reduced risk from this vulnerability.\n\n#### Workarounds for Utility Manager Vulnerability - CAN-2003-0908:\n\nMicrosoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified below.\n\n*   **Use Group Policies to disable the Utility Manager on all affected systems that do not require this feature.**\n\n    Because the Utility Manager is a possible attack vector, disable it using Group Policies. The Utility Manager process name is Utilman.exe. The following guide provides information about how to require users to run only approved applications using [Group Policies](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windows2000serv/howto/grpolwt.mspx).\n\n    **Note** You may also review the [Windows 2000 Hardening Guide](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=15e83186-a2c8-4c8f-a9d0-a0201f639a56&displaylang;=en). This guide includes information about how to disable the Utility Manager.\n\n    **Impact of Workaround:**\n\n    The Utility Manager provides easy access to many of the accessibility features of the operating system. This access would be unavailable until the restrictions are removed. To find information about how to manually start many of the accessibility features, visit this [Web site](https://www.microsoft.com/enable/training/windows2000/default.aspx).\n\n#### FAQ for Utility Manager Vulnerability - CAN-2003-0908:\n\n**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**\n\nThis is a [privilege elevation](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21142) vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system, including installing programs; viewing, changing, or deleting data; or creating new accounts that have full privileges.\n\n**What causes the vulnerability?**\n\nThe process used by Utility Manager to launch applications. It is possible that Utility Manager could launch applications with system privileges.\n\n**What is Utility Manager?**\n\nUtility Manager is an [accessibility utility](https://www.microsoft.com/enable/at/default.aspx) that allows users to check the status of accessibility programs such as Microsoft Magnifier, Narrator, or On-Screen Keyboard, and to start or stop them.\n\n**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**\n\nAn attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system, including installing programs; viewing, changing, or deleting data; or creating new accounts that have full privileges.\n\n**Who could exploit the vulnerability?**\n\nAn attacker must be able to log on to the system and then, after starting Utility Manager, run a program that sends a specially crafted message to Utility Manager to attempt to exploit the vulnerability.\n\n**How could an attacker exploit this vulnerability?**\n\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to start Utility Manager on Windows 2000 and then run a specially designed application that could exploit the vulnerability. In default configurations of Window 2000, Utility Manager is installed but is not running. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to gain complete control over a Windows 2000 system.\n\n**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**\n\nOnly Windows 2000 is affected by this vulnerability. Workstations and terminal servers that are based on Windows 2000 are primarily at risk. Servers are only at risk if users who do not have sufficient administrative credentials are given the ability to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.\n\n**I am using Windows 2000, but I am not using Utility Manager or any of the accessibility features. Am I still vulnerable?**\n\nYes. By default, Utility Manager is installed and enabled. However, Utility Manager is not running by default.\n\n**Could the vulnerability be exploited over the Internet?**\n\nNo. An attacker must be able to log on to the specific system targeted for attack. An attacker cannot load and run a program remotely using this vulnerability.\n\n**What does the update do?**\n\nThis update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that Utility Manager launches applications."
