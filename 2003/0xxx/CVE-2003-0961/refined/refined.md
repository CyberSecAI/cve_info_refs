      "date": "2003-12-04"
    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root cause": "Integer overflow in the do_brk function within the Linux kernel.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Integer Overflow",
        "Missing bounds checking"
      ],
      "Impact": "Local users can exploit this vulnerability to gain access to the kernel address space and gain elevated privileges, potentially leading to full privilege escalation.",
      "Attack vector": "Local exploitation.",
      "Required attacker capabilities": "A local user on the system."
    },
    "Additional Information": "The provided content includes a Linux kernel module (`brk_fix.c`) intended as a hotfix for the `do_brk` vulnerability. This module modifies kernel memory by redirecting calls and jumps to the vulnerable `do_brk` function to a wrapper routine (`my_brk`). The wrapper routine performs bounds checking before calling the original `do_brk` function, thereby preventing exploitation."
