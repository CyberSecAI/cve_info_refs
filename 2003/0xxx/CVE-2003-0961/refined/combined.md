Greetings,

I've written a linux kernel module that can be used to hot fix a
Linux system for the bug in do_brk.  It scans the
kernel space and replaces jmp and calls to do_brk
to point to a wrapper routine instead.  It also maps
the symbol table to point to the wrapper.  This only
works on x86 and it has only been tested with RH kernels
2.4.18-27.7.xsmp and 2.4.20-20.7smp.  It is quite possible
this could crash or screw-up a system, so use at your own
risk.  I've tested the module against the proof of concept code
written and posted by Christophe Devine.  The module catches
the exploit and logs the attempt.

/* brk_fix
 * Verions: 0.01
 *
 * WARNING WARNING WARNING
 * This module intentionally modifies kernel memory.
 * This module could potentially crash or damage your system.
 * Use at your own risks.
 *
 *  Hot fix for integer overflow in do_brk
 *
 *  This module scans kernel code space looking for jumps and calls
 *  to do_brk.  It then changes these calls to instead call my_brk,
 *  which is a wrapper routine that does some checks before calling do_brk.
 *  The module also scans for the address of do_brk and replaces it
 *  with my_brk.  This would mainly occur in the exported symbols table.
 *
 *  This has been tested with RH 2.4.20-20.7smp and RH 2.4.18-27.7.xsmp on i686
 *
 *  Sample use...
 *  gcc -O3 -I/lib/modules/`uname -r`/build/include   -c -o brk_fix.o brk_fix.c
 *  insmod ./brk_fix.o

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Hi,

We have released a paper covering technical details of the do_brk() bug
and the results of our research done while writing the exploit code.
It also describes the numerous techniques we have used to create a very
effective exploit code that leads to full privilege escalation even on
systems running a kernel secured with various security patches.

It can be found at: <http://isec.pl/papers/linux_kernel_do_brk.pdf>

Regards,

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
