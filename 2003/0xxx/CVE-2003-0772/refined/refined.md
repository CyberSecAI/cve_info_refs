- Root cause of vulnerability: Buffer overflow in the processing of FTP commands.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The WS_FTP server is vulnerable to a buffer overflow when processing overly long commands via the "quote" command. Specifically, the `status`, `append`, or potentially other commands can trigger the overflow.
- Impact of exploitation: Successful exploitation can lead to a denial of service, crashing the FTP server, and potentially allowing arbitrary code execution.
- Attack vectors: Remote attackers can exploit the vulnerability by sending an overly long string as part of a quoted FTP command after authenticating to the server.
- Required attacker capabilities/position:  The attacker needs to authenticate to the FTP server with valid credentials, or exploit it through anonymous access if enabled.

- Root cause of vulnerability: Buffer overflow vulnerability in the processing of the "APPE" command.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The WS_FTP Server versions 3.00, 4.00, and 4.01 are vulnerable to a buffer overflow when processing the APPE command.
- Impact of exploitation:  Successful exploitation can lead to an authenticated user executing arbitrary code with the elevated privileges of the server process. If anonymous access is enabled, authentication is not required for exploitation.
- Attack vectors: Remote attackers can exploit the vulnerability by sending an overly long string as part of the APPE command.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to authenticate to the FTP server with valid credentials, or exploit it through anonymous access if enabled.

- Root cause of vulnerability: Buffer overflow vulnerability in the processing of the "STAT" command.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The WS_FTP Server versions 3.00, 4.00, and 4.01 are vulnerable to a buffer overflow when processing the STAT command.
- Impact of exploitation: Successful exploitation can lead to an authenticated user executing arbitrary code with the elevated privileges of the server process. If anonymous access is enabled, authentication is not required for exploitation.
- Attack vectors: Remote attackers can exploit the vulnerability by sending an overly long string as part of the STAT command.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to authenticate to the FTP server with valid credentials, or exploit it through anonymous access if enabled.
