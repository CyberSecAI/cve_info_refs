Advisory Title: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Neoteris IVE Allows Session Hijacking
Release Date: May 13, 2003
Product: Neoteris Instant Virtual Extranet (IVE), Versions 3.01 and Prior
Overall Risk: Medium
CVE Candidate: CAN-2003-0217
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PRODUCT OVERVIEW:

Neoteris Instant Virtual Extranet (IVE) is an appliance-based remote access solution \
that is  accessed via a standard web browser. The Neoteris IVE is one of the more \
well known "clientless  VPN" solutions, and in fact boasts an impressive, growing \
list of customers (see  <http://www.neoteris.com> for more information). Once \
authenticated to the remote network via the  IVE, a user can theoretically access all \
internal resources, provided the Neoteris box is  configured accordingly.

Quoting from the company website, "The Neoteris IVE has always provided a means to \
remote access  with a dramatically lower Total Cost of Ownership vs. traditional \
methods like VPN or dial. The  IVE also enhances security, by eliminating open-ended, \
network layer connections. The security of  the IVE has been verified by a several \
well-known independent security authorities."

VULNERABILITY:

A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in Neoteris IVE v3.01 and prior. An \
argument  passed to a CGI script does not properly validate input. It has been \
confirmed that exploiting  this vulnerability can lead to a legitimate user's session \
being hijacked, bypassing any  authentication.

SOLUTION:

I would like to thank Neoteris for their cooperation in developing a remediation for \
this  vulnerability. A patch has been released for v3.01 and prior. In addition, this \
issue has been  fixed in v3.1. Patch and new version release information is available \
for customers at  <https://support.neoteris.com>.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name \
CAN-2003-0217 to this

issue. This is a candidate for inclusion in the CVE list (<http://cve.mitre.org>), \
which  standardizes names for security problems.

Special thanks to DW (shall I say greetz?) for his invaluable help with these issues. \
