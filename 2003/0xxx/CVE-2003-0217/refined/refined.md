- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists because a CGI script does not properly validate input passed as an argument.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit can lead to a legitimate user's session being hijacked, bypassing authentication.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by passing a malicious argument to a CGI script.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to inject the malicious script into the vulnerable CGI script argument and trick a user to access it.
