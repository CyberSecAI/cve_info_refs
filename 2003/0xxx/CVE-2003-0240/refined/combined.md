Vendors contacted:
  - Axis Communications
    . Core Notification: 2003-04-10
    . Notification acknowledged by Axis: 2003-04-17
    . 2.34 Release candidate for the Axis 2400/2401 Video Servers
      available: 2003-04-17
    . Fixed versions available for all affected products: 2003-05-27

Release Mode: COORDINATED RELEASE

*Vulnerability Description:*

  An Axis Network Camera captures and transmits live images directly
  over an IP network (e.g. LAN/intranet/Internet), enabling users to
  remotely view and/or manage the camera from a Web browser on any
  computer. For more information see <http://www.axis.com>

  After setting up the Axis Camera, the user is provided with
  Web-based Administration Tools for configuring and managing the
  camera by accessing <http://camera-ip/admin/admin.shtml>, which
  requires a username and password.

  We have discovered the following security vulnerability: by accessing
     <http://camera-ip//admin/admin.shtml>
  (notice the double slash) the authentication for "admin" is bypassed
  and an attacker gains direct access to the configuration.

  Using this vulnerability, an attacker can reset the root password,
  then enable the telnet server by modifying configuration files,
  giving the attacker interactive access to a Unix like command line,
  allowing her to execute arbitrary commands as root.

*Vulnerable Packages:*

  . AXIS 2100 Network Camera versions 2.32 and previous
  . AXIS 2110 Network Camera versions 2.32 and previous
  . AXIS 2120 Network Camera versions 2.32 and previous
  . AXIS 2130 PTZ Network Camera versions 2.32 and previous
  . AXIS 2400 Video Server versions 2.32 and previous
  . AXIS 2401 Video Server versions 2.32 and previous
  . AXIS 2420 Network Camera versions 2.32 and previous
  . AXIS 2460 Network DVR versions 3.00 and previous
  . AXIS 250S Video Server versions 3.02 and previous

  vulnerability in its Network Camera and Video Server products.

  Recommended Actions:
  We strongly recommend that all devices are updated to these
  firmware versions.

*Credits:*

  This vulnerability was found by Juliano Rizzo from Core Security
  Technologies.

  We wish to thank Joacim Tullberg from Axis for his quick response to
  this issue.

*Technical Description - Exploit/Concept Code:*

  We have discovered the following security vulnerability: by accessing
   <http://camera-ip//admin/admin.shtml>
  (notice the double slash) the authentication for "admin" is bypassed
  and an attacker gains direct access to the configuration.

  In the same way, an attacker can access the other administration
  tools for the camera, for example:
   <http://camera-ip//admin/img_general.shtml>
   <http://camera-ip//admin/netw_tcp.shtml>
   <http://camera-ip//admin/sys_date.shtml>
   <http://camera-ip//admin/com_port.shtml>
   <http://camera-ip//admin/op_general.shtml>
   <http://camera-ip//admin/sys_motiond.shtml>

  Note that the workaround for a recently published Axis HTTP Server
  vulnerability (see reference [[1]](#1)) was to add authentication to
  some particular paths. With this vulnerability the authentication
  can be bypassed, so the mentioned Information Disclosure
  vulnerability can still be exploited.

  The affected Axis devices run a Linux like operating system. With
  this vulnerability an attacker can reset the root password. Then
  using the default open ftp server, the attacker can download
  configuration files, modify these files and upload them again.
  Modifying /etc/inittab it is possible to enable the Telnet server
  (see [[2]](#2) a technical note explaining how to enable Telnet support),
  giving the attacker interactive access to a Unix like command line.
  Axis provides free developer tools (see [[3]](#3)), so it is feasible
  for an attacker to build tools like port scanners or proxies to
  start attacks from the compromised camera (which are usually
  installed inside internal networks) which could lead to the
  compromise of the internal network.

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
