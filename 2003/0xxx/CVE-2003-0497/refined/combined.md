[Information Sharing Terms](https://www.intersystems.com/support/information-sharing-terms/)

Information security and privacy are forefront concerns for InterSystems when interacting with our customers, partners, or other parties. To that end, InterSystems does not maintain accounts on or directly access your systems or environments. Importantly, our support advisors across all of our products will work with you to understand your issue and not request to use your data or to view your system unless actually and truly needed for any problem solving, which occurs only in the rarest of circumstances. Most times, the information that we need to resolve an issue relates to system or database settings, error reports or displays, or object script code, rather than the data itself. If we do need to view your data or the specific operation of the product on your systems, we would arrange with you for secure “over the shoulder” access, using Webex or some other secure screen sharing option with the focus on never having independent or direct access to your systems or data. Our goal is to keep your data with you while solving your issue.
