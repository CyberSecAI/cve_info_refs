The provided content details two vulnerabilities in OneOrZero version 1.4 rc4: an SQL injection vulnerability and an issue that allows unauthorized admin account creation.

**1. SQL Injection Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:** The `supporter/tupdate.php` script directly uses user-supplied input (`$sg`) in an SQL query without proper sanitization or escaping.
*   **Weakness:**  SQL Injection vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can manipulate the SQL query to modify database data or potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, as demonstrated by modifying a ticket's description.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted GET request to `supporter/tupdate.php` with malicious values for the `groupid`, `sg`, and `id` parameters.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable application.

**2. Admin Account Creation Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:** The `admin/install.php` script allows the creation of an admin account even if one already exists. Additionally, the script doesn't properly sanitize input before inserting it into the database.
*   **Weakness:**  Lack of proper installation checks and lack of input sanitization.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can create a new admin account and gain full administrative access to the application by making a POST request to the install script and filling the fields with their chosen credentials.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted POST request to `admin/install.php` with required data for the admin account creation.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable application. They need to know the structure of the request to fill the correct parameters to create a new account.
