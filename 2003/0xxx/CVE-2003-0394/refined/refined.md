- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a missing include statement for `server.inc.php4` in `admin/objects.inc.php4`. The script uses user-controlled parameters `Server[path]` and `Server[language_file]` to include other php files. Because the `server.inc.php4` file is not included, these parameters can be manipulated to inject and execute arbitrary PHP code.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The code has an include statement that takes user input via the GET parameters `Server[path]` and `Server[language_file]` without proper sanitization, leading to arbitrary file inclusion and remote code execution.

- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server. This could lead to complete compromise of the server, allowing data theft, modification or denial of service.

- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is via HTTP GET requests to the `admin/objects.inc.php4` script, setting the `Server[path]` and `Server[language_file]` parameters to attacker-controlled URLs containing malicious PHP code.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable BLNews instance. The attacker needs to host files containing malicious PHP code accessible by the vulnerable server.
