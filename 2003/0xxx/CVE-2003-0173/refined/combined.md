## SGI IRIX "xfsdump" creates quota information files insecurely

#### Vulnerability Note VU#111673

Original Release Date: 2003-04-10 | Last Revised: 2003-06-16

---

### Overview

A vulnerability exists in xfsdump on SGI IRIX. Exploitation of this vulnerability may allow a local attacker to gain root privileges. Because other operating systems ship with xfsdump, vendors other than SGI may be affected.

### Description

| From the [xfsdump man page](http://www.mcsr.olemiss.edu/cgi-bin/man-cgi?xfsdump+1):  xfsdump backs up files and their attributes in a filesystem. The files are dumped to storage media, a regular file, or standard output. Options allow the operator to have all files dumped, just files that have changed since a previous dump, or just files contained in a list of pathnames.xfsdump does not create quota files in a secure manner. As a result, a local attacker may be able to gain superuser privileges on a vulnerable system. For more details, please see SGI Security Advisory [20030404-01-P](http://lists.netsys.com/pipermail/full-disclosure/2003-April/009167.html). |
| --- |

### Impact

| A local attacker may be able to gain superuser privileges. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Apply a patch from your vendor. |

                Mandrake Linux Security Update Advisory
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Package name:           xfsdump
Advisory ID:            MDKSA-2003:047
Date:                   April 16th, 2003

Affected versions:8.2, 9.0, 9.1, Corporate Server 2.1
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Problem Description:

 A vulnerability was discovered in xfsdump by Ethan Benson related to
 filesystem quotas on the XFS filesystem.  When xfsdump runs xfsdq to
 save the quota information into a file at the root of the filesystem
 being dumped, the file is created in an unsafe manner.

 A new option to xfsdq was added when fixing this vulnerability:
 '-f path'.  This specifies an output file to use instead of the
 default output stream.  If the file exists already, xfsdq will
 abort and if the file doesn't already exist, it will be created
 with more appropriate access permissions.
