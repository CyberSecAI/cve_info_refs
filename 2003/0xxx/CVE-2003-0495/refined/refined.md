Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The LedNews CGI application, written in Perl, fails to filter or sanitize user-supplied input, specifically HTML tags and JavaScript. This lack of input validation allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into news posts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The primary weakness is the absence of any filtering of HTML tags or JavaScript in user-supplied news posts.
*   **Potential SSI Injection:** The report also suggests the possibility of injecting Server-Side Includes (SSI) tags due to the lack of filtering, although this was not explicitly tested.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Cookie Theft:** By injecting JavaScript, an attacker can steal user cookies by redirecting them to a malicious site. This could lead to session hijacking and unauthorized access to user accounts.
*   **Potentially more:** The content also notes the potential for server side include injection, which would have a different and potentially more serious impact.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **News Posts:** The primary attack vector is through the submission of malicious code within the content of a news post.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to post content to the LedNews application.
*   Basic understanding of HTML and JavaScript.
