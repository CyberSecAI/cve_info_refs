{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The default configuration of Sendmail on IBM AIX enables three options that allow arbitrary users to route email: \"promiscuous_relay\", \"accept_unresolvable_domains\", and \"accept_unqualified_senders\".",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Sendmail is configured as an open mail relay by default.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Any remote user can route mail through the vulnerable Sendmail server, leading to abuse for delivering unsolicited commercial email (UCE) or SPAM.",
  "Attack vectors": "Remote, unauthenticated users can send email through the vulnerable server.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable server and does not need any authentication."
