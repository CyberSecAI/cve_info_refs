{
  "CVE-2003-0015": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "A double-free vulnerability exists in the CVS server's memory management during the processing of directory change requests.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
        "Double-free vulnerability",
        "Unsafe use of update-prog/checkin-prog feature"
      ],
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can exploit the double-free bug to bypass write access checks, potentially leading to arbitrary command execution with the privileges of the CVS server. This is especially severe in 'pserver' mode used for anonymous read-only access, where attackers could gain write privileges.",
      "Attack vectors": [
        "Remote exploitation via crafted directory change requests to a vulnerable CVS server.",
        "Leveraging write privileges gained through the double-free vulnerability to utilize the update-prog and checkin-prog features."
      ],
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker requires network access to a vulnerable CVS server, potentially anonymous read-only access when 'pserver' mode is enabled."
    },
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The CVS server contains a programming error that allows a memory block to be freed more than once.",
       "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
        "Double-free vulnerability"
        ],
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker may exploit the double-free vulnerability to bypass write access checks, and with update-prog/checkin-prog, execute arbitrary commands with CVS server's privileges.",
      "Attack vectors": [
        "Remote exploitation via specially crafted requests, especially in pserver mode.",
          "Use of update-prog/checkin-prog feature by attacker"
      ],
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable CVS server. The impact is severe when CVS server runs in pserver mode providing anonymous read-only access."
    },
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "A double-free vulnerability exists within the dirswitch function of the CVS server.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
        "Double-free vulnerability"
      ],
      "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows unprivileged access to the system. An attacker can overwrite arbitrary memory locations leading to the execution of arbitrary commands.",
      "Attack vectors": [
        "Remote exploitation of the pserver with crafted directory change requests"
      ],
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Network access to a vulnerable CVS server, with anonymous access sufficient to trigger the vulnerability."
