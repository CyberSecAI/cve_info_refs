Greetings--

    Attached to this e-mail you'll find a Java program which probes a
CVS pserver for the recent double-free() vulnerability.
    I've tested it on a Linux architecture only; it would be much
appreciated if people would mail me back with its performance results
against *BSD, AIX, etc...

    Here is how this tool works:

[jdog@wonderland jdog]$ java CVSProber 192.168.1.5 jdog chad0wnzme /cvs
Connecting...connected.
Server responded with 'ok', which means that it is not vulnerable.
Probe completed.
[jdog@wonderland jdog]$ java CVSProber 192.168.1.7 anonymous /cvs
Connecting...connected.
Server killed the connection and thus appears to be vulnerable!
Probe completed.
[jdog@wonderland jdog]$

    Word.

                                                          The FreeBSD Project

Topic:          remotely exploitable vulnerability in cvs server

Category:       contrib
Module:         contrib_cvs
Announced:      2003-02-04
Credits:        Stefan Esser <s.esser@e-matters.de>
Affects:        All FreeBSD versions prior to 4.6-RELEASE-p7, 4.7-RELEASE-p4,
                5.0-RELEASE-p1
Corrected:      2003-01-21 22:26:46 UTC (RELENG_4)
                2003-02-04 18:05:07 UTC (RELENG_5_0)
                2003-02-04 18:07:20 UTC (RELENG_4_7)
                2003-02-04 18:08:26 UTC (RELENG_4_6)
FreeBSD only:   NO

I.   Background

The Concurrent Versions System (CVS) is a version control system.  It
may be used to access a repository locally, or to access a `remote
repository' using several different methods, including `ext' (rsh),
and `pserver' (password-authenticated server).  When accessing a
remote repository, the target machine runs the CVS server to fulfill
client requests.

II.  Problem Description

The implementation of the CVS server contains a programming error which
can lead to a block of memory being freed more than once (i.e. a
double-free bug).

Separately, the CVS server allows clients with write access to specify
arbitrary commands to execute as part of an update (update-prog) or
commit (checkin-prog).  This is a dangerous feature that is generally
not needed: there are other, safer methods of triggering program
execution.

III. Impact

An attacker may exploit the double-free bug in order to bypass write
access checks.  Combined with the update-prog/checkin-prog feature,
the attacker may be able to execute arbitrary commands with the
privileges of the CVS server.  The impact is most severe when running
the CVS server in `pserver' mode to provide read-only access to the
world (anoncvs).

IV.  Workaround

Do not use `pserver' mode directly.  Instead, use one of the safer
methods described in the following online resources:

<URL:<http://openbsd.sunsite.ualberta.ca/papers/anoncvs-paper.ps>>
<URL:<http://www.netsys.com/library/papers/chrooted-ssh-cvs-server.txt>>

V.   Solution

1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to 4.7-STABLE; or to the RELENG_4_7
(4.7-RELEASE-p4), RELENG_4_6 (4.6-RELEASE-p7), or RELENG_5_0
(5.0-RELEASE-p1) security branch dated after the correction date.

2) To patch your present system:

The following patch has been verified to apply to FreeBSD 4.6, 4.7, and
5.0 systems.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

# fetch ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/patches/SA-03:01/cvs.patch
# fetch ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/patches/SA-03:01/cvs.patch.asc

b) Execute the following commands as root:

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
# cd /usr/src/gnu/usr.bin/cvs
# make obj && make depend && make && make install

VI.  Correction details

The following list contains the revision numbers of each file that was
corrected in FreeBSD.

# RHSA-2003:013 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

cvs security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Critical

## Topic

Updated CVS packages are now available for Red Hat Linux Advanced Server.
These updates fix a vulnerability which would permit arbitrary command
execution on servers configured to allow anonymous read-only access.

[Updated 06 Feb 2003]
Added fixed packages for Advanced Workstation 2.1

## Description

CVS is a version control system frequently used to manage source code
repositories. During an audit of the CVS sources, Stefan Esser discovered
an exploitable double-free bug in the CVS server.

On servers which are configured to allow anonymous read-only access, this
bug could be used by anonymous users to gain write privileges. Users with
CVS write privileges can then use the Update-prog and Checkin-prog features
to execute arbitrary commands on the server.

All users of CVS are advised to upgrade to these packages which
contain patches to correct the double-free bug.

Our thanks go to Stefan Esser of e-matters for reporting this issue to us.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

Subject:    Exploit for CVS double free() for Linux pserver
From:       [Igor Dobrovitski <noident () mad ! scientist ! com>](?a=104418867700002&r=1&w=2)

A bug in cvs versions up to and including 1.11.4 was recently found
where, under certain conditions,
a pointer is free()'d, and then free()'d again without being
re-initialised.
The reports with regards to the exploitability of the condition in
question range from -
"it is a classical exploitable double-free()" to "may possibly be
exploited".
I have written an exploit for Linux for pserver, and contrary to my usual
practice, decided to make it public.
First, I couldn't find any papers on the internet that would explain the
exploitation techniques of
double-free(), and I believe we don't have many publically available
exploits or in-depth discussion on the matter.
I hope that this little explanation that I've put together, and the
exploit itself may be somewhat useful
to the hacker/security community (we can't exist without each other, can
we? :)
The impact of a successful exploitation is not that great: an unprivileged
access to the system,
where your calls to getuid() will return a number that's far from 0 (cvs
drops provileges, and does it right).
The audience is expected to be familiar with D.L. malloc implementation.
The explanation of how D.L. malloc works can be found in two articles in
phrack 57.

If a request for a memory chunk is made, and if chunks that are kept in
linked lists, or the last remaindered chunk
cannot satisfy the requirement, the top memory chunk is split off, and a
chunk of the right size is returned
to malloc(). When this chunk is later free()'d, it may be coalesced with
other adjacent chunks if any of
the adjacent chunks are free. If not, the chunk is placed in a linked
list. After being processed by
the frontlink() macro, the linked list looks like this: we have two items
in the list, the bin and the chunk,
both BK and FD pointers of the bin point to the chunk, and both BK and FD
pointers of the chunk point to the bin.
Now, should this chunk be free()'d again, while on the linked list, the
picture changes. After the second free()
is called and the chunk is processed by the frontlink() again, we have
both BK and FD pointers of the bin still
pointed at the chunk, but both BK and FD pointers of the chunk will point
to itself !!!
Take a look now at the unlink() macro. This macro is called when taking a
chunk off the list:
#define unlink( P, BK, FD ) {            \
                             BK = P->bk;                          \
                             FD = P->fd;                          \
                             FD->bk = BK;                         \
                             BK->fd = FD;                         \
                         }
Remember that we have now P = P->bk = P->fd. What changes when this chunk
is passed though unlink()? Nothing!
This means that ALL subsequent calls to malloc of the size our chunk will
be returning the same chunk, the one that was double-free()'d.
The rest is easy. After the chunk was double-free()'d, we make a request
to the program that will have to allocate
the double-free()'d chunk back to us, and copy the data we supply into the
memory returned to us.
Well, since the chunk is allocated, the backward and forward pointers are
not used, and user data gets straight there.
We will copy 2 addresses into the first 8 bytes of the chunk.
Now, we make another request to the program that will have to allocate to
us the same chunk. It will be passed through
the unlink() again, but this time, since the chunk is considered free, its
BK and FD pointers are used,
and lo and behold! We can overwrite any address in the memory with 4 bytes
of our choosing.

Now, how this particular exploit works:
   1. First we allocate a chunk of some size and make sure this chunk
comes from the top memory chunk.
Also make sure that this chunk stays allocated while we're
exploiting. This will keep our directory chunk
from being coalesced with the previous chunk.
   2. Allocate the Directory chunk, make sure it comes from the top memory
chunk.
   3. Allocate a chunk the same size as in step 1, for the same reason,
except that it will keep our Directory chunk
from being coalesced with the next chunk.
   4. Now that our exploitable chunk is secure, allocate a big chunk for
us to put shellcode, jumps and noops,
4K in this exploit.
   5. free() our directory chunk twice.
   6. Ask the server to malloc() a chunk of the size that was
double-free()'d, it will give us the very same
double-free()'d chunk without actually taking it off its linked list;
   7. the server will strcpy() our 2 addresses we provide into the first 8
bytes of our double-free()'d once
malloc()'ed chunk.
   8. Ask the server to again malloc() a chunk of the size that was
double-free()'d, upon which again our chunk is
malloc()'ed, passed through unlink(), overwriting memory.

/*****************************************************************************************************/
 /* Exploit for CVS double free() in dirswitch() for Linux pserver */
/* Usage instructions:
Any access to the pserver will work, anonymous is enough.
The exploit tries to bind to port 30464 on the target and exec a shell on connection,
It will connect there itself and pass control to you if it succeeds. Accidentally, \
this means that if that port is firewalled, the exploit will fail.
Here's what you need to do:
   1. Compile the proggie: gcc -o sploit this_file.c
   2. Make sure the target is running Linux, use nmap -O, it won't work unless it's a \
Linux  3. Run the proggie: ./sploit -r repository -u user [ -p password if not empty \
] target_host  4. Look for output, if the exploit doesn't work:
     a. If after readjusting in memory ( you will be told when it happens ) the \
                figures that you see
        (return codes) are 3's, and nothing else, tweak the -j parameter, the default \
                is 7, but
        I had to use 0 on a debian cvs 1.11.1, it worked in the end, you might even \
                try low negative integers
     b. If after readjusting you see not only 3's but 0's, occasionally -2's and \
                others,
        but 0's are of interest, then chances are the -j is correct, then set the -s \
                to 4,
        setting it to 4 means it will bruteforce for longer, but will try every \
address  5. If successful, clean up the mess after yourself: rm -rf /tmp/cvs*
   6. Enjoy it even if you don't break in anywhere :)

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=82014#c0)  Mark J. Cox    2003-01-16 11:34:17 UTC  ``` During an audit of the CVS sources, Stefan Esser of e-matters discovered an exploitable double-free bug in the CVS server.  On servers which are configured to allow anonymous read-only access, this bug could be used by anonymous users to gain write privileges and execute arbitrary commands on the server.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=82014#c1)  Mark J. Cox    2003-01-20 21:23:12 UTC  ``` An errata has been issued which should help the problem described in this bug report.  This report is therefore being closed with a resolution of ERRATA. For more information on the solution and/or where to find the updated files, please follow the link below. You may reopen  this bug report if the solution does not work for you.  <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2003-013.html>    ``` |  |

# Security Contacts and Procedures

Red Hat takes security very seriously, and we aim to take immediate action to
address serious security-related problems that involve our products or
services.

Please report any suspected security vulnerability in a Red Hat product or service to Red Hat Product Security at secalert@redhat.com. You can use our [GPG key](#contact) to communicate with us securely.

To report an issue in any Red Hat branded website or online service, please contact Red Hat Information Security at site-security@redhat.com.

## When to contact Red Hat Product Security

You should contact Red Hat Product Security if:

* You think there might be a security vulnerability in a Red Hat product or service.
* You want to provide feedback about our standards of service and performance. If you feel your security concern is not dealt with in a satisfactory manner, please contact secalert@redhat.com.

In all other cases, you should contact [Red Hat Customer Experience & Engagement](/site/support/).

You should contact Red Hat Customer Experience & Engagement if:

* You are unsure about how a known vulnerability affects a Red Hat product or service.
* You wish to report an issue in a language other than English.
* You require technical assistance for a security function (for example, "How do I configure my firewall?").
* You need help upgrading packages due to security alerts. (Refer to "How do I apply package updates from the Red Hat Network?" for information on upgrading packages.)
* Your issue is not security related.

In any of these cases, please contact [Red Hat Customer Experience & Engagement](/site/support/) instead.

## Who reads email sent to secalert@redhat.com?

Only members of Red Hat Product Security, a restricted
and carefully chosen group of Red Hat employees, will have access to
material sent to the secalert@redhat.com address. No outside users can subscribe to this list.

## Reporting security vulnerabilities in Red Hat Offerings

Red Hat Product Security welcomes and encourages all potential vulnerability submissions. For us to provide the best customer service and address issues in a timely manner, please provide the following information, if known:

* The version number of the affected component, such as the rpm package, container image, and java component.
* The environment and corresponding version(s) where the issue was discovered, for example, the operating system's name, version, architecture, or container platform.
* The steps to reproduce, if available.
* The ways an attacker could exploit this vulnerability on a system.
* Is the vulnerability already known to the public? If not, when is the planned date for disclosure?
* The immediate impact if an attacker exploits the vulnerability, such as a denial of service, privilege escalation, or remote code execution.

## How to contact us securely

Red Hat Product Security uses an OpenPGP key to secure our email communications. Mail sent to secalert@redhat.com can be encrypted with this public key. We expect to change the key we use from time to time. Should we change the key, the previous keys will be revoked, and the [rhsa-announce](http://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/rhsa-announce) mailing list will be notified of the change.

#### DCE3823597F5EAC4: Red Hat, Inc. (Product Security)

### Resources include the following:

[Red Hat Security Updates (Advisories)](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/security-advisories)

[Red Hat CVE Database](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/cve)

[Red Hat Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure (CVE) Program](https://access.redhat.com/articles/red_hat_cve_program)

## Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD)

Red Hat engages with partners, vendors, researchers, and community coordinators to disclose newly discovered vulnerabilities in hardware, software, and services. Multi-party coordination is a complex process, and understanding the parties' vulnerability disclosure policies, vulnerability handling policies, and contractual agreements opens the way to trusted communication and collaboration. Increasing transparency between parties assures that vendors can understand and manage the risk imposed by the vulnerability and facilitate engagements with other parties. The aim of CVD is to provide timely and consistent guidance to parties and customers to help them protect themselves.

Please see the [Red Hat CNA Vulnerability Disclosure Policy](https://access.redhat.com/articles/red_hat_cna_vulnerability_disclosure_policy) for details on how Red Hat discloses security vulnerabilities under the Red Hat/Fedora scope.

## History

The CERT Division is the birthplace of cybersecurity. For nearly 30 years, the CERT Division of the SEI has partnered with government, industry, law enforcement, and academia to advance cybersecurity and improve the security and resilience of computer systems and networks.

Originally focused on incident response, we have expanded into cybersecurity areas such as network situational awareness, malicious code analysis, secure coding, resilience management, insider threats, digital investigations and intelligence, workforce development, DevOps, forensics, software assurance, vulnerability discovery and analysis, and risk management.

## Former Director Richard Pethia

[Richard Pethia](/about/leadership/display.cfm?customel_datapageid_2623=3545) was founding director of the SEI's CERT Division. Pethia, who served as director of CERT from 1988 to 2016, guided the organization through tremendous growth and change. Under Pethia's leadership, the unit expanded and evolved from the CERT Coordination Center—a small group focused on computer incident response—to a research organization of more than 200 professionals dedicated to solving problems with widespread cybersecurity implications.

## Concurrent Versions System (CVS) server improperly deallocates memory

#### Vulnerability Note VU#650937

Original Release Date: 2003-01-21 | Last Revised: 2003-08-20

---

### Overview

A "double-free" vulnerability in the Concurrent Versions System (CVS) server could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or commands or cause a denial of service on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| CVS is a source code maintenance system that is widely used by open-source software development projects.  The CVS server component contains a "double-free" vulnerability that can be triggered by a set of specially crafted directory change requests. While processing these requests, an error checking routine may attempt to free() the same memory reference more than once. Deallocating the already freed memory can lead to heap corruption, which may be leveraged by an attacker to execute arbitrary code. The CVS server process is commonly started by the Internet services daemon (inetd) and run with root privileges.CVS clients are not affected. |

### Impact

| Depending on configuration, operating system, and platform architecture, a remote attacker with anonymous read-only access to a vulnerable CVS server could execute arbitrary code, read sensitive information, or cause a denial of service. There is a significant secondary impact in that source code maintained in CVS repositories could be modified to include trojan horses, backdoors, or other malicious code. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Patch or Upgrade**Apply the appropriate patch or upgrade as specified by your vendor. This vulnerability is resolved in CVS 1.11.5. |
| --- |

| **Disable CVS Server**Until patches are available and can be applied, consider disabling the CVS server.**Disable Anonymous CVS Access**Disable anonymous access to the CVS server.**Block or Restrict Access**Block or restrict access to the CVS server from untrusted hosts and networks. The CVS server typically listens on 2401/tcp, but may use another port or protocol.**Limit CVS Server Privileges**     + Configure CVS server to run in a restricted (chroot) environment. + Run CVS servers with the minimum set of privileges required on the host file system. + Provide separate systems for development (write) and public/anonymous (read-only) CVS access. + Host public/anonymous CVS servers on single-purpose, secured systems.  Note that none of these workarounds will prevent exploitation of this vulnerability. These workarounds will only limit the scope and impact of possible attacks. Other features inherent in CVS may give anonymous users the ability to gain shell access. |

### [Apple Computer Inc.](#AAMN-5HZKWQ) Affected

Notified:  January 21, 2003  Updated: August 20, 2003

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

Apple: Not Vulnerable. The underlying code in Mac OS X is not susceptible to the vulnerability described in this notice.

### Vendor Information

The vendor has not provided us with any further information regarding this vulnerability.

### Addendum

Based on source code analysis, cvs-29 from the [Darwin Projects Directory](http://www.opensource.apple.com/projects/darwin/6.0/projects.html) appears to be vulnerable. However, the Apple OS X [malloc(3)](http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/html/malloc.3.html#sect3) implementation (phkmalloc) may safely handle the double-free condition. If malloc(3) is configured such that all warnings are fatal ("A" option), the impact of this vulnerability on Darwin cvs-29 may be limited to a denial of service.

Darwin cvs-29 may not be the same cvs code that is shipped with the Apple OS X Developer Tools package.

### [Openwall GNU/\*/Linux](#AAMN-5HZKY4) Not Affected

Notified:  January 21, 2003  Updated: February 04, 2003

### Status

Not Affected

### Vendor Statement

We don't yet re-distribute CVS in Openwall GNU/\*/Linux.

We do, however, provide public anonymous CVS access to a copy of our repository, hosted off a separate machine and in a chroot jail. This kind of vulnerabilities in CVS was expected, and our anoncvs setup is mostly resistant to them: read-only access to the repository is achieved primarily with the use of regular Unix permissions, not controls built into CVS. CVS LockDir option is used to direct CVS lock files to a separate directory tree, actually writable to the pseudo-user. Nevertheless, the anoncvs server has been upgraded to CVS 1.11.5 a few hours after it was released.
