Based on the provided advisory, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- A stack buffer overflow exists in the `rlm_smb` module of FreeRADIUS. This occurs in the `SMB_Logon_Server` function within the `smblib.c` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The `strcpy` function is used to copy the `PassWord` into a fixed-size buffer `pword[128]`. If the `PassWord` attribute exceeds 128 bytes, a stack buffer overflow occurs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit can lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the FreeRADIUS server (typically root), allowing the attacker to gain complete control of the system.
- The advisory mentions that if the exploit fails, the radius server will be killed.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted RADIUS Access-Request packet with a `User-Password` attribute exceeding 128 bytes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send RADIUS packets to the FreeRADIUS server.
- The attacker must know the shared secret used by the NAS (Network Access Server) communicating with the FreeRADIUS server.
- The NAS must not restrict the length of the `User-Password` attribute.

**Additional Information:**
- The `rlm_smb` module is not enabled by default and requires manual configuration and recompilation with the `--with-experimental-modules` option.
- The code in the `rlm_smb` module was taken from `pam_smb` and is considered experimental and untested, making it prone to vulnerabilities.
- The advisory includes a Proof of Concept (PoC) exploit.
