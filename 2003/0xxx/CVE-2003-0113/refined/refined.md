Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2003-0113:

**Root Cause:**
- A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in `URLMON.DLL`, a library used by Microsoft Internet Explorer for handling URLs and web server communication. This overflow occurs because Internet Explorer fails to properly check the parameters of data received from a web server, specifically in the HTTP header fields.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The core issue is a stack-based buffer overflow in `URLMON.DLL`. When processing HTTP responses, the library doesn't sufficiently validate the length of certain header fields, allowing an attacker to send an oversized value that overwrites adjacent memory on the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By overflowing the buffer, an attacker can overwrite the return address on the stack, redirecting program execution to attacker-controlled code. This allows for arbitrary code execution within the security context of the user running Internet Explorer or the email client.
- **Complete System Compromise:** An attacker could potentially gain complete control of the user's system.
- **Information Disclosure:** While the primary vulnerability is arbitrary code execution, the attacker could use this access to exfiltrate data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Web Page:** An attacker can host a website with a specially crafted HTTP response containing oversized header fields. When a victim visits this site with Internet Explorer, the overflow occurs.
- **Malicious HTML Email:**  A specially crafted HTML email message can trigger the vulnerability when the email is viewed or previewed. The email doesn't need attachments or scripts to trigger the attack, it can be carried out via standard HTML.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Host a Malicious Web Server:** The attacker needs a server to host the malicious web page and deliver the exploit via the HTTP response.
- **Ability to Send Malicious Email:** The attacker needs to send a specially crafted HTML email message to the victim.
- **No User Interaction Needed (in some cases):** The vulnerability can be exploited without user interaction beyond visiting a web page or opening/previewing an email (depending on configuration where the email program might open the first new message automatically).

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is a traditional stack-based buffer overflow and relatively easy to exploit.
- The vulnerability is triggered due to missing or insufficient input validation when processing HTTP header fields.
- The vulnerability is present in Internet Explorer 5.01, 5.5 and 6.0.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Critical" by Microsoft.
- The bulletin MS03-015 incorrectly states that the vulnerability is not exploitable by e-mail borne attacks. This has been corrected in later revisions.
