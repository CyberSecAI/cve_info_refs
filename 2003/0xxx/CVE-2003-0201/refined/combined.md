## Samba contains multiple buffer overflows

#### Vulnerability Note VU#267873

Original Release Date: 2003-04-10 | Last Revised: 2003-07-10

---

### Overview

Samba contains several buffer overflow vulnerabilitites. At least one of these vulnerabilities could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service.

### Description

| Samba is a widely used open-source implementation of Server Message Block (SMB)/Common Internet File System (CIFS). Samba-TNG is a forked development branch of Samba. SMB/CIFS is used in Microsoft Windows to provide file and print services. Samba versions prior to 2.2.8a and Samba-TNG versions prior to 0.3.2 contain several buffer overflow vulnerabilities.  A stack overflow in the function trans2open() (in trans2.c) has been assigned [CAN-2003-0201](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0201). An exploit for this vulnerability has been publicly released.After the trans2open() issue was reported, the Samba Team discovered and fixed several other buffer overflow vulnerabilities (in statcache.c, reply.c, and password.c). These vulnerabilities have been assigned [CAN-2003-0196](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0196).These vulnerabilities are different than the packet fragment re-assembly problem discussed in [VU#298233](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/298233) ([CAN-2003-0085](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0085)). |
| --- |

### Impact

| An unauthenticated, remote attacker could execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service. The Samba daemon (smbd) runs with root privileges, so an attacker could gain complete control of a vulnerable system. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Patch or Upgrade**Upgrade or apply a patch as specified by your vendor.Upgrade or patch to Samba 2.2.8a or Samba-TNG 0.3.2. |
| --- |

| **Block or Restrict Access**Block or restrict access to Samba services from untrusted networks such as the Internet. The Samba Team [announcement](http://lists.samba.org/pipermail/samba-announce/2003-March/000063.html) for version 2.2.8 contains excellent recommendations for restricting access to Samba servers:\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*Protecting an unpatched Samba server\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*Samba Team, March 2003This is a note on how to provide your Samba server some protection against the recently discovered remote security hole if you are unable to upgrade to the fixed version immediately. Even if you do upgrade you might like to think about the suggestions in this note to provide you with additional levels of protection.Using host based protection---------------------------In many installations of Samba the greatest threat comes for outside your immediate network. By default Samba will accept connections from any host, which means that if you run an insecure version of Samba on a host that is directly connected to the Internet you can be especially vulnerable.One of the simplest fixes in this case is to use the 'hosts allow' and 'hosts deny' options in the Samba smb.conf configuration file to only allow access to your server from a specific range of hosts. An example might be:   hosts allow = 127.0.0.1 192.168.2.0/24 192.168.3.0/24hosts deny = 0.0.0.0/0 The above will only allow SMB connections from 'localhost' (your own computer) and from the two private networks 192.168.2 and 192.168.3. All other connections will be refused connections as soon as the client sends its first packet. The refusal will be marked as a 'not listening on called name' error.Using interface protection--------------------------By default Samba will accept connections on any network interface that it finds on your system. That means if you have a ISDN line or a PPP connection to the Internet then Samba will accept connections on those links. This may not be what you want.You can change this behavior using options like the following:  interfaces = eth\* lobind interfaces only = yes that tells Samba to only listen for connections on interfaces with a name starting with 'eth' such as eth0, eth1, plus on the loopback interface called 'lo'. The name you will need to use depends on what OS you are using. In the above I used the common name for ethernet adapters on Linux.If you use the above and someone tries to make a SMB connection to your host over a PPP interface called 'ppp0', they will get a TCP connection refused reply. In that case no Samba code is run at all as the operating system has been told not to pass connections from that interface to any process.Using a firewall----------------Many people use a firewall to deny access to services that they don't want exposed outside their network. This can be a very good idea, although I would recommend using it in conjunction with the above methods so that you are protected even if your firewall is not active for some reason.If you are setting up a firewall then you need to know what TCP and UDP ports to allow and block. Samba uses the following:  UDP/137    - used by nmbdUDP/138    - used by nmbdTCP/139    - used by smbdTCP/445    - used by smbd The last one is important as many older firewall setups may not be aware of it, given that this port was only added to the protocol in recent years.Using a IPC$ share deny-----------------------If the above methods are not suitable, then you could also place a more specific deny on the IPC$ share that is used in the recently discovered security hole. This allows you to offer access to other shares while denying access to IPC$ from potentially untrustworthy hosts.To do that you could use:  [ipc$]  hosts allow = 192.168.115.0/24 127.0.0.1hosts deny = 0.0.0.0/0 this would tell Samba that IPC$ connections are not allowed from anywhere but the two listed places (localhost and a local subnet). Connections to other shares would still be allowed. As the IPC$ share is the only share that is always accessible anonymously this provides some level of protection against attackers that do not know a username/password for your host.If you use this method then clients will be given a 'access denied' reply when they try to access the IPC$ share. That means that those clients will not be able to browse shares, and may also be unable to access some other resources.I don't recommend this method unless you cannot use one of the other methods listed above for some reason.Upgrading Samba---------------Of course the best solution is to upgrade Samba to a version where the bug has been fixed. If you wish to also use one of the additional measures above then that would certainly be a good idea.Please check regularly on <http://www.samba.org/> for updates and important announcements. |

 Digital Defense Inc. Security Advisory DDI-1013        labs@digitaldefense.net
 <http://www.digitaldefense.net/>
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

Synopsis          : Buffer Overflow in Samba allows remote root compromise
Package           : Samba, Samba-TNG
Type              : Remote Root Compromise
Issue date        : 04-07-2003
Versions Affected : < Samba 2.2.8a, <= Samba 2.0.10,  < Samba-TNG 0.3.2
Not Affected      : Samba 3.0 Alpha Versions, CVS Versions of Samba-TNG
CVE Id            : CAN-2003-0201

|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

o Product description:
   Samba is an Open Source/Free Software suite that provides seamless file and
   print services to SMB/CIFS clients. Samba-TNG was originally a fork off of
   the Samba source tree, and aims at being a substitute for a Windows NT domain
   controller.

o Problem description:
   An anonymous user can gain remote root access due to a buffer overflow caused
   by a StrnCpy() into a char array (fname) using a non-constant length
   (namelen).

   StrnCpy(fname,pname,namelen);    /* Line 252 of smbd/trans2.c */

   In the call_trans2open function in trans2.c, the Samba StrnCpy function
   copies pname into fname using namelen. The variable namelen is assigned the
   value of strlen(pname)+1, which causes the overflow.

   The variable 'fname' is a _typedef_ pstring, which is a char with a size of
   1024. If pname is greater than 1024, you can overwrite almost anything you
   want past the 1024th byte that fits inside of sizeof(pname), or the value
   returned by SVAL(inbuf,smbd_tpscnt) in function reply_trans2(), which should
   be around 2000 bytes.

   The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name
   CAN-2003-0201 to this issue. This is a candidate for inclusion in the CVE
   list (<http://cve.mitre.org>), which standardizes names for security problems.

o Testing Environment:
   Tested against source compiles and binary packages of Samba from version
   2.2.5 to 2.2.8 on the following x86 platforms:

   Redhat Linux 7.1, 7.3, 8.0
   Gentoo Linux 1.4-rc3
   SuSe Linux 7.3
   FreeBSD 4.6, 4.8, 5.0
   Solaris 9

o Solutions and Workarounds:
   Upgrading to the latest version of Samba or Samba-TNG is the recommended
   solution to this vulnerability. Samba version 2.2.8a, and Samba-TNG version
   0.3.2 are not vulnerable. There will be no new releases for the 2.0 line of
   Samba code. The only fix for Samba 2.0 is to apply the patches that Samba is
   providing.

   A workaround in the current source code for this specific vulnerability
   would be to modify the StrnCpy line found at line 250 in smbd/trans2.c in the
   Samba 2.2.8 source code:

   -StrnCpy(fname,pname,namelen);
   +StrnCpy(fname,pname,MIN(namelen, sizeof(fname)-1));

   As a result of this vulnerability being identified at least three others
   have also been found by the Samba team after reviewing similar usages in the
   source tree. One is a static overflow and the other two are heap overflows.
   Applying the fix above will only protect against the specific problem
   identified in this advisory. To fully protect yourself, you must apply the
   patches from Samba, or upgrade to 2.2.8a.

   Samba is available for download from: <http://www.samba.org/>
   Samba-TNG is available for download from: <http://www.samba-tng.org/>

o Exploit:
   An exploit named trans2root.pl has been posted on the Digital Defense, Inc.
   website. A quick udp based based scanner named nmbping.pl has also been
   posted to assist you in identifying Samba servers on your network. Both are
   available for download from the following URL:

   <http://www.digitaldefense.net/labs/securitytools.html>

   This exploit works against all distributions listed in the testing
   environment section. Usage is as follows:

   trans2root.pl <options> -t <target type> -H <your ip> -h <target ip>

   This exploit should work against all x86 Linux, Solaris, and  FreeBSD hosts
   running the 2.2.x branch of Samba. Hosts with a non-executable stack are not
   vulnerable to this particular exploit. The exploit will cause the target host
   to connect back to the host running the exploit and spawn a root shell on the
   defined port (default is 1981).

   The scanner is very easy to use, and should detect and identify Samba and
   Windows SMB services. Usage is as follows:

   nmbping.pl <network/cidr>

o Forced Release:
   This vulnerability is being actively exploited in the wild. Digital Defense,
   Inc. discovered this bug by analyzing a packet capture of an attack against a
   host running Samba 2.2.8. The attack captured was performed on April 1st,
   2003. Samba users are urged to check their Samba servers for signs of
   compromise. Samba and Digital Defense, Inc. decided to release their
   advisories before all vendors had a chance to update their packages due to
   this vulnerability being actively exploited.

o Revision History:
   04-07-2003     Initial public release

   Latest revision available at:
   <http://www.digitaldefense.net/labs/advisories.html>

o Vendor Contact Information:
   04-03-2003     security@samba.org notified
   04-03-2003     elrond@samba-tng.org notified.
   04-03-2003     Samba Team responds via telephone, acknowledges vulnerability
   04-03-2003     Elrond of Samba-TNG responds and acknowledges vulnerability
   04-04-2003     Samba Team notifies vendorsec mailing list
   04-07-2003     Initial public release

o Thanks to:
   Elrond of Samba-TNG, The Samba Security Team, and everyone on the
   Digital Defense Inc., SECOPS team.

	Immunix Secured OS Security Advisory

Packages updated:	samba
Affected products:	ImmunixOS 7.0, 7+
Bugs fixed:		CAN-2003-0201
Date:			Mon Apr  7 2003
Advisory ID:		IMNX-2003-7+-006-01
Author:			Seth Arnold <sarnold@wirex.com>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Description:
  Digital Defense found an actively-exploited samba static-buffer
  overflow on a honeypot system. They figured out the vulnerable section
  of code and alerted the Samba team, who found some additional bugs
  while fixing this bug.

  In samba version 2.0.10, this buffer is located on the heap, so
  StackGuard does not provide protection for this buffer overflow.
  There are actively-used samba 2.2 exploits that allow remote anonymous
  users to gain local root privileges. The samba 2.2 exploit analyzed by
  Digital Defense used a statically allocated buffer. While we do not
  know of any exploits against the 2.0.10 version, it may be possible
  to re-write the exploit in use to attack the heap-based buffer in
  samba 2.0.10. We recommend upgrading.

  Please note this is different from (and includes the fixes from)
  IMNX-2003-7+-003-01, which addressed different samba security flaws.
