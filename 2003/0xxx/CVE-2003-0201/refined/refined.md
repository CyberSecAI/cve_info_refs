{
  "CVE-2003-0201": {
    "description": "Samba contains a stack buffer overflow vulnerability in the trans2open() function within trans2.c. This vulnerability can be triggered by an unauthenticated remote attacker.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a `StrnCpy` function in `trans2open()` that copies data from `pname` to `fname` using the length from `namelen`. The length `namelen` is calculated as `strlen(pname)+1`, which doesn't account for the size of the destination buffer `fname`. This can lead to a buffer overflow if `pname` is larger than `fname`",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Stack buffer overflow in `trans2open()`"
    ],
    "impact": "An unauthenticated, remote attacker can execute arbitrary code with root privileges or cause a denial of service by overflowing the buffer.",
    "attack_vector": "A remote attacker can send a specially crafted SMB/CIFS request to a vulnerable Samba server exploiting the `trans2open()` function.",
     "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires network access to the Samba server and does not need authentication."
