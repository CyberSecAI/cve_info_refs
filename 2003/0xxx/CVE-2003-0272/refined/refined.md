- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of authentication in the `admin/admin.php` script. The script uses a cookie (`miniPortailAdmin`) to determine if a user is logged in as an administrator. However, it also checks if the user has supplied the correct password by comparing a submitted password against a hardcoded hash. The primary issue is that the script checks for the cookie using `$HTTP_COOKIE_VARS[$portalname] == $cookiedata`, which allows an attacker to bypass authentication by simply setting the cookie with the correct value (`adminok`).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - **Cookie-based authentication bypass:** The reliance on a client-side cookie for authentication without proper server-side checks makes it easy to forge administrator access.
    - **Lack of session management:** The application does not use secure session management techniques, relying solely on cookies.
    - **Hardcoded password hash**: While not the primary issue in this exploit, the use of a hardcoded password hash makes the system more brittle.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can gain administrative access to the miniPortail application by simply setting a cookie named `miniPortailAdmin` with the value `adminok`. This could allow the attacker to perform any action within the admin panel.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP request setting the required cookie.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected web server. No special privileges are required.
