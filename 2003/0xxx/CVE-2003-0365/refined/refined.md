- **Root cause of vulnerability:** During installation, ICQLite silently adds an Access Control Entry (ACE) granting "Full Control" to the "Interactive Users" group for the "Program Files\ICQ Lite" directory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure file permissions, specifically, granting "Full Control" to interactive users on the installation directory allows modification of executable files.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can replace any executable file within the ICQ Lite directory. When a user launches ICQ Lite, the attacker's modified executable runs with the user's privileges, potentially leading to privilege escalation or arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by any user with interactive access to the system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have the ability to write to the ICQLite installation directory and have the privileges to overwrite/modify files within this directory.
