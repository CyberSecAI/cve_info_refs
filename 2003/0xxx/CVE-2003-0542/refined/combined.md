## Apache mod\_alias vulnerable to buffer overflow via crafted regular expression

#### Vulnerability Note VU#549142

Original Release Date: 2004-02-03 | Last Revised: 2004-03-19

---

### Overview

A vulnerability in a supplementary module to the Apache HTTP server could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected web server under certain circumstances.

### Description

| The [Apache HTTP server](http://httpd.apache.org/) distribution includes a number of supplemental [modules](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/) that provide additional functionality to the web server. One of these modules, [mod\_alias](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_alias.html), provides for mapping different parts of the host filesystem into the document tree and for URL redirection. Several of the mod\_alias directives can use regular expressions rather than simple prefix matches. A buffer overflow has been discovered in the way that mod\_alias handles regular expressions containing more than 9 captures (stored strings matching a particular pattern). This flaw results in a remotely exploitable vulnerability on web servers that specify such a regular expression to the mod\_alias module in their configuration files. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code in the context of the web server user (e.g., "apache", "httpd", "nobody", etc.). The attacker would have to have the ability to supply a specially crafted configuration file (e.g., .htaccess or httpd.conf) to the Apache server in order to mount this attack. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply a patch from the vendor**  Patches have been released to address this vulnerability. Please see the Systems Affected section of this document for more details. |
| --- |

| **Workarounds**  Disable mod\_alias if it is not required in your web server configuration. Instructions for doing this can be found in the [Apache HTTP Server documentation](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/). Sites, particularly those that are not able to apply the patches, are encouraged to consider implementing this workaround. |

CONECTIVA LINUX SECURITY ANNOUNCEMENT

PACKAGE   : apache
SUMMARY   : Fix for some vulnerabilities
DATE      : 2003-11-05 19:18:00
ID        : CLA-2003:775
RELEVANT
RELEASES  : 7.0, 8, 9

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

DESCRIPTION
 Apache[1] is the most popular webserver in use today.

 New versions of the Apache web server have been made available[2][3]
 with the following security fixes:

 1. Buffer overflow in mod\_alias and mod\_rewrite (CAN-2003-0542) [4]
 A buffer overflow could occur in mod\_alias and mod\_rewrite when a
 regular expression with more than 9 captures is configured. Users who
 can create or modify configuration files (httpd.conf or .htaccess,
 for example) could trigger this. This vulnerability affects Apache
 1.3.x and Apache 2.0.x.

 2. mod\_cgid mishandling of CGI redirect paths (CAN-2003-0789) [5]
 mod\_cgid mishandling of CGI redirect paths could result in CGI output
 going to the wrong client when a threaded MPM is used. The packages
 provided with Conectiva Linux 9 are not vulnerable to this issue
 because  they are not compiled with that MPM, but the fix has been
 included because new packages for Conectiva Linux 9 were already
 being built for the suexec problem (see below).

 In addition to the above security fixes, "suexec" has been correctly
 built in the Conectiva Linux 9 packages, fixing[6] the problem where
 CGI scripts could not be run from the user's home directory.

SOLUTION
 It is recommended that all Apache users upgrade their packages.

 IMPORTANT: it is necessary to manually restart the httpd server after
 upgrading the packages. In order to do this, execute the following as
 root:

 service httpd stop

 (wait a few seconds and check with "pidof httpd" if there are any
 httpd processes running. On a busy webserver this could take a little
 longer)

 service httpd start

CHANGE SUMMARY:  Rev. 01 Corrected typo in version number
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
\*\*REVISED  01\*\*
A. Background
   The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
   <<http://cve.mitre.org/>> has identified potential
   vulnerabilities in the Apache HTTP Server (CAN-2003-0789, and
   CAN-2003-0542).  It affects the following HP product
   numbers/versions on HP-UX releases B.11.00, B.11.11, B.11.20,
   B.11.22, and B.11.23:

   - hp apache-based web server, 2.0.43.04 or earlier
     (HPApache/B9416AA)

   - hp-ux apache-based web server, v.1.0.09.01 or earlier
     (hpuxwsAPACHE/hpuxwsApache)

   - hp apache-based web server, 2.0.43.04 (with IPv6 support)
     or earlier (HPApache/B9416BA)

   - hp-ux apache-based web server (with IPv6 support),
     v.1.0.09.01 or earlier (hpuxwsAPACHE/hpuxwsApache)

   AFFECTED VERSIONS

   The following is a list of affected filesets or patches
   and fix information. To determine if a system has an
   affected version, search the output of
   "swlist -a revision -l fileset" for an affected fileset
   or patch, then determine if a fixed revision or applicable
   patch is installed.

         HP-UX B.11.00
         HP-UX B.11.11
         HP-UX B.11.20
         HP-UX B.11.22
         HP-UX B.11.23
         ====================================
         HPApache.APACHE2
         hpuxwsAPACHE.APACHE2
 --->>   fix: install hp-ux apache-based web server, v.1.0.10.01
              or later.

   END AFFECTED VERSIONS

B. Recommended solution
   The Apache Software Foundation has released Apache 2.0.48 as
   the best known version that fixes the problems identified in
   the above mentioned issues.

   For customers using HPApache/B9416AA HPApache/B9416BA and
   hpuxwsAPACHE/hpuxwsApache, HP has incorporated Apache 2.0.48
   in the following product:
   - hp-ux apache-based web server v.1.0.10.01 or later
      <http://www.software.hp.com/cgi-bin/swdepot_parser.cgi/cgi/>
             displayProductInfo.pl?productNumber=HPUXWSSUITE

   Check for Apache Installation
   -----------------------------
   To determine if the Apache web server from HP is installed on
   your system, use Software Distributor's swlist command.  All
   three versions products may co-exist on a single system.

   For example, the results of the command
     swlist -l product | grep -i apache

     HPApache      2.0.39.01.02  HP Apache-based Web Server
     hpuxwsAPACHE  A.1.0.09.01   HP-UX Apache-based Web Server

   Stop Apache
   -----------------------------
   Before updating, make sure to stop any previous Apache binary.
   Otherwise, the previous binary will continue running,
   preventing the new one from starting, although the installation
   would be successful.

   After determining which Apache is installed, stop Apache with
   the following commands:

     for HPApache:        /opt/hpapache2/bin/apachectl stop
     for hpuxwsAPACHE:    /opt/hpws/apache/bin/apachectl stop

   Download and Install Apache
   -----------------------------
   - Download Apache from Software Depot using the previously
     mentioned links.
   - Verify successful download by comparing the cksum with the
     value specified on the installation web page.
   - Use SD to swinstall the depot.
   - For customers with HPApache/B9416BA installed, migrate to
     hpuxwsAPACHE/hpuxwsApache and remove the affected products
     from the system.

   Installation of this new version of HP Apache over an existing
   HP Apache installation is supported, while installation over a
   non-HP Apache is NOT supported.

   Removing Apache Installation
   ----------------------------
   If you rather remove Apache from your system than install a
   newer version to resolve the security problem, use both
   Software Distributor's "swremove" command and also "rm -rf" the
   home location as specified in the rc.config.d file "HOME"
   variables.

   To find the files containing HOME variables in the
   /etc/rc.config.d directory:

     %ls /etc/rc.config.d | grep apache
        hpapache2conf
        hpws\_apacheconf

[slackware-security]  apache security update (SSA:2003-308-01)

Apache httpd is a hypertext transfer protocol server, and is used
by over two thirds of the Internet's web sites.

Upgraded Apache packages are available for Slackware 8.1, 9.0, 9.1,
and -current.  These fix local vulnerabilities that could allow users
who can create or edit Apache config files to gain additional
privileges.  Sites running Apache should upgrade to the new packages.

In addition, new mod\_ssl packages have been prepared for all platforms,
and new PHP packages have been prepared for Slackware 8.1, 9.0, and
- -current (9.1 already uses PHP 4.3.3).  In -current, these packages
also move the Apache module directory from /usr/libexec to
/usr/libexec/apache.  Links for all of these related packages are
provided below.

More details about the Apache issue may be found in the Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database:

  <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0542>

Here are the details from the Slackware 9.1 ChangeLog:
+--------------------------+
Mon Nov  3 20:06:29 PST 2003
patches/packages/apache-1.3.29-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to apache-1.3.29.
  This fixes the following local security issue:
    o CAN-2003-0542 (cve.mitre.org)
      Fix buffer overflows in mod\_alias and mod\_rewrite which occurred if
      one configured a regular expression with more than 9 captures.
  This vulnerability requires the attacker to create or modify certain
  Apache configuration files, and is not a remote hole.  However, it could
  possibly be used to gain additional privileges if access to the Apache
  administrator account can be gained through some other means.  All sites
  running Apache should upgrade.
  (\* Security fix \*)

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Apache mod\_rewrite vulnerable to buffer overflow via crafted regular expression

#### Vulnerability Note VU#434566

Original Release Date: 2004-02-03 | Last Revised: 2004-03-19

---

### Overview

A vulnerability in a supplementary module to the Apache HTTP server could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected web server under certain circumstances.

### Description

| The [Apache HTTP server](http://httpd.apache.org/) distribution includes a number of supplemental [modules](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/) that provide additional functionality to the web server. One of these modules, [mod\_rewrite](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_rewrite.html), provides a rule-based rewriting engine to rewrite requested URLs "on the fly" based regular expressions. A buffer overflow has been discovered in the way that mod\_rewrite handles regular expressions containing more than 9 captures (stored strings matching a particular pattern). This flaw results in a remotely exploitable vulnerability on web servers that specify such a regular expression to the mod\_rewrite module in their configuration files. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code in the context of the web server user (e.g., "apache", "httpd", "nobody", etc.). The attacker would have to have the ability to supply a specially crafted configuration file (e.g., .htaccess or httpd.conf) to the Apache server in order to mount this attack. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply a patch from the vendor**  Patches have been released to address this vulnerability. Please see the Systems Affected section of this document for more details. |
| --- |

| **Workarounds**  Disable mod\_rewrite if it is not required in your web server configuration. Instructions for doing this can be found in the [Apache HTTP server documentation](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/). Sites, particularly those that are not able to apply the patches, are encouraged to consider implementing this workaround. |

Updated:  February 02, 2004

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

We have not received a statement from the vendor.

### Vendor Information

The vendor has not provided us with any further information regarding this vulnerability.

### Addendum

The [Apache Software Foundation](http://www.apache.org/) has released versions 1.3.29 and 2.0.48 of the Apache httpd server in response to this issue. These patched versions of the software are available at:

CONECTIVA LINUX SECURITY ANNOUNCEMENT
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

PACKAGE   : apache
SUMMARY   : Fix for some vulnerabilities
DATE      : 2003-11-05 19:18:00
ID        : CLA-2003:775
RELEVANT
RELEASES  : 7.0, 8, 9

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

DESCRIPTION
 Apache[1] is the most popular webserver in use today.

 New versions of the Apache web server have been made available[2][3]
 with the following security fixes:

 1. Buffer overflow in mod\_alias and mod\_rewrite (CAN-2003-0542) [4]
 A buffer overflow could occur in mod\_alias and mod\_rewrite when a
 regular expression with more than 9 captures is configured. Users who
 can create or modify configuration files (httpd.conf or .htaccess,
 for example) could trigger this. This vulnerability affects Apache
 1.3.x and Apache 2.0.x.

 2. mod\_cgid mishandling of CGI redirect paths (CAN-2003-0789) [5]
 mod\_cgid mishandling of CGI redirect paths could result in CGI output
 going to the wrong client when a threaded MPM is used. The packages
 provided with Conectiva Linux 9 are not vulnerable to this issue
 because  they are not compiled with that MPM, but the fix has been
 included because new packages for Conectiva Linux 9 were already
 being built for the suexec problem (see below).

 In addition to the above security fixes, "suexec" has been correctly
 built in the Conectiva Linux 9 packages, fixing[6] the problem where
 CGI scripts could not be run from the user's home directory.

SOLUTION
 It is recommended that all Apache users upgrade their packages.

 IMPORTANT: it is necessary to manually restart the httpd server after
 upgrading the packages. In order to do this, execute the following as
 root:

 service httpd stop

 (wait a few seconds and check with "pidof httpd" if there are any
 httpd processes running. On a busy webserver this could take a little
 longer)

 service httpd start

CHANGE SUMMARY:  Rev. 01 Corrected typo in version number
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
\*\*REVISED  01\*\*
A. Background
   The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
   <<http://cve.mitre.org/>> has identified potential
   vulnerabilities in the Apache HTTP Server (CAN-2003-0789, and
   CAN-2003-0542).  It affects the following HP product
   numbers/versions on HP-UX releases B.11.00, B.11.11, B.11.20,
   B.11.22, and B.11.23:

   - hp apache-based web server, 2.0.43.04 or earlier
     (HPApache/B9416AA)

   - hp-ux apache-based web server, v.1.0.09.01 or earlier
     (hpuxwsAPACHE/hpuxwsApache)

   - hp apache-based web server, 2.0.43.04 (with IPv6 support)
     or earlier (HPApache/B9416BA)

   - hp-ux apache-based web server (with IPv6 support),
     v.1.0.09.01 or earlier (hpuxwsAPACHE/hpuxwsApache)

   AFFECTED VERSIONS

   The following is a list of affected filesets or patches
   and fix information. To determine if a system has an
   affected version, search the output of
   "swlist -a revision -l fileset" for an affected fileset
   or patch, then determine if a fixed revision or applicable
   patch is installed.

         HP-UX B.11.00
         HP-UX B.11.11
         HP-UX B.11.20
         HP-UX B.11.22
         HP-UX B.11.23
         ====================================
         HPApache.APACHE2
         hpuxwsAPACHE.APACHE2
 --->>   fix: install hp-ux apache-based web server, v.1.0.10.01
              or later.

   END AFFECTED VERSIONS

B. Recommended solution
   The Apache Software Foundation has released Apache 2.0.48 as
   the best known version that fixes the problems identified in
   the above mentioned issues.

   For customers using HPApache/B9416AA HPApache/B9416BA and
   hpuxwsAPACHE/hpuxwsApache, HP has incorporated Apache 2.0.48
   in the following product:
   - hp-ux apache-based web server v.1.0.10.01 or later
      <http://www.software.hp.com/cgi-bin/swdepot_parser.cgi/cgi/>
             displayProductInfo.pl?productNumber=HPUXWSSUITE

   Check for Apache Installation
   -----------------------------
   To determine if the Apache web server from HP is installed on
   your system, use Software Distributor's swlist command.  All
   three versions products may co-exist on a single system.

   For example, the results of the command
     swlist -l product | grep -i apache

     HPApache      2.0.39.01.02  HP Apache-based Web Server
     hpuxwsAPACHE  A.1.0.09.01   HP-UX Apache-based Web Server

   Stop Apache
   -----------------------------
   Before updating, make sure to stop any previous Apache binary.
   Otherwise, the previous binary will continue running,
   preventing the new one from starting, although the installation
   would be successful.

   After determining which Apache is installed, stop Apache with
   the following commands:

     for HPApache:        /opt/hpapache2/bin/apachectl stop
     for hpuxwsAPACHE:    /opt/hpws/apache/bin/apachectl stop

   Download and Install Apache
   -----------------------------
   - Download Apache from Software Depot using the previously
     mentioned links.
   - Verify successful download by comparing the cksum with the
     value specified on the installation web page.
   - Use SD to swinstall the depot.
   - For customers with HPApache/B9416BA installed, migrate to
     hpuxwsAPACHE/hpuxwsApache and remove the affected products
     from the system.

   Installation of this new version of HP Apache over an existing
   HP Apache installation is supported, while installation over a
   non-HP Apache is NOT supported.

   Removing Apache Installation
   ----------------------------
   If you rather remove Apache from your system than install a
   newer version to resolve the security problem, use both
   Software Distributor's "swremove" command and also "rm -rf" the
   home location as specified in the rc.config.d file "HOME"
   variables.

   To find the files containing HOME variables in the
   /etc/rc.config.d directory:

     %ls /etc/rc.config.d | grep apache
        hpapache2conf
        hpws\_apacheconf

[slackware-security]  apache security update (SSA:2003-308-01)

Apache httpd is a hypertext transfer protocol server, and is used
by over two thirds of the Internet's web sites.

Upgraded Apache packages are available for Slackware 8.1, 9.0, 9.1,
and -current.  These fix local vulnerabilities that could allow users
who can create or edit Apache config files to gain additional
privileges.  Sites running Apache should upgrade to the new packages.

In addition, new mod\_ssl packages have been prepared for all platforms,
and new PHP packages have been prepared for Slackware 8.1, 9.0, and
- -current (9.1 already uses PHP 4.3.3).  In -current, these packages
also move the Apache module directory from /usr/libexec to
/usr/libexec/apache.  Links for all of these related packages are
provided below.

More details about the Apache issue may be found in the Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database:

  <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0542>

Here are the details from the Slackware 9.1 ChangeLog:
+--------------------------+
Mon Nov  3 20:06:29 PST 2003
patches/packages/apache-1.3.29-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to apache-1.3.29.
  This fixes the following local security issue:
    o CAN-2003-0542 (cve.mitre.org)
      Fix buffer overflows in mod\_alias and mod\_rewrite which occurred if
      one configured a regular expression with more than 9 captures.
  This vulnerability requires the attacker to create or modify certain
  Apache configuration files, and is not a remote hole.  However, it could
  possibly be used to gain additional privileges if access to the Apache
  administrator account can be gained through some other means.  All sites
  running Apache should upgrade.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
