Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2003-0547:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from how GDM (GNOME Display Manager) handles the `~/.xsession-errors` file.  GDM's error browser could be exploited to read arbitrary files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Handling of `~/.xsession-errors`:** GDM allows a user to create a symlink from their `~/.xsession-errors` file to any other file on the system that the user has read permissions to, including files that are readable by root.
*   **Error Browser Exploitation:** The GDM error browser then displays the contents of the file pointed to by the symlink, allowing users to read the content of system files they shouldn't have access to through GDM's error display mechanism.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Read:** A local user can read the content of any root-readable text file on the system. This can expose sensitive information such as configuration files, password hashes, or other confidential data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system.
*   **Symlink Creation:** The attacker needs the ability to create a symbolic link within their home directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Account:** The attacker must have a valid user account on the system.
*   **Basic File System Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to create a symlink.
*   **GDM access**: Must be able to access the graphical login screen.

**Additional Notes:**
* The advisory from the gnome.org email highlights the issue, "CAN-2003-0547 which allows any user to read any root readable text file on the system by making a symlink from ~/.xsession-errors. This affects all GNOME2 versions."
* The Slackware security advisory confirms the vulnerability and fix: "These fix a security issue where a local user may use GDM to read any file on the system."
* The fix involves backporting the errorgui from HEAD, and ensuring /tmp/.ICE-unix is correctly handled.
