Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- Flaws in the `libnasl` library that allow a script to break out of its sandboxed environment.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Insufficient sandboxing in `libnasl`.
- Vulnerabilities in the `insstr()`, `ftp_log_in()`, and other NASL functions that allow for script crashes when provided with bad parameters.
- Potential for arbitrary command execution on the `nessusd` host due to the lack of proper sandboxing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Arbitrary command execution on the `nessusd` host.

**Attack Vectors:**

- Uploading of malicious Nessus plugins to the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- A valid Nessus account.
- Ability to upload arbitrary Nessus plugins to the server. (Note: This option is disabled by default).

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is not exploitable by a tested host to crash `nessusd` remotely.
- The vulnerabilities were discovered by "Sir Mordred" who found ways to crash NASL scripts.
- The fix includes fixes to other similar issues in other `nasl` functions and `libnessus`.
- The vulnerability is addressed in Nessus 2.0.6.
