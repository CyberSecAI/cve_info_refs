- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The authentication logic in `admin.php` uses an incorrect logical operator. It uses `AND` instead of `OR` in the conditional statement that checks the user and password cookies, allowing an attacker to bypass authentication by providing a valid username cookie and any password.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Authentication bypass due to flawed logic in the authentication routine.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthorized access to the administrative panel of the Digi-news and Digi-ads scripts, allowing the attacker to add, edit, and delete news or advertisements.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a specific HTTP cookie containing a valid username (e.g. "admin") and sending it to the `admin.php` page of the affected application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker only needs to know the default administrator username and be able to send crafted HTTP requests.
