- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper handling of environment variables by VMware GSX Server and VMware Workstation on Linux systems.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software allows manipulation of environment variables which leads to execution of arbitrary code.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A user of the host system can start an arbitrary program with root privileges, potentially gaining full access to the host system.
- **Attack vectors**: By manipulating the VMware GSX Server and VMware Workstation environment variables before launching a virtual machine, an attacker can trigger the execution of a program with root privileges.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a user on the host system where the vulnerable VMware product is installed.
