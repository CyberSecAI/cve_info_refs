Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2003-0660:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the way Microsoft's Authenticode mechanism handles ActiveX control installations under low memory conditions.  Specifically, under certain low memory conditions, Authenticode fails to properly present the user with a dialog box that prompts for approval before installing an ActiveX control.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing User Prompt:** The primary weakness is the failure to display the standard Authenticode prompt, which normally requires user consent before installing an ActiveX control. This bypasses a key security check designed to prevent unauthorized installations.
*   **Low Memory Condition Trigger:** The vulnerability is triggered when the system experiences low memory conditions during the installation process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** A remote attacker can install and execute arbitrary code on the victim's system by leveraging this vulnerability to install a malicious ActiveX control without user consent.
*   **Privilege Execution:** The attacker's code executes within the security context of the user who is currently logged in.  Therefore, if the user has administrative privileges, the attacker's code would have those same privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Web Page:** An attacker can host a specially crafted web page containing a malicious ActiveX control designed to exploit the vulnerability. If the victim visits this page, the control can be installed and executed automatically without prompting.
*   **HTML Email:** An attacker can craft a malicious HTML email containing the malicious ActiveX control. If the victim views the HTML email, the vulnerability may be triggered resulting in the installation of the malicious control.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely, either by hosting a malicious web page or sending a specially crafted HTML email.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to persuade a user to visit a malicious web page or open/view a malicious HTML email.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects various Microsoft Windows versions, including Windows NT 4.0, 2000, XP, and Server 2003.
*   Mitigating factors exist, such as Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration (enabled by default on Windows Server 2003) which blocks automatic exploitation in the web-based attack scenario.
*   Using Outlook Express 6.0, Outlook 2002 or later with the Outlook Email Security Update, reading emails in plain text format, or disabling ActiveX controls can reduce the risk of exploitation.
*   Microsoft released a patch to address this vulnerability, and users were advised to apply it promptly.
*   The vulnerability is present in the underlying Authenticode technology, not only in Internet Explorer. Any application using Authenticode may be affected.
