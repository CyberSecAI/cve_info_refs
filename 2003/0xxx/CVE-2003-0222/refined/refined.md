The provided content is related to CVE-2003-0222.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists within the Oracle database server. This is caused by an overly long parameter provided in the connect string of a `CREATE DATABASE LINK` query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow
- Insufficient input validation of the connect string length.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution in the security context of the Oracle database server.
- On Unix-based systems, the attacker gains access as the 'oracle' user, leading to full data compromise.
- On Windows systems, the attacker gains access as the local SYSTEM user, leading to full compromise of data and the operating system.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted database link.
- An attacker can exploit it by first creating a database link with an overly long connect string.
- Then, triggering the overflow by selecting from the crafted database link.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the `CREATE DATABASE LINK` privilege, which is by default assigned to the `CONNECT` role. This role is commonly assigned to most Oracle accounts, even low-privileged ones.
- Ability to execute SQL queries against the Oracle database server.
