Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2003-0526:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability exists due to the improper handling of URLs within the error pages of Microsoft ISA Server. Specifically, the `homepage()` function in these error pages does not correctly encode the requested URL before displaying it in HTML. This lack of proper encoding allows for the injection of arbitrary script code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is XSS.  By crafting a specific URL, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the error pages displayed by the ISA Server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Code Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript within the context of the user's browser.
*   **Cookie Stealing:**  The injected script can access cookies associated with the ISA-protected website.
*   **Session Hijacking:** By stealing cookies, attackers can hijack user sessions. This can affect things such as access to hotmail accounts and potentially other web-based applications.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Through ActiveX components and other browser features.
*   **Data Access:** The injected script can access any data belonging to the targeted website.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Crafted URLs:** Attackers construct malicious URLs that, when processed by ISA server result in injected code in the resulting HTML error page displayed to the user
*   **Web-based attacks:**  Attackers host a malicious website with the crafted URL.
*   **HTML Email:** Attackers can embed the malicious link in an HTML email.
*   **Triggering Errors:** The attack requires the crafted request to trigger an error response from the ISA server which will then display the vulnerable error page.
 *   Specifically, the report mentions the 500 error page can be triggered by appending `%U0` to the querystring.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Knowledge of ISA Server:** Attackers need to know about a specific ISA server's access policies or have their own server configured to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to entice a user to click on a malicious link or open a specially crafted HTML email. They cannot force a user to visit the malicious page in a web-based attack.
*   **Network Access:** Attackers need to be able to send the malicious URL to a victim.

**Additional details from the content:**
*   The vulnerability exists because ISA server's error pages display the requested URL in HTML text without proper encoding.
*   The `document.write` function used in the error pages to display URLs is where the vulnerability lies.
*   The patch provided by Microsoft eliminates the homepage functionality, and the JavaScript commands for refreshing the page and navigation.
*   The advisory mentions that other error codes can also trigger the vulnerability.
