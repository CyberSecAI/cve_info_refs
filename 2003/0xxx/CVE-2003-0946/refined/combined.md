Quick Summary:
************************************************************************
Advisory Number         : SRT2003-11-11-1151
Product                 : Clam AntiVirus
Version                 : clamav-0.60 through clamav-0.60p
Vendor                  : <http://clamav.elektrapro.com/>
Class                   : Remote
Criticality             : High (to clamav-milter users)
Operating System(s)     : *nix, cygwin

Notice
************************************************************************
The full technical details of this vulnerability can be found at:
<http://www.secnetops.com> under the research section.

Basic Explanation
************************************************************************
High Level Description  : clamav-milter contains format strings issues.
What to do              : disable syslog support, upgrade to clamav-0.65

Basic Technical Details
************************************************************************
Proof Of Concept Status : SNO has proof of concept.

Low Level Description   : Clam AntiVirus is an anti-virus toolkit for
UNIX. The main purpose of the software is to integrate with mail servers
for attachment scanning. Clam AntiVirus works with Linux, Solaris,
FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, AIX, Mac OS X, and Cygwin B20.

Snapshot clamav-devel-20031111 and clamav-0.65 fix a potentially
exploitable format string issue that can be triggered by a remote attacker.
Only versions above clamav-0.54 that include syslog() functionality are
vulnerable to this attack. CVS snapshots up to but not including version
clamav-devel-20031111 may be vulnerable to attack. Versions clamav-0.60
through clamav-0.60p are confirmed to be at least exploitable for a DoS
condition. This issue only poses a problem for clamav-milter users.

*    0.60q   11/11/03 Fixed handling of % characters in e-mail addresses
*    pointed out by dotslash@snosoft.com

This issue may potentially be used to run code as either the clamav user or
root depending on how clamav is configured. At the very least a DoS attack
on clamav-milter can be caused using "mail from: %n%n%n%n%n%n%n" along with
a test antivirus string which is used to trigger an AV alert.

Vendor Status           : Promptly attended to the issue. Patched
clamav-milter is available in clamav-devel-20031111 and clamav-0.65
