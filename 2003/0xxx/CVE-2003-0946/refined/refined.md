- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `clamav-milter` component of Clam AntiVirus contains format string vulnerabilities.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Format string vulnerability in the `syslog()` function calls within `clamav-milter`.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    -  Remote attackers can potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the `clamav` user, or even root depending on the configuration.
    -  Denial-of-service (DoS) by crashing `clamav-milter`.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending specially crafted strings containing format string specifiers (e.g., `%n`) within the "mail from:" field of an email, triggering the vulnerable `syslog()` calls. The email must also trigger an AV alert.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to send emails to a server using `clamav-milter` with syslog support enabled.

The advisory provides more specific details than what is typically included in a CVE description such as:
- The specific vulnerable versions (`clamav-0.60` through `clamav-0.60p`) and that versions above 0.54 that use `syslog()` are vulnerable.
- The specific email field and format string needed to trigger the issue: "mail from: %n%n%n%n%n%n%n".
- The type of DoS attack and how to trigger the AV alert.
- The potential for arbitrary code execution.
