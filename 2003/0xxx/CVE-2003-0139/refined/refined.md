  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Kerberos v4 protocol lacks cryptographic protection such as a cryptographic hash of the encrypted data, random padding, and a random initial vector, making it vulnerable to chosen-plaintext attacks. The MIT implementation of triple-DES encryption for service tickets in Kerberos v4 uses CBC mode, which introduces a ticket splicing vulnerability.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of cryptographic hash, random padding, and random initial vector in Kerberos v4 tickets.",
       "Use of CBC mode in MIT implementation of triple-DES encryption for Kerberos v4 service tickets." ,
      "Vulnerable to chosen plaintext attacks because parts of the ticket are static",
       "Tickets encrypted with Triple-DES are vulnerable to a splicing attack"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can impersonate any user within a Kerberos realm and gain any authorized privileges. With the ability to capture network traffic, an attacker can fabricate Kerberos v4 tickets for unauthorized client principals if triple-DES keys are used for service authentication. This can lead to complete compromise of the Kerberos authentication infrastructure, potentially including root-level access to KDCs and other systems relying on Kerberos. Cross-realm attacks can also compromise other realms sharing keys with the attacked realm.",
