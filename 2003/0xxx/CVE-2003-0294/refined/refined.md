- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the `autohtml.php` file of php-proxima where the `$name` variable, intended for including files from the `autohtml` directory, can be controlled by a user-supplied input via the `name` parameter in the URL, without proper sanitization, allowing for local file inclusion.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is a local file inclusion (LFI) vulnerability due to the insecure handling of user input in the `include("autohtml/$name");` statement. The code does not properly validate or sanitize the `$name` variable, which can lead to an attacker including arbitrary files on the server. The `mainfile.php` is also not required to be included, further weakening the security posture.
- **Impact of exploitation:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can read sensitive files from the server's filesystem by providing the path to the file they wish to include, potentially exposing confidential data, source code, or configuration files.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable `autohtml.php` file, specifically by manipulating the `op` and `name` parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server hosting the affected php-proxima installation. No special privileges are required.
