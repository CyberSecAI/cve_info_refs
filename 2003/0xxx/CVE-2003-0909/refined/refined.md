Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2003-0909:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists in how Microsoft Windows XP allows tasks to be created. Specifically, it stems from a flaw in the Windows Management Interface (WMI) provider that handles task creation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Privilege Elevation:** A non-privileged user could create a task that executes with SYSTEM level privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could gain complete control of the affected system.
- This includes the ability to install programs, view/modify/delete data, and create new accounts with full privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker needs valid logon credentials to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be able to create a task, which can be done through the task scheduler or programmatically.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be a logged-in user on a Windows XP system.
- Remote exploitation is not possible; the attacker needs local access.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is specific to Windows XP and does not affect other Windows versions (NT 4.0, 2000, Server 2003).
- The associated Microsoft Security Bulletin is MS04-011.
- The fix involves preventing users from creating tasks at an elevated privilege level.
- The update also introduced behavioral changes:
  - User may need to supply a username and password to create event based triggers through `eventtriggers.exe`
  - Task scheduler service must be running for administrators to create event-based triggers
  - A limit of 1000 triggers was introduced
  - Permissions on event based triggers were strengthened.
