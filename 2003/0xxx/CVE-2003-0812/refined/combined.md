	about XPs).

	To be compiled with lcc-win32 (*hint* link mpr.lib) ... I will not improve
	this public version, do not bother to ask.

	Credits go to eEye :)
	See original bulletin for more information, it is very well documented.

Windows Workstation Service Remote Buffer Overflow

Release Date:
November 11, 2003

Date Reported:
September 15, 2003

Severity:
High (Remote Code Execution)

Systems Affected:
Windows 2000
Windows XP

Description:
eEye Digital Security has discovered a remote buffer overflow in the Windows \
Workstation Service (WKSSVC.DLL). An unauthenticated attacker could exploit this \
vulnerability to execute arbitrary code with system-level privileges on Windows 2000 \
and Windows XP machines. The susceptible Workstation functionality is accessible via \
the WKSSVC named pipe (TCP ports 139 and 445).

This buffer overflow bug is within network management functions provided by the \
DCE/RPC service. These functions provide the ability to manage user accounts and \
network resources locally and remotely. Some network management functions generate a \
debug log file in the "debug" subdirectory located in the Windows directory.

A logging function implemented in WKSSVC.DLL is called to write entries to the log \
file.  In this function, the vsprintf() routine is used to create a log entry.  The \
string arguments for this logging function are supplied as parameters to vsprintf() \
without any bounds checking, so if we can pass a long string argument to the logging \
function, then a buffer overflow will occur.

We found some RPC functions which will accept a long string as a parameter, and will \
attempt to write it to the debug log file.  If we specify a long string as a \
parameter to these RPC functions, a stack-based buffer overflow will happen in the \
Workstation service on the remote system. Attackers who successfully leverage this \
vulnerability will be executing code under the SYSTEM context of the remote host.

Technical Description:
The buffer overflow bug is in a logging function which generates a string for the log \
file using vsprintf().  The name of the log file is "NetSetup.LOG", and it is located \
in the Windows "debug" directory.

This logging routine is called from some functions which handle commands for the \
Workstation service, such as "NetValidateName", "NetJoinDomain", etc.  In the case of \
NetValidateName(), the "computer name" specified as the second argument is eventually \
recorded in the log file.

For example, if we use NetValidateName() API as follows:

    NetValidateName(L"\\\\192.168.0.100","AAAAAAAA",NULL,NULL,0);

then we can confirm the following log entry on the remote host "192.168.0.100":

    08/13 13:01:01 NetpValidateName: checking to see if '' is valid as type 0 name
    08/13 13:01:01 NetpValidateName: '' is not a valid NetBIOS \\AAAAAAAA name: 0x57

If we specify a long string as the second argument to the NetValidateName() API, a \
buffer overflow happens on the specified host if the debug file is writeable.

Generally, the "debug" subdirectory in the Windows directory is not writeable by \
everyone if the drive is formatted as NTFS, which means that we cannot append to the \
log using a null session.  The WsImpersonateClient() API is called before opening the \
log file, and if the connected client does not have the privilege to write to the log \
file, then CreateFile() will fail, and the vulnerable call to vsprintf() is not \
performed.  So, in this case, we can exploit FAT32 systems (which do not support ACLs \
on directories), or systems where the "%SYSTEMROOT%\debug" directory is writeable by \
everyone.

However, there are some extended RPC functions implemented in Windows XP which open \
the logfile before calling WsImpersonateClient().  They are undocumented RPC \
functions, but we can observe them in the function table in WKSSVC.DLL.  The RPC \
numbers for these extended commands start at 0x1B; for example, function 0x1B invokes \
the NetpManageComputers() API internally, which does not call WsImpersonateClient() \
before opening the log file.

The usage of NetpManageComputers() is not published; however, we found the prototype \
definition of the NetAddAlternateComputerName() API in "LMJoin.h", which calls \
NetpManageComputers() internally.  This API is exported from NETAPI32.DLL. This API \
is also undocumented.  We can generate the packet to execute this RPC function \
(number 0x1B) using the API as follows:

    NetAddAlternateComputerName(L"\\\\192.168.0.200",long_unicode_string,NULL,NULL,0);

We do not need special privileges to write the second argument into the log file on \
the remote host.  If we specify a long Unicode string as the second argument \
("AlternateName"), the remote system specified in the first argument will crash due \
to a buffer overflow.  The Unicode string "long_unicode_string" will be translated \
into an ASCII string before the logging function is called.

### General Information

## Technical Details

**Technical description:**

A security vulnerability exists in the Workstation service that could allow remote code execution on an affected system. This vulnerability results because of an unchecked buffer in the Workstation service.

If exploited, an attacker could gain System privileges on an affected system, or could cause the Workstation service to fail. An attacker could take any action on the system, including installing programs, viewing data, changing data, or deleting data, or creating new accounts with full privileges.

**Mitigating factors:**

* If users have blocked inbound UDP ports 138, 139, 445 and TCP ports 138, 139, 445 by using a firewall an attacker would be prevented from sending messages to the Workstation service. Most firewalls, including Internet Connection Firewall in Windows XP, block these ports by default.
* Disabling the Workstation service will prevent the possibility of attack. However there are a number of impacts when performing this workaround. Please see the Workaround section for more details.
* Only Windows 2000 and Window XP are affected. Other operating systems are not vulnerable to this attack.

**Severity Rating:**

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Microsoft Windows 2000** | Critical |
| **Microsoft Windows XP** | Critical |

The above [assessment](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21140) is based on the types of systems affected by the vulnerability, their typical deployment patterns, and the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would have on them.

**Vulnerability identifier:** [CAN-2003-0812](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=can-2003-0812)

## Workarounds

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds that apply to this vulnerability. These workarounds help block known attack vectors, however they will not correct the underlying vulnerability. Workarounds may reduce functionality in some cases; in such cases, the reduction in functionality is identified below.

* **Block UDP ports 138, 139, 445 and TCP ports 138, 139, 445 at your firewall.**

  These ports are used to accept a Remote Procedure Call (RPC) connection at a remote computer. Blocking them at the firewall will help prevent systems behind that firewall from being attacked by attempts to exploit this vulnerability.
* **Use a personal firewall such as** [Internet Connection Firewall](https://www.microsoft.com/athome/security/protect/windowsxp/firewall.aspx)**, which is included with Windows XP.**

  If you use the Internet Connection Firewall feature in Windows XP to help protect your Internet connection, Internet Connection Firewall blocks inbound traffic from the Internet or from the intranet by default.

  **To enable the Internet Connection Firewall feature by using the Network Setup Wizard:**

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel**.
  2. In the default Category View, click **Network and Internet Connections**, and then click **Setup or change your home or small office network**. The Internet Connection Firewall feature is enabled when you select a configuration in the Network Setup Wizard that indicates that your computer is connected directly to the Internet.

  **To configure Internet Connection Firewall manually for a connection:**

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel**.
  2. In the default Category View, click **Networking and Internet Connections**, and then click **Network Connections**.
  3. Right-click the connection on which you want to enable Internet Connection Firewall, and then click **Properties**.
  4. Click the **Advanced** tab.
  5. Select the **Protect my computer or network by limiting or preventing access to this computer from the Internet check box**, and then click **OK**.

     **Note:** If you want to enable the use of some applications and services through the firewall, click **Settings** on the **Advanced** tab, and then select the programs, the protocols, and the services.
* **Enable advanced TCP/IP filtering on Windows 2000-based systems and on Windows XP-based systems.**

  You can enable advanced TCP/IP filtering to block all unsolicited, inbound traffic. For additional information about how to configure TCP/IP filtering, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  [309798](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;309798&sd;=tech) HOW TO: Configure TCP/IP Filtering in Windows 2000
* **Disable the Workstation service.**

  You can disable the Workstation service to help prevent the possibility of an attack.

  To disable the Workstation service on Windows XP:

  + Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel**.
  + In the default Category View, click **Performance and Maintenance**.
  + Click **Administrative Tools**.
  + Double-click **Services**.
  + Double-click **Workstation**.
  + On the **General** tab, click **Disabled** in the **Startup type** list.
  + Click **Stop** under **Service status**, and then click **OK**.

  To disable the Workstation service on Windows 2000:

  + Click **Start**, point to **Settings**, and then click **Control Panel**.
  + Double-click **Administrative Tools**.
  + Double-click **Services**.
  + Double-click **Workstation**.
  + On the **General** tab, click **Disabled** in the **Startup type** list.
  + Click **Stop** under **Service status**, and then click **OK**.

  **Impact of Workaround:** If the Workstation service is disabled, the system cannot connect to any shared file resources or shared print resources on a network. Only use this workaround on stand-alone systems (such as many home systems) that do not connect to a network. If the Workstation service is disabled, any services that explicitly depend on the Workstation service do not start, and an error message is logged in the system event log. The following services depend on the Workstation service:

  + Alerter
  + Browser
  + Messenger
  + Net Logon
  + RPC Locator

  These services are required to access resources on a network and to perform domain authentication. Internet connectivity and browsing for stand-alone systems, such as users on dial-up connections, on DSL connections, or on cable modem connections, should not be affected if these services are disabled.

  **Note:** The Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer will not function if the Workstation service is disabled. It is possible that other applications may also require the Workstation service. If an application requires the Workstation service, simply re-enable the service. This can be performed by changing the **Startup Type** for the Workstation service back to **Automatic** and restarting the system.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a [buffer overrun](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/glossary) vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could allow remote code execution with System privileges on an affected system, or an attacker could cause the Workstation service to fail. The attacker could then take any action on the system, including installing programs, viewing data, changing data, or deleting data, or creating new accounts with full privileges.\*\* \*\*

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability results because of an unchecked buffer within the Workstation service.

**What is the Workstation Service?**

Both local file system requests and remote file or print network requests are routed through the Workstation service. This service determines where the resource is located and then routes the request to the local file system or to the networking components. When the Workstation service is stopped, all requests are assumed to be local requests. For a detailed understanding of the Windows networking architecture, visit the following Microsoft Web site: [https://www.microsoft.com /technet/prodtechnol/windows2000serv/reskit/cnet/cnad\_arc\_tfgi.mspx](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windows2000serv/reskit/cnet/cnad_arc_tfgi.mspx)

**What could this vulnerability enable an attacker to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause code to execute with System privileges on an affected system or could cause the Workstation service to fail. An attacker could then take any action on the system, including installing programs, viewing data, changing data, or deleting data, or creating new accounts with full privileges.

**Who could exploit the vulnerability?**

Any anonymous user who could deliver a malformed message to the Workstation service on an affected system could attempt to exploit this vulnerability. Because the Workstation service is enabled by default in all versions of Windows, this means that any user who could establish a connection with an affected system could attempt to exploit this vulnerability.

**How could an attacker exploit this vulnerability?**

An attacker could seek to exploit this vulnerability by creating a specially-crafted network message and by sending the message to the Workstation service on an affected system. Receipt of such a message could cause the Workstation service on the vulnerable system to fail in such a way that could allow the Workstation service to execute code.
An attacker could also access the affected component through another vector, such as one that would involve logging onto the system interactively or by using another application that passed parameters to the vulnerable component (locally or remotely).

**What does the update do?**

The update eliminates the vulnerability by ensuring that the Workstation service properly validates the length of a message before passing the message to the allocated buffer.

**Why does the Windows XP update reference the MS03-043 Security Bulletin?**

There is no Windows XP version of the MS03-049 security update. The Windows XP security updates that released as part of Security Bulletin [MS03-043](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/ms03-043) ([828035](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/ms03-043)) include the updated file that helps protect from this vulnerability. The Windows XP download links in this bulletin link to the Windows XP MS03-043 security update. If you have applied the Windows XP security updates for [MS03-043](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/ms03-043) ([828035](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/ms03-043)) you do not have to reapply the update to be protected against the vulnerability described in this bulletin. However, the Windows 2000 security update that is released as part of this security bulletin contains updated files that were not part of the [MS03-043](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/ms03-043) ([828035](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/ms03-043)) security bulletin.

However, the Windows 2000 security update that is released as part of this security bulletin contains updated files that were not part of the [MS03-043](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS03-043.asp) ([828035](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS03-043.asp)) security bulletin. Customers have to apply this Windows 2000 security update even if they applied the Windows 2000 security updates for [MS03-043](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS03-043.asp) ([828035](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS03-043.asp)). |
| --- |

| Note the following mitigation strategies from Microsoft's Advisory:       + If users have blocked inbound UDP ports 138, 139, 445 and TCP ports 138, 139, 445by using a firewall an attacker would be prevented from sending messages to the Workstation service. Most firewalls, including Internet Connection Firewall in Windows XP, block these ports by default. + Disabling the Workstation service will prevent the possibility of attack. However there are a number of impacts when performing this workaround. Please see the Workaround section for more details. + Only Windows 2000 and Window XP are affected. Other operating systems are not vulnerable to this attack. |

## History

The CERT Division is the birthplace of cybersecurity. For nearly 30 years, the CERT Division of the SEI has partnered with government, industry, law enforcement, and academia to advance cybersecurity and improve the security and resilience of computer systems and networks.

Originally focused on incident response, we have expanded into cybersecurity areas such as network situational awareness, malicious code analysis, secure coding, resilience management, insider threats, digital investigations and intelligence, workforce development, DevOps, forensics, software assurance, vulnerability discovery and analysis, and risk management.

## Former Director Richard Pethia

[Richard Pethia](/about/leadership/display.cfm?customel_datapageid_2623=3545) was founding director of the SEI's CERT Division. Pethia, who served as director of CERT from 1988 to 2016, guided the organization through tremendous growth and change. Under Pethia's leadership, the unit expanded and evolved from the CERT Coordination Center—a small group focused on computer incident response—to a research organization of more than 200 professionals dedicated to solving problems with widespread cybersecurity implications.
