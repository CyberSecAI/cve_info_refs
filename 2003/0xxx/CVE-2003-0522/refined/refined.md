Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is a failure to sanitize user-supplied input in the ProductCart application, specifically within the `Custva.asp` and `login.asp` files. This allows for SQL injection attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection because it directly incorporates user-provided data into SQL queries without proper sanitization.
*   The `Custva.asp` file is vulnerable to SQL injection in the `Email` parameter.
*   The `login.asp` file in the admin control panel is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `idadmin` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Exposure:** An attacker can use SQL injection to query and potentially extract sensitive information from the database, including user data, application configurations, and other private data.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** In the most critical case, the vulnerability in `login.asp` allows an attacker to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the admin control panel. This provides complete control over the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting malicious URLs containing SQL injection payloads.
    *   For `Custva.asp`, the attacker crafts a URL with a modified `Email` parameter.
    *   For `login.asp`, the attacker modifies the `idadmin` parameter in the URL.
*   **Direct Interaction:** The attacker directly interacts with the web application by sending crafted HTTP requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to access the target web server over the network.
*   **Basic Knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand HTTP requests, URL parameters and have basic knowledge of SQL injection techniques.
*   **No Credentials Needed (for Admin Access):** For the `login.asp` vulnerability, no existing user credentials are required to gain administrative access.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory indicates that while the application has some error handling, it does not prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
*   The vendor's response includes instructions on patching the vulnerability.
