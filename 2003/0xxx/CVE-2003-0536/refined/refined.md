Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability lies in the way phpSysInfo handles the `template` and `lng` variables. It uses these variables to construct file paths without properly sanitizing or validating them for directory traversal sequences like `..`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** The lack of input validation on the `template` and `lng` variables allows an attacker to inject `..` sequences, leading to the ability to access files outside of the intended directories.
*   **Arbitrary File Inclusion:** By manipulating the `lng` variable, the attacker can include arbitrary PHP files from the system, leading to potential execution of arbitrary code.
*   **Local File Disclosure:** Attackers can read any file on the system accessible by the webserver user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive files on the server can be read, potentially exposing passwords, configuration data, and other confidential information.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including malicious PHP files, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server, gaining full control over the system.
*   **Compromise of Web Server:** Successful exploitation can lead to the complete compromise of the web server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Parameter Manipulation:** The vulnerability is exploited by crafting HTTP GET requests that include malicious `template` or `lng` parameters.
*   **Directory Traversal:** Attackers utilize `..` sequences within the `template` and `lng` parameters to navigate to arbitrary directories.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable phpSysInfo instance.
*   **Local Write Access (For Arbitrary Code Execution):** To achieve arbitrary code execution, the attacker needs write access to a local directory where the webserver user can read files. This is necessary to upload the malicious PHP file that will be included via the `lng` parameter. Note that the attacker does not require local access to the server itself, only local to the webserver instance, which could be the same machine.

**Additional Details:**

*   The exploit requires creating symlinks or files within a directory that the webserver user can read to trigger the vulnerability.
*   The `template` variable is used to access files such as `form.tpl` and `box.tpl`, and the `lng` variable includes PHP files.
*   The vulnerability is present up to version 2.1 of phpSysInfo.
*   There is no official patch, but the reporter suggests adding regex to filter `..` sequences from the variables.
