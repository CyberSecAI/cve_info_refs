{
  "CVE-2003-0730": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Several variables passed from a font server to a client are not adequately checked, allowing integer overflows.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Integer overflows in the font libraries of XFree86, leading to erroneous buffer size calculations.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Remote code execution on clients, potential local privilege escalation if Xserver is forced to load a font from an arbitrary server.",
      "Attack vectors": "Remote: malicious font server to client communication. Local: manipulating X server configuration to load fonts from a malicious server.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Remote: Attacker needs to control a font server. Local: Attacker needs to be able to modify the X server configuration."
    },
    {
       "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer overflows in XFree86 font libraries, specifically related to transferring and enumerating fonts from font servers to clients.",
       "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Inadequate checking of variables passed from the font server to the client, leading to integer overflows.",
       "Impact of exploitation": "Erroneous buffer size calculations can cause heap and stack overflows, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution. Remote compromise is limited to clients but can affect xfs and X server in certain configurations. Local users can potentially gain root privileges by exploiting configuration of X server.",
       "Attack vectors": "Remote: Malicious font server can send crafted data causing client overflows. Local: An unprivileged user can force the X server (setuid root) to load a font from an arbitrary (malicious) font server.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Remote: Requires control over a font server. Local: Requires the ability to alter the X server's configuration to point to a malicious font server."
