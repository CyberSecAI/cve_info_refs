How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## OpenSSL ASN.1 parser insecure memory deallocation

#### Vulnerability Note VU#935264

Original Release Date: 2003-09-30 | Last Revised: 2003-10-01

---

### Overview

A vulnerability in the way OpenSSL deallocates memory used to store ASN.1 structures could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the process using the OpenSSL library.

### Description

| [OpenSSL](http://www.openssl.org/) implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols and includes a general purpose cryptographic library. SSL and TLS are commonly used to provide authentication, encryption, integrity, and non-repudiation services to network applications such as HTTP, IMAP, POP3, LDAP, and others. Clients and servers exchange authentication information in X.509 certificates. While the SSL and TLS protocols are not directly based on ASN.1, they do rely on ASN.1 objects used in X.509 certificates and other cryptographic elements (e.g. PKCS#1 encoded RSA values). The ASN.1 parser in OpenSSL is also used to handle non-SSL/TLS elements such as PKCS#7 encoded S/MIME parts.  There is a vulnerability in the way OpenSSL deallocates memory used to store ASN.1 structures (ASN1\_TYPE). Parsing specially crafted ASN.1 encoded structures that OpenSSL determines to be invalid could cause memory to be deallocated insecurely, corrupting the stack.From the OpenSSL [advisory](http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20030930.txt):  ``` 1. Certain ASN.1 encodings that are rejected as invalid by the parsercan trigger a bug in the deallocation of the corresponding datastructure, corrupting the stack. This can be used as a denial of serviceattack. It is currently unknown whether this can be exploited to runmalicious code. This issue does not affect OpenSSL 0.9.6. ``` All versions of SSLeay and versions of OpenSSL prior to 0.9.7c are vulnerable, as are operating systems and applications that use vulnerable SSLeay or OpenSSL libraries. The OpenSSL [advisory](http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20030930.txt) describes as vulnerable "Any application that makes use of OpenSSL's ASN1 library to parse untrusted data. This includes all SSL or TLS applications, those using S/MIME (PKCS#7) or certificate generation routines." OpenSSL 0.9.6 is not affected.The U.K. National Infrastructure Security Co-ordination Centre ([NISCC](http://www.niscc.gov.uk/)) is tracking this vulnerability as [NISCC/006489/openssl/3](http://www.uniras.gov.uk/vuls/2003/006489/openssl.htm). |
| --- |

### Impact

| By providing specially crafted data to the vulnerable ASN.1 parser, a remote attacker could cause a denial of service. It may be possible to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the process using the vulnerable library. One potential attack vector is a client certificate message containing specially crafted X.509 certificates. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade or Patch**Upgrade to OpenSSL 0.9.7c. Alternatively, upgrade OpenSSL or apply a patch as specified by your vendor. Further information is available in an [advisory](http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20030930.txt) from OpenSSL. Note that it is necessary to recompile any applications that are statically linked to OpenSSL libraries. |

## History

The CERT Division is the birthplace of cybersecurity. For nearly 30 years, the CERT Division of the SEI has partnered with government, industry, law enforcement, and academia to advance cybersecurity and improve the security and resilience of computer systems and networks.

Originally focused on incident response, we have expanded into cybersecurity areas such as network situational awareness, malicious code analysis, secure coding, resilience management, insider threats, digital investigations and intelligence, workforce development, DevOps, forensics, software assurance, vulnerability discovery and analysis, and risk management.

## Former Director Richard Pethia

[Richard Pethia](/about/leadership/display.cfm?customel_datapageid_2623=3545) was founding director of the SEI's CERT Division. Pethia, who served as director of CERT from 1988 to 2016, guided the organization through tremendous growth and change. Under Pethia's leadership, the unit expanded and evolved from the CERT Coordination Center—a small group focused on computer incident response—to a research organization of more than 200 professionals dedicated to solving problems with widespread cybersecurity implications.
