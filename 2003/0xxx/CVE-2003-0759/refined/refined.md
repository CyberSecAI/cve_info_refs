- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Stack-based buffer overflow in the `db2licm` binary.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The `db2licm` binary is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow due to insufficient bounds checking when handling command-line arguments.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local attacker can execute arbitrary code with root privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation occurs by providing a long command-line argument to the vulnerable `db2licm` binary.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs local access to the system and must have the ability to execute the `db2licm` binary, which is setuid root. They must have access to an account that is either in the `db2iadm1` or `db2asgrp` group by default.
