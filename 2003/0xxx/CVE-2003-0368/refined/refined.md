The provided content is related to CVE-2003-0368.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A vulnerability exists in the Nokia Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) that allows a remote attacker to restart the device by sending IP packets with non-standard IP options.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The GGSN is vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack due to improper handling of IP packets with non-standard IP options.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation results in the GGSN restarting, causing a disruption in connectivity within the GPRS network that the GGSN is responsible for and potentially losing some charging data.

**Attack vectors:**
A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending specifically crafted IP packets with non-standard options to the GGSN via the Gi interface or the Gn network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker requires the ability to send IP packets to the GGSN. They can potentially do this from the mobile user side or through the Gi interface, although firewalls on the Gi interface might usually drop such packets. The attack can be performed by a malicious user equipped with a computer and a mobile phone, able to inject IP packets into the network.
