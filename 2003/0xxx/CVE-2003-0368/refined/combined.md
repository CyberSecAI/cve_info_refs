## Nokia Gateway GPRS support node vulnerable to DoS

#### Vulnerability Note VU#924812

Original Release Date: 2003-08-20 | Last Revised: 2003-08-20

---

### Overview

A vulnerability in the Nokia Gateway GPRS support node (GGSN) may allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service.

### Description

| A vulnerability in the GGSN may allow a remote attacker to restart the device. For technical details, please see the @stake Security Advisory [*Nokia GGSN (IP650 Based) DoS Issues*](http://www.atstake.com/research/advisories/2003/a060903-1.txt).  Nokia [describes](http://www.nokia.com/networks/product_catalog/pc_product_highlights/1%2C6929%2C%2C00.html?prod_id=NWS00032&path=alpha&mcat=&scat=&tech_id=&range_id=1&query=) the GGSN as follows:The Nokia GGSN is the network element that provides the interface between the GPRS network and external IP networks, such as the Internet and corporate intranet. By providing secure connections to external packet networks, the GGSN links the GPRS network to the Internet, ISPs and corporate intranets. The GGSN also provides allocation of IP address. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker may be able to restart the GGSN, which will disrupt connectivity within the GPRS network that the GGSN is responsible for. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Obtain an upgraded IPSO from Nokia. |
| --- |

| **Workarounds**  Nokia recommends the following:As an interim measure operators can perform the following preventative configuration changes to their networks. Ensure that all IP packets  with non standard IP options are dropped by boarder firewalls on the  Gi interface. Within the Gn network ensure that the GTP aware firewall (if present) also drops all encapsulated IP packets with non standard  IP options. This may introduce latency however it will mitigate against the attack until the patch has been fully deployed and tested. |

### Addendum

@stake has [indicated](http://www.atstake.com/research/advisories/2003/a060903-1.txt) that Nokia sent the following text to their customers.

---[Nokia Notice]---
 NOKIA CUSTOMER CONFIDENTIAL, GGSN RELEASE 1 VULNERABILITY

 Under exceptional circumstances Nokia GGSN release 1 is
 potentially vulnerable to a "Denial Of Service" style of
 attack from a malicious user equipped with a computer and a
 mobile phone. When the vulnerability is exploited the GGSN
 restarts. There is no damage to the configuration, but some
 charging data may be lost. Changing a normal Access Point to
 tunneled (GRE or IP in IP) prevents the attacks from mobile
 user side.

 The same applies for the Gi interface though routers and
 firewalls would normally drop this kind of packets. The
 problem has been detected and reported by @stake and has been
 reproduced by Nokia in collaboration with @stake. Nokia and
 @stake are jointly working to eliminate the problem.

 This vulnerability is corrected in IPSO version 3.4 and all
 subsequent versions. Thus, GGSN release 2 is not vulnerable,
 GGSN release 1 is. Nokia advices all the customers still
 running GGSN release level 1 to upgrade on GGSN release level 2.

 As an interim measure operators can perform the following
 preventative configuration changes to their networks. Ensure
 that all IP packets with non standard IP options are dropped
 by boarder firewalls on the Gi interface. Within the Gn
 network ensure that the GTP aware firewall (if present) also
 drops all encapsulated IP packets with non standard IP
 options. This may introduce latency however it will mitigate
 against the attack until the patch has been fully deployed
 and tested.

 Due to the severity of this vulnerability @stake has
 confirmed that they will not be releasing this information
 publicly on their research page (<http://www.atstake.com/research/>)
 until Nokia has confirmed that all affected operators have fully
 patched and tested all affected elements. However @stake would
 ideally like to release this information no later than 1st June
 2003.

 Neither @stake nor Nokia are aware of this attack being used
 in the wild as it was discovered by @stake within a lab
 environment and subsequently tested on a number of operators
 for whom they have worked for.
