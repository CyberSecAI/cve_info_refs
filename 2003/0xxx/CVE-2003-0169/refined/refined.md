- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `hpnst.exe` application, acting as a middle-man for file requests, can be made to request itself, leading to a recursive loop and ultimately causing a denial-of-service.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the design of `hpnst.exe` which does not properly handle a request for itself, causing a recursive loop.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exploiting this vulnerability results in a denial-of-service, rendering the system unstable and unusable. The application will continue to loop and call itself, even after the initial request times out, and the only remedy is to kill `hpnst.exe` or reboot.
- **Attack vectors**: Attackers can trigger the vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the GoAhead-Webs web server running on TCP port 280, specifically requesting `/cgi-bin/hpnst.exe?c=p+i=hpnst.exe`. Repeated requests amplify the impact.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server on TCP port 280. This could be from the local network or, if the service is exposed, the internet.
