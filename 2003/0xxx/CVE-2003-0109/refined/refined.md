Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is due to an unchecked buffer within `ntdll.dll`, a core operating system component in Microsoft Windows.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- A buffer overflow exists in `ntdll.dll`. This DLL is used by many different components in the Windows operating system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** A remote attacker can execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.
- **Complete System Control:** Successful exploitation grants the attacker complete control over the affected system, allowing them to perform actions with Local System privileges.
- This can lead to actions such as: changing web pages, reformatting the hard drive, adding new users to the local administrators group, installing programs, viewing/changing/deleting data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **WebDAV via IIS:** A specially crafted HTTP request (specifically a WebDAV request) sent to a machine running Internet Information Server (IIS) can trigger the buffer overflow.
- **Local Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited through other attack vectors, including logging onto the system interactively or by using another application that passes parameters to the vulnerable component either locally or remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **WebDAV Exploit:** An attacker needs to be able to send a WebDAV request to an affected web server. Since WebDAV uses the same port as HTTP (usually port 80), anyone who can establish a connection with the server can attempt exploitation.
- **Local Exploit:** Requires the ability to log onto the system interactively or access the affected component through some other vector.

**Affected Software:**
- Microsoft Windows NT 4.0
- Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Terminal Server Edition
- Microsoft Windows 2000
- Microsoft Windows XP

**Mitigating Factors:**
-  URLScan (part of the IIS Lockdown Tool) blocks this attack in its default configuration.
- The vulnerability can only be exploited remotely if an attacker can establish a web session with an affected server
- Windows NT 4.0 and Windows XP do not install Internet Information Services by default.
- Windows NT 4.0 does not support WebDAV

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability was initially exploited via WebDAV in IIS 5.0, but the underlying issue was in `ntdll.dll`.
- While Windows NT 4.0 and XP do not support WebDAV or install IIS by default, they are still vulnerable through other means.
-  A patch is available from Microsoft to correct the issue. Workarounds include disabling WebDAV, restricting buffer size used by IIS, or using URLScan.
