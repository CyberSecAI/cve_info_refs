{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow in the way OpenSSL handles ASN.1 tags. A specially crafted ASN.1 tag can lead to an out-of-bounds memory read operation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer Overflow",
      "Out-of-bounds memory read"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by sending specially crafted ASN.1 encoded data. This could crash the process using the OpenSSL library. In some cases, it could be triggered by a malformed SSL client certificate.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a carefully crafted SSL client certificate",
      "Providing specially crafted ASN.1 encoded data to a vulnerable system."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to a vulnerable server or application using the vulnerable OpenSSL library.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability affects all versions of SSLeay and versions of OpenSSL prior to 0.9.7c or 0.9.6k. Any application using OpenSSL's ASN1 library to parse untrusted data is vulnerable, including all SSL or TLS applications, those using S/MIME (PKCS#7), or certificate generation routines. The vulnerability is triggered by unusual ASN.1 tag values."
