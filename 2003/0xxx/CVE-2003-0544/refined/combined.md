## OpenSSL contains integer overflow handling ASN.1 tags (2)

#### Vulnerability Note VU#380864

Original Release Date: 2003-09-30 | Last Revised: 2003-10-01

---

### Overview

A vulnerability in the way OpenSSL handles ASN.1 tags could allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service.

### Description

| [OpenSSL](http://www.openssl.org/) implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols and includes a general purpose cryptographic library. SSL and TLS are commonly used to provide authentication, encryption, integrity, and non-repudiation services to network applications such as HTTP, IMAP, POP3, LDAP, and others. Clients and servers exchange authentication information in X.509 certificates. While the SSL and TLS protocols are not directly based on ASN.1, they do rely on ASN.1 objects used in X.509 certificates and other cryptographic elements (e.g. PKCS#1 encoded RSA values).  OpenSSL contains an integer overflow vulnerability in the way ASN.1 tags are handled. A specially crafted ASN.1 tag could cause the OpenSSL library to perform an out-of-bounds memory read operation. This could result in a denial of service, crashing the process using the OpenSSL library.From the OpenSSL [advisory](http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20030930.txt):  ``` 2. Unusual ASN.1 tag values can cause an out of bounds read undercertain circumstances, resulting in a denial of service vulnerability. ```  All versions of SSLeay and versions of OpenSSL prior to 0.9.7c or 0.9.6k are vulnerable, as are operating systems and applications that use vulnerable SSLeay or OpenSSL libraries. The OpenSSL [advisory](http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20030930.txt) describes as vulnerable "Any application that makes use of OpenSSL's ASN1 library to parse untrusted data. This includes all SSL or TLS applications, those using S/MIME (PKCS#7) or certificate generation routines."The U.K. National Infrastructure Security Co-ordination Centre ([NISCC](http://www.niscc.gov.uk/)) is tracking this vulnerability (VU#380864) and VU#255484 as [NISCC/006489/openssl/1](http://www.uniras.gov.uk/vuls/2003/006489/openssl.htm). |
| --- |

### Impact

| By providing specially crafted ASN.1 encoded data to a vulnerable system, a remote attacker could cause a denial of service. One potential attack vector is a client certificate message containing specially crafted X.509 certificates. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade or Patch**Upgrade to OpenSSL 0.9.7c or 0.9.6k. Alternatively, upgrade or apply a patch as specified by your vendor. Further information is available in an [advisory](http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20030930.txt) from OpenSSL. Note that it is necessary to recompile any applications that are statically linked to OpenSSL libraries. |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=104893#c0)  Mark J. Cox    2003-09-23 11:06:15 UTC  ``` Notified via NISCC on Sep12, NISCC 006489  [CAN-2003-0543](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2003-0543) OpenSSL 0.96/0.97 ASN.1 int overflow [CAN-2003-0544](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2003-0544) OpenSSL 0.96/0.97 ASN.1 read one character  NISCC found two bugs in OpenSSL 0.9.6 which can be triggered by sending a carefully crafted SSL client certificate containing an unusual ASN.1 tag value, such a certificate, could cause an application using OpenSSL to terminate unexpectedly.    RHSA-2003:293 in progress  Embargoed until November 4th 2003.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=104893#c1)  Mark J. Cox    2003-09-29 09:36:16 UTC  ``` Actually this is embargoed until September 30th not November 4th (my mistake).  A better description of the issues:  NISCC testing of implementations of the SSL protocol uncovered two bugs in OpenSSL 0.9.6 and OpenSSL 0.9.7. The parsing of unusual ASN.1 tag values can cause OpenSSL to crash. A remote attacker could trigger this bug by sending a carefully-crafted SSL client certificate to an application. The effects of such an attack vary depending on the application targetted; against Apache the effects are limited, as the attack would only cause child processes to die and be replaced. An attack against other applications that use OpenSSL could result in a Denial of Service. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names [CAN-2003-0543](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2003-0543) and [CAN-2003-0544](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2003-0544) to this issue.  [[CAN-2003-0543](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2003-0543) is the fix that prevents the tag from overflowing an int.  [CAN-2003-0544](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2003-0544) is the fix that decrements the number of characters which can be read when the final long form octet is read. Without this it can read one character past end of buffer whenever the long form is used.]  NISCC testing of implementations of the SSL protocol uncovered an additional bug in OpenSSL 0.9.7. Certain ASN.1 encodings that are rejected as invalid by the parser can trigger a bug in deallocation of a structure, leading to a double free. A remote attacker could trigger this bug by sending a carefully-crafted SSL client certificate to an application. It may be possible for an attacker to exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CAN-2003-0545](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2003-0545) to this issue.  This will be RHSA-2003:293   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=104893#c2)  Mark J. Cox    2003-10-02 08:05:42 UTC  ``` The errata  <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2003-293.html>  was released shortly after 1200UTC on 30th September.  Making this bug public.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=104893#c3)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-05-15 11:02:46 UTC  ``` More details from the CERT VU#935264, OpenSSL "secadv_20030930.txt" upstream advisory (<http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/935264>,            <http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20030930.txt>)  advisory for the CAN/CVE-2003-0545 issue:  <cite>  1. Certain ASN.1 encodings that are rejected as invalid by the parser can trigger a bug in the deallocation of the corresponding data structure, corrupting the stack. This can be used as a denial of service attack. It is currently unknown whether this can be exploited to run malicious code. This issue does not affect OpenSSL 0.9.6.  </cite>  The [CAN-2003-0545](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2003-0545) (currently known as [CVE-2003-0545](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2003-0545)) issue does NOT affect the versions of the openssl096 package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1, 3, and 4.   ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## History

The CERT Division is the birthplace of cybersecurity. For nearly 30 years, the CERT Division of the SEI has partnered with government, industry, law enforcement, and academia to advance cybersecurity and improve the security and resilience of computer systems and networks.

Originally focused on incident response, we have expanded into cybersecurity areas such as network situational awareness, malicious code analysis, secure coding, resilience management, insider threats, digital investigations and intelligence, workforce development, DevOps, forensics, software assurance, vulnerability discovery and analysis, and risk management.

## Former Director Richard Pethia

[Richard Pethia](/about/leadership/display.cfm?customel_datapageid_2623=3545) was founding director of the SEI's CERT Division. Pethia, who served as director of CERT from 1988 to 2016, guided the organization through tremendous growth and change. Under Pethia's leadership, the unit expanded and evolved from the CERT Coordination Center—a small group focused on computer incident response—to a research organization of more than 200 professionals dedicated to solving problems with widespread cybersecurity implications.
