Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2003-0787:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) code of the Portable OpenSSH server. Specifically, there are multiple vulnerabilities within the new PAM code introduced in versions 3.7p1 and 3.7.1p1. One of these vulnerabilities is remotely exploitable under specific conditions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The primary weakness is a stack corruption issue in the PAM conversion stack within the Portable OpenSSH server. This issue was introduced with the new PAM code.
- There are "multiple vulnerabilities" in the PAM code, though only one is explicitly mentioned as remotely exploitable.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The impact of this vulnerability is not fully known but it may potentially lead to:
    - Privilege escalation.
    - Denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is remotely exploitable under a specific, non-standard configuration of the OpenSSH server, particularly when privilege separation (privsep) is disabled.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to connect to the vulnerable OpenSSH server over the network and exploit the PAM stack corruption.
- The attacker also needs to target a server where privsep is disabled which would represent a non-standard configuration.

**Additional Details:**
- OpenSSH versions 3.7p1 and 3.7.1p1 are affected.
- OpenBSD-specific releases are not affected by this issue, as they do not contain the vulnerable PAM code.
- Older versions of portable OpenSSH are also not vulnerable.
- The issue is resolved in Portable OpenSSH version 3.7.1p2.
- As a mitigation, disabling PAM support by setting "UsePAM no" in `sshd_config` can be implemented.
