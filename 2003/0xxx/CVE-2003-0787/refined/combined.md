Subject: Portable OpenSSH Security Advisory: sshpam.adv
This document can be found at: http://www.openssh.com/txt/sshpam.adv
1. Versions affected:
Portable OpenSSH versions 3.7p1 and 3.7.1p1 contain multiple
vulnerabilities in the new PAM code. At least one of these bugs
is remotely exploitable (under a non-standard configuration,
with privsep disabled).
The OpenBSD releases of OpenSSH do not contain this code and
are not vulnerable. Older versions of portable OpenSSH are not
vulnerable.
2. Solution:
Upgrade to Portable OpenSSH 3.7.1p2 or disable PAM
support ("UsePam no" in sshd\_config).
Due to complexity, inconsistencies in the specification and
differences between vendors' PAM implementations we recommend
that PAM be left disabled in sshd\_config unless there is a need
for its use. Sites only using public key or simple password
authentication usually have little need to enable PAM support.
