Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in how FreeRADIUS versions up to 0.9.2 handle the "Tunnel-Password" attribute and other string attributes with tags in RADIUS packets. Specifically, a malformed attribute can cause `memcpy` to be called with a negative length argument.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Negative Length Argument in memcpy:** The core vulnerability is that when parsing a RADIUS attribute of type string with a tag, the code decrements the length of the attribute multiple times without proper bounds checking. This can lead to a negative length value being passed as an argument to `memcpy`, which will cause a crash.
*   **Heap Overflow (Potential):**  The `memcpy` operation copies data from a RADIUS packet to a structure on the heap. When a negative length is passed to memcpy, it effectively copies data from the packet to the heap, over-writing allocated memory on the heap.  If the attacker provides a large enough packet this could overwrite other parts of the heap and possibly lead to code execution.
*   **NULL Pointer Dereference:** Specifically for the `Tunnel-Password` attribute, an Access-Request packet containing this attribute could also cause the server to immediately crash due to dereferencing a NULL pointer.
*   **Lack of RADIUS Packet Signature:** The RADIUS protocol doesn't enforce packet signatures, so an attacker can spoof the source IP address of a NAS and send malicious packets to the RADIUS server. This is described as a design flaw in the RADIUS protocol.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The most immediate impact is that a crafted packet can cause the `radiusd` daemon to crash, resulting in a denial of service.
*   **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** While not explicitly proven, the heap overflow caused by the negative length in `memcpy` could potentially be leveraged to execute arbitrary code.  The overwrite of malloc's internal pointers, on certain systems, makes this more likely.
* **Information Leakage:** Copying arbitrary data from the network into heap memory could lead to the leak of heap data to a sufficiently determined attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network-based:** The attack is launched by sending a specially crafted RADIUS packet to the server.
*   **Spoofed Source IP:** The attacker can spoof the source IP address of a legitimate Network Access Server (NAS).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send UDP packets to the RADIUS server.
*   **No NAS Secret Required:** The attacker doesn't need to know the shared secret between the NAS and the RADIUS server since the source IP can be spoofed.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   The vulnerability is not limited to just the `Tunnel-Password` attribute. It affects any string type attribute with a tag.
*   The fix was made available in CVS shortly after being reported.
*   The initial report of the vulnerability was made to the `freeradius-users` mailing list, instead of the `freeradius-devel` mailing list or security contact.
*   The maintainers of FreeRADIUS do not respond well to "blackmail" and made their own announcement of the vulnerability in response to threats of public disclosure without prior coordination.

**In summary,** this CVE describes a vulnerability in FreeRADIUS where a specially crafted RADIUS packet containing a malformed tagged string attribute (specifically Tunnel-Password) can cause a denial of service (crash) due to a negative length argument in `memcpy` leading to a heap overflow or a NULL pointer dereference.
