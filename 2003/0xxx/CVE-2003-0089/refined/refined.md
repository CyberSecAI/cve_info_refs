- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A buffer overflow exists in HP-UX Software Distributor utilities due to a lack of bounds checking when handling the `LANG` environment variable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Local attackers can gain root privileges by overwriting the return address and other data on the stack with malicious code.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by setting the `LANG` environment variable to an overly large string before executing programs like `swinstall` which have the `suid` bit set.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Local access to the system is required to set the environment variable and execute the vulnerable programs.
