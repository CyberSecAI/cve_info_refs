- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `normal_html.cgi` script in Happymall does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing for directory traversal and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Directory Traversal: Attackers can use `..` sequences in the `file` parameter to access files outside of the intended directory.
    - Cross-site scripting (XSS): Attackers can inject malicious scripts into the `file` parameter which will be executed in the victim's browser.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Directory Traversal: Attackers can read arbitrary files on the server.
    - XSS: Attackers can steal cookies and other sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors:** HTTP GET requests to `normal_html.cgi` with a modified `file` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server, no special position is needed.
