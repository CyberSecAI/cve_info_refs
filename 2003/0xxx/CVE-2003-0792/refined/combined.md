# Fetchmail 6.2.5 fixes a remote DoS — GLSA **200403-10**

Fetchmail versions 6.2.4 and earlier can be crashed by sending a
specially-crafted email to a fetchmail user.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-mail/fetchmail** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **6.2.4** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **6.2.5** |

### Background

Fetchmail is a utility that retrieves and forwards mail from remote systems
using IMAP, POP, and other protocols.

### Description

Fetchmail versions 6.2.4 and earlier can be crashed by sending a
specially-crafted email to a fetchmail user. This problem occurs because
Fetchmail does not properly allocate memory for long lines in an incoming
email.

### Impact

Fetchmail users who receive a malicious email may have their fetchmail
program crash.

### Workaround

While a workaround is not currently known for this issue, all users are advised to upgrade to the latest version of fetchmail.

### Resolution

Fetchmail users should upgrade to version 6.2.5 or later:

```
 # emerge sync
 # emerge -pv ">=net-mail/fetchmail-6.2.5"
 # emerge ">=net-mail/fetchmail-6.2.5"
```
