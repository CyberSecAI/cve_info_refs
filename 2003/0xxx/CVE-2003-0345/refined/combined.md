## Microsoft Windows fails to properly validate buffer size of incoming SMB packets

#### Vulnerability Note VU#337764

Original Release Date: 2003-10-10 | Last Revised: 2003-10-10

---

### Overview

Microsoft's implementation of Server Message Block (SMB) contains a buffer overflow vulnerability that could permit a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service.

### Description

| SMB and the Common Internet File System (CIFS) are closely related protocols used sharing data and resources between computers. [According to Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/mind/1196/cifs.asp), "CIFS is an enhanced version of Microsoft's open, cross-platform Server Message Block (SMB) protocol."  Windows uses this protocol to share files, printers, serial ports, and to communicate between computers using named pipes and mail slots.  Microsoft's implementation of SMB does not properly validate the size of incoming SMB packets. An remote attacker with valid credentials on the server could use this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service on a vulnerable system. For more information ,see [Microsoft Security Bulletin MS03-024](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS03-024.asp). |
| --- |

### Impact

| An authenticated remote attacker may be able to exploit this vulnerability to run arbitrary code on the system or cause a denial of service with the privileges of the vulnerable service. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Apply a patch from Microsoft as described in [Microsoft Security Bulletin MS03-024](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS03-024.asp). |
| --- |

| If a patch can't be applied, or as a workaround until a patch can be applied, you can block ports TCP/139 and TCP/445 and UDP/139 and UDP/445 at your network perimeter. This will still leave you exposed to attacks inside your network. Additionally, you may wish to block these ports using a host-based firewall, such as Microsoft's Internet Connection Firewall ([ICF](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/home/using/howto/homenet/icf.asp)) or a similar product available from a number of vendors. |

### General Information

## Technical details

**Technical description:**

Subsequent to the original release of this bulletin Microsoft extended the support of Windows NT Workstation 4.0 and Windows 2000 Service Pack 2. The existing Windows NT 4.0 Server security update will install successfully on Windows NT 4.0 Workstation and is officially supported on that operating system version. A security update is now available from Microsoft Product Support Services for customers running Windows 2000 Service Pack 2. Contact [Microsoft Product Support Services](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;en-us;cntactms) to obtain the Windows 2000 Service Pack 2 security update

Server Message Block (SMB) is the Internet Standard protocol that Windows uses to share files, printers, serial ports, and to communicate between computers using named pipes and mail slots. In a networked environment, servers make file systems and resources available to clients. Clients make SMB requests for resources, and servers make SMB responses in what's described as a client server request-response protocol.

A flaw exists in the way that the server validates the parameters of an SMB packet. When a client system sends an SMB packet to the server system, it includes specific parameters that provide the server with a set of "instructions." In this case, the server is not properly validating the buffer length established by the packet. If the client specifies a buffer length that is less than what is needed, it can cause the buffer to be overrun.

By sending a specially crafted SMB packet request, an attacker could cause a buffer overrun to occur. If exploited, this could lead to data corruption, system failure, or-in the worst case-it could allow an attacker to run the code of their choice. An attacker would need a valid user account and would need to be authenticated by the server to exploit this flaw.

**Mitigating factors:**

* Windows Server 2003 is not affected by this vulnerability.
* By default, it is not possible to exploit this flaw anonymously. The attacker would have to be authenticated by the server prior to attempting to send a SMB packet to it.
* Blocking port 139/445 at the firewall will prevent the possibility of an attack from the Internet.

**Severity Rating:**

The above [assessment](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21140) is based on the types of systems affected by the vulnerability, their typical deployment patterns, and the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would have on them.

**Vulnerability identifier:** [CAN-2003-0345](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=can-2003-0345)

**Tested Versions:**

Microsoft tested Windows NT Workstation 4.0, Windows NT Server 4.0, Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Services Edition, Windows 2000, Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 to assess whether they are affected by this vulnerability. Previous versions are no longer [supported](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742), and may or may not be affected by these vulnerabilities.

## Frequently asked questions

**Why has Microsoft updated this bulletin?**

Subsequent to the original release of this bulletin Microsoft extended the support of Windows NT Workstation 4.0 and Windows 2000 Service Pack 2. The existing Windows NT 4.0 Server security update will install successfully on Windows NT 4.0 Workstation and is officially supported on that operating system version. A security update is now available from Microsoft Product Support Services for customers running Windows 2000 Service Pack 2. Contact [Microsoft Product Support Services](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;en-us;cntactms) to obtain the Windows 2000 Service Pack 2 security update.

**What's the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a [buffer overrun](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/glossary) vulnerability that could lead to data corruption, system failure or allow an attacker to run the code of their choice.
To successfully exploit this flaw, an attacker would have to first be authenticated by the server. By default, it is not possible to exploit this flaw anonymously.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability results because of insufficient validation by the system of the buffer size for certain incoming SMB packets. SMB is a client to server based protocol and when the client system sends an SMB command to the server, it should validate the parameters set in the packet and respond accordingly.
In the case of this flaw, the recipient system doesn't validate the buffer size necessary before responding. This could cause a buffer overrun which could lead to data corruption, system failure or allow an attacker to run the code of their choice.

**What is SMB?**

SMB (Server Message Block)-and its follow-on, [Common Internet File System](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/aa302188.aspx) (CIFS)-is the Internet Standard protocol that Windows uses to share files, printers, serial ports, and also to communicate between computers using named pipes and mail slots. In a networked environment, servers make file systems and resources available to clients. Clients make SMB requests for resources and servers make SMB responses in what is described as a client server, request-response protocol.

**Does this vulnerability affect CIFS as well?**

Common Internet File System (CIFS) is an Internet Standard protocol. The vulnerability described here resides specifically in Microsoft's implementation of the protocol and not the protocol itself.

**What's wrong with Microsoft's implementation of the protocol?**

There is a flaw in the way that the server validates the parameters of an SMB packet. When a client system sends an SMB packet to the server system, it includes specific parameters that provide the server with a set of "instructions." In this case, the server does not properly validate the buffer length established by the packet. If the client specifies a buffer length less than what is needed, it can cause the buffer to be overrun. This could result in random data being written to memory, which could cause data corruption or system failure, or it could also allow an attacker to run the code of their choice.

**What could this vulnerability enable an attacker to do?**

If an attacker were able to successfully exploit this vulnerability, they could cause random areas of memory to be overwritten. The resulting effect of this could be data corruption, system failure or allow an attacker to run the code of their choice.

**What sort of data would be corrupted?**

Essentially, any data in memory could be randomly overwritten. In the worst case, system memory could be overwritten causing the server to fail.

**How could an attacker exploit this vulnerability?**

An attacker could seek to exploit this vulnerability by creating a specifically malformed SMB packet and sending it to the server. The attacker would first require a valid user name and password to be authenticated by the server. By default, there is no means to anonymously exploit this vulnerability.

**What does the patch do?**

The patch eliminates the vulnerability by implementing proper validation of the parameters set on SMB packets.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
