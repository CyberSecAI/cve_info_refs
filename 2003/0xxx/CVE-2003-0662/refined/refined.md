Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2003-0662:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is a buffer overflow within the `RunQuery2` method of the Microsoft Local Troubleshooter ActiveX control (Tshoot.ocx). This occurs when the method is called with a long string as its first parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a classic buffer overflow, where a long string input exceeds the allocated buffer size, leading to memory corruption.
*   **ActiveX Control marked "Safe for Scripting":** The affected ActiveX control is marked as "safe for scripting," allowing it to be loaded and executed within web browsers (like Internet Explorer) without user interaction or warnings, even from the Internet security zone.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of the buffer overflow allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's computer.
*   **Privilege of User:** The attacker's code runs with the same privileges as the logged-on user, giving the attacker the ability to perform actions the user could perform, such as creating, modifying, or deleting data, reconfiguring the system or reformatting the hard disk.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Web-based Attacks:** An attacker can create a malicious web page containing JavaScript that calls the vulnerable ActiveX control with a long string. If a victim visits this page using Internet Explorer, the overflow can be triggered.
*   **HTML Email:** The attacker can embed the malicious HTML into an email. When the victim opens or previews the email, the vulnerability may be triggered.
*  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability can be exploited through XSS attacks by injecting malicious code into a vulnerable web application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to host a web page:** For the web-based attack, the attacker needs a web server to host the malicious HTML page.
*   **Ability to send email:** To exploit via HTML email, the attacker needs to be able to send emails to the target.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick the user into either visiting a malicious web page or opening/previewing a specially crafted email.

**Additional details:**
*   The Microsoft Local Troubleshooter ActiveX control is installed by default on Windows 2000 systems.
*   Microsoft released patch [MS03-042](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS03-042.asp) to fix the issue.
*   The vulnerability affects Windows 2000 (all versions including Service Packs 2, 3, and 4).
*   Windows NT 4.0, Windows Millennium Edition, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 are not affected.
*   The risk of attack from the HTML email vector can be significantly reduced if the patch included with Microsoft Security bulletin [MS03-040](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/ms03-040) has been applied, and if the user uses Internet Explorer 6 or later, and if the user uses the Microsoft Outlook Email Security Update or Microsoft Outlook Express 6.0 and higher, or Microsoft Outlook 2000 or higher in their default configuration.
