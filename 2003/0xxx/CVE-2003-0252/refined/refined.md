Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2003-0252:

**Root Cause:**
- An off-by-one buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `xlog()` function within the `nfs-utils` package. This function handles logging of requests in the `rpc.mountd` daemon.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The `xlog()` function attempts to add a newline character (`\n`) and a null terminator (`\0`) to a log string.
- A miscalculation in the code leads to writing a null byte beyond the allocated buffer. Specifically, if the input string to `xlog()` is 1023 bytes or longer, the null terminator will be written one byte outside of the intended 1024-byte buffer.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code snippet is as follows:
```c
        char            buff[1024];
        ...

        va_start(args, fmt);
        vsnprintf(buff, sizeof (buff), fmt, args);
        va_end(args);
        buff[sizeof (buff) - 1] = 0;

        if ((n = strlen(buff)) > 0 && buff[n-1] != '\n') {
                buff[n++] = '\n'; buff[n++] = '\0';
        }
```
- The code first formats the log message into the `buff` buffer using `vsnprintf`, ensuring null termination.
- It then checks if a newline character is present at the end of the formatted string. If not, it attempts to append a newline and a null terminator.
- The vulnerability lies in the post-increment operations `buff[n++] = '\n'; buff[n++] = '\0';`, as 'n' could already be 1023, and then these operations cause a write out of the allocated buffer

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A local or remote attacker capable of sending RPC requests to the vulnerable `rpc.mountd` daemon can exploit this vulnerability.
- Successful exploitation could potentially lead to:
    - Denial of service (DoS) by crashing the `mountd` daemon.
    - Arbitrary code execution if the overflow can be controlled to overwrite sensitive data or jump to attacker controlled code

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through sending crafted RPC requests to the `rpc.mountd` daemon.
- This could be performed remotely if the service is exposed to the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send RPC requests to the vulnerable `rpc.mountd` daemon. This could be either a local or a remote attacker, as long as network access to the service is available.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Janusz Niewiadomski.
- A fix is included in `nfs-utils` version 1.0.4.
-  StackGuard might not prevent exploitation due to the small overflow size.
- An exploit for this vulnerability is reported to exist in the wild
