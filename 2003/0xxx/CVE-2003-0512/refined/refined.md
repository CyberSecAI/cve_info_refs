Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2003-0512:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Cisco Aironet 1100 Series Access Point fails to provide universal login error messages. This allows an attacker to distinguish between valid and invalid usernames via the different responses received during login attempts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Account Enumeration:** The vulnerability lies in the access point's failure to mask the validity of usernames during the login process. Different error messages or response times for valid and invalid users can be used to enumerate valid accounts through brute-force methods.
- **Lack of Proper Error Handling:** The system does not provide consistent error messages, which makes it possible to discern valid user accounts

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Discovery of Valid Accounts:** A remote attacker can discover valid usernames on the vulnerable access point using brute-force techniques.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** Once valid accounts are discovered, an attacker could potentially attempt password guessing, leading to unauthorized access to the access point's management interface, and potentially the network that it connects to.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Network Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by anyone who can access the access point's login interface.
- **Brute-Force Attacks:** Attackers can use automated tools to send multiple login attempts with different usernames and analyze the responses to determine valid accounts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the Cisco Aironet 1100 series access point.
- **Ability to send login requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send login requests, such as via telnet or other management interfaces.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is specifically in Cisco Aironet AP1100
*   The recommended workaround is to disable Telnet and use SSH. If SSH is not available on the system, using AAA authentication and other user management measures can mitigate the issue
*   The issue was discovered by Reda Zitouni of the Security Watch Team at VIGILANTe.
