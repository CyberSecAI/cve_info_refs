- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Clearswift MAILsweeper product fails to properly detect and block malicious attachments when MIME encapsulation is malformed, specifically when the `MIME-Version` header field is missing.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The product's attachment detection logic relies on strict MIME standards compliance. It does not account for common misinterpretations or deviations from the standard, such as the absence of the `MIME-Version` header.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can bypass attachment filtering by sending malformed MIME attachments. This can allow malicious executables to pass through the email security filter.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited via email.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send emails to a system protected by MAILsweeper and have the knowledge of how to create malformed MIME attachments.
