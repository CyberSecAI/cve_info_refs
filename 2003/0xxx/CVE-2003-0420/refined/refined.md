Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2003-0420

**Description:** The vulnerability lies within the `dsimportexport` tool, where a logged-in user could potentially view the name and password of the account running the tool. This is distinct from the heap buffer overflow in `apr_psprintf()` which is addressed by CVE-2003-0245.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the design or implementation of the `dsimportexport` tool, which allows a logged-in user to view sensitive credentials (username and password) of the account under which it runs. Specifics of how this access is achieved are not described in the provided content.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The core weakness is the exposure of sensitive user credentials, which could be used for further unauthorized access or actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Exposure:** An attacker can gain access to the credentials of the account running the `dsimportexport` tool.
- **Potential for Privilege Escalation:** If the account running the tool has elevated privileges, the attacker could use the compromised credentials to gain access to other parts of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attack requires a logged-in user to be able to access and run `dsimportexport`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be a logged-in user on the system where the vulnerable `dsimportexport` tool is located.

**Additional Details from Content:**
- The vulnerability was addressed in "Security Update 2003-06-12" for Mac OS X Server.
- The `dsimportexport` vulnerability was fixed in conjunction with addressing CVE-2003-0245 (the Apache `apr_psprintf` heap buffer overflow) in the same update.

In summary, CVE-2003-0420 is about an information disclosure vulnerability in the `dsimportexport` tool, allowing local users to view the credentials of the account running the tool. It is separate from the Apache vulnerability described under CVE-2003-0245 but is addressed in the same Apple security update.
