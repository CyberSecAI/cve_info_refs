How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Hash: SHA1

Apache 2.0.46 Released

The Apache Software Foundation and the Apache HTTP Server Project are
pleased to announce the ninth public release of the Apache 2.0
HTTP Server.  This Announcement notes the significant changes in
2.0.46 as compared to 2.0.45.

This version of Apache is principally a security and bug fix release.
A summary of the bug fixes is given at the end of this document.
Of particular note is that 2.0.46 addresses two security
vulnerabilities:

Apache 2.0 versions 2.0.37 through 2.0.45 can be caused to crash in
certain circumstances.  This can be triggered remotely through mod\_dav
and possibly other mechanisms.  The crash was originally reported by
David Endler <DEndler@iDefense.com> and was researched and fixed by
Joe Orton <jorton@redhat.com>.  Specific details and an analysis of the
crash will be published Friday, May 30.  No more specific information
is disclosed at this time, but all Apache 2.0 users are encouraged to
upgrade now.
[<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0245>]

Apache 2.0 versions 2.0.40 through 2.0.45 on Unix platforms were
vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack on the basic authentication
module, which was reported by John Hughes <john.hughes@entegrity.com>.
A bug in the configuration scripts caused the apr\_password\_validate()
function to be thread-unsafe on platforms with crypt\_r(), including
AIX and Linux.  All versions of Apache 2.0 have this thread-safety
problem on platforms with no crypt\_r() and no thread-safe crypt(),
such as Mac OS X and possibly others.  When using a threaded MPM (which
is not the default on these platforms), this allows remote attackers
to create a denial of service which causes valid usernames and
passwords for Basic Authentication to fail until Apache is restarted.
We do not believe this bug could allow unauthorized users to gain
access to protected resources.
[<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0189>]

The Apache Software Foundation would like to thank David Endler
and John Hughes for the responsible reporting of these issues.

This release is compatible with modules compiled for 2.0.42 and later
versions.  We consider this release to be the best version of Apache
available and encourage users of all prior versions to upgrade.

Apache 2.0.46 is available for download from

<http://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi>

Please see the CHANGES\_2.0 file, linked from the above page, for
a full list of changes.

Apache 2.0 offers numerous enhancements, improvements, and performance
boosts over the 1.3 codebase.  For an overview of new features introduced
after 1.3 please see

<http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/new_features_2_0.html>

When upgrading or installing this version of Apache, please keep
in mind the following:

If you intend to use Apache with one of the threaded MPMs, you must
ensure that the modules (and the libraries they depend on) that you
will be using are thread-safe.  Please contact the vendors of these
modules to obtain this information.

Apache 2.0.46 Major changes

Security vulnerabilities closed since Apache 2.0.45

\*) SECURITY [CAN-2003-0245]: Fixed a bug that could be triggered
remotely through mod\_dav and possibly other mechanisms, causing
an Apache child process to crash.  The crash was first reported
by David Endler <DEndler@iDefense.com> and was researched and
fixed by Joe Orton <jorton@redhat.com>.  Details will be released
on 30 May 2003.

\*) SECURITY [CAN-2003-0189]: Fixed a denial-of-service vulnerability
affecting basic authentication on Unix platforms related to
thread-safety in apr\_password\_validate().  The problem was reported
by John Hughes <john.hughes@entegrity.com>

Bugs fixed and features added since Apache 2.0.45

\*) Fix for mod\_dav.  Call the 'can\_be\_activity' callback, if provided,
when a MKACTIVITY request comes in.
[Ben Collins-Sussman <sussman@collab.net>]

\*) Perform run-time query in apxs for apr and apr-util's includes.
[Justin Erenkrantz]

\*) run libtool from the apr install directory (in case that is different
from the apache install directory) [Jeff Trawick]

\*) configure.in: Play nice with libtool-1.5. [Wilfredo Sanchez]

\*) If mod\_mime\_magic does not know the content-type, do not attempt to
guess.  PR 16908.  [Andrew Gapon <agapon@telcordia.com>]

\*) ssl session caching(shmht) : Fix a SEGV problem with SHMHT session
caching. PR 17864.
[Andreas Leimbacher <andreasl67@yahoo.de>, Madhusudan Mathihalli]

\*) Add a delete flag to htpasswd.
[Thom May]

\*) Fix mod\_rewrite's handling of absolute URIs. The escaping routines
now work scheme dependent and the query string will only be
appended if supported by the particular scheme.  [André Malo]

\*) Add another check for already compressed content in mod\_deflate.
PR 19913. [Tsuyoshi SASAMOTO <nazonazo@super.win.ne.jp>]

\*) Fixes for VPATH builds; copying special.mk and any future .mk files
from the source tree as well as the build tree (now creates a usable
configuration for apxs), and eliminated redundant -I'nclude paths.
[William Rowe]

\*) Code fixes, constness corrections and ssl\_toolkit\_compat.h updates
for SSLC and OpenSSL toolkit compatibility.  Still work remains to
be done to cripple features based on the limitations of RSA's binary
distribution of their SSL-C toolkit.
[William Rowe, Madhusudan Mathihalli, Jeff Trawick]

\*) Linux 2.4+: If Apache is started as root and you code
CoreDumpDirectory, coredumps are enabled via the prctl() syscall.
[Greg Ames]

address a security hole in the mod\_dav module that could be exploited
remotely causing an Apache Web server process to crash.  Apache 1.3
is
unaffected and is the primary web server on Mac OS X Server.  Apache
2.0 is installed with Mac OS X Server, but off by default.

dsimportexport:  Fixes CAN-2003-0420 where a logged-in user could
potentially view the name and password of the account running the
dsimportexport tool.

CONECTIVA LINUX SECURITY ANNOUNCEMENT

PACKAGE   : apache
SUMMARY   : Apache 2 vulnerability
DATE      : 2003-06-16 18:27:00
ID        : CLA-2003:661
RELEVANT
RELEASES  : 9

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

DESCRIPTION
Apache[1] is the most popular webserver in use today.

This update addresses two security vulnerabilities which have been
fixed in the recently released[2] 2.0.46 version:

1) CAN-2003-0245[3]
iDefense published[5] an advisory about a vulnerability in the APR
library used by Apache 2. This library contains a vulnerability in
the apr\_psprintf() function which could be used to make apache
reference invalid memory.

The most immediate impact of this vulnerability is a Denial of
Service condition. Arbitrary command execution remains a possibility,
but is deemed to be difficult to achieve outside a controlled
environment.

The packages provided with this update contain a fix for this
vulnerability.

2) CAN-2003-0189[4]
A problem with the build configuration scripts caused the Apache
basic authentication module to not be thread-safe. Systems running a
threaded server would then be vulnerable to a Denial of Service
condition when authenticating users using this module. Apache in
Conectiva Linux 9 is \*not\* vulnerable to this issue because it is not
built with threads support. However, the packages available through
this update have been patched to fix this problem to allow users to
recompile Apache with threads support in the event they choose to do
so.

SOLUTION
It is recommended that all Apache users upgrade their packages.

IMPORTANT: it is necessary to manually restart the httpd server after
upgrading the packages. In order to do this, execute the following as
root:

service apache stop

(wait a few seconds and check with "ps ax|grep httpd" if there are
any httpd processes running. On a busy webserver this could take a
little longer)

service apache start

Note: The following are not vulnerable:
HP OpenVMS
HP NonStop Servers
HP Tru64 UNIX
HP Tru64 OpenVMS

\*\*REVISED 01\*\*
B. Recommended solution
The Apache Software Foundation has released Apache 2.0.46 as
the best known version fixing the potential vulnerabilities
mentioned above.

HP has incorporated Apache 2.0.46 in the following product:

- hp-ux apache-based web server v.1.0.06.01 or later,
available from:
<http://www.software.hp.com/cgi-bin/swdepot_parser.cgi/cgi/>

--->> documentation and depot's available from software.hp.com
--->> Click on "internet ready and networking"
--->> and look for "hp-ux apache-based web server
--->> v.1.0.07.01 for ipv6 powered by apache, tomcat, webmin.

Check for Apache Installation
-----------------------------
To determine if the Apache web server from HP is installed on
your system, use Software Distributor's swlist command.  More
than one version may be present on a single system.

For example, the results of the command
swlist -l product | grep -i apache

HPApache      2.0.39.01.02  HP Apache-based Web Server
hpuxwsAPACHE  A.1.0.05.01   HP-UX Apache-based Web Server

Stop Apache
-----------------------------
Before updating, make sure to stop any previous Apache binary.
Otherwise, the previous binary will continue running,
preventing the new one from starting, although the
installation would be successful.

After determining which Apache is installed, stop Apache with
the following commands:

for HPApache:        /opt/hpapache2/bin/apachectl stop
for hpuxwsAPACHE:    /opt/hpws/apache/bin/apachectl stop

Download and Install Apache
-----------------------------
- Download Apache from Software Depot using the previously
mentioned links.
- Verify successful download by comparing the cksum with the
value specified on the installation web page.
- Use SD to swinstall the depot.
- For customers with HPApache/B9416AA or HPApache/B9416BA
installed, migrate to hpuxwsAPACHE/hpuxwsApache and
remove the affected products from the system.

Installation of this new version of HP Apache over an existing
HP Apache installation is supported, whereas installation over
a non-HP Apache is NOT supported.

Removing Apache Installation
----------------------------
If you prefer to remove Apache from your system rather than
install a newer version to resolve the security problem, use
both Software Distributor's "swremove" command and also
"rm -rf" the home location as specified in the rc.config.d
file "HOME" variables.

To find the files containing HOME variables in the
/etc/rc.config.d directory:

%ls /etc/rc.config.d | grep apache
hpapache2conf
hpws\_apacheconf

Mandrake Linux Security Update Advisory
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Package name:           apache2
Advisory ID:            MDKSA-2003:063-1
Date:                   June 2nd, 2003
Original Advisory Date: May 30th, 2003
Affected versions:9.1
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Problem Description:

Two vulnerabilities were discovered in the Apache web server that
affect all 2.x versions prior to 2.0.46.  The first, discovered by John
Hughes, is a build system problem that allows remote attackers to
prevent access to authenticated content when a threaded server is used.
This only affects versions of Apache compiled with threaded server
"httpd.worker", which is not the default for Mandrake Linux.

The second vulnerability, discovered by iDefense, allows remote
attackers to cause a DoS (Denial of Service) condition and may also
allow the execution of arbitrary code.

The provided packages include back-ported fixes to correct these
vulnerabilities and MandrakeSoft encourages all users to upgrade
immediately.

Update:

The previous update mistakenly listed apache-conf packages which were
never included, nor intended to be included, as part of the update.

To upgrade automatically, use MandrakeUpdate.  The verification of md5
checksums and GPG signatures is performed automatically for you.

If you want to upgrade manually, download the updated package from one
of our FTP server mirrors and upgrade with "rpm -Fvh \*.rpm".  A list of
FTP mirrors can be obtained from:

<http://www.mandrakesecure.net/en/ftp.php>

Please verify the update prior to upgrading to ensure the integrity of
the downloaded package.  You can do this with the command:

Red Hat Security Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated httpd packages fix Apache security vulnerabilities
Advisory ID:       RHSA-2003:186-01
Issue date:        2003-05-28
Updated on:        2003-05-28
Product:           Red Hat Linux
Keywords:          Apache httpd auth remote
Cross references:
Obsoletes:
CVE Names:         CAN-2003-0189 CAN-2003-0245
---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Topic:

Updated httpd packages that fix two security issues are now available for
Red Hat Linux 8.0 and 9.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 8.0 - i386
Red Hat Linux 9 - i386

3. Problem description:

The Apache HTTP server is a powerful, full-featured, efficient, and
freely-available Web server.

A bug in Apache 2.0 through 2.0.45 allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service, and may allow execution of arbitrary code.  This bug
affects both Red Hat Linux 8.0 and 9.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0245 to
this issue.

A build system problem in Apache 2.0 through 2.0.45 allows remote attackers
to cause a denial of access to authenticated content when a threaded
server is used.   This bug affects only Red Hat Linux 9 when the threaded
server "httpd.worker" has been configured, which is not the default.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name CAN-2003-0189 to this issue.

All users of the Apache HTTP Web Server are advised to upgrade to the
applicable errata packages, which contain back-ported fixes correcting
these issues, and applied to Apache version 2.0.40.

After the errata packages are installed, restart the Web service by running
the following command:

/sbin/service httpd restart

Red Hat would like to thank iDefense who initially discovered CAN-2003-0245
and John Hughes for CAN-2003-0189.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (\*.rpm) if your current directory \*only\* contains the
desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

5. Bug IDs fixed (<http://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla> for more info):

88575 - Byte Range implementation fix
89170 - fullstatus segfaults apachectl
89179 - mod\_proxy (forward proxy) inserts empty line before header

6. RPMs required:
