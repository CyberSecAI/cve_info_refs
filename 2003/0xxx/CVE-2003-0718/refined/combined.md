### General Information

## Executive Summary

**Executive Summary:**

This update resolves a newly-discovered, privately reported vulnerability. The vulnerability is documented in the Vulnerability Details section of this bulletin.

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause WebDAV to consume all available memory and CPU time on an affected server. This behavior could cause a denial of service. The IIS service would have to be restarted to restore functionality.

We recommend that customers consider applying the security update.

**Severity Ratings and Vulnerability Identifiers:**

| Vulnerability Identifiers | Impact of Vulnerability | Windows 2000 | Windows XP | Windows Server 2003 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| WebDAV Vulnerability - [CAN-2003-0718](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=can-2003-0718) | Denial of Service | Important | Moderate | Moderate |

This [assessment](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21140) is based on the types of systems that are affected by the vulnerability, their typical deployment patterns, and the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would have on them.

## Frequently asked questions (FAQ) related to this security update

**Does this update contain any other changes to functionality?**

Yes. In addition to the changes that are listed in the Vulnerability Details section of this bulletin the update requires that new limits be applied to the XML documents that WebDAV accepts. Because of this change, valid requests that violate these new limits will be returned as failed requests to the client. You can configure these new limits by using metabase entries. If an application requires documents that would otherwise be rejected, you can adjust the metabase entries to support the required content. The new metabase configurations are documented in Microsoft Knowledge Base article [824151](https://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=824151).

**Is there anything else about this update that I need to be aware of?**

Yes. This update package includes a full upgrade to MSXML 3.0 Service Pack 5. This upgrade was necessary to insure proper functionality after you apply the security update. To minimize the deployment impact, we have included the upgrade in the same package as the security update.

MSXML versions are side-by-side so different major versions of MSXML will not be affected. Some programs may now default to using MSXML 3.0 instead of those other major versions of MSXML especially if no version of MSXML 3.0 was previously installed.

MSXML 3.0 is always present on Windows XP and Windows 2003 systems.

**I am still using Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 2, but extended security update support ended on June 30, 2004. What should I do?**

Windows 2000 Service Pack 2 has reached the end of its life cycle as previously documented, and Microsoft extended this support to June 30, 2004

It should be a priority for customers who have this operating system version to migrate to a supported version to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities. For more information about the Windows Product Life Cycle, visit the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742) Web site. For more information about the extended security update support period for these operating system versions, visit the [Microsoft Product Support Services](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33328) Web site.

**I'm still using Windows XP, but extended security update support ended on September 30th, 2004. However, this bulletin has a security update for this operating system version. Why is that?**

The original version of Windows XP, commonly referred to as Windows XP Gold or Windows XP Release to Manufacturing (RTM) version, reached the end of its extended security update support life cycle on September 30th, 2004. However, the end-of-life occurred very recently. In this case, the majority of the steps that are required to address this vulnerability were completed before this date. Therefore, we have decided to release a security update for this operating system version as part of this security bulletin. We do not anticipate doing this for future vulnerabilities affecting this operating system version, but we reserve the right to produce updates and to make these updates available when necessary. It should be a priority for customers who have this operating system version to migrate to supported operating system versions to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities. For more information about the Windows Service Pack Product Life Cycle, visit the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle Web site](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?pr=lifesupsps). For more information about the Windows Product Life Cycle, visit the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742).

For more information, see the [Windows Operating System FAQ](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33330).

**Can I use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) to determine if this update is required?**

Yes. MBSA will determine if this update is required. For more information about MBSA, visit the [MBSA Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).

It is important to note that, with the inclusion of MSXML 3.0 Service Pack 5 in this update, MBSA will detect both the update that you need for IIS and the need for MSXML 3.0 Service Pack 5, and will report them under separate nodes.

**Note** After April 20, 2004, the Mssecure.xml file that is used by MBSA 1.1.1 and earlier versions is no longer being updated with new security bulletin data. Therefore, scans that are performed after that date with MBSA 1.1.1 or earlier will be incomplete. All users should upgrade to MBSA 1.2 because it provides more accurate security update detection and supports additional products. Users can download MBSA 1.2 from the [MBSA Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134). For more information about MBSA support, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer 1.2 Q&A; Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33332).

**Can I use Systems Management Server (SMS) to determine if this update is required?**

Yes. SMS can help detect and deploy this security update. For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

You can deploy this update using the [Inventory and Software Distribution](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33333) feature of SMS.

## Vulnerability Details

#### WebDAV Vulnerability - CAN-2003-0718:

A [denial of service](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21142) vulnerability exists that could allow an attacker to send a specially crafted WebDAV request to a server that is running IIS and WebDAV. An attacker could cause WebDAV to consume all available memory and CPU time on an affected server. The IIS service would have to be restarted to restore functionality.

#### Mitigating Factors for WebDAV Vulnerability - CAN-2003-0718:

* The vulnerability can only be exploited remotely if an attacker can establish a Web session with an affected server.
* By default, Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, except for Windows Server 2003 Web Server Edition, do not install IIS.
* IIS 5.0, which is included as part of Windows 2000, is the only version that enables WebDAV by default

#### Workarounds for WebDAV Vulnerability - CAN-2003-0718:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified below.

* Disable WebDAV on IIS 5.0 if it is not needed.

#### FAQ for WebDAV Vulnerability - CAN-2003-0718:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a [denial of service](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21142) vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause WebDAV to consume all available memory and CPU time on an affected server. The IIS service would have to be restarted to restore functionality.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

WebDAV does not limit the number of attributes that can be specified per XML-element in WebDAV requests.

**Why does this vulnerability require an upgrade to MSXML 3.0 Service Pack 5, which is included in this security update?**

The Microsoft XML Parser is a core operating system component that applications use to process XML documents. This component is used by WebDAV and by third-party applications. This update is required to allow WebDAV to limit the number of attributes that it can try to process on submitted documents.

**Do I need to install MSXML 3.0 Service Pack 5 separately?**

No. The update package includes both the update for WebDAV and the upgrade files for MSXML 3.0 to upgrade your installation to Service Pack 5.

**What is WebDAV?**

WebDAV is an industry standard extension to the HTTP specification. The âDAVâ in âWebDAVâ stands for âdistributed authoring and versioning.â WebDAV adds a capability for authorized users to remotely add and manage content on a Web server. By default, WebDAV is enabled when IIS is enabled on Windows 2000. By default, WebDAV is not installed on IIS 5.1 or on IIS 6.0.

**What is wrong with the way that WebDAV handles HTTP requests?**

Before the recent update of the XML Parser, MSXML 3.0, WebDAV, or other third-party applications that use the Microsoft XML Parser, could not limit the number of attributes that the Microsoft XML Parser would try to process on submitted documents.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

This is a denial of service vulnerability. An attacker could cause a disruption of normal services. Restarting the affected service restores normal functionality to the server. However, the service remains susceptible to a new denial of service attack until the update is applied.

**Who could exploit the vulnerability?**

Any user who could deliver a WebDAV request to an affected Web server could exploit the vulnerability. Because WebDAV requests travel over the same port as HTTP (typically port 80), an attacker who could establish a connection to an affected Web server could try to exploit the vulnerability

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have to send a specially-crafted HTTP messages to an affected Web site that could increase the CPU utilization on the IIS server to 100% while IIS was processing the message. The more XML attributes contained per XML element in the XML message, the longer the IIS server would take to process the XML message. This could cause a denial of service while IIS is processing the messages and the service would have to be restarted to restore functionality to the server.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Servers that are running both IIS and WebDAV services are primarily at risk from this vulnerability.

**Could the vulnerability be exploited over the Internet?**

Yes. An attacker may be able to exploit this vulnerability over the Internet. Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect against attacks that originate from the Internet. Microsoft has provided information on how you can help protect your PC. End users can visit the [Protect Your PC Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21169). IT Professionals can visit the [Security Center Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21171).

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by updating WebDAV to use the new XML parser properties to limit the number of XML attributes per element in the XML documents it accepts in WebDAV-based requests.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information indicating that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**Notes** The Windows XP and Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003 versions of this security update are packaged as dual-mode packages, which contain files for both the original version of Windows XP and Windows XP Service Pack 1 (SP1). For more information about dual-mode packages, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [328848](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?kbid=328848).

When you install the Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003 security update, the installer checks to see if any of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix. If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR files to your system. For more information, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [824994](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?kbid=824994).

**Verifying Update Installation**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update is installed on an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. This tool allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results pane**, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name box**, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying the update installation. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry keys.

  For Windows XP Home Edition, Windows XP Professional, Windows XP Home Edition Service Pack 1, Windows XP Professional Service Pack 1, Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Service Pack 1, Windows XP Tablet PC Edition, and Windows XP Media Center Edition:

  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows XP\SP2\KB824151\Filelist

**Software Update Services:**

By using Microsoft Software Update Services (SUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates to Windows 2000 and Windows Server 2003-based servers, and to desktop systems that are running Windows 2000 Professional or Windows XP Professional.

For more information about how to deploy this security update with Software Update Services, visit the [Software Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21133).

**Systems Management Server:**

Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) delivers a highly-configurable enterprise solution for managing updates. By using SMS, administrators can identify Windows-based systems that require security updates and to perform controlled deployment of these updates throughout the enterprise with minimal disruption to end users. For more information about how administrators can use SMS 2003 to deploy security updates, see the [SMS 2003 Security Patch Management Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=22939). SMS 2.0 users can also use [Software Updates Service Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33340) to help deploy security updates. For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

**Note** SMS uses the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer and the Microsoft Office Detection Tool to provide broad support for security bulletin update detection and deployment. Some software updates may not be detected by these tools. Administrators can use the inventory capabilities of the SMS in these cases to target updates to specific systems. For more information about this procedure, see the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33341). Some security updates require administrative rights following a restart of the system. Administrators can use the Elevated Rights Deployment Tool (available in the [**SMS 2003 Administration Feature Pack**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33387) and in the [**SMS 2.0 Administration Feature Pack**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21161)) to install these updates.

-----[ IIS 5.x/6.0 WebDAV (XML parser) attribute blowup DoS
--------------------------------------------------------------------

--[ Author: Amit Klein

--[ Release Date: October 12, 2004

--[ Products:

Microsoft IIS/5.0 (Windows/2000)
Microsoft IIS/5.1 (Windows XP)
Microsoft IIS/6.0 (Windows/2003)

--[ Severity: High

--[ Description

An attacker can craft a malicious WebDAV PROPFIND request, which
uses XML attributes in a way that inflicts a denial of service
condition on the target machine (IIS web server).
The result of this attack is that the XML parser consumes all the
CPU resources for a long period of time (from seconds to minutes,
depending on the size of the payload). In our experiments, we were
able to send attacks (of few hunderd KBs) that caused the target
machines to consume 100% CPU for several minutes.

--[ Solution

Microsoft security bulletin MS04-030 (October 12th, 2004)
<http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS04-030.mspx>

--[ Acknowledgements
To Ory Segal (Watchfire), for the his help with applying this
attack to IIS.
