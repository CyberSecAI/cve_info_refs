Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2003-0718:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the way WebDAV handles XML messages. Specifically, the Microsoft XML Parser (MSXML) did not limit the number of attributes that could be specified per XML element within WebDAV requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unrestricted XML Attribute Processing**: The core weakness is that the XML parser did not enforce a limit on the number of attributes within an XML element, making it possible to create excessively large XML structures.
- **Denial of Service (DoS)**: This lack of limitation could be exploited to cause a denial of service condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Resource Exhaustion:** An attacker exploiting this vulnerability can cause the WebDAV service to consume all available memory and CPU time on the affected server.
- **Service Disruption:** The server becomes unresponsive, requiring the IIS service to be restarted to restore functionality.
- **Prolonged CPU Usage:** Malicious requests can cause 100% CPU usage for an extended period (seconds to minutes) depending on the size of the payload.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **WebDAV Requests:** The attack vector involves sending a specially crafted WebDAV `PROPFIND` request containing an XML payload with an excessive number of attributes per element.
- **Network Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely if the attacker can establish a Web session with the affected server, typically over port 80 (HTTP).
- **Internet Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited over the internet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs the ability to send WebDAV requests to an affected server. This typically means having network connectivity to the server on port 80.
- **Crafting Malicious Requests**: The attacker needs the capability to create a malicious WebDAV request that contains XML with an excessive number of attributes per element.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was reported privately, and Microsoft released a security update to address it.
- The fix involves updating WebDAV to limit the number of XML attributes it processes by leveraging new capabilities of MSXML. This update includes a full upgrade to MSXML 3.0 Service Pack 5.
- The security update also introduces new limits that can be configured via metabase entries, which may affect some valid WebDAV requests that have many attributes.
- The vulnerability affects Internet Information Services (IIS) versions 5.0, 5.1 and 6.0.
- By default, Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 do not have IIS installed. IIS 5.0 has WebDAV enabled by default.
