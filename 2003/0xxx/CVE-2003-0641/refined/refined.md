The provided content describes two vulnerabilities in WatchGuard's ServerLock for Windows 2000, which allow attackers to bypass its protection mechanisms:

**Vulnerability 1: Arbitrary Module Loading via Runtime Process Infection**

*   **Root Cause:** ServerLock trusts protected executable files, assuming attackers cannot modify their code. However, attackers can use `OpenProcess()` to access a protected process and then inject a malicious DLL using `CreateRemoteThread()`. This injected DLL can then call `ZwSetSystemInformation()` to load an arbitrary kernel driver.
*   **Weakness:** The vulnerability stems from the flawed assumption that trusted processes cannot be manipulated at runtime.
*  **Attack Vector:** The attack involves the following steps:
    1. An attacker gains sufficient privileges to use `OpenProcess()`, `CreateRemoteThread()`, `VirtualAllocEx()`, and `WriteProcessMemory()`.
    2. The attacker uses these functions to inject a malicious DLL into a protected (trusted) process.
    3. The malicious DLL executes within the trusted process context.
    4. The DLL uses `ZwSetSystemInformation()` to load a malicious kernel driver (rootkit) from the filesystem.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the system by loading and executing a malicious kernel module.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs sufficient privileges to open processes, inject DLLs and write to memory.

**Vulnerability 2: Improper Handling of Symbolic Links to \Device\PhysicalMemory**

*   **Root Cause:** ServerLock attempts to restrict access to `\Device\PhysicalMemory` to prevent direct kernel memory access. However, attackers can create symbolic links to this device and bypass the restriction by accessing the physical memory via the created symlinks.
*   **Weakness:** ServerLock does not properly handle symbolic links to `\Device\PhysicalMemory`, allowing access through the created links.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attack involves creating symbolic links to `\Device\PhysicalMemory` and then accessing physical memory through these links.
*   **Impact:** Complete system compromise by gaining arbitrary read/write access to kernel memory. This allows for the loading of rootkits and backdoors.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs the ability to create symbolic links.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The report mentions that the vendor released ServerLock 2.0.3 to address the first bug and 2.0.4 to address both bugs.
*   ServerLock 2.0.4 also restricts `OpenProcess()`.
