```
Root cause of vulnerability: A flaw in the way Apache handles SSL/TLS renegotiation in combination with the `SSLCipherSuite` directive.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- The server could use a weak cipher suite instead of the strong one that was intended.
- This could lead to the use of weaker encryption than configured, which is a security vulnerability.

Impact of exploitation:
- Compromise of data confidentiality. An attacker may be able to eavesdrop on or manipulate encrypted communications.
- Downgrade attack, forcing the use of insecure ciphers.

Attack vectors:
- Specific sequences of per-directory renegotiations.
- The `SSLCipherSuite` directive was used to upgrade from a weak cipher suite to a stronger one.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker would need to trigger the specific conditions where the renegotiation leads to using the weak ciphersuite.
- The attacker would need to be in a position to intercept the network traffic.
