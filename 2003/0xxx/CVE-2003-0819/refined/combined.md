### General Information

## Technical Details

**Technical description:**

A security vulnerability exists in the H.323 filter for Microsoft Internet Security and Acceleration Server 2000 that could allow an attacker to overflow a buffer in the Microsoft Firewall Service in Microsoft Internet Security and Acceleration Server 2000. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could try to run code of their choice in the security context of the Microsoft Firewall Service. This would give the attacker complete control over the system. The H.323 filter is enabled by default on servers running ISA Server 2000 computers that are installed in integrated or firewall mode.

**Mitigating factors:**

* Users can prevent the risk of attack by disabling the H.323 filter
* ISA Servers running in cache mode are not vulnerable because the Microsoft Firewall Service is disabled by default

**Severity Rating:**

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Microsoft Internet Security and Acceleration Server 2000** | Critical |

The above [assessment](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21140) is based on the types of systems that are affected by the vulnerability, their typical deployment patterns, and the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would have on them.

**Vulnerability identifier:** [CAN-2003-0819](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=can-2003-0819)

## Workarounds

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. These workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability however they help block known attack vectors. Workarounds may cause a reduction in functionality in some cases - in such situations this is identified below.

* **Disable the H.323 filter.**

  To disable the H.323 filter, follow these steps:

  1. Open ISA management tool. Expand the **Extensions** container, expand the **Application Filters** container.
  2. Select the **H.323 Filter** and then click **Disable**.
  3. **Restart** the Microsoft Firewall Service Windows Components.

  **Impact of workaround:**

  If the H.323 filter is disabled, H.323 traffic is blocked by the Microsoft Firewall Service. This stops any applications that use the H.323 protocol for Internet Protocol (IP) telephony or data collaboration from communicating through the ISA Sever. If H.323 traffic is not on the network with the ISA Server, disabling this filter and other unused filters is recommended for enhanced security and performance.
* **Block TCP port 1720 at a perimeter or gateway router.**

  By default the H.323 filter listens on external Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) port 1720. Blocking this port at a perimeter router will help to protect the ISA Server from an Internet-based attack.

  **Note:** Clicking to clear the **Allow Incoming Calls** check box on the **Call Control** tab of the H.323 filter settings does not configure the filter to stop listening on the external TCP port 1720 and is not an effective workaround. This behavior has been changed in this Security Update and is documented additionally in the "Frequently Asked Questions" section of this security bulletin.

  **Impact of workaround:**

  If port 1720 traffic is blocked, applications that use the H.323 protocol for IP telephony or data collaboration can no longer be able to communicate over the Internet.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a [buffer overflow](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21141) vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause code to run in the security context of the Microsoft Firewall Service on ISA Server 2000. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could also gain complete control over the system.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability results because of the way that the H.323 filter checks the boundaries on specially crafted H.323 traffic.

**What is the H.323 Filter?**

The H.323 filter is an application filter that ISA Server 2000 uses to monitor and control traffic using H.323 and T.120 protocols. The H.323 protocol is used in IP telephony applications to transfer audio and video communications. The T.120 protocol is used in IP telephony applications to transfer data such as whiteboard, file transfer, or remote desktop data. The H.323 filter is enabled by default on ISA Server 2000.

**What is the Microsoft Firewall Service?**

ISA Server's Microsoft Firewall Service allows Internet applications to perform as if they were directly connected to the Internet. These services redirect the necessary communications functions to an ISA Server, establishing a communication path from the internal application to the Internet through the server computer.
The service eliminates the need for a specific gateway for each protocol, such as Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), Telnet, File Transfer Protocol (FTP), or H.323 protocol.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause code to run in the security context of the Microsoft Firewall Service on ISA Server 2000. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain complete control over the system.

**Does this update contain any other security changes?**

Yes. The update also corrects an issue with the **Call Control** tab of the H.323 filter setting. Before this update if you clicked to clear the **Allow Incoming Calls** check box in the **Call Control** tab of the H.323 filter settings, the filter would not be configured to stop listening on the external TCP port 1720. This update corrects this problem. After the update, clicking to select this option correctly configures the filter to stop listening on the external TCP port 1720. The Microsoft Firewall Service must be restarted for this setting to take effect.
If the network that the H.323 filter is helping to protect intends to use only outgoing H.323 traffic, it is recommended that you disable **Allow Incoming Calls** to enhance security.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that the H.323 filter validates H.323 traffic.

**I have installed the H.323 Gatekeeper Service. Is the H.323 Gatekeeper Service vulnerable?**

No. The H.323 Gatekeeper Service does not contain the vulnerability that is associated with this update. However, if the H.323 Gatekeeper Service has been installed on the system, an updated version of **gksvc.dll** will be installed with this update. The H.323 Gatekeeper Service is not installed by default.

**If I install the H.323 Gatekeeper Service after I apply this update, do I need to re-apply the update?**

Yes. If setup components are re-installed, all updates should be re-applied.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Multiple vulnerabilities in H.323 implementations

#### Vulnerability Note VU#749342

Original Release Date: 2004-01-13 | Last Revised: 2009-07-29

---

### Overview

A number of vulnerabilities have been discovered in various implementations of the multimedia telephony protocols H.323 and H.225. Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) and video conferencing equpiment and software can use these protocols to interoperate over a variety of computer networks. The majority of the vulnerabilities discovered are limited to denial of service impacts; however, several may allow unauthorized code execution.

### Description

| The U.K. National Infrastructure Security Co-ordination Center (NISCC) has reported multiple vulnerabilities in different vendor implementations of the multimedia telephony protocols H.323 and H.225. H.323 and H.225 are international standard protocols, published by the International Telecommunications Union, used to facilitate communication among telephony and multimedia systems. An example of such a system includes VoIP or video-conferencing equipment and software deployed on a network or computer. Sending an exceptional ASN.1 element to a vulnerable telephony component that cannot handle it may cause the application or system behavior to become unpredictable.  A test suite developed by NISCC has exposed vulnerabilities in a variety of H.323/H.225 implementations. While most of these vulnerabilities exist in ASN.1 parsing routines, some vulnerabilities may occur elsewhere. Due to the general lack of specific vulnerability information, this document covers multiple vulnerabilities in different H.323/H.225 implementations. Information about individual vendors is available in the [Systems Affected](#systems) section.The U.K. National Infrastructure Security Co-ordination Centre is tracking this vulnerability as [NISCC/006489/H.323](http://www.uniras.gov.uk/vuls/2004/006489/h323.htm). |
| --- |

### Impact

| The impacts associated with these vulnerabilities include denial of service, and potential execution of arbitrary code. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Patch or Upgrade**Apply a patch or upgrade as appropriate. Information about specific vendors is available in the Systems Affected section of this document. |
| --- |

| One potential workaround includes making sure ports 1720/tcp and 1720/udp are blocked on network perimeters. |

vulnerabilities in several implementations of the H.323
protocol.

The potential vulnerabilities may be exploited to produce a
denial of service (DoS) attack. Such an attack may cause an
affected product to failover or crash and failover. Due to
its robust design OCMC will recover from most attack scenarios.
In the event that OCMC does not recover, the attack can be
stopped by blocking the offending IP address. Attacks may also
be blocked by creating an access list to restrict TCP port 1720
traffic to known, trusted IP addresses.

RESOLUTION:

HP will be providing patches to the impacted versions of OCMC:

 OCMC v1.2 released January 2004
 OCMC v1.1 patch 46
 OCMC v1.1 patch 37

This bulletin will be revised as the patches become available
and patches will be available from the normal HP Services
support channel.

Please write to security-alert@hp.com to request a PGP signed

Mitel Networks Security Advisory MNSA-2004-001: Vulnerability Reports in
H.323 Implementations

   Synopsis:    Interim Statement About Vulnerability Reports in H.323
                Implementations

   Advisory:           MNSA-2004-001

   Release Date:       2004-01-16
   Last Revised:       2004-01-16

   Severity:           Important

   Impact:             See below

   Affected Products:  See below

1. SUMMARY

   On Tuesday, January 13th, advisories were issued by the
   UK National Infrastructure Security Co-Ordination Centre and
   the CERT Coordination Center about potential vulnerabilities
   in multiple implementations of the H.323 protocol used for
   some Voice-over-IP and videoconferencing products.  Exploitation
   of these vulnerabilities could potentially result in a denial-of-
   service attack or remote code execution.

   At the current time Mitel Networks has determined that all of
   its VoIP products are NOT vulnerable as they do not make use
   of the H.323 protocol.

   However, we are still investigating whether or not a potential
   vulnerability exists with the following videoconferencing products:

     \* 5700 Voice First Solution
     \* 5750 Desktop Video Appliance
     \* 5760 Videoconference Appliance

   This advisory will be updated when the results of that investigation
   are complete.

2. RECOMMENDATION

   Until the investigation can be completed Mitel Networks recommends
   that administrators of sites with the 5700 Voice First Solution
   follow the workaround suggested in the CERT advisory of applying
   network filters to block access to H.323 services at network borders
   to minimize any potential denial-of-service attacks originating
   outside your network.  Please see the CERT advisory (URL below) for
   more information.

3. DESCRIPTION

   No vulnerability has yet been identified.  If a vulnerability is
   found, the description will appear here.

4. AFFECTED PRODUCTS

   As noted above, the only Mitel Networks products still under
   investigation are:

     \* 5700 Voice First Solution
     \* 5750 Desktop Video Appliance
     \* 5760 Videoconference Appliance

   It is important to note that no vulnerability has yet been found
   in these products and they are still under active investigation.
