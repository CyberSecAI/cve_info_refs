- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from several flaws in how OpenCA handles PKCS#7 signatures and certificate chain verification. Specifically, the `crypto-utils.lib` library incorrectly extracts the signer's certificate from the PKCS#7 structure, leading to the use of a random certificate from the chain instead of the correct one. Additionally, regular expression errors in `OpenCA::PKCS7` module cause issues during parsing the certificate chain.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    1. **Incorrect certificate extraction:** The `crypto-utils.lib` uses all certificates included in the signature to create the X.509 object of the signer's certificate, resulting in an arbitrary certificate being selected from the chain.
    2. **Regular expression errors:**
        -  A wrong regular expression is used to detect non-certificate lines during parsing in `OpenCA::PKCS7`.
        -  The serial number in the certificate chain is parsed with a regular expression that ignores uppercase letters A-F.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Due to the flaws, OpenCA might accept revoked or expired certificates, compromising the security of digital signatures used to secure approved requests or role-based access control (RBAC). This could lead to unauthorized access or the acceptance of invalid requests.
- **Attack vectors:** By creating a malicious PKCS#7 signature with a specially crafted certificate chain, an attacker could bypass the signature verification process.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be able to create or manipulate PKCS#7 signatures used within the OpenCA system.
