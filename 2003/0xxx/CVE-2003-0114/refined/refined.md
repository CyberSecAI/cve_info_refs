Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2003-0114:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how the Internet Explorer file upload control handles input. Specifically, an attacker can supply a file name to the control via script, causing it to automatically upload a file from the user's system without user interaction. This occurs because an unchecked parameter in the file upload control allows input from the attacker.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper Input Validation: The file upload control lacks proper validation of input parameters, allowing for arbitrary file paths to be supplied through script.
- Lack of User Interaction: The vulnerability allows for a file upload to occur without any explicit action or consent from the user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: A successful exploit allows an attacker to upload files from the victim's computer to a remote server controlled by the attacker.
- Potential Data Loss: Sensitive files could be exfiltrated from the victim's machine.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious Web Page: An attacker hosts a specially crafted web page that leverages the file upload control vulnerability.
- User Lure: The attacker must entice a user to visit the malicious web page to trigger the exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Remote Server: The attacker must have a web server under their control to host the malicious page and receive the uploaded file.
- Path and Filename Knowledge: The attacker must know the full path and file name of the target file on the victim's computer.
- No File-in-Use: The file to be uploaded must not be in use by the user or the operating system.

**Additional Details from the Analysis:**
- The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" in terms of severity.
- The vulnerability affects Internet Explorer versions 5.01, 5.5, and 6.0.
- A patch is available that addresses this vulnerability by preventing input to the file upload control from a website.
- The attacker needs to lure a user to visit the malicious web site.
- The vulnerability is identified as CAN-2003-0114.
