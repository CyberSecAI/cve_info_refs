Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities found in Sun-ONE Application Server 7.0 for Windows, as described in the advisory:

**Issue 1: JSP source code disclosure**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a case-sensitive check for ".jsp" file extensions when processing requests on a Windows system which has a case-insensitive file system.
*   **Vulnerability:** When a request with a case-altered extension like ".JSP" is sent, the server bypasses the JSP engine check (since the check is case-sensitive) but the Windows filesystem retrieves the file anyway (as it is case-insensitive), returning the raw JSP source code instead of executing it.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can obtain the source code of JSP applications, potentially exposing sensitive logic, database credentials, and other confidential information.
*   **Attack Vector:** By sending an HTTP request to a JSP file with a case-altered extension (e.g., .JSP instead of .jsp).
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires the ability to send HTTP requests to the target server.

**Issue 2: Log evasion**

*   **Root Cause:** The server logs only the first 4042 characters of a request URI, while the maximum URI length is 4096 characters, creating a gap where information will not be logged.
*   **Vulnerability:** By crafting a request URI with more than 4042 characters but less than 4096, an attacker can obscure part of their request from the logs, allowing them to hide parts of an attack. While the server warns about the buffer overflow, the file accessed is not logged.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can conceal their actions, making it harder for administrators to detect and analyze attacks, identify compromised files, or understand which parameters were being used.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending an HTTP request with a URI exceeding 4042 characters.
*  **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires the ability to send HTTP requests to the target server.

**Issue 3: Cross-site scripting**

*   **Root Cause:**  The server does not properly sanitize user input within error messages generated when an application error occurs while processing a Java application.
*   **Vulnerability:** If an error occurs while processing a Java application, an attacker can inject malicious script code into the query string. The error message generated by the server will include this unsanitized input, resulting in the execution of the injected script in the victim's browser (cross-site scripting).
*   **Impact:** Attackers can perform various malicious actions, such as stealing cookies, redirecting users, or defacing websites.
*   **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious scripts into the query string of an HTTP request, targeting an application that could generate an error message.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires the ability to send HTTP requests to the target server.

**Issue 4: Incorrect local file permissions and plaintext passwords**

*   **Root Cause:**  The default installation directory has insufficient permissions, and the statefile contains sensitive information in plain text.
*   **Vulnerability:** The default installation directory (C:\sun) has world-readable permissions allowing any user to access files. The "statefile" within this directory contains plaintext administrative server usernames and passwords.
*  **Impact:**  Local users can gain access to the administrative password, potentially leading to full compromise of the application server
*   **Attack Vector:** Accessing the vulnerable file system and reading the statefile.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires local access to the serverâ€™s file system.
