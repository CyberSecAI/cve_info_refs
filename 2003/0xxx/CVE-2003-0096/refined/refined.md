Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2003-0096

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the `TZ_OFFSET` function of Oracle Database.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Remotely exploitable buffer overflow in the `TZ_OFFSET` function.
- Insufficient bounds checking when handling the time zone name, allowing a long string to overwrite the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Overwriting a saved return address on the stack of the Oracle process.
- Execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the Oracle service (typically "Oracle" on Linux/Unix and "Local System" on Windows).
- Complete compromise of the data stored in the database.
- Potential compromise of the operating system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending a crafted SQL query containing an overly long character string as the time zone name to the `TZ_OFFSET` function.
- The `TZ_OFFSET` function is executable by `PUBLIC` by default, meaning any database user can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Access to the Oracle database server with a valid user ID and password.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Oracle9i Database Release 2, 9i Release 1, 8i, 8.1.7, and 8.0.6 on all platforms.
- The vulnerability was reported to Oracle on September 30, 2002.
- A patch was made available by Oracle.
- This vulnerability is similar to other buffer overflows found in Oracle functions like `TO_TIMESTAMP_TZ` and `BFILENAME`.
