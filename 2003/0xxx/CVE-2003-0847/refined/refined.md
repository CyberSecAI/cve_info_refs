- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A symlink vulnerability exists in the shell script `/sbin/conf.d/SuSEconfig.susewm`, line 86, within the `susewm` package.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The script uses `$r/tmp/susewm.$$` which is vulnerable to symlink attacks. By creating a symlink to a target file, an attacker can trick the script into modifying or overwriting arbitrary files.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local user can gain root privileges by exploiting this vulnerability.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by a local attacker.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to create symlinks and execute the vulnerable script, which is part of the `susewm` package.
