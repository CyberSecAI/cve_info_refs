## Network device drivers reuse old frame buffer data to pad packets

#### Vulnerability Note VU#412115

Original Release Date: 2003-01-06 | Last Revised: 2013-09-03

---

### Overview

Many network device drivers reuse old frame buffer data to pad packets, resulting in an information leakage vulnerability that may allow remote attackers to harvest sensitive information from affected devices.

### Description

| The Ethernet standard (IEEE 802.3) specifies a minimum data field size of 46 bytes. If a higher layer protocol such as IP provides packet data that is smaller than 46 bytes, the device driver must fill the remainder of the data field with a "pad". For IP datagrams, [RFC1042](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1042.txt) specifies that "the data field should be padded (with octets of zero) to meet the IEEE 802 minimum frame size requirements."  Researchers from @Stake have discovered that, contrary to the recommendations of RFC1042, many Ethernet device drivers fail to pad frames with null bytes. Instead, these device drivers reuse previously transmitted frame data to pad frames smaller than 46 bytes. This constitutes an information leakage vulnerability that may allow remote attackers to harvest potentially sensitive information. Depending upon the implementation of an affected device driver, the leaked information may originate from dynamic kernel memory, from static system memory allocated to the device driver, or from a hardware buffer located on the network interface card. For detailed information on this research, please read @Stake's "EtherLeak: Ethernet frame padding information leakage", available at<http://www.atstake.com/research/advisories/2003/atstake_etherleak_report.pdf>This vulnerability may also affect link layer networking protocols other than Ethernet. |
| --- |

### Impact

| This vulnerability allows remote attackers to harvest potentially sensitive information from network traffic. In some network environments, this vulnerability can also be used to circumvent technologies that divide networks into separate domains, such as VLANs and routers. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply a patch from your vendor**For vendor-specific information regarding vulnerability status and patch availability, please consult the Systems Affected section of this document |
| --- |

| **Use encryption to protect sensitive data**  By using encryption to protect network traffic, vulnerable sites can greatly reduce the impact of this vulnerability. Affected device drivers will still leak information, but fragments of encrypted information will be useless to attackers. Note that this workaround will not protect sensitive information leaked from non-network sources such as kernel memory. |

### [National Semiconductor Corporation](#JPLA-5HUS7R) Not Affected

Notified:  January 09, 2003  Updated: January 16, 2003

**Statement Date:   January 09, 2003**

### Status

Not Affected

### Vendor Statement

National Semiconductor manufactures a number of Ethernet controller chips, both for 100 Mbps and Gigabit Ethernet. Specifically these chips are used by our customers to create Ethernet adapter and LAN on Motherboard (LOM) products. In addition some of the MAC controller cores are integrated into other silicon products National produces. The base product line is as follows:

DP83815100 Mbps Ethernet MAC/PHY
DP83816100 Mbps Ethernet MAC/PHY
DP838201000 Mbps Ethernet MAC

We have evaluated our MAC cores to determine their vulnerability to the issue that your report raised. We have found that our products properly pad short frames with 00's. However we did find that it is possible that from 1 - 7 bytes following the end of actual frame data may contain byte data from that same frame. All bytes following this alignment padding, however, will be 00's. Because the non-zero data comes from the same frame, this does not represent a security problem. Future Ethernet MAC products from National Semiconductor will not duplicate data and will 00 out all padding on short frames.

This e-mail's purpose is to clear several issues surrounding the
Etherleak paper:

- Who is Vulnerable?
- Why this vulnerability is so wide spread?
- Why the examples are only with Linux device drivers?
- Why we have contacted CERT?
- Are Device Drivers under Microsoft-based OSs are vulnerable?
- How can you test your network card and device driver?
- Why is this better then a sniffer?
- Why the vulnerability is important?

Who is vulnerable?
------------------
Josh Anderson and I tested several Ethernet cards and device drivers.

We have found several device drivers which are vulnerable but we never
attempted to find them all. It is simply because there are too many.
Therefore we have contacted CERT more than 6 months ago and sent them
the Etherleak paper and asked them to contact OS manufactures, Network
device manufactures, Chipset manufactures, motherboard manufactures and
other manufactures and vendors who might need to check their device
driver's implementations.

In our tests we have experienced this bug under 4 different operating
systems:

- Linux
- NetBSD
- FreeBSD
- Microsoft Windows

One of the Ethernet cards and device drivers we have tested was a Compaq
PCMCIA Ethernet card under Windows 2000 (with the latest SP at the time)
which demonstrated the vulnerability (among other Ethernet cards which
have demonstrated the vulnerability under Microsoft Windows 2000).

It is clear to us that device drivers under the various Microsoft
operating systems are vulnerable.

Microsoft's statement to CERT:
"Microsoft does not ship any drivers that contain the vulnerability.
However, we have found samples in our documentation that, when compiled
without alteration, could yield a driver that could contain this issue.
We have made corrections to the samples in our documentation, and will
include tests for this issue in our certification process."

If you read the statement carefully you can understand that there are
OTHER manufactures which have built device drivers for their networking
equipment that are based on Microsoft's documentation and therefore
MIGHT BE VULNERABLE.

Microsoft does not make vulnerable device drivers BUT Microsoft's sample
code was vulnerable and therefore Microsoft has added a test to the
device driver's certification test which will test for the bug. The
situation is that CURRENT Microsoft certified device drivers MIGHT BE
VULNERABLE.

Different vendors were contacted by CERT more than 6 months ago and had
an enormous amount of time to fix this issue before it went public. The
authors did not receive a list of vendors who were notified by CERT. The
authors were aware that Microsoft was one of the vendors who were
contacted and notified regarding this vulnerability.

The examples in the paper are given from the Linux operating system
because it helps to illustrate the problem.

Why this vulnerability is so wide spread?
-----------------------------------------
Some networking gear manufactures choose to purchase (in some cases)
chipsets from a chipset manufacture rather then developing their own (or
using their own). Therefore you might find networking cards from one
vendor with chipsets of another chipset manufacture (for example some
low-end SMC cards are using RealTek chipsets). Some other manufactures
are embedding networking cards with their products (such as motherboards
with LAN). To minimize the cost, sometimes, low-end chipsets, which many
of whom have vulnerable device drivers on different operating system,
are used (some vulnerable device drivers are even shipped with some
cards...).

How can you test your network card and device driver?
-----------------------------------------------------
You need to send packets which are less than 46 data bytes long (the
minimum packet size) to examine if you experience this vulnerability
with your Ethernet card and device driver. Any packet less than 46 data
bytes long would do the trick but we have found the following examples
helpful:

- An ICMP Echo request packet with 1 data byte in its payload (total of
29
  bytes). The rest - 17 data bytes will be filled with information (you
can
  see for yourself in the paper we have written what kind of information
it
  will be) if your Ethernet card's device driver is vulnerable.

- You can also use Raw Packets and then have 28 data bytes as room for
  padded data.

Why is this better then a sniffer? or Why is this bug important?
----------------------------------------------------------------
First Example:
You can extract information that you will never be able to see on a
switched environment.

A Second Exmaple:
In some cases you will be able to extract information directly from a
Router on your LAN (try this with a Linux or a NetBSD machine acting as
a router with vulnerable Ethernet cards (and their device drivers) and
see for yourself how easily information is being gleaned) or from
another networking equipment on your LAN.

A Third Example:
Another example might be a corporate network (just think about the
scenario of a nice flat switched network).

There are special instances were the padded information might cross
layer 2 boundaries, but they are very unique in nature and depend on
many factors.

Combining the information is not a trivial task for script kiddies. If
you are experienced with networking and seen and analyzed network
traffic in the past you will be able to understand what are the portions
of information you are absorbing (see the examples in the paper).

In our tests we were able to extract pop3 passwords, other clear text
passwords, cookies, and other interesting pieces of information.

We hope this email will help the community and more people to understand
why this bug class is important and problematic.

We urge people to read the paper before they cry wolf...

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2015

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2015

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore *strongly* recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes *without* delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 169 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that a blog entry summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at <https://blogs.oracle.com/security>.

Please note that on October 16, 2014, Oracle released information for  [CVE-2014-3566 "POODLE"](/security-alerts/poodlecve-2014-3566.html) .Customers of affected Oracle products are strongly advised to apply the fixes and/or configuration steps that were announced for CVE-2014-3566 in addition to the fixes announced in this CPU.

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available at:  [https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in  [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is available  [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2015verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](//cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same**CVE#** in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see  [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the only variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review  [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update January 2015 Availability Document,  [My Oracle Support Note 1942215.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1942215.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/) . We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in  [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1) .Please review the  [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available to customers who have Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/) . Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download patches released through the Critical Patch Update program for products in the Extended Support Phase.

1. This fix also addresses CVE-2014-0050. The CVSS score is taken from  [http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2013-2186](//web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2013-2186).

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 19 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. 14 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found  [here](https:///security-alerts/cpujan2015verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Partial" instead of "Complete", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 10.0 becomes 7.5.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 7 and 8 releases.

[My Oracle Support Note 360870.1](https:///https%3A//support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=360870.1) explains the impact of Java security vulnerabilities on Oracle products that include an Oracle Java SE JDK or JRE.
