  "CVE-2003-0001": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "Multiple network device drivers reuse old frame buffer data to pad packets, resulting in an information leakage vulnerability that may allow remote attackers to harvest sensitive information from affected devices.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "Many Ethernet device drivers fail to pad frames with null bytes, instead reusing previously transmitted frame data.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Information Leakage",
        "Improper padding of network frames"
      ],
      "impact": "Remote attackers can harvest sensitive information from network traffic. This could include kernel memory, static system memory, or hardware buffer data. The vulnerability can also bypass network segmentation technologies like VLANs and routers.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Sending specially crafted packets smaller than 46 bytes to trigger the driver to use old frame buffer data as padding."
      ],
       "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the target device. No prior authentication or specific privileges are needed to exploit this issue."
