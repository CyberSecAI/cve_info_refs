- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A race condition exists in the way Qt libraries handle temporary files, specifically the creation of the `.qt` directory and `qt_plugins_3.0rc` and `qt_plugins_3.0rc.lock` files within `/tmp` on Knoppix 3.1. The directory and files are created with root ownership but are located in the world-writable `/tmp` directory.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - **Race condition:** An attacker can exploit the time between the creation of the directory and files and the time they are used.
    - **Insecure temporary file handling:**  The reliance on `/tmp` for these files exposes them to manipulation.
    - **World writable /tmp directory**:  This allows any user to create/modify files and directories in `/tmp`.
    - **Symlink vulnerability:** An attacker can create a symbolic link to replace the intended temporary files.

- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can overwrite arbitrary files on the system, leading to system instability or failure.
    - **Potential Root Compromise**: While the provided message does not explicitly detail how to obtain root access it mentions it is possible.

- **Attack vectors**:
    - Local access: An attacker needs to have a user account or some method to execute commands as an unprivileged user. 
    - The provided example uses a malicious `~/.bash_profile` on a Knoppix user. This script creates a symlink in /tmp before the KDM service starts, forcing it to overwrite a target file when it tries to use the qt files.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker must have a user account on the system, specifically an account that gets logged into through SSH before KDM is started.
    - The attacker must be able to create files in the user's home directory.
    -  The attacker must be able to predict and exploit the race condition, by having a script run during the boot process.
