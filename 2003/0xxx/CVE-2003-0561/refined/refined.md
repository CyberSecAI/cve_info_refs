The provided content describes multiple buffer overflows in IglooFTP PRO, which aligns with the nature of a CVE.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient bounds checking when handling input in several FTP commands (FTP banner, USER, PASS, and ACCT). The application copies data into fixed-size buffers without ensuring the input does not exceed the buffer's capacity.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Buffer overflows in multiple areas related to FTP commands:
  - FTP Banner
  - USER command
  - PASS command
  - ACCT command
- Lack of input validation allows an attacker to send more data than the allocated buffer size.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution by overwriting the return address on the stack.
- An attacker can control program execution by injecting shell code.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious FTP server can be set up to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker crafts a malicious response with an overly long banner, username, password or account string, which is then sent to the vulnerable IglooFTP PRO client.
- The malicious string includes padding, EBP overwrite, EIP overwrite to point to shellcode, and the shellcode itself.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to control the FTP server that the victim's IglooFTP PRO client connects to.
- The attacker needs to craft malicious FTP responses containing a long string and injected code.
