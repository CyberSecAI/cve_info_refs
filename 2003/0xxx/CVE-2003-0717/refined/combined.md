## Buffer overflow in Microsoft Messenger Service

#### Vulnerability Note VU#575892

Original Release Date: 2003-10-16 | Last Revised: 2003-10-16

---

### Overview

There is a buffer overflow in the Microsoft Windows Messenger service that could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on most recent versions of Microsoft Windows.

### Description

| There is a buffer overflow vulnerability in the Microsoft Windows Messenger service. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with System privileges. Microsoft recommends immediately disabling the Messenger service and evaluating the need for the patch. For more information, see [Microsoft Security Bulletin MS03-043](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/treeview/default.asp?url=/technet/security/bulletin/MS03-043.asp). This vulnerability affects virtually all recent versions of Windows with the exception of Microsoft Windows Millennium Edition. On Windows Server 2003, the Messenger service is disabled by default; however, if it is enabled the server is vulnerable to compromise. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker can run arbitrary code with Local System privileges. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Disable the Windows messenger service and evaluate the need to apply the patch. to disable the Messenger service, follow these steps as provided by Microsoft:   1. *Click* ***Start*** *, and then click* ***Control Panel*** *(or point to* ***Settings*** *, and then click* ***Control Panel*** *).* 2. *Double-click* ***Administrative Tools*** *.* 3. *Double-click* ***Services*** *.* 4. *Double-click* ***Messenger*** *.* 5. *In the* ***Startup type*** *list, click* ***Disabled*** *.* 6. *Click* ***Stop*** *, and then click* ***OK*** *.*  ***Impact of Workaround:*** *If the Messenger service is disabled, messages from the Alerter service (for example notifications from your backup software or Uninterruptible Power Supply) are not transmitted. If the Messenger service is disabled, any services that explicitly depend on the Messenger service do not start, and an error message is logged in the System event log.* The image below illustrates this procedure on Microsoft Windows XP. It will appear different on different versions of Windows. You should carefully consider the impact of disabling the Messenger service. |
| --- |

| As a general rule, and as a partial workaround to this problem, block ports 137 through 139 and UDP broadcast packets at your network perimeter and/or at the host level. This will limit the ability of external attackers to reach vulnerable systems. |

### General Information

## Technical Details

**Technical Description:**

Subsequent to the release of this bulletin, it was determined that the update for Windows XP did not properly place the updated file wkssvc.dll into the %systemroot%\system32\dllcache. This problem is unrelated to the security vulnerability discussed in this bulletin. Microsoft recommends that customers who have previously applied the security update reinstall the latest version to insure that their system remains protected in the event that the wkssvc.dll is ever deleted or becomes corrupt. More information on this is available in the FAQ section of this bulletin.

Microsoft re-issued this bulletin on October 29, 2003 to advise on the availability of an updated Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 patch. This revised patch corrects the Debug Programs (SeDebugPrivilege) user right issue that some customers experienced with the original patch that is discussed in Knowledge Base Article [830846](https://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=830846). This problem is unrelated to the security vulnerability discussed in this bulletin. If you have previously applied this security patch, this update does not need to be installed.

A security vulnerability exists in the Messenger Service that could allow arbitrary code execution on an affected system. The vulnerability results because the Messenger Service does not properly validate the length of a message before passing it to the allocated buffer.

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could be able to run code with Local System privileges on an affected system, or could cause the Messenger Service to fail. The attacker could then take any action on the system, including installing programs, viewing, changing or deleting data, or creating new accounts with full privileges.

**Mitigating factors:**

* Messages are delivered to the Messenger service via NetBIOS or RPC. If users have blocked the NetBIOS ports (ports 137-139) - and UDP broadcast packets using a firewall, others will not be able to send messages to them on those ports. Most firewalls, including Internet Connection Firewall in Windows XP, block NetBIOS by default.
* Disabling the Messenger Service will prevent the possibility of attack.
* On Windows Server 2003 systems, the Messenger Service is disabled by default.

**Severity Rating:**

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Windows NT** | Critical |
| **Windows Server NT 4.0 Terminal Server Edition** | Critical |
| **Windows 2000** | Critical |
| **Windows XP** | Critical |
| **Windows Server 2003** | Moderate |

The above [assessment](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21140) is based on the types of systems affected by the vulnerability, their typical deployment patterns, and the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would have on them.

**Vulnerability identifier:** [CAN-2003-0717](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=can-2003-0717)

## Workarounds

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. These workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability however they help block **known** attack vectors. Workarounds may cause a reduction in functionality in some cases - in such situations this is identified below.

* **Use a personal firewall such as** [**Internet Connection Firewall**](https://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/networking/security/winfirewall.mspx) **(only available on XP and Windows Server 2003).**

  If you are using the Internet Connection Firewall in Windows XP or Windows Server 2003 to protect your Internet connection, it will by default block inbound RPC traffic from the Internet.

  To enable Internet Connection Firewall feature using the Network Setup Wizard:

  1. Run the Network Setup Wizard. To access this wizard, point to **Control Panel**, double-click **Network and Internet Connections**, and then click **Setup or change your home or small office network**.
  2. The Internet Connection Firewall is enabled when you choose a configuration in the wizard that indicates that your computer is connected directly to the Internet.

  To configure Internet Connection Firewall manually for a connection:

  1. In Control Panel, double-click **Networking and Internet Connections**, and then click **Network Connections.**
  2. Right-click the connection on which you would like to enable ICF, and then click **Properties**.
  3. On the **Advanced** tab, click the box to select the option to **Protect my computer or network**.
  4. If you want to enable the use of some applications and services through the firewall, you need to enable them by clicking the **Settings** button, and then selecting the programs, protocols, and services to be enabled for the ICF configuration.
* **Disable the Messenger Service**

  Disabling the messenger service will prevent the possibility of an attack. You can disable the messenger service by performing the following:

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel** (or point to **Settings**, and then click **Control Panel**).
  2. Double-click **Administrative Tools**.
  3. Double-click **Services**.
  4. Double-click **Messenger**.
  5. In the **Startup type** list, click **Disabled**.
  6. Click **Stop**, and then click **OK**.

**Impact of Workaround:** If the Messenger service is disabled, messages from the Alerter service (for example notifications from your backup software or Uninterruptible Power Supply) are not transmitted. If the Messenger service is disabled, any services that explicitly depend on the Messenger service do not start, and an error message is logged in the System event log.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Why is Microsoft reissuing this security update?**

Subsequent to the release of this bulletin, it was determined that the update for Windows XP did not properly place the updated file wkssvc.dll into the %systemroot%\system32\dllcache. This problem is unrelated to the security vulnerability discussed in this bulletin. Microsoft recommends that customers who have previously applied the security update reinstall the latest version to insure that their system remains protected in the event that the wkssvc.dll is ever deleted or becomes corrupt.

**What version of Windows does this update apply to?**

The only version of Windows affected by this specific issue is Windows XP.

**What is the %systemroot%\system32\dllcache?**

The %systemroot%\system32\dllcache or "dll cache", is used by the Windows File Protection Feature which prevents programs from replacing critical Windows system files. If a critical Windows system file is deleted or becomes corrupt, the system replaces the file with a correct version from the "dll cache".

**What is the Windows File Protection Feature?**

Windows File Protection (WFP) prevents programs from replacing critical Windows system files. Programs must not overwrite these files because they are used by the operating system and by other programs. Protecting these files prevents problems with programs and the operating system.
WFP protects critical system files that are installed as part of Windows (for example, files with a .dll, .exe, .ocx, and .sys extension and some True Type fonts). WFP uses the file signatures and catalog files that are generated by code signing to verify if protected system files are the correct Microsoft versions. For more information on WFP and how it works, see Microsoft Knowledge Base article [https://support.microsoft.com?kbid=222193](https://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=222193)

**What are the ramifications of not having the updated version of wkssvc.dll copied to the dll cache?**

If the updated version of the file wkssvc.dll (or any critical Windows system files) is not copied into the dll cache at the same time as the security update is applied to the system, the system is still protected from the vulnerability.
However, if that file is ever deleted or becomes corrupt, WFP will seek to replace the deleted or corrupt file with the version currently available in the dll cache. In this case, the version of wkssvc.dll available would be older than the version which corrects the security vulnerability described in this bulletin. The effect of this would be that the system is returned to an insecure state, and the security update would need to be reinstalled.

**If the wkssvc.dll file is inadvertently reverted to the version available prior to this update, will Windows Update notice that my system is no longer protected, and prompt me to install this critical update again?**

Yes. Windows Update will recognize that the file version now residing on the system is not the most current version, and you will be prompted to reinstall the security update.

**I don't use Windows Update. If the wkssvc.dll file was inadvertently reverted to the version available prior to this update, would I be able to manually reinstall the update?**

Yes. The installer technology used by Microsoft will detect that the file version now residing on the system is not the most current version, and you will be able to successfully reinstall the security update.

**Even with the original version of the wkssvc.dll-- .1301--, am I still secure?**

Yes, the original version of wkssvc.dll will protect you unless it gets corrupted and is replaced with an unpatched version of the file from the dll cache, as described above.

**Will the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) detect that I have the older version of wkssvc.dll installed on my Windows XP system?**

Yes. The Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) will detect that the version of the wkssvc.dll file on the system is not the most current version, and prompt you to reinstall the updated version.

**MBSA is showing me as insecure even though the older version of the wkssvc.dll does protect me. How can I make MBSA stop showing me as unpatched?**

The only way to prevent MBSA from showing the system as unprotected is to reinstall MS03-043.

**I'm not sure which version of the wkssvc.dll I need to have installed on my Windows XP system in order to receive the security update, and be confident that the wkssvc.dll file also was copied into the dll cache. Which version do I need?**

If you are running Windows XP, the correct version of the wkssvc.dll file which is also copied into the dll cache is 5.1.2600.1309. If you still have the version ending in .1301, you should reinstall the security update.

**Why has Microsoft reissued this bulletin?**

Subsequent to the release of this bulletin and the associated patches, a problem was identified with the Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 versions of the patch. This problem is unrelated to the security vulnerability discussed in this bulletin. If you have previously applied this security patch, this update does not need to be installed.
Microsoft has corrected this problem and re-issued this bulletin on October 29th, 2003 to advise on the availability of an updated Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 patch. This revised patch corrects the Debug Programs (SeDebugPrivilege) user right issue that some customers experienced with the original patch that is discussed in Knowledge Base Article [830846](https://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=830846). If you have previously applied this security patch, this update does not need to be installed.

**What's the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a [buffer overrun](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/glossary) vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could be able to run code with Local System privileges on an affected system, or could cause the Messenger Service to fail. The attacker could then be able to take any action on the system, including installing programs, viewing, changing or deleting data, or creating new accounts with full privileges.

**What is the Windows Messenger Service?**

The Messenger service is a Windows service that transmits **net send** messages and messages that are sent through the Alerter service between client computers and servers. For example, the Messenger service can be used by network administrators to send administrative alerts to network users. The Messenger service can also be used by Windows and other software programs. For example, Windows may use it to inform you when a print job is completed or when you lose power to your computer and switch to a Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS). The Messenger service is not related to your Web browser, e-mail program, Windows Messenger, or MSN Messenger.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability results because of an unchecked buffer in the Messenger Service. If exploited, an attacker could gain Local System privileges on an affected system, or cause the service to fail.

**Is the Messenger Service the same thing as Windows Messenger or MSN Messenger?**

No. It's important to note that the Messenger Service is not the same thing as Windows Messenger or MSN Messenger. Windows Messenger ([https://messenger.microsoft.com](https://messenger.microsoft.com/)) and MSN Messenger ([https://messenger.msn.com](https://messenger.msn.com/)) are instant messaging services that allow users to converse, share pictures, video, etc. In contrast, the Messenger service ([https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=KB;EN-US;168893&](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;168893&)) is a simple text-only broadcast service that's typically used by administrators to send alerts to users, and warn them of pending outages, server maintenance, etc.

**What's wrong with the Messenger Service?**

The vulnerability results because the Messenger Service does not properly validate the length of a message before passing it to the allocated buffer.

**What could this vulnerability enable an attacker to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could be able to run code with Local System privileges on an affected system, or could cause the Messenger Service to fail. The attacker could then take any action on the system, including installing programs, viewing, changing or deleting data, or creating new accounts with full privileges.

**How could an attacker exploit this vulnerability?**

An attacker could seek to exploit this vulnerability by creating a specially crafted message and sending it to the Messenger Service on an affected system.

**What does the patch do?**

The patch eliminates the vulnerability by insuring that the Messenger Service properly validates the length of a message before passing it to the allocated buffer.

## History

The CERT Division is the birthplace of cybersecurity. For nearly 30 years, the CERT Division of the SEI has partnered with government, industry, law enforcement, and academia to advance cybersecurity and improve the security and resilience of computer systems and networks.

Originally focused on incident response, we have expanded into cybersecurity areas such as network situational awareness, malicious code analysis, secure coding, resilience management, insider threats, digital investigations and intelligence, workforce development, DevOps, forensics, software assurance, vulnerability discovery and analysis, and risk management.

## Former Director Richard Pethia

[Richard Pethia](/about/leadership/display.cfm?customel_datapageid_2623=3545) was founding director of the SEI's CERT Division. Pethia, who served as director of CERT from 1988 to 2016, guided the organization through tremendous growth and change. Under Pethia's leadership, the unit expanded and evolved from the CERT Coordination Center—a small group focused on computer incident response—to a research organization of more than 200 professionals dedicated to solving problems with widespread cybersecurity implications.

/*

DoS Proof of Concept for MS03-043 - exploitation shouldn't be too hard.
Launching it one or two times against the target should make the machine
reboot. Tested against a Win2K SP4.

"The vulnerability results because the Messenger Service does not properly
validate the length of a message before passing it to the allocated buffer"
according to MS bulletin. Digging into it a bit more, we find that when a
character 0x14 in encountered in the 'body' part of the message, it is replaced
by a CR+LF. The buffer allocated for this operation is twice the size of the
string, which is the way to go, but is then copied to a buffer which was only
allocated 11CAh bytes. Thanks to that, we can bypass the length checks and
overflow the fixed size buffer.

Credits go to LSD :)
