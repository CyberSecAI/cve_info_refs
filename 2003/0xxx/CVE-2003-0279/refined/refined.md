- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Web_Links module in PHP-Nuke does not sanitize numeric input in SQL queries, allowing for SQL injection. Specifically, the lack of inverted commas around numeric values in queries allows a malicious user to inject SQL code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection vulnerability in the Web_Links module, affecting multiple numeric values used in SQL queries. The vulnerability is present in versions 6.x (including 6.5) and 5.x.
- **Impact of exploitation:** With the use of `UNION` statements in the SQL injection, attackers can extract information such as passwords and personal data from the database. Without `UNION`, they can still manipulate hit counts and vote data in the `web links` tables.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting malicious requests to the vulnerable `Web_Links` module, attackers can inject SQL code into the `cid` parameter as seen in the provided example.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attackers must be able to send requests to a vulnerable PHP-Nuke installation.
