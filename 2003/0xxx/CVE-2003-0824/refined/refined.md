Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2003-0824:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies within the SmartHTML interpreter, a sub-component of Microsoft FrontPage Server Extensions (FPSE). A specially crafted request sent to the SmartHTML interpreter can cause it to enter an infinite loop.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The SmartHTML interpreter fails to properly handle specific types of requests, leading to a loop that consumes excessive processing power.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service:** Successful exploitation results in the server temporarily becoming unresponsive, interrupting normal operations. The server's CPU is fully utilized, preventing it from performing other tasks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is conducted remotely by sending a specially crafted request to the vulnerable server via the network. The attacker connects to the FrontPage Server Extensions service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Unauthenticated Access:** An attacker does not need any specific credentials to exploit this vulnerability. They only require the ability to send requests to the server running the vulnerable FrontPage Server Extensions.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in the SmartHTML interpreter, which is used to support dynamic web content in FPSE.
*   Microsoft Security Bulletin MS03-051 addresses this vulnerability.
*   The fix involves the SmartHTML interpreter properly validating incoming requests and discarding invalid ones, preventing the infinite loop.
*  The vulnerability was assigned the identifier CAN-2003-0824
*  This vulnerability is separate from a buffer overflow vulnerability (CAN-2003-0822) also addressed in the same Microsoft bulletin.
*  The vulnerability is present in multiple versions of Microsoft FrontPage Server Extensions, impacting various versions of Windows and Office products.
