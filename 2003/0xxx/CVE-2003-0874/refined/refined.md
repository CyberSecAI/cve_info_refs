Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is inadequate filtering of user-provided data in the DeskPRO application. This lack of sanitization allows remote attackers to inject malicious SQL statements into existing SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Multiple SQL Injection vulnerabilities exist across different pages within the application.
- Specifically, user inputs to `faq.php`, `view.php`, and the login page are not properly sanitized.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database.
- A remote attacker can log in as an administrator without knowing the password.
- Attackers can potentially modify data, inject malicious content, or take control of the system/database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP requests to the vulnerable pages, by injecting malicious SQL code in user-supplied parameters.
- Specifically, the following parameters are vulnerable: `cat` and `article` in `faq.php`, `ticketid` and `ticket_pass` in `view.php`, and `email` and `password` in the logon page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable DeskPRO application.
- No special privileges are needed; the vulnerabilities are remotely exploitable by unauthenticated users.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects DeskPRO version 1.1.0 and prior, and it is fixed in version 1.1.2
- Examples of vulnerable URL parameters and a SQL injection login bypass are provided
- The vulnerability was reported on 2003-09-21, with a fix released by 2003-10-02.
