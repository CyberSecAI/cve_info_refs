  "CVE-2003-0549": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "A crash vulnerability exists in GDM (GNOME Display Manager) when the authorization key name is shorter than 18 bytes (not MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1).",
    "details": "The vulnerability is a denial-of-service (DoS) condition that occurs in GDM when handling X Display Manager Control Protocol (XDMCP) connections. The issue is triggered if the authorization key name provided in the XDMCP request is shorter than 18 bytes. Since XDMCP should only be used on trusted networks, the DoS is less severe.",
    "affected_versions": "All versions of GDM with XDMCP support are affected unless patched.",
    "root_cause": "Insufficient validation of the authorization key name length in XDMCP handling.",
    "vulnerability": "A crash can occur if the authorization key name is not the expected length.",
     "impact": "Denial of Service (DoS). The GDM process may crash when an XDMCP connection with an invalid authorization key name length is established.",
    "attack_vector": "Network. A remote attacker can send a crafted XDMCP request with an invalid authorization key name to trigger the crash.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send network packets to the target system running GDM. The attacker must be able to establish an XDMCP connection to the target."
