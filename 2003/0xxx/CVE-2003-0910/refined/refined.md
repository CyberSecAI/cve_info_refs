Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2003-0910:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `NtSetLdtEntries` API in Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000. This API allows applications to create Local Descriptor Tables (LDT).
- The core issue is a failure to properly filter content within this programming interface. Specifically, the API doesn't validate that the provided LDT entries do not point to protected kernel memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The `NtSetLdtEntries` API lacks proper validation of the provided LDT entries.
- **Privilege Elevation:** The ability to modify the LDT and access protected memory segments allows an attacker to bypass security restrictions.
- **Memory Corruption:** By creating malicious LDT entries, an attacker can potentially corrupt memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Privilege Escalation:** A local user can gain elevated privileges on the system, potentially to SYSTEM level access.
- **Complete System Control:** With elevated privileges, an attacker could take complete control of the system, including installing programs, viewing/changing/deleting data, and creating new privileged accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited only by a user who can log on locally to the system. It can't be exploited remotely.
- **Malicious Program:** An attacker needs to execute a specially crafted program that uses the `NtSetLdtEntries` API to create malicious LDT entries.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local User:** The attacker must be a local user with the ability to log on to the system.
- **Program Execution:** The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the target system.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs specific knowledge of how to exploit the `NtSetLdtEntries` API.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is present in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000. Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 are not affected.
- The provided documents reference Microsoft Security Bulletin MS04-011 which contains patch information to resolve the vulnerability.
- This vulnerability is also referred to as "Local Descriptor Table Vulnerability" with the identifier "CAN-2003-0910" in the Microsoft documents.
