Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a buffer overflow in the Cisco IOS HTTP server when processing a malformed HTTP GET request larger than 2GB.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The HTTP server does not properly handle overly large HTTP GET requests, leading to a buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A remote attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable router.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Repeatedly exploiting the vulnerability can cause the router to reboot, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely by sending a crafted, oversized HTTP GET request.
*   **HTTP Server:** The attack targets the HTTP server functionality of Cisco IOS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the targeted Cisco IOS device with the HTTP server enabled.
*   **Crafted HTTP Request:** The attacker must be able to create and send a malformed HTTP GET request exceeding 2GB in size.
*   **HTTP Server Enabled:** The HTTP server on the Cisco device must be enabled for the vulnerability to be exploitable.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects all Cisco IOS software versions except 12.3 and 12.3T.
*   CatOS and PIX are not affected by this vulnerability.
*   An exploit for this vulnerability has been made public.
*   Cisco has provided a workaround using access lists to restrict access to the HTTP service and has released a document addressing the issue.
