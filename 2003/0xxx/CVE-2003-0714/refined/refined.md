Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2003-0714:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the way Microsoft Exchange Server handles specially crafted SMTP extended verb requests.
- Specifically, the Internet Mail Service in Exchange Server 5.0 and 5.5 does not properly validate these requests, allowing an attacker to allocate large amounts of memory.
- In Exchange 2000 Server, the vulnerability stems from a buffer overrun when processing these extended verb requests due to improper buffer allocation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Improper Input Validation:** Exchange Server fails to validate the data provided in SMTP extended verb requests.
- **Memory Allocation Issue:** In versions 5.0 and 5.5, excessive memory is allocated based on attacker-controlled input.
- **Buffer Overflow:** In Exchange 2000, a buffer overrun occurs due to an improperly sized buffer when processing extended verb requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** For Exchange Server 5.0 and 5.5, an attacker can cause a DoS by exhausting server memory or shutting down the Internet Mail Service, leading to service unavailability.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE):** For Exchange 2000, an attacker can trigger a buffer overflow, leading to remote code execution, allowing them to run malicious programs with the privileges of the SMTP service (typically the Local System account). This allows for complete control over the affected server.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is through the SMTP port of the Exchange server.
- An attacker connects to the server's SMTP port.
- The attacker sends specially crafted SMTP extended verb requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- An attacker needs to be able to establish a network connection to the SMTP port (typically port 25) of the vulnerable Exchange Server.
- The attacker does not need to authenticate to the server to exploit the vulnerability.
- No special privileges are required besides the ability to send network packets.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability affects Exchange Server versions 5.0, 5.5 and 2000.
- Exchange 2003 is not affected as it only accepts extended verb requests from other Exchange servers within the same organization.
- The vulnerability is not exploitable by simply sending an email to a mailbox hosted on the exchange server.
- The patch for this vulnerability requires authentication between Exchange servers in the same organization for extended verb communication.
- The provided Microsoft Security Bulletin MS03-046 provides further details and patches to address this issue.
