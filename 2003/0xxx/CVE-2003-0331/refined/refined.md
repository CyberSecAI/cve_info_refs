- **Root cause of vulnerability:** SQL injection vulnerability in ttForum's profile page due to insufficient input sanitization when `magic_quotes_gpc` is off in PHP.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can gain administrator privileges on the forum and potentially execute arbitrary code on the server by uploading PHP files.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by injecting SQL code into the `Ignorelist`-Textfield on the profile preferences page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs a regular user account on the forum. They also need to access the profile preferences page and modify the Ignorelist field. The server must be running PHP with `magic_quotes_gpc` disabled.
