## SUSE Security

# A Process That Never Ends

### SUSE is committed to delivering best effort security to its customers and to the Open Source community. We believe that trust in Open Source Software security in general, and the user's privacy in particular, are both indispensable and indefeasible.

We treat software security as a process that never ends. This means we:

* Promptly react to security incidents and deliver premium quality security updates
* Continuously improve the security-related functionality in SUSE products
* Continuously contribute to the rapidly growing maturity of Open Source Software
* Respect the Open Source Software security principles of openness, transparency and traceability

Software security is a complex challenge. Software can provide many of its own security features, such as authentication methods, encryption, intrusion prevention and detection, and backup.

At the same time, it can also contain errors (both deliberate and accidental) that can affect the system's security, including design flaws, programming errors, and backdoors.

The SUSE Security Team addresses all of these aspects of software security, on an ongoing basis. Software security cannot be thought of as a state you can achieve at a specific point in time. Instead, it is a process that must be executed with professional expertise and continuous development. This persistent focus is what has given Open Source Software, Linux and SUSE such an excellent reputation for security.

| From the [PopTop web site](http://www.poptop.org/):  PopToP is the PPTP server solution for Linux (ports exist for Solaris 2.6, OpenBSD and FreeBSD and others).A buffer overflow exists in [ctrlpacket.c](http://opensource.lineo.com/cgi-bin/cvsweb/~checkout~/poptop/ctrlpacket.c?rev=1.1.1.1&content-type=text/plain&sortby=file), which is used to control message packet reading, formatting, and writing. For further technical details, please see the [original report](http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/317995). |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker may be able to crash the PPTP server or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the PopTop server. |
| --- |

GENTOO LINUX SECURITY ANNOUNCEMENT 200304-08
- - - ---------------------------------------------------------------------

PACKAGE : pptpd
SUMMARY : buffer overflow
DATE : 2003-04-28 09:22 UTC
EXPLOIT : remote
VERSIONS AFFECTED : <pptpd-1.1.3.20030429
FIXED VERSION : >=pptpd-1.1.3.20030429
CVE : CAN-2003-0213

- - - ---------------------------------------------------------------------

- - From advisory:

"PPTP packet header contain 16bit length which specifies the full size of
the packet:

bytes\_this = read(clientFd, packet + bytes\_ttl, 2 - bytes\_ttl);
// ...
bytes\_ttl += bytes\_this;
// ...
length = htons(\*(u\_int16\_t \*) packet);
if (length > PPTP\_MAX\_CTRL\_PCKT\_SIZE) {
// abort
}

Looks good so far, except:

bytes\_this = read(clientFd, packet + bytes\_ttl, length - bytes\_ttl);

If given length was 0 or 1, the "length - bytes\_ttl" result is -1 or -2,
which means that it reads unlimited amount of data from client into
"packet", which is a buffer located in stack.

The exploitability only depends on if libc allows the size parameter to be
larger than SSIZE\_MAX bytes. GLIBC does, Solaris and \*BSD don't."

Read the full advisory at:
<http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=bugtraq&m=104994375011406&w=2>

SOLUTION

It is recommended that all Gentoo Linux users who are running
net-dialup/pptpd upgrade to pptpd-1.1.3.20030409 as follows:

emerge sync
emerge pptpd
emerge clean

GENTOO LINUX SECURITY ANNOUNCEMENT 200304-08
- - - ---------------------------------------------------------------------

          PACKAGE : pptpd
          SUMMARY : buffer overflow
             DATE : 2003-04-28 09:22 UTC
          EXPLOIT : remote
VERSIONS AFFECTED : <pptpd-1.1.3.20030429
    FIXED VERSION : >=pptpd-1.1.3.20030429
              CVE : CAN-2003-0213

- - - ---------------------------------------------------------------------

- - From advisory:

"PPTP packet header contain 16bit length which specifies the full size of
the packet:

        bytes_this = read(clientFd, packet + bytes_ttl, 2 - bytes_ttl);
        // ...
        bytes_ttl += bytes_this;
        // ...
        length = htons(*(u_int16_t *) packet);
        if (length > PPTP_MAX_CTRL_PCKT_SIZE) {
          // abort
        }

Looks good so far, except:

        bytes_this = read(clientFd, packet + bytes_ttl, length - bytes_ttl);

If given length was 0 or 1, the "length - bytes_ttl" result is -1 or -2,
which means that it reads unlimited amount of data from client into
"packet", which is a buffer located in stack.

The exploitability only depends on if libc allows the size parameter to be
larger than SSIZE_MAX bytes. GLIBC does, Solaris and *BSD don't."

Read the full advisory at:
<http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=bugtraq&m=104994375011406&w=2>

SOLUTION

It is recommended that all Gentoo Linux users who are running
net-dialup/pptpd upgrade to pptpd-1.1.3.20030409 as follows:

emerge sync
emerge pptpd
emerge clean

hello bugtraq,

Here is an exploit for a recently discovered vulnerability in PoPToP
PPTP server under Linux. Versions affected are all prior to
1.1.4-b3 and 1.1.3-20030409.
The exploit is capable of bruteforcing the RET address to find our
buffer in the stack. Upon a successfull run it brings up a reverse
shell with privileges of the pptpd daemon (typically root)
on the victim server.

Have fun,

einstein, dH team
einstein_dhtm@front.ru

P.S. Greets to ERRor, Death and all others.
