Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from Adobe PDF viewers (Acrobat and Reader) loading and executing non-certified plug-ins by default. These plug-ins, which are essentially executable code modules, can run arbitrary code within the viewer's process space.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted Plug-in Loading:** The primary weakness is that Adobe PDF viewers, by default, load non-certified plug-ins from a local directory. This allows malicious or altered plug-ins to be loaded.
*   **Lack of Robust Plug-in Verification:** While Adobe has a "Certified Mode" that verifies plug-ins via digital signatures, this mode is not enabled by default. The plug-in verification mechanism is also dependent on the underlying OS.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The ability for plug-ins to execute arbitrary code within the viewer's process space is a core vulnerability, as it allows attackers to perform a wide variety of actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers can execute any code they desire on the user's system by creating a malicious non-certified plugin.
*   **Circumvention of DRM Features:**  By injecting code, attackers can put the viewer into "Certified Mode", which allows circumvention of digital rights management (DRM) features, such as restrictions on printing, copying text, and other usage controls, that are supposed to be enforced through certified plug-ins.
*   **Displaying False Information:** Malicious plug-ins can manipulate information displayed by the viewer, including document properties.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Plug-in Distribution:** Attackers can distribute malicious plug-ins through various means, such as social engineering or bundling them with other software.
*   **Installation in Plug-ins Directory:** The malicious plug-ins must be installed in the PDF viewer's plug-ins directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Create/Modify Plug-ins:** The attacker needs the technical expertise to create malicious plug-ins that exploit the vulnerabilities.
*   **Access to User's System:** Attackers need to convince users to install the malicious plug-in. This could be achieved via social engineering, or exploiting another vulnerability to gain access.

**Additional Details:**

* The document mentions that Adobe has a "Certified Mode" to address this issue, which restricts the loading of plug-ins to those signed by Adobe.
* It is pointed out that this is dependent on the underlying OS and not the application itself.
* The document also emphasizes that the vulnerability is still present in Adobe Acrobat 6.0 and Adobe Reader 6.0 when loading non-certified plug-ins is allowed (the default setting).
* Adobe considers this a theoretical vulnerability and will not be issuing updates.
