## Adobe PDF viewers allow non-certified plug-ins to put viewers into Certified Mode

#### Vulnerability Note VU#689835

Original Release Date: 2003-07-15 | Last Revised: 2003-07-15

---

### Overview

By default, Adobe PDF viewers will start up and load non-certified plug-ins installed in a local plug\_ins directory. Adobe Reader plug-ins not certified by Adobe, if allowed to load, can execute arbitrary code in the process space of the running viewer. One incremental impact of such arbitrary code execution is to put the viewer into 'Certified Mode', allowing the circumvention of certain digital right management features such as printing, copying of text, etc.

### Description

| Adobe Acrobat is software designed to create and manipulate Portable Document Format (PDF) files. The Adobe Reader is a more widely-deployed free PDF viewer. Acrobat plug-ins are separate executable code modules designed to use the [Acrobat SDK](http://partners.adobe.com/asn/developer/acrosdk/acrobat.html) to work within the Acrobat framework and extend the functionality and features of Adobe's PDF viewers. These are typically dynamic libraries installed in a plug\_ins directory (with the extension .api on Windows systems). Installed plug-ins run with the same execution privileges as the user running the Acrobat PDF viewer, but may cause other plug-ins to not be loaded at startup, depending on whether they are digitally signed by Adobe's certification key.  There are three primary cryptographic features in Adobe Acrobat and Adobe Reader products. These are:   1. Document digital signatures 2. Document encryption 3. Plug-in cryptographic verification  While the first two features do not have any reported weaknesses and are believed to cryptographically strong, the third feature is only as reliable as the security of the underlying operating system. In particular, malicious or altered plug-ins, like any code sharing memory with an application, are able to circumvent certain digital rights management features that prevent printing, copying of text, etc.The vulnerability described in [VU#549913](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/549913): *Adobe Acrobat PDF viewers contain flaw when loading and verifying plug-ins* is still present in Adobe Acrobat 6.0 and Adobe Reader 6.0 when loading of non-certified plug-ins is allowed (the default setting). Since plug-ins can run arbitrary code, users of these products will want to make sure untrusted plug-ins are not installed or loaded. Because Version 6 certified plug-in are now verified using strong cryptography, enabling the 'Use Only Certified Plug-ins' option will ensure that only plug-ins legitimately signed and distributed by Adobe will load (see the checkbox in the 'Application Startup' area under menu item 'Edit->Preferences->Startup'). |

### Impact

| There are two classes of end-users affected by this report: Consumers of Adobe Acrobat and Adobe Reader Products Attackers that can convince users to download and install malicious programs (non-certified plug-ins) may be able to execute arbitrary code on the user's system. Executing arbitrary code may allow an attacker to display false information when reporting document information and circumvent digital rights management features that prevent printing, copying of text, etc. This can only happen via non-certified plug-ins installed in a plug\_ins directory when the 'Use Only Certified Plug-ins' checkbox is turned off, the default state in Adobe Acrobat 6.0 and Adobe Reader 6.0. Digital Content Providers Digital content providers can not rely on plug-in cryptographic verification mechanisms to prevent attackers from gaining certain rights. These rights include printing, copying of text, and other digital-rights-management features when the attacker is able to access legitimately decrypted documents and the attacker has control of the local system. Note this can happen regardless of the plug-in architecture used. The ability for any application to protect such rights is dependent on the underlying operating system architecture, not application architecture. |

### Solution

| Adobe has provided a [statement](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/JSHA-5PAMS7) regarding this issue, available here:<http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/JSHA-5PAMS7> |
| --- |

| WorkaroundsThere are two classes of end-user response to this report:Consumers of Adobe Acrobat and Adobe Reader ProductsBe careful not to install untrusted software, including non-certified Adobe plug-ins (those not signed and deployed by Adobe), unless absolutely certain of the origin and integrity of such software. Unverified non-certified plug-ins can be removed from the plug-ins directory, and they will no longer load at startup.If you desire additional protection, you may wish to set the certified-plug-ins-only feature. When the 'Use Only Certified Plug-ins' checkbox under 'Edit->Preferences->Startup' (under 'Application Startup') is enabled (not the default), non-certified plug-ins are prevented from loading at startup.Finally, to prevent all plug-ins from loading when an Acrobat viewer starts, press the 'Shift' key while the application is starting.Digital Content ProvidersDo not rely on any digital rights management features enforced solely via non-certified plug-ins for critical content. When appropriate, use the stronger document signature and encryption features built into the Adobe Acrobat products. |

TITLE: Digital Rights Management (DRM) and the Adobe Acrobat/PDF Security
Model

OVERVIEW
Adobe encourages the security community to report truthful and legitimate
security vulnerabilities so they can be quickly and appropriately
addressed for customers. Recently, an organization publicly disclosed a
theoretical vulnerability within the Adobe Acrobat/PDF product.
Unfortunately, the information was inaccurate and misleading.

DESCRIPTION
Adobe PDF includes several mechanisms to protect electronic documents.
This includes encryption, digital signatures, and digital rights
management.

\* Encryption can be used with passwords or public key infrastructure
(PKI) to restrict access to confidential electronic content. Using strong
passwords with 128bit RC4 symmetric encryption or PKI certificates, Adobe
PDF provides added assurances that protected documents can only be opened
by the intended recipients.

\* Digital signatures can be used with PKI to provide authenticity and
integrity checking capabilities to sensitive electronic content. Using up
to 2048 bit RSA keys, Adobe PDF provides added assurances that protected
content originated from the named author and that the content has not been
altered since authoring.

\* Digital rights management can be used to control the distribution and
usage of copyrighted material. This may include restrictions for print,
copy, read aloud and expiration of content.

Adobe provides a plug-in architecture for developers to further enhance
these protection capabilities within Adobe Acrobat and Adobe Reader. The
Software Development Kit (SDK) can be found at
<http://partners.adobe.com/asn/acrobat/index.jsp>

There are four types of plug-ins available for Adobe PDF products:

1.Adobe Acrobat plug-in
2.Adobe Reader plug-in
3.Adobe Acrobat Certified plug-in
4.Adobe Reader Certified plug-in

Developers can freely write plug-ins for Adobe Acrobat. Adobe Reader
plug-ins require a license agreement and an enabling key from Adobe as
part of the Adobe Reader Integration Key License Agreement (IKLA). The
purpose of the Reader enabling plug-in architecture and IKLA is for
licensing only and does not imply suitability or endorsement by Adobe of
third party plug-ins. The Certified Mode of both Adobe Acrobat and Adobe
Reader is used to provide added assurances that only plug-ins provided by
Adobe are compatible. All third party plug-ins are restricted to
non-certified mode.

As reported in the CERT/CC Vulnerability Note 549913,
<http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/549913>
Adobe Acrobat and Adobe Reader versions 4.X and 5.X utilized the same
mechanism to restrict Reader and Certified plug-ins, which could be
bypassed in certain circumstances. As noted, Adobe Acrobat and Adobe
Reader version 6.X have been updated to provide a new Certified Mode
verification scheme. When specifically enabled within the product, only
Certified plug-ins - those supplied by Adobe - will load on a users
system. For backward compatibility, Reader plug-in verification mechanisms
have not been changed in version 6.X.

IMPACT
Adobe/PDF products rely on a third party operating system and these
operating systems do not currently restrict loading of multiple
applications in shared computer memory. Therefore, Adobe does not make any
warranties about plug-ins to Adobe applications or other applications on
an operating system that may affect Digital Rights Management capabilities
within Adobe PDF products. Electronic content that can be viewed or heard
could be potentially copied through digital and/or analog means.
Technology alone is not a complete barrier to prevent the stealing of
copyrighted material.

An organization has publicly posted theoretical information that could be
used to help circumvent Digital Rights Management capabilities in Adobe
Acrobat/PDF using the plug-in architecture. A product created using this
information could encourage illegal activity and potential violations of
the End User License Agreement for Adobe Acrobat and Adobe Reader
products.

This information also includes inaccurate statements related to other
elements of Adobe Acrobat/PDF security and contains no credible
information concerning weaknesses in document encryption or digital
signature capabilities of Adobe Acrobat/PDF related security
infrastructure. Users of Adobe applications are not at risk from the
information contained in these erroneous reports.

SOLUTION
Since this is a theoretical vulnerability and does not pose a risk to
Acrobat customers, Adobe will not be issuing an update to Adobe Acrobat or
Adobe Reader to modify plug-in loading mechanisms.

Authors who determine their copyrighted material has been illegally
duplicated, in any format, are encouraged to pursue appropriate legal
action.

Legitimate security vulnerabilities can be reported to Adobe at
<http://www.adobe.com/misc/securityform.html>
