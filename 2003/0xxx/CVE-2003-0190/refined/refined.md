**Vulnerability:** CVE-2003-0190

*   **Description:** OpenSSH-portable (OpenSSH) 3.6.1p1 and earlier with PAM support enabled immediately sends an error message when a user does not exist.
*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the immediate error response by OpenSSH when a user does not exist, when PAM support is enabled.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Timing Attack:** The immediate error message allows attackers to use timing differences to discern between valid and invalid usernames.
