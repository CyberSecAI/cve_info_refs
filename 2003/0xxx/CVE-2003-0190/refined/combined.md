SUMMARY

SCALANCE X-200RNA switch devices before V3.2.7 contain multiple OpenSSL and OpenSSH vulnera-
bilities. The most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow a denial of service condition or could lead to
execution of arbitrary code.

Siemens has released updates for the affected products and recommends to update to the latest versions.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Restrict access to the affected systems, especially to ports 22/tcp and 443/tcp to trusted IP

addresses only

• Deactivate the webserver if not required, and if deactivation is supported by the product

Siemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT

Product-speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/
industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The SCALANCE X-204RNA Industrial Ethernet network access points enable the cost-effective connection
of non-PRP terminal devices to separate parallel networks, where a high availability is required.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2003-0190

OpenSSH-portable (OpenSSH) 3.6.1p1 and earlier with PAM support enabled immediately sends
an error message when a user does not exist, which allows remote attackers to determine valid
usernames via a timing attack.

Vulnerability CVE-2003-1562

sshd in OpenSSH 3.6.1p2 and earlier, when PermitRootLogin is disabled and using PAM keyboard-
interactive authentication, does not insert a delay after a root login attempt with the correct password,
which makes it easier for remote attackers to use timing differences to determine if the password step
of a multi-step authentication is successful, a different vulnerability than CVE-2003-0190.

Vulnerability CVE-2014-8176

The dtls1_clear_queues function in ssl/d1_lib.c in OpenSSL before 0.9.8za, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0m, and
1.0.1 before 1.0.1h frees data structures without considering that application data can arrive between
a ChangeCipherSpec message and a Finished message, which allows remote DTLS peers to cause a

Vulnerability CVE-2015-0207

The dtls1_listen function in d1_lib.c in OpenSSL 1.0.2 before 1.0.2a does not properly isolate the state

The ASN.1 signature-veriﬁcation implementation in the rsa_item_verify function in crypto/r-
sa/rsa_ameth.c in OpenSSL 1.0.2 before 1.0.2a allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(NULL pointer dereference and application crash) via crafted RSA PSS parameters to an endpoint

The ssl3_client_hello function in s3_clnt.c in OpenSSL 1.0.2 before 1.0.2a does not ensure that the
PRNG is seeded before proceeding with a handshake, which makes it easier for remote attackers to
defeat cryptographic protection mechanisms by snifﬁng the network and then conducting a brute-force

Vulnerability CVE-2019-1552

OpenSSL has internal defaults for a directory tree where it can ﬁnd a conﬁguration ﬁle as well as
certiﬁcates used for veriﬁcation in TLS. This directory is most commonly referred to as OPENSSLDIR,
and is conﬁgurable with the –preﬁx / –openssldir conﬁguration options. For OpenSSL versions 1.1.0
and 1.1.1, the mingw conﬁguration targets assume that resulting programs and libraries are installed
in a Unix-like environment and the default preﬁx for program installation as well as for OPENSSLDIR
should be ‘/usr/local’. However, mingw programs are Windows programs, and as such, ﬁnd themselves
looking at sub-directories of ‘C:/usr/local’, which may be world writable, which enables untrusted users
to modify OpenSSL’s default conﬁguration, insert CA certiﬁcates, modify (or even replace) existing
engine modules, etc. For OpenSSL 1.0.2, ‘/usr/local/ssl’ is used as default for OPENSSLDIR on
all Unix and Windows targets, including Visual C builds. However, some build instructions for the
diverse Windows targets on 1.0.2 encourage you to specify your own –preﬁx. OpenSSL versions
1.1.1, 1.1.0 and 1.0.2 are affected by this issue. Due to the limited scope of affected deployments this
has been assessed as low severity and therefore we are not creating new releases at this time. Fixed
in OpenSSL 1.1.1d (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1c). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0l (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0k). Fixed in

malicious scp server (or Man-in-The-Middle attacker) can overwrite arbitrary ﬁles in the scp client
target directory. If recursive operation (-r) is performed, the server can manipulate subdirectories as
