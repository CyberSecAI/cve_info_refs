Based on the provided document, here's an analysis of CVE-2003-0838:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability arises because Internet Explorer does not properly validate the object type returned from a web server when processing an object tag within a popup window created with the `Window.CreatePopup` script command. Specifically, the browser doesn't perform a proper parameter check on the HTTP response which could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Object Type Determination:** Internet Explorer fails to correctly identify the object type being returned in the HTTP response for an object tag within a popup window, allowing a malicious object to be executed.
*   **Lack of Parameter Checking:** The browser does not conduct proper checks on parameters within the HTTP response, allowing the response to point to a file type that can be scripted and executed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user's system within the security context of the logged-on user. This could lead to complete system compromise if the user has administrative privileges.
*   **Full System Control:** With the ability to execute arbitrary code, an attacker could perform a wide range of malicious actions, such as installing malware, stealing data, or taking control of the user's computer.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Web Site:** An attacker could host a specially crafted web page that exploits this vulnerability. When a user visits this page with a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer, the malicious code would be executed.
*   **HTML Email:** An attacker could craft an HTML-based email that attempts to exploit this vulnerability when the user views the email in Internet Explorer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to host a specially crafted webpage or send an HTML email with the exploit code.
*   No user interaction other than visiting a malicious site or opening a malicious email is required for the exploit to be triggered.
