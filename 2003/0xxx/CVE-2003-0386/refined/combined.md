# RHSA-2006:0298 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

openssh security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Low

## Topic

Updated openssh packages that fix bugs in sshd are now available for Red
Hat Enterprise Linux 3.

This update has been rated as having low security impact by the Red Hat
Security Response Team.

## Description

OpenSSH is OpenBSD's SSH (Secure SHell) protocol implementation. This
package includes the core files necessary for both the OpenSSH client and
server.

An arbitrary command execution flaw was discovered in the way scp copies
files locally. It is possible for a local attacker to create a file with a
carefully crafted name that could execute arbitrary commands as the user
running scp to copy files locally. (CVE-2006-0225)

The SSH daemon, when restricting host access by numeric IP addresses and
with VerifyReverseMapping disabled, allows remote attackers to bypass
"from=" and "user@host" address restrictions by connecting to a host from a
system whose reverse DNS hostname contains the numeric IP address.
(CVE-2003-0386)

The following issues have also been fixed in this update:

* If the sshd service was stopped using the sshd init script while the

main sshd daemon was not running, the init script would kill other sshd
 processes, such as the running sessions. For example, this could happen
 when the 'service sshd stop' command was issued twice.

* When privilege separation was enabled, the last login message was printed

only for the root user.

* The sshd daemon was sending messages to the system log from a signal

handler when debug logging was enabled. This could cause a deadlock of
 the user's connection.

All users of openssh should upgrade to these updated packages, which
resolve these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied. Use Red Hat
Network to download and update your packages. To launch the Red Hat
Update Agent, use the following command:

up2date

guide specific to your system:

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Vulnerability in OpenSSH daemon (sshd)

#### Vulnerability Note VU#978316

Original Release Date: 2003-06-06 | Last Revised: 2007-01-16

---

### Overview

A vulnerability in the OpenSSH daemon (sshd) may give remote attackers a better chance of gaining access to restricted resources.

### Description

| OpenSSH is an implementation of the [Secure Shell protocol](http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/secsh-charter.html). It is used to provide strong authentication and cryptographically secure communications between hosts. A vulnerability in versions up to and including 3.6.1 of OpenSSH may allow a remote attacker to circumvent security policies and attempt to or actually login from IP addresses that are not permitted to access resources.  There are two methods a client can use to authenticate to an SSH server. The first method is password authentication. This method is generally the easiest to set up, but the least secure. As long as the client has a valid username and password, they can gain access to the system running the SSH server. The second method is public key authentication. Public key authentication is one of the most secure methods available to authenticate a user. For a client to gain access to a system using public key authentication, a copy of the client's public key must exist on the SSH server. The client must also have the private key in their possession as well as the passphrase associated with the private key. In addition to the methods available to authenticate a user, there also exists ways in which one can restrict access to the SSH server, such that connections are permitted only from trusted hosts. One of the most common methods is by utilizing a firewall to do host-based access restriction. Additionally, sshd has the ability to restrict access by IP address or hostname. While this is not cryptographically strong security, it provides an additional layer of protection which some sites rely upon to limit their exposure. A flaw exists in the way OpenSSH evaluates IP addresses and hostnames. We have included an excerpt of the [report](http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/324016/2003-06-02/2003-06-08/0) sent to BugTraq regarding this vulnerability:Interestingly, when a purely numeric IP address is provided, an attacker who controls reverse DNS for his host can circumvent this controls by returning text containing a numeric IP address in the reverse DNS response. This would allow stolen keys containing numeric IP address restrictions to be used from other IP address, or external access to a system which hadAllowUsers \*@192.168.\*.\* set in an attempt to limit access to users in the internal 192.168/16 network.The exploit works because the code treats both the IP address and hostname as strings, and there is no logic to indicate when a pure IP address match should be attempted. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker can attempt to login to your system from a location that is not allowed. If the attacker has a private key in their possession that is allowed to access the system, they will be able to gain entry to the network. If the attacker does not have a legitimate private key, they may be able to guess a correct username/password pair if you allow password authentication. |
| --- |

### Solution

| The OpenSSH maintainers recommend enabling VerifyReverseMapping in sshd\_config. You may also wish to restrict access to the secure shell service by applying packet filters for port 22/tcp at your network perimeter. While this measure will limit your exposure to attacks, blocking port 22/tcp at a network perimeter would still allow attackers within the perimeter of your network to exploit the vulnerability. It is important to understand your network's configuration and service requirements before deciding what changes are appropriate. In cases where applying packet filters is not feasible, software such as Wietse Venema's TCP Wrappers can be used to restrict access to the secure shell daemon. Finally, it is highly advisable to use public key authentication as opposed to password authentication. In our estimation, this vulnerability does not pose an imminent threat; however, it permits a greater-than-expected level of access to a security control in your infrastructure. The next release of OpenSSH will drop the VerifyReverseMapping option and, subsequently, sshd will by default perform reverse-mapping. At this point in time, we do not know if the OpenSSH maintainers plan to make a patch available before the next release. |

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

The Solaris Secure Shell, which ships with Solaris 9 and later, is based on OpenSSH and is therefore vulnerable to this issue. The advice to enable the sshd\_config(4) option of VerifyReverseMapping is a valid workaround for Solaris Secure Shell as well. Similarly, the use of IP addresses instead of hostnames for the sshd\_config(4) options of AllowUsers and DenyUsers will also workaround this issue.

### Vendor Information

The vendor has not provided us with any further information regarding this vulnerability.

### [VanDyke Software Inc.](#IAFY-5N9PLZ) Affected

Notified:  June 06, 2003  Updated: June 16, 2003

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

VShell connection filters are vulnerable to this type of attack if hostname of domain name based filters are used in any of the connection filters.

VShell starts with the IP address provided by the TCP/IP protocol stack for the connection.

If there are no name based filters in the connection filter list, it simply uses this address to do filtering-- no name resolution is performed, and therefore, no vulnerability exists.

If there are name based filters in the connection filter list, VShell must discover all the hostnames associated with the connection IP. It does this through DNS, which is subject to trivial spoofing.

It is recommended that our customers \_not\_ use hostname or domain name based filtering, but rather, use IP and netmask based filtering.

### [SSH Communications Security](#IAFY-5N9PM7) Not Affected

Notified:  June 06, 2003  Updated: July 14, 2003

### Status

Not Affected

### Vendor Statement

Since 3.0.0, SSH Secure Shell server has had an additional specifier for matching with the host addresses, which can be used to only match IP-addresses or IP-masks. For example, one could specify

AllowUsers \*@\i192.168.\*.\*

Since 3.1.0, a specifier for address masks was added.

AllowUsers \*@\m192.168.0.0/16

The specifiers are to be prepended to the address, and are "\i" and "\m", respectively.

Thus, SSH Secure Shell daemon is not vulnerable to this, if these specifiers are used.

openssh security update (RHSA-2006-0298)

Original Release Date: August 31, 2006

Last Revised: August 31, 2006

Number: ASA-2006-174

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 1.0

Advisory Status: Interim

---

## 1. Overview:

OpenSSH is a suite of tools for interoperating with the SSH protocol,
brought
to you by the folks who make OpenBSD.

The scp command was found to contain an arbitrary command execution
vulnerability in the method it uses to securely copy files locally.
A
malicious user could possibly take advantage of this vulnerability to
run
arbitrary commands as the user running scp. The Common
Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2006-0225](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-0225) to the issue.

Due to a bug in sshd, a remote attacker could possibly bypass IP
address
restrictions on a host running sshd where the "VerifyReverseMapping"
option
is disabled. If the system the remote attacker was coming from had a
reverse
DNS record that resolved to an IP that was allowed into the system
via either
the "from=" and/or "user@host" OpenSSH configuration file directives,
sshd
could allow the user access. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures
project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2003-0386](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2003-0386) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the
security
advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2006-0298.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with openssh installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya S87XX/S8500/S8300 | CM 3.0 and before | Low | Updating to CM 3.1 or later is recommended to resolve this issue. See recommended actions below. |
| Avaya Intuity LX | All | Low | See recommended actions below.  This issue will be addressed in accordance with [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |
| Avaya Messaging Storage Server | All | Low | See recommended actions below.  This issue will be addressed in accordance with [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |
| Avaya Message Networking | All | Low | See recommended actions below.  This issue will be addressed in accordance with [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |

**Recommended Actions:**
For all system products which use
vulnerable
versions of openssh, Avaya recommends that customers restrict local
and
network access to the server. This restriction should be enforced
through the
use of physical security, firewalls, ACLs, VPNs, and other
generally-accepted
networking practices until such time as an update becomes available
and can
be installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating
systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying
operating
system or applications that come with the operating system. These
vulnerabilities often do not impact the software-only product
directly but
may threaten the integrity of the underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not
affected by
the vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers should determine on which Linux operating system the
product was
installed and then follow that vendors guidance:

## 4. Software-Only Products:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Interactive Response(IR) | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected packages may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IR application. The IR application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| CVLAN | All | Low | See recommended actions below. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite(IMS) | All | Low | See recommended actions below. |

**Recommended Actions:**
Avaya recommends that customers follow
recommended actions supplied by the Operating System vendor (e.g.
RedHat
Linux) or remove the affected packages.

## 5. Additional Information:

Additional information may also be available via the Avaya support
[website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya
account
representative. Please contact your Avaya product support
representative, or

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
