{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The SSH daemon, when restricting host access by numeric IP addresses and with VerifyReverseMapping disabled, incorrectly evaluates IP addresses and hostnames.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation in handling IP addresses and hostnames.",
      "Failure to distinguish between numeric IP address and hostname strings"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote attackers can bypass \"from=\" and \"user@host\" address restrictions, potentially gaining unauthorized access.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network-based attack",
      "Exploiting vulnerable SSH daemon configuration",
      "Manipulating reverse DNS records"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to control the reverse DNS record for their system and must be connecting from a system whose reverse DNS hostname contains the numeric IP address to bypass the restrictions. They may also need valid credentials or private keys to gain full access."
  },
  "additional_details": "The vulnerability arises because sshd treats both IP addresses and hostnames as strings and does not have specific logic to determine when to attempt a pure IP address match. This allows a malicious actor to manipulate the reverse DNS of their attacking host to appear as an allowed IP address and bypass access restrictions. The recommended solution is to enable VerifyReverseMapping in sshd_config or restrict access to the service via packet filters or TCP wrappers and use public key authentication.",
