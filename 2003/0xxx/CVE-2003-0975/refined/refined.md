Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is that Apple's Safari 1.1 (v100) is vulnerable to the same cookie theft vulnerability that was previously discovered in Mozilla and Internet Explorer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core weakness lies in how the browser handles cookies, allowing for a malicious party to potentially steal them. The specifics of the vulnerability are detailed in Marc Slemko's writeup and demo.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
The impact of exploitation is cookie theft. This means that an attacker could gain access to session cookies and other cookie data that could allow them to impersonate the user, gain access to their accounts, or perform other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through malicious web pages or websites that are able to exploit the cookie handling vulnerability. The attacker would need to entice the user to visit a page they control.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs the ability to host and deliver a webpage. The attacker does not necessarily need to be on the same network as the victim.
