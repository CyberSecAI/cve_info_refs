Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities found in Snowblind Web Server v1.0:

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Directory Traversal:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The web server doesn't properly sanitize or validate user-supplied paths in URLs, allowing access to files and directories outside of the designated web root.
    *   **Weakness:** Improper input validation, path traversal vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can read sensitive files (e.g., system.ini) or download arbitrary files (e.g., calc.exe, sws.exe) from the server's file system.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Crafted URLs containing `../` sequences, either directly or within the `internal.sws` handler.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No special privileges are needed.
2.  **Directory Listing Exposure:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The web server allows directory listings when the "Allow directory listings" option is enabled (which is the default configuration). The server does not properly restrict listing to the web root.
    *   **Weakness:** Insecure default configuration, improper path restriction.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can view the contents of the root directory of the disk the webserver is running on.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Requests to directories outside of the webroot, using `.../`
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
3.  **Denial of Service (DoS):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The web server crashes when specific URLs are requested or when the length of the GET request exceeds a certain limit.
    *   **Weakness:** Poor handling of malformed requests, potential buffer overflow when processing requests.
    *   **Impact:** The web server becomes unresponsive, leading to denial of service for legitimate users.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Sending HTTP GET request with a path of `/>` or large GET request.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.

**Summary of Vulnerabilities:**

*   The Snowblind Web Server v1.0 is vulnerable to directory traversal, allowing access to arbitrary files on the server.
*   Directory listing exposure allows for an attacker to see the root directory contents.
*   The server is susceptible to DoS attacks by requesting specific URLs or sending overly long GET requests.
