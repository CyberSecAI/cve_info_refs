How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=97958#c0)  Paul D. Mitcheson    2003-06-24 16:25:09 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  Occasionally I have an IPP process running at 100% processor.  This seems to  come from occasional print jobs but I have been unable to find out what sort of  jobs cause it.  It doesn't do any harm other than slow down the print server.  However, I have done strace -p on the process, and here's what I get:   time(NULL)                              = 1056471483 recv(3, "", 2048, 0)                    = 0 time(NULL)                              = 1056471483 recv(3, "", 2048, 0)                    = 0 time(NULL)                              = 1056471483 recv(3, "", 2048, 0)                    = 0 time(NULL)                              = 1056471483 recv(3, "", 2048, 0)                    = 0 time(NULL)                              = 1056471483 recv(3, "", 2048, 0)                    = 0 time(NULL)                              = 1056471483 recv(3, "", 2048, 0)                    = 0 time(NULL)                              = 1056471483 recv(3, "", 2048, 0)                    = 0 time(NULL)                              = 1056471483 recv(3, "", 2048, 0)                    = 0 time(NULL)                              = 1056471483 recv(3, "", 2048, 0)                    = 0 time(NULL)                              = 1056471483  which goes on forever.   Does this help?  I can try to get more info if you give me some pointers on how  to gathrer it.  Sorry to be so ague, I'm hoping the strace is useful.   Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): cups-1.1.17-13.3  How reproducible: Well, at least on my print server, let people print for a week or so and  another process will appear.   Steps to Reproduce: 1. print many files 2. eventually one causes IPP at 100% 3.      Actual results:   Expected results:   Additional info: Not actually sure if this means some files fail to print.  I will ask my users  if you think this gives useful insight into the problem.   Thanks a lot.

However, I'm not running nfsd and cups still works - it doesn't just exit on starting, just occasionally I see this 100%, but cups is still running and does still print, it's just that the load on the machine is higher.

Paul   ```  [Comment 29](show_bug.cgi?id=97958#c29)  Tim Waugh    2003-10-09 11:14:32 UTC  ``` Binaries for 1.1.19-13.0.0.0.1test are at:  ftp://people.redhat.com/twaugh/tmp/cups*  (Yes, it might fix other problems too.)  Thanks.   ```  [Comment 30](show_bug.cgi?id=97958#c30)  Paul D. Mitcheson    2003-10-15 16:53:26 UTC  ``` Hi Tim,  Everything is going very well with the new version of cups.  The ipp loop has not occured and the printers have not been jamming randomly with jobs.  So far it is the most reliable printing system I have had using cups.  However, what does happen is that if a job is cancelled on the printer using the "cancel job" button, the queue jams until the first one in the queue cancelled (say from the web pages).  Perhaps cups has some flag set which doesn't get cleared until a job is cancelled.  (ie it thinks the printer is off line?)  Please let me know if I can send you any more info about that one.  Paul   ```  [Comment 31](show_bug.cgi?id=97958#c31)  Paul D. Mitcheson    2003-10-15 16:55:31 UTC  ``` Tim,  I forgot to say that this type of jam (from pressing the button on the printer) always happened with previous releases come to think of it)  Paul    ```  [Comment 32](show_bug.cgi?id=97958#c32)  Tim Waugh    2003-10-16 12:31:57 UTC  ``` Okay, let's give it until (say) tomorrow to check that the IPP busy loop is gone.  I have another package, this time based on 1.1.17 again, which I hope will fix the original problem in the same way that 1.1.19 does.  It's possible that this bug is related to [bug #104360](show_bug.cgi?id=104360 "CLOSED ERRATA - cups sometimes fails to print"), but if not we'll have to look at that once we know this one is nailed.   ```  [Comment 33](show_bug.cgi?id=97958#c33)  Paul D. Mitcheson    2003-10-17 14:59:25 UTC  ``` Tim,  IPP bug has not occured today.  Seems fixed in 1.1.19  Cheers,  Paul   ```  [Comment 34](show_bug.cgi?id=97958#c34)  Tim Waugh    2003-10-17 17:15:30 UTC  ``` Okay, that's good news.  So now we need a 1.1.17-based version, i.e. to distill the bug fixes from the 1.1.19 features.  At ftp://people.redhat.com/twaugh/tmp/ there are some 1.1.17-13.3.0.2 packages (cups and cups-libs).  These contain the fix that seems like it will cure the IPP busy loop problem.  Could you please try them out so that (a) we can verify that the IPP busy loop problem is really gone, and (b) to see if it has any bearing on [bug #104360](show_bug.cgi?id=104360 "CLOSED ERRATA - cups sometimes fails to print")?  Thanks.   ```  [Comment 35](show_bug.cgi?id=97958#c35)  Paul D. Mitcheson    2003-10-17 17:22:12 UTC  ``` <grumble>humph, a downgrade!</grumble>  Yes, of course I'll do it.  What rpm command do I run, just --force to downgrade?  Paul   ```  [Comment 36](show_bug.cgi?id=97958#c36)  Tim Waugh    2003-10-17 17:26:39 UTC  ``` Yeah, a downgrade.  I'm just a bit nervous about doing a wholesale upgrade. :-(  You can use rpm -Uvh --oldpackages ... to install them.    ```  [Comment 37](show_bug.cgi?id=97958#c37)  Paul D. Mitcheson    2003-10-17 20:07:03 UTC  ``` OK, downgrade complete.  Will let you know what happens.  It's working at the moment.  Paul   ```  [Comment 38](show_bug.cgi?id=97958#c38)  Paul D. Mitcheson    2003-10-18 11:47:51 UTC  ``` Tim,  In new cups packages would it be possible for the rpm to save a mime.convs.rpmnew and a mime.types.rpmnew instead of making the .old files.  I need the raw printing fpr my non-PS printers which is not enabled by default in these files.  So, if upo2date runs in cron and happens to update cups it can break the coupld of non-PS printers we have.  Everything still working fine btw.  Paul   ```  [Comment 39](show_bug.cgi?id=97958#c39)  Tim Waugh    2003-10-18 16:22:39 UTC  ``` If you have a raw print queue defined using redhat-config-printer the right thing will happen (i.e. the octet-stream mime-type will get defined).   ```  [Comment 40](show_bug.cgi?id=97958#c40)  Paul D. Mitcheson    2003-10-18 16:30:10 UTC  ``` ahhhh I use cups web pages to do my print admin.  Is there some way I can set it from there?  If I now start the redhat tool it doesn't find some of the cups defined printers.  The redhat tool doesn't query the cups definitions?  I guess because it can work with other printing systems too.  Paul   ```  [Comment 41](show_bug.cgi?id=97958#c41)  Tim Waugh    2003-10-18 16:43:35 UTC  ``` No. :-(  Basically redhat-config-printer uses its own, separate, configuration file.  You ought to be able to import CUPS-defined queues using /usr/share/printconf/util/cups_import.py -- but then they will be managed by redhat-config-printer and not the CUPS web GUI.   ```  [Comment 42](show_bug.cgi?id=97958#c42)  Paul D. Mitcheson    2003-10-18 16:47:51 UTC  ``` OK, I'd rather keep the web management.  Is there any way of making sure this thing always gets defined from there?  Paul   ```  [Comment 43](show_bug.cgi?id=97958#c43)  Tim Waugh    2003-10-18 16:57:03 UTC  ``` Not short of removing redhat-config-printer altogether.  Basically redhat-config-printer needs to be redone or replaced IMHO.   ```  [Comment 44](show_bug.cgi?id=97958#c44)  Paul D. Mitcheson    2003-10-18 21:15:37 UTC  ``` with cups as the default printing system now, and the cups web pages, doesn;t this make config-printer redundant anyway?  Perhaps redhat-config-printer can become:  #!/bin/bash konqueror <http://localhost:631>   There.  I just wrote a new tool for you!  OK, will let you know say friday about the status of the ipp loop or earlier if it appears.  Paul   ```  [Comment 45](show_bug.cgi?id=97958#c45)  Tim Waugh    2003-10-18 22:36:00 UTC  ``` At the risk of heresy, the CUPS GUI is absolutely awful.   ```  [Comment 46](show_bug.cgi?id=97958#c46)  Paul D. Mitcheson    2003-10-19 09:21:31 UTC  ``` Well, at least you didn't object to konqueror at the same time!   ```  [Comment 47](show_bug.cgi?id=97958#c47)  Paul D. Mitcheson    2003-10-25 12:27:46 UTC  ``` Hi Tim,  The new package has behaved itself all week.  And, it hasn't jammed print queues randomly so far.  Perhaps that is also now fixed.... so perhaps its now only pressing te cancel button on the printer which causes a problem.  Can we start investigating that one now, or do you want to make a release of this fix first?  Cheers,  Paul   ```  [Comment 48](show_bug.cgi?id=97958#c48)  Tim Waugh    2003-10-29 11:49:06 UTC  ``` Any jams since your last comment?   ```  [Comment 49](show_bug.cgi?id=97958#c49)  Paul D. Mitcheson    2003-10-29 11:55:49 UTC  ``` no jams - it's all running well.  Paul   ```  [Comment 50](show_bug.cgi?id=97958#c50)  Tim Waugh    2003-10-29 12:01:31 UTC  ``` Excellent.  And no reoccurrance of [bug #104360](show_bug.cgi?id=104360 "CLOSED ERRATA - cups sometimes fails to print") then?   ```  [Comment 51](show_bug.cgi?id=97958#c51)  Paul D. Mitcheson    2003-10-29 21:01:26 UTC  ``` Tim,  No, there has been no reoccurance of 104360  Everything has been working great for the last week and a half.  Are you going to release this?  Paul   ```  [Comment 52](show_bug.cgi?id=97958#c52)  Mark J. Cox    2003-11-03 09:22:59 UTC  ``` An errata has been issued which should help the problem described in this bug report.  This report is therefore being closed with a resolution of ERRATA. For more information on the solution and/or where to find the updated files, please follow the link below. You may reopen  this bug report if the solution does not work for you.  <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2003-275.html>    ```  [Comment 53](show_bug.cgi?id=97958#c53)  Robert van den Aker    2003-11-17 11:03:01 UTC  ``` IÂ´m confused. If this bug was fixed upstream in CUPS 1.1.19 and the fix for RHL 8 and 9 is a backport of the upstream fix, then whatÂ´s the old patch still doing in cups-1.1.19-13 (Fedora and Rawhide)?   ```  [Comment 54](show_bug.cgi?id=97958#c54)  Tim Waugh    2003-11-17 14:31:59 UTC  ``` Nothing; in fact it's been removed in rawhide.   ``` |  |
