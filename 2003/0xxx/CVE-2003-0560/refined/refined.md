- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the `shopexd.asp` script of the VP-ASP e-commerce application. The script is vulnerable to SQL injection because it does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `id` parameter. This allows attackers to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the lack of input sanitization in the `shopexd.asp` script, leading to a classic SQL injection vulnerability. The application directly uses the provided `id` parameter in SQL queries without proper validation or escaping.
- **Impact of exploitation:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code. The provided exploits demonstrate how to insert a new user with administrative privileges into the `tbluser` table. This allows complete control of the web-based admin interface, leading to full control over the application and potentially the underlying server.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable `shopexd.asp` script. The attacker crafts a malicious URL by appending SQL injection code to the `id` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application. They do not need to be authenticated and can perform the injection remotely.

The provided content includes two exploit scripts in Perl, further confirming the vulnerability and demonstrating its exploitation:

- The first script (`tio-fux.pl`) uses the LWP::UserAgent module to send a crafted HTTP GET request that injects SQL code to create a new admin user.
- The second script (`tioeuy.pl`) utilizes lower-level socket programming to send a similar request for user injection.
