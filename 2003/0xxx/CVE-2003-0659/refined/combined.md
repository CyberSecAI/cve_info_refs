= Public disclosure on October 15, 2003
========================================================================

As past history has shown us, Windows has many buffer overflow resulting
from the mishandling of long file names or path names. This one is no
different.

== Description ==

Sending either a LB_DIR message to a listbox or a CB_DIR message to a
combobox, specifying a large pathname as the parameter will result in
the following event log message.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Event Type:       Error
Event Source:     Service Control Manager
Event Category:   None
Event ID:         7031
Description:
The [application] service terminated unexpectedly.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The LB_DIR and CB_DIR messages are defined as;

LB_DIR
  An application sends an LB_DIR message to add a list of filenames
  to a list box

  wParam = (WPARAM) (UINT) uAttrs;          // file attributes
  lParam = (LPARAM) (LPCTSTR) lpszFileSpec; // filename address
  lpszFileSpec
    Value of lParam. Pointer to the null-terminated string that
    specifies the filename to add to the list

CB_DIR
  An application sends a CB_DIR message to add a list of filenames
  to the list box of a combo box.

  wParam = (WPARAM) (UINT) uAttrs;          // file attributes
  lParam = (LPARAM) (LPCTSTR) lpszFileSpec; // address of filename
  lpszFileSpec
    Value of lParam. Pointer to the null-terminated string that
    specifies the filename to add to the list

== Exploitation ==

On Windows 2000, the utility manager runs under the localsystem account
and contains a listbox control that will accept messages from unprivileged
users, allowing for the escalation of privileges to localsystem level.

The following details are based on the exploitation of that listbox.

After sending a message with a large pathname utilman will cause an
exception within a call to wcscpy.

* From MSDN *
strcpy, wcscpy Copy a string.
    char *strcpy( char *strDestination, const char *strSource );
    wchar_t *wcscpy( wchar_t *strDestination, const wchar_t *strSource );

Parameters
   strDestination - Destination string
   strSource - Null-terminated source string

Remarks
The strcpy function copies strSource, including the terminating null
character, to the location specified by strDestination.
No overflow checking is performed when strings are copied or appended.
* End MSDN *

The exception occurs at this code location;

77F81E98   mov         dx,word ptr [ecx]
77F81E9B   mov         word ptr [esi],dx   <-- Exception
77F81E9E   inc         esi
77F81E9F   inc         esi
77F81EA0   inc         ecx
77F81EA1   inc         ecx
77F81EA2   test        dx,dx
77F81EA5   jne         77F81E98

At this point ESI has been incremented to much and is now pointing to an
invalid memory location. The registers look like this;

EAX = 007AF6DC EBX = 0000018D
ECX = 007E0924 EDX = 0000FFFF
ESI = 007B0000 EDI = 007E0000
EIP = 77F81E9B ESP = 007AF6AC
EBP = 007AFD6C EFL = 00000286

The area where the pathname has been copied to starts at 0x007AF6F7,
which is higher than ESP, but lower than EBP. The memory starting at EBP
now contains the data passed in the pathname, and any future reference
to EBP will reference this data.

007AFD6C  58 58 58 58 58  XXXXX
007AFD71  58 58 58 58 58  XXXXX
007AFD76  58 58 58 58 58  XXXXX
007AFD7B  58 58 58 58 58  XXXXX
007AFD80  58 58 58 58 58  XXXXX

Because an exception has occurred, and our pathname has overwritten the
exception handlers on the stack, an unhandled exception will occur when
execution flow reaches;

77F8EB6B   mov         ecx,dword ptr [ebp+18h]	<-- EBP points to buffer
77F8EB6E   call        ecx                      <-- We control ECX

At this point EBX points directly into the buffer and by correctly forming
the pathname, execution flow can be directed back into our buffer.

Standard stack based overflow techniques apply and exploits can be written
for either Unicode or non-Unicode depending on which API is used to send
the original message.

== Solutions ==

- Install the vendor supplied patch.
- Interactive processes should not run under a higher level account.

## Microsoft Windows ListBox and ComboBox controls vulnerable to buffer overflow when supplied crafted Windows message

#### Vulnerability Note VU#967668

Original Release Date: 2003-10-16 | Last Revised: 2003-10-22

---

### Overview

There is a buffer overflow in a function called by the Microsoft Windows ListBox and ComboBox controls that could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with privileges of the process hosting the controls.

### Description

| Processes that run on Windows use [messages](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/winui/WinUI/WindowsUserInterface/Windowing/MessagesandMessageQueues/AboutMessagesandMessageQueues.asp) in order to interact with the system and other processes. There is a buffer overflow in a function called by the Microsoft Windows ListBox and ComboBox controls. The function fails to properly validate the parameters that are sent from a crafted Windows Message. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with privileges of the process hosting the controls. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A local attacker can execute arbitrary code with privileges of the process hosting the controls, potentially gaining elevated privileges. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Apply a patch as described in [Microsoft Security Bulletin MS03-045](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS03-045.asp). |

## Former Director Richard Pethia

[Richard Pethia](/about/leadership/display.cfm?customel_datapageid_2623=3545) was founding director of the SEI's CERT Division. Pethia, who served as director of CERT from 1988 to 2016, guided the organization through tremendous growth and change. Under Pethia's leadership, the unit expanded and evolved from the CERT Coordination Center—a small group focused on computer incident response—to a research organization of more than 200 professionals dedicated to solving problems with widespread cybersecurity implications.

A vulnerability exists because the **ListBox** control and the **ComboBox** control both call a function, which is located in the User32.dll file, that contains a buffer overrun. The function does not correctly validate the parameters that are sent from a specially-crafted Windows message. Windows messages provide a way for interactive processes to react to user events (for example, keystrokes or mouse movements) and to communicate with other interactive processes. A security vulnerability exists because the function that provides the list of accessibility options to the user does not correctly validate Windows messages that are sent to it. One process in the interactive desktop could use a specific Windows message to cause the **ListBox** control or the **ComboBox** control to execute arbitrary code. Any program that implements the **ListBox** control or the **ComboBox** control could allow code to be executed at an elevated level of administrative credentials, as long as the program is running at an elevated level of privileges (for example, Utility Manager in Windows 2000). This could include third-party applications.

An attacker who had the ability to log on to a system interactively could run a program that could send a specially-crafted Windows message to any applications that have implemented the **ListBox** control or the **ComboBox** control, causing the application to take any action an attacker specified. This could give an attacker complete control over the system by using Utility Manager in Windows 2000.

**Mitigating factors:**

* An attacker must have valid logon credentials to exploit the vulnerability. The vulnerability could not be exploited remotely.
* Properly-secured systems are at little risk from this vulnerability. Standard best practices recommend only allowing trusted users to log on to systems interactively.
* Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 are affected by this vulnerability in the **ListBox** control and in the **ComboBox** control. However, in Windows XP and in Windows Server 2003, Utility Manager runs under the context of the logged-on user and does not allow for elevation of privileges. Windows NT 4.0 does not implement Utility Manager.

**Severity Rating:**

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Microsoft Windows NT 4.0** | Low |
| **Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition** | Low |
| **Microsoft Windows 2000** | Important |
| **Microsoft Windows XP** | Low |
| **Microsoft Windows Server 2003** | Low |

The above [assessment](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21140) is based on the types of systems that are affected by the vulnerability, their typical deployment patterns, and the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would have on them.

**Vulnerability identifier:** [CAN-2003-0659](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=can-2003-0659)

## Workarounds

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. These workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability however they help block known attack vectors. Workarounds may cause a reduction in functionality in some cases - in such situations this is identified below.

* **Disable the Utility Manager on all affected systems that do not need this feature through software polices**

Since the Utility Manager Service is a possible attack vector this can be disabled using software restriction polices within Active Directory or within the Local Security Policy. The Utility Manager process name is utilman.exe. You may use the following software restriction policy guides to help prevent users from accessing this file:

* [**Using Software Restriction Policies to Protect Against Unauthorized Software**](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/winxppro/maintain/rstrplcy.mspx)
* [**HOW TO: Use Software Restriction Policies in Windows Server 2003 (324036**)](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;324036)
* [**Protect Your System from Viruses (Using Software Restriction Polices**)](https://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/evaluation/features/antivirus.mspx)
* [**To create new software restriction policies**](https://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windowsserv/2003/standard/proddocs/srp_create_policy.asp)

**Impact of Vulnerability:**

The Utility Manager Service provides many of the accessibility features of the operating system. These would be unavailable until the restrictions are removed.

**I have Windows NT, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003 am I affected by the compatibility problems which only affect certain language versions of the patch?**

No - Windows 2000 Service Pack 4 is the only affected platform.

**I have Windows 2000 Service Pack 4 but a language in the 'not affected versions' am I affected by the compatibility problems which only affect certain language versions of the patch?**

No - You are only affected if you have Windows 2000 Service Pack 4 and one of the languages mentioned in the 'affected languages' section.

**Can I uninstall this patch?**

Yes - See the removal section for more information on how to uninstall this patch.

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a [buffer overrun](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/glossary) vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability on Windows 2000 could gain complete control over a system. This would give the attacker the ability to take any action that they want on a system such as adding, deleting, or modifying data. It could also give the attacker the ability to create or to delete user accounts, or to add accounts to the local administrators group.
The vulnerability could only be exploited by an attacker who has credentials to log on to the computer interactively. Since restricted users are not normally permitted to logon to mission critical server this vulnerability primarily of concern on workstations and terminal servers.
Any application that has implemented the **ListBox** control or the **ComboBox** control, which is in the User32.dll file, could allow code to be executed at an elevated level of privileges, as long as the program is running at an elevated level of privileges (for example, the Utility Manager utility in Windows 2000). This could include third-party applications.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

A vulnerability results because the **ListBox** control and the **ComboBox** control both call a function, which is located in the User32.dll file, that contains a buffer overrun. The function does not correctly validate the parameters that are sent from a specially-crafted Windows message.

**What is Utility Manager?**

Utility Manager is an [accessibility utility](https://www.microsoft.com/enable/at/default.aspx) that allows users to check the status of accessibility programs (for example, Microsoft Magnifier, Narrator, or On-Screen Keyboard) and to start or to stop them.

**What are Windows messages?**

Processes that run on Windows interact with the system and other processes by using [messages](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms644927.aspx). For example, each time the user presses a key on the keyboard, moves the mouse, or clicks a control such as a scroll bar, Windows generates a message. The purpose of this message is to alert the program that a user event has occurred and to deliver the data from that event to the program. Similarly, a program can generate messages to allow the various windows that it controls to communicate with each other.

**What is wrong with the way that Windows messages are handled by the List Box control?**

The vulnerability lies in the way that the function that both the **ListBox** control and the **ComboBox** control use to handle messages when the controls present the list of available accessibility functions to the user. The function that is called does not correctly validate Windows messages that are sent to it. When Utility Manager is running on Windows 2000, another process could run on the system and could send a specially-crafted message to Utility Manager. In Windows 2000, Utility Manager runs under the context of the Local System. This context has a higher level of administrative credentials than a logged-on user and could allow arbitrary code to be executed.

**Why does this pose a security vulnerability?**

The vulnerability in the **ListBox** control and in the **ComboBox** control could provide a way for a process to cause Utility Manager to run arbitrary code on Windows 2000. Although it is against best practice guidelines, a third-party application could use the **ListBox** control or in the **ComboBox** control under the context of the Local System.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

To exploit this vulnerability an attacker would first have to start Utility Manager on Windows 2000 and then could run a specially-designed application that could exploit the vulnerability in the **ListBox** control and the **ComboBox** control. In default configurations of Window 2000, Utility Manager is installed but is not running. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to gain complete control over the system on Windows 2000.

**Who could exploit the vulnerability?**

To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker must be able to log on to the system, start Utility Manager, and execute a program that sends a specially-crafted message to Utility Manager that exploits the vulnerability.

**What versions of the ListBox control or of the ComboBox control are vulnerable to this attack?**

Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 are affected by this vulnerability. However, the Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 versions of Utility Manager do not allow elevation of permissions because Utility Manager runs under the context of the logged-on user. Windows NT 4.0 does not implement Utility Manager however the vulnerable function is still present within User32.dll.

**I'm using Windows 2000, but I'm not using Utility Manager or any of the accessibility features, am I still vulnerable?**

Yes - Utility Manager is installed and enabled by default.

**Which systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers are only at risk if users who do not have sufficient administrative credentials are given the ability to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**Could the vulnerability be exploited over the Internet?**

No. The attacker must be able to log on to the specific system that they want to attack. The attacker cannot load and run a program remotely.

**What does the patch do?**

The patch addresses the vulnerability by changing way that the function used by the ListBox control and the ComboBox control use to handle Windows messages so that the parameters that are passed are correctly validated.
