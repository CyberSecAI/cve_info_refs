### General Information

## Technical Details

**Technical description:**

This is a cumulative update that includes the functionality of all the previously-released updates for Internet Explorer 5.01, Internet Explorer 5.5, and Internet Explorer 6.0. Additionally, it eliminates the following five newly-discovered vulnerabilities:

* Three vulnerabilities that involve the cross-domain security model of Internet Explorer, which keeps windows of different domains from sharing information. These vulnerabilities could result in the execution of script in the My Computer zone. To exploit one of these vulnerabilities, an attacker would have to host a malicious Web site that contains a Web page that is designed to exploit the particular vulnerability and then persuade a user to view the Web page. The attacker could also create an HTML e-mail message that designed to exploit one of these vulnerabilities and persuade the user to view the HTML e-mail message. After the user has visited the malicious Web site or viewed the malicious HTML e-mail message an attacker who exploited one of these vulnerabilities could access information from other Web sites, access files on a user's system, and run arbitrary code on a user's system. This code would run in the security context of the currently logged on user.
* A vulnerability that involves the way that zone information is passed to an XML object within Internet Explorer. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to read local files on a user's system. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have to host a malicious Web site that contains a Web page that is designed to exploit the particular vulnerability and then persuade a user to view the Web page. The attacker could also create an HTML e-mail message that is designed to exploit this vulnerability and persuade the user to view the HTML e-mail message. After the user visits the malicious Web site or views the malicious HTML e-mail message, the user would then be prompted to download an HTML file. If the user accepts the download of this HTML file, an attacker could read local files that are in a known location on the user's system.
* A vulnerability that involves performing a drag-and-drop operation during dynamic HTML (DHTML) events in Internet Explorer. This vulnerability could allow a file to be saved in a target location on the user's system if the user clicks a link. No dialog box would request that the user approve this download. To exploit one of these vulnerabilities, an attacker would have to host a malicious Web site that contains a Web page that has a specially-crafted link. The attacker would then have to persuade a user to click that link. The attacker could also create an HTML e-mail message that has a specially-crafted link, and then persuade the user to view the HTML e-mail message and then click the malicious link. If the user clicked this link, code of the attacker's choice could be saved on the user's computer in a targeted location.

As with the previous Internet Explorer cumulative updates that were released with bulletins [MS03-004](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/ms03-004), [MS03-015](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/ms03-015), [MS03-020](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/ms03-020), [MS03-032](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/ms03-032), and [MS03-040](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/ms03-040), this cumulative update causes the **window.showHelp( )** control to no longer work if you have not applied the HTML Help update. If you have installed the updated HTML Help control from Knowledge Base article [811630](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;811630), you will still be able to use HTML Help functionality after you apply this update.

**Mitigating factors:**

There are three common mitigating factors across all the vulnerabilities:

* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 runs in [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=d41b036c-e2e1-4960-99bb-9757f7e9e31b&displaylang;=en). This default configuration of Internet Explorer blocks automatic exploitation of this attack. If Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration has been disabled, the protections that are put in place that prevent these vulnerabilities from being automatically exploited would be removed.
* In the Web-based attack scenario, the attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit these vulnerabilities. An attacker would have no way to force a user to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, the attacker would have to lure them there, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site.
* By default, Outlook Express 6.0, Outlook 2002 and Outlook 2003 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. Additionally, Outlook 98 and 2000 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if the Outlook E-mail Security Update has been installed. The risk of attack from the HTML email vector can be significantly reduced if the following conditions are met:
  + You have applied the patch included with Microsoft Security bulletin [MS03-040](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/ms03-040).
  + You are using Internet Explorer 6 or later.
  + You are using the Microsoft Outlook Email Security Update or Microsoft Outlook Express 6.0 and higher, or Microsoft Outlook 2000 SP2 or higher in their default configuration.
* If an attacker exploited these vulnerabilities, they would gain only the same privileges as the user. Users whose accounts are configured to have few privileges on the system would be at less risk than ones who operate with administrative privileges.

In addition, there are two individual mitigating factors for the XML Object Vulnerability:

* A Web page that tried to exploit this vulnerability would present the user with a prompt to download an HTML file. An attacker could only access files on the user's system if the user accepted this prompt.
* An attacker can only access files that are in a known location on the user's system.

**Severity Rating:**

|  | Internet Explorer 5.01 SP2, SP3, SP4 | Internet Explorer 5.5 SP2 | Internet Explorer 6 and Internet Explorer 6 SP1 (All versions earlier than Windows Server 2003) | Internet Explorer 6 SP1 for Windows Server 2003 | Internet Explorer 6 SP1 for Windows Server 2003 (64-Bit) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

**Tested Versions:**

Microsoft tested Internet Explorer 5.01 Service Pack 2, Internet Explorer 5.01 Service Pack 3, Internet Explorer 5.01 Service Pack 4, Internet Explorer 5.5 Service Pack 2, Internet Explorer 6.0, and Internet Explorer 6.0 Service Pack 1 to assess whether they are affected by these vulnerabilities. Previous versions are no longer [supported](https://support.microsoft.com/directory/discontinue.asp), and may or may not be affected by these vulnerabilities.

## Workarounds

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds that apply across all the vulnerabilities. These workarounds help block known attack vectors, however they will not correct the underlying vulnerabilities. Workarounds may reduce functionality in some cases; in such cases, the reduction in functionality is identified below.

**Prompt before running ActiveX controls and active scripting in the Internet zone and in the Intranet zone**

You can help protect against these vulnerabilities by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to prompt before running ActiveX controls. To do this, follow these steps:

1. In Internet Explorer, click **Internet Options** on the **Tools** menu.
2. Click the **Security** tab.
3. Click **Internet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
4. Under **Settings**, in the **ActiveX controls and plug-ins** section, under **Run ActiveX controls and plug-ins**, click **Prompt**.
5. In the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click **Prompt**, and then click **OK**.
6. Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
7. Under **Settings**, in the **ActiveX controls and plug-ins** section, under **Run ActiveX controls and plug-ins**, click **Prompt**
8. In the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click **Prompt**.
9. Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer.

**Impact of Workaround:**

There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX controls. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running ActiveX controls is a global setting that affects all Internet and Intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click Yes to run ActiveX controls. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the "Restrict Web sites to only your trusted Web sites" workaround.

**Restrict Web sites to only your trusted Web sites**

After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX in the Internet zone and in the Intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to Internet Explorer's Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. Microsoft recommends that you only add sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

To do this, follow these steps:

1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
2. In the Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings box, click Trusted Sites, and then click Sites.
3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
4. In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer. Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your computer. One in particular that you may want to add is "\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com" (without the quotes). This is the site that will host the update, and it requires the use of an ActiveX control to install the update.

**Impact of Workaround:**

For those sites that you have not configured to be in your Trusted sites zone, their functionality will be impaired if they require the use of ActiveX controls to function correctly. Adding sites to your Trusted sites zone will allow them to be able to download the ActiveX control that they require to function correctly. However you should only add Web sites you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

**Install Outlook E-mail Security Update if you are using Outlook 2000 SP1 or earlier**

By default, the Outlook Email Security Update causes Outlook 98 and 2000 to open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. By default, Outlook Express 6.0, Outlook 2002, and Outlook 2003 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. Customers who use any of these products are at reduced risk from an e-mail-borne attack that tries to exploit this vulnerability, unless the user clicks a malicious link in the e-mail message.

**If you are using Outlook 2002 or Outlook Express 6.0 SP1 or later, read e-mail messages in plain text format to help protect yourself from the HTML e-mail attack vector**

Microsoft Outlook 2002 users who have applied Service Pack 1 or later and Outlook Express 6.0 users who have applied Service Pack 1 or later can enable a feature that will enable them to view all non-digitally-signed e-mail messages or non-encrypted e-mail messages in plain text only.

Digitally-signed e-mail messages and encrypted e-mail messages are not affected by the setting and may be read in their original formats. Information about how to enable this setting in Outlook 2002 can be found in the following Knowledge Base article:

[https:](https://)

Information about how to enable this setting in Outlook Express 6.0 can be found in the following Knowledge Base article:

</https:>[https:](https://)

**Impact of Workaround:**

E-mail that is viewed in plain text format cannot contain pictures, specialized fonts, animations, or other rich content. Additionally:

* The changes are applied to the preview pane and to open messages.
* Pictures become attachments to avoid loss of message content.
* Because the message is still in Rich Text Format or in HTML format in the store, the object model (custom code solutions) may behave unexpectedly because the message is still in Rich Text Format or in HTML format in the mail store.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Why are the version numbers for the files in the Internet Explorer 5.01 Service Pack 3 Security Update lower than the version numbers of the files in the Internet Explorer 5.01 Service Pack 3 Security Update described by** [**MS03-040**](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/ms03-040)**?**

Prior to this release the Internet Explorer 5.01 Service Pack 3 and the Internet Explorer 5.01 Service Pack 4 Security Updates were combined in a single package that installed on both platforms. In this release, these were separated to correct a problem with the **About** help screen on Internet Explorer 5.01 Service Pack 3. As part of this separation, the version numbers of the files in this package were lowered.

**Does the Internet Explorer 5.01 Service Pack 3 Security Update in this release contain all the fixes up to and including this release even though the files are a lower version number?**

Yes. Even though the file versions for the Internet Explorer Service Pack 3 Security Update are lower than previous Security Updates for this platform, it is still cumulative and includes all fixes in past Security Updates including this Security Update (MS03-048).

**Why is the update available for Windows 98 and Windows 98 Second Edition?**

While Windows 98 and Windows 98 Second Edition no longer qualify for no-charge or extended support, Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 and Internet Explorer 5.5 Service Pack 2 are supported on those operating systems until January 16, 2004 and December 31, 2003 respectively. See the [Internet Explorer FAQ](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;%5bln%5d;lifean2), the [Windows 98 and Windows 98 SE FAQ](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;%5bln%5d;lifean1) or the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle site](https://www.microsoft.com/lifecycle/) for additional information.

**What vulnerabilities are eliminated by this update?**

This is a cumulative update that incorporates the functionality of all previously released updates for Internet Explorer. Additionally, this update eliminates the following newly reported vulnerabilities:

* Three vulnerabilities that could allow an attacker to cause arbitrary code to run on the user's system.
* A vulnerability that could allow an attacker to access local files and cookies on a user's system.
* A vulnerability that could allow an attacker to save arbitrary code on the user's system.

**Does the update contain any other security changes?**

Yes. This update also sets the [kill bit](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;q240797&id;=kb;en-us;q240797) on the following ActiveX controls:

| Description | File Name | CLSID |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Windows Trouble Shooter | Tshoot.ocx | 4B106874-DD36-11D0-8B44-00A024DD9EFF |
| SymantecÂ® RuFSI Registry Information Class | Rufsi.dll | 69DEAF94-AF66-11D3-BEC0-00105AA9B6AE |
| RAV Online Scanner | Ravonine.cab | D32C3BAD-5213-49BD-A7D5-E6DE6C0D8249 |

These controls have been found to contain security vulnerabilities and are no longer supported by Internet Explorer. To protect customers who have this control installed, this update helps prevent the control from running or from being reintroduced onto users' systems by setting the kill bit for this control. In the cases where a kill-bit is set on a 3rd party control, the setting has been made with the permission of the owner. A kill-bit can be set for any control manually by following the instructions in the Knowledge Base article [Q240797](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;q240797&id;=kb;en-us;q240797).

**I am running Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003. Does this mitigate these vulnerabilities?**

Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 runs in a restricted mode that is known as Enhanced Security Configuration.

**What is Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration?**

Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured Internet Explorer settings that reduce the likelihood of a user or of an administrator downloading and running malicious Web content on a server. Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration reduces this risk by modifying numerous security-related settings, including the settings on the **Security** and the **Advanced** tab in the **Internet Options** dialog box. Some of the important modifications include:

* Security level for the Internet zone is set to High. This setting disables scripts, ActiveX controls, Microsoft Java Virtual Machine (MSJVM), HTML content, and file downloads.
* Automatic detection of intranet sites is disabled. This setting assigns all intranet Web sites and all Universal Naming Convention (UNC) paths that are not explicitly listed in the Local intranet zone to the Internet zone.
* Install On Demand and non-Microsoft browser extensions are disabled. This setting prevents Web pages from automatically installing components and prevents non-Microsoft extensions from running.
* Multimedia content is disabled. This setting prevents music, animations, and video clips from running.

Disabling Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration would remove the protections that are put in place to help prevent this vulnerability from being exploited. For more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration, see the Managing Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration guide.

**Is there any configuration of Windows Server 2003 that is likely to have Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration disabled?**

Yes. Systems Administrators who have deployed Windows Server 2003 as a Terminal Server would likely disable Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration to allow users of the Terminal Server to use Internet Explorer in an unrestricted mode.

**CAN-2003-0814, CAN-2003-0815, CAN-2003-0816: ExecCommand, Function Pointer Override, and Script URL Cross-Domain Vulnerabilities Could Allow Remote Code Execution**

**What is the scope of these vulnerabilities?**

These vulnerabilities could allow a malicious Web site operator to access information in another Internet or intranet domain or on the user's local system by injecting specially-crafted code when the browser parses specially formatted Script URLs. This could also allow an attacker to run an executable file of their choice on the user's system. Although these vulnerabilities are all subtly different, the effects are the same.

**What causes these vulnerabilities?**

These vulnerabilities result because three different programming functions can bypass the cross-domain security model that Internet Explorer implements.

**What is the cross-domain security model that Internet Explorer implements?**

One of the principal security functions of a browser is to ensure that browser windows that are under the control of different Web sites cannot interfere with each other or access each other's data, while allowing windows from the same site to interact with each other. To differentiate between cooperative and uncooperative browser windows, the concept of a "domain" has been created. A domain is a security boundary - any open windows within the same domain can interact with each other, but windows from different domains cannot. The cross-domain security model is the part of the security architecture that keeps windows from different domains from interfering with each other.
The simplest example of a domain is associated with Web sites. If you visit <https://www.microsoft.com>, and it opens a window to <https://www.microsoft.com/security>, the two windows can interact with each other because both sites belong to the same domain, <https://www.microsoft.com>. However, if you visited <https://www.microsoft.com>, and it opened a window to a different Web site, the cross-domain security model would protect the two windows from each other. The concept goes even further. The file system on your local computer is also a domain. For example, <https://www.microsoft.com> could open a window and show you a file on your hard disk. However, because your local file system is in a different domain from the Web site, the cross-domain security model should prevent the Web site from reading the file that is being displayed.
The Internet Explorer cross-domain security model can be configured by using the security zone settings in Internet Explorer.

**What are Internet Explorer security zones?**

Internet Explorer [security zones](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;q174360) are a system that divides online content into categories or zones based on its trustworthiness. Specific Web domains can be assigned to a zone, depending on how much trust is placed in the content of each domain. The zone then restricts the capabilities of the Web content, based on the zone's policy. By default, most Internet domains are treated as part of the Internet zone, which has default policy that prevents scripts and other active code from accessing resources on the local system.

**What is wrong with the way Internet Explorer calculates cross domain security?**

Internet Explorer evaluates security when one Web Page requests access to resources in another security zone. However, there are three vulnerabilities in how the security is calculated when three different programming functions are used. As a result, an attacker can bypass the security checks. Although these vulnerabilities are all subtly different, the effects are the same.

**What could these vulnerabilities enable an attacker to do?**

An attacker could use these vulnerabilities to create a Web page that could allow the attacker to access data across domains. This could include accessing information from other Web sites, from local files on the system, or from running executable files that already exist on the local file system. This could also include running executable files of the attacker's choice on the user's local file system.

**How could an attacker exploit these vulnerabilities?**

An attacker could seek to exploit these vulnerabilities by creating a malicious Web page or an HTML e-mail message and then enticing the user to visit this page or to view the HTML e-mail message. When the user visited the page or viewed the e-mail message, the attacker could cause script to run in the security context of the My Computer zone.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Any system that has Internet Explorer installed is at risk from these vulnerabilities. This update should be installed immediately on all systems. However, these vulnerabilities require a user to be logged on and to be using Internet Explorer for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where Internet Explorer is actively used (such as user's workstations) are at the most risk from these vulnerabilities. Systems where Internet Explorer is not actively used (such as most server systems) are at a reduced risk.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerabilities by ensuring that the correct cross domain security checks take place whenever the affected programming functions are used.

**CAN-2003-0817: XML Object Vulnerability Could Allow Information Disclosure**

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability involves how zone information is passed to an XML document in Internet Explorer and could result in an attacker being able to read local files on a user's system. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have to host a malicious Web site that contained a Web page that is designed to exploit this particular vulnerability and then persuade a user to visit that site. After the user had visited the malicious Web site, an attacker could read local files from a known location on the user's system.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability results because Internet Explorer improperly validates the path when binding content to a XML document. As a result, local file content can be bound to an XML document from the Internet zone or from the intranet zone.

**What is an XML document?**

An XML document is a representation of the World Wide Web Consortium's (W3C) Document Object Model (DOM) [Level 1 Core](https://www.w3.org/tr/rec-dom-level-1/) and the [DOM Level 2 Core](https://www.w3.org/tr/dom-level-2-core/). These documents provide standards-based support for processing XML. For more information about XML documents, visit [MSDN](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/system.xml.xmldocument%28vs.71%29.aspx).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker that successfully exploited this vulnerability could obtain a list of recently visited Web sites, grab session information from the user's cookie files, or access data in files that are stored in a known location on the user's file system.

**How could an attacker exploit this vulnerability?**

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have to host a malicious Web site or an HTML e-mail message that contained a Web page that is designed to exploit this particular vulnerability and then persuade a user to visit that site or view the e-mail message. After the user viewed the Web site or the HTML e-mail message, they would be prompted to download an HTML file. If the user accepted the download of this HTML file, an attacker could read local files on the user's system.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Any system that has Internet Explorer installed is at risk from this vulnerability and this update should be installed immediately on all systems. However, this vulnerability requires a user to be logged on and to be using Internet Explorer for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where Internet Explorer is actively used (such as user's workstations) are at the most risk from this vulnerability. Systems where Internet Explorer is not actively used (such as most server systems) are at a reduced risk.

**What does the update do?**

The update corrects the vulnerability by ensuring that the path is properly evaluated when binding content to a data object. As a result, local file content cannot be bound to a XML object from the Internet zone or from the Intranet zone.

**CAN-2003-0823: Drag and Drop Vulnerability Could Allow Arbitrary Code to be Saved on User's System**

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability involves the Drag and Drop event in Internet Explorer and could result in a file being saved on the user's system when the user clicked a link. The user would not receive a dialog box requesting to approve the download. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have to host a malicious Web site that contained a Web page with a link that is designed to exploit this particular vulnerability and then persuade a user to visit that site. If the user clicked the malicious link, any code of the attacker's choice could be saved in a target location on the user's computer.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability is caused by Drag and Drop technology improperly validating certain Dynamic HTML (DHTML) events. As a result, a file could be downloaded to the user's system after the user clicks a link.

**What are DHTML events?**

DHTML events are special actions that are provided by the DHTML Object Model. These events can be used in script code to add dynamic content to a Web site. For more information about DHTML events, visit [MSDN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/author/dhtml/reference/events.asp).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could save code of their choice to the user's local file system. Although this code could not be executed through this vulnerability directly, the operating system might open the file if it is dropped to a sensitive location, or a user may click the file inadvertently, causing the attacker's code to be executed.

**How could an attacker exploit this vulnerability?**

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have to host a malicious Web site that contained a Web page with a link that is designed to exploit this particular vulnerability and then persuade a user to visit that site. If the user clicked the malicious link, any code of the attacker's choice could be saved on the user's computer in a targeted location.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Any system that has Internet Explorer installed is at risk from this vulnerability, and this update should be installed immediately on all systems. However, this vulnerability requires a user to be logged on and to be using Internet Explorer for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where Internet Explorer is actively used (such as user's workstations) are at the most risk from this vulnerability. Systems where Internet Explorer is not actively used (such as most server systems) are a reduced risk.

**What does the update do?**

This update corrects this vulnerability by correctly evaluating Drag and Drop operations during DHTML events.

dragNdrop!
for image, it copies file.
for link, it creates shortcut.

but, some guy is lazy.
he moves the window instead of the mouse.
then a click event(mousedown&mouseup) becomes
mousedown&mousemove&mouseup == dragNdrop.

then "POF VER" in the "[demo]" section shows a click
indeed can be transformed into a dragNdrop.
then "ATTACK VER" in the "[demo]" section drags my
homepage to your favorite list.

## Microsoft Internet Explorer allows mouse events to manipulate window objects and perform "drag and drop" operations

#### Vulnerability Note VU#413886

Original Release Date: 2004-02-02 | Last Revised: 2004-10-28

---

### Overview

Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) dynamic HTML ([DHTML](http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/author/dhtml/reference/dhtml_reference_entry.asp)) mouse events can manipulate windows to copy objects from one domain to another, including the Local Machine Zone. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to write arbitrary files to the local file system.

### Description

| In IE, certain DHTML events monitor mouse actions and are permitted to call proprietary DHTML methods that manipulate window objects. This technique can be used to create "drag and drop" operations by moving a window under an object that has registered a mouse event.  In a publicly available exploit (HijackClick, 2003-09-10), a mouse event calls a script function that invokes methods to move and resize one browser window over another. The background window contains an object (in this case, the user's Favorites directory) instantiated by a reference to a ShellNameSpace ActiveX object. The result is a new bookmark (the address of the foreground window) added to the user's Favorites list (the object in the background window). Other objects expose the local file system in this manner, for example, the user's Startup folder (shell:startup).The update issued in MS03-048 defeats this attack vector by denying mouse events access to certain proprietary window manipulation methods: window.resizeBy(), window.resizeTo(), window.moveBy(), and window.moveTo(). The patch does not, however, prevent mouse events from calling functions that reference these methods. Using a function to reference an otherwise inaccessible method has been termed "method caching" or "SaveRef." Method caching is used in a second exploit (HijackClickV2, 2003-11-25) to bypass the restriction imposed by the MS03-048 patch. A third exploit (HijackClick 3, 2004-07-12) uses the popup.show() method.The first attack vector, demonstrated by HijackClick, is addressed in MS03-048, and is assigned [CAN-2003-0823](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0823). The second attack vector, demonstrated by HijackClickV2, is addressed in MS04-004, and is assigned [CAN-2003-1027](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-1027). The third attack vector, demonstrated by HijackClick 3, is addressed by [MS04-038](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms04-038.mspx) ("Script in Image Tag File Download Vulnerability") and Windows XP Service Pack 2, and is assigned [CAN-2004-0841](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0841).There seems to be one underlying vulnerability: Mouse events are allowed to manipulate windows to simulate a drag and drop operation. The user does not intentionally perform the operation, and receives no warning dialog. Simulated drag and drop operations can be used to copy arbitrary files from a browser window to the local file system. This is an indirect violation of the cross-domain security model, since script in one domain can transfer data into a different domain, including the Local Machine Zone. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By convincing a victim to click on a link in an HTML document (web page, HTML email), an attacker could write arbitrary files to a vulnerable system within the security context of the user running IE. These files could contain code that could be executed through other means. [MS04-004](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS04-004.asp) elaborates: "Although this code could not be executed through this vulnerability directly, the operating system might open the file if it is dropped to a sensitive location, or a user may click the file inadvertently, causing the attacker's code to be executed." One example of a "sensitive location" is the user's Startup folder (shell:startup).In combination with a vulnerability in the way IE handles files for drag and drop operations (VU#526089), an attacker could write arbitrary files by convincing a user to click anywhere within the attacker's HTML document or on the scroll bar of the document window. Given the ability to spoof GUI elements, including the entire desktop (VU#490708), an attacker could easily convince a user to click on the attacker's HTML document. |

### Solution

| **Apply a patch**Apply the patch (834707) referenced in Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS04-038](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS04-038.asp) ("Script in Image Tag File Download Vulnerability"). |
| --- |

| **Upgrade to Windows XP Service Pack 2**Service Pack 2 for Windows XP addresses all three attack vectors.**Disable Active scripting and ActiveX controls**For systems not running Windows XP SP2, disable Active scripting and ActiveX controls for untrusted sites. At a minimum, disable Active scripting in the Internet zone and the zone used by Outlook, Outlook Express, or any other software that uses the WebBrowser ActiveX control or the IE HTML rendering engine (MSHTML). Instructions for disabling Active scripting and ActiveX controls can be found in the [Malicious Web Scripts FAQ](http://www.cert.org/tech_tips/malicious_code_FAQ.html#steps).**Apply the Outlook Email Security Update**Another way to effectively disable Active scripting and ActiveX controls in Outlook is to install the Outlook Email Security Update. The update configures Outlook to open email messages in the Restricted Sites Zone, where Active scripting and ActiveX controls are disabled by default. In addition, the update provides further protection against malicious code that attempts to propagate via Outlook. The Outlook Email Security Update is available for [Outlook 98](http://office.microsoft.com/downloads/9798/Out98sec.aspx) and [Outlook 2000](http://office.microsoft.com/downloads/2000/Out2ksec.aspx). The functionality of the Outlook Email Security Update is included in Outlook 2002 and Outlook Express 6.**Render email in plain text**Configure email client software (mail user agent [MUA]) to render email messages in plaint text. Instructions to configure Outlook 2002 and Outlook Express 6 are available in Microsoft Knowledge Base Articles [307594](http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=307594) and [291387](http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=291387), respectively. HTML-formatted email messages may not appear properly, however script will not be evaluated, thus preventing certain types of attacks.**Maintain updated antivirus software**[Antivirus software](http://www.cert.org/other_sources/viruses.html#VI) with updated virus definitions may identify and prevent some exploit attempts. Variations of exploits or attack vectors may not be detected. Do not rely on antivirus software to defend against this vulnerability.**Use a different web browser**There are a number of significant vulnerabilities in technologies relating to the IE domain/zone security model, the DHTML object model, MIME type determination, the graphical user interface (GUI), and ActiveX. It is possible to reduce exposure to these vulnerabilities by using a different web browser, especially when browsing untrusted sites. Such a decision may, however, reduce the functionality of sites that require IE-specific features such as DHTML, VBScript, and ActiveX. Note that using a different web browser will not remove IE from a Windows system, and other programs may invoke IE, the WebBrowser ActiveX control (WebOC), or the HTML rendering engine (MSHTML). |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
