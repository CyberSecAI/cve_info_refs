      "cve_id": "CVE-2003-0823",
      "source": "docs.microsoft.com_f2417219_20250125_214523.html",
      "details": "The vulnerability involves performing a drag-and-drop operation during dynamic HTML (DHTML) events in Internet Explorer. This vulnerability could allow a file to be saved in a target location on the user's system if the user clicks a link. No dialog box would request that the user approve this download.\n\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have to host a malicious Web site that contains a Web page that has a specially-crafted link. The attacker would then have to persuade a user to click that link. The attacker could also create an HTML e-mail message that has a specially-crafted link, and then persuade the user to view the HTML e-mail message and then click the malicious link. If the user clicked this link, code of the attacker's choice could be saved on the user's computer in a targeted location.",
        "root_cause": "Improper validation of Drag and Drop operations during DHTML events.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of DHTML events",
        "Lack of user confirmation for drag-and-drop operations"
      ],
      "impact": "Arbitrary code can be saved on the user's system. Although the code cannot be executed directly through the vulnerability, the operating system might open the file if it's dropped to a sensitive location, or the user might inadvertently click it, causing it to be executed.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Malicious website containing a specially crafted link",
        "HTML email with a malicious link"
       ],
       "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to host a malicious website or send an HTML email. The attacker needs to convince the victim to visit the webpage or view the email and click the malicious link."

      "source": "marc.info_ab28c4f2_20250125_214520.html",
      "details": "The vulnerability involves a drag-and-drop issue where a click event can be transformed into a drag-and-drop action by moving the window instead of the mouse. This allows an attacker to copy files or create shortcuts on the user's system.",
        "root_cause": "Manipulation of mouse events to simulate drag-and-drop.",
      "weaknesses": [
          "Incorrect handling of mouse events and window manipulation during drag-and-drop operations",
           "Lack of proper validation of click events being transformed into drag-and-drop"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can copy files or create shortcuts on the user's system without user consent. In the provided example, the attacker adds their homepage to the user's favorites.",
      "attack_vectors": [
          "Malicious website"

     "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to host a malicious webpage that contains specially crafted code using drag-and-drop functionality"

      "source": "www.kb.cert.org_40dbdf6e_20250125_214522.html",
      "details": "The vulnerability allows mouse events to manipulate window objects and perform 'drag and drop' operations, potentially writing arbitrary files to the local file system. This is achieved by moving a window under an object that has registered a mouse event. Specifically, certain DHTML mouse events can call proprietary DHTML methods to manipulate window objects, simulating drag-and-drop operations. The user does not perform the operation intentionally and does not receive a warning dialog.",
        "root_cause": "Improper handling of DHTML events, allowing for manipulation of window objects to simulate drag and drop operations.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "DHTML mouse events can manipulate window objects",
        "Proprietary DHTML methods can be used to manipulate window objects to perform unintended drag-and-drop operations.",
        "Lack of user warning dialogs for drag-and-drop actions",
           "Indirect violation of the cross-domain security model"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can write arbitrary files to the local file system without user knowledge or consent. This could be used to execute code through other means.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Convincing the user to click a link within an HTML document (web page, HTML email)",
           "Spoofing GUI elements to trick users to click on a malicious document."
         ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to convince a user to click a link on a web page or in an HTML email. The attacker can also spoof GUI elements."
