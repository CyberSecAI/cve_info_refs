Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `FNDWRR` CGI program, specifically when handling overly long URLs. This program is part of the Oracle E-Business Suite and is used to retrieve report output.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The `FNDWRR` program does not properly validate the length of input data received through the URL, leading to a buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to gain control of the `FNDWRR` process, potentially executing arbitrary code on the server. This could lead to a complete compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable via a web browser by crafting an overly long URL that is sent to the `FNDWRR` CGI program.
- **Web Browser:** The attack vector utilizes a standard web browser to send the malicious request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server running the Oracle E-Business Suite.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the buffer overflow in the `FNDWRR` CGI program and how to exploit it with a malicious URL.

**Additional Information:**
- The affected versions of Oracle E-Business Suite are 11.0 and 11.5.1 through 11.5.8, across all platforms (Unix and Windows).
- Oracle has released patches (Patch 2919943) to address the vulnerability, which should be applied immediately, especially on Internet-facing servers.
- The `FNDWRR` program is named "FNDWRR.exe" on both Unix and Windows platforms
- The vulnerability was discovered by Stephen Kost of Integrigy Corporation.
