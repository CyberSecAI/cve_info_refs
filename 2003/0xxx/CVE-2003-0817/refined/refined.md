Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2003-0817:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way Internet Explorer passes zone information to an XML object. Specifically, Internet Explorer improperly validates the path when binding content to an XML document. This allows content from the Internet or intranet zone to be bound to an XML document which should not be allowed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper validation of the path when binding content to an XML document.
- The ability to bypass security checks that should prevent cross-zone access to local files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can read local files on a user's system if they are in a known location. This could include sensitive information such as recently visited websites, session information from cookies, or other data stored in specific directories.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Web Site:** An attacker hosts a website containing a page designed to exploit the vulnerability.
- **HTML Email:** An attacker crafts an HTML email message to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to host a malicious webpage or send a specially crafted HTML email.
- The attacker must then persuade a user to visit the malicious website or open the email.
- The user must be using a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer.
- The attacker needs knowledge of known locations of files on the victim's system for effective exploitation.
- The user needs to accept a prompt to download a malicious HTML file.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Internet Explorer 5.5 SP2, Internet Explorer 6, and Internet Explorer 6 SP1 versions prior to Windows Server 2003.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" for Internet Explorer 5.5 SP2, and "Low" for the server versions of IE.
- Microsoft provides workarounds including prompting before running ActiveX controls and active scripting or restricting to only trusted websites.
