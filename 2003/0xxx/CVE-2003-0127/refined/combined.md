## ptrace contains vulnerability allowing for local root compromise

#### Vulnerability Note VU#628849

Original Release Date: 2004-04-16 | Last Revised: 2004-04-30

---

### Overview

A vulnerability in the Linux 2.2 and 2.4 distributions of ptrace() may permit a local attacker to gain elevated privileges.

### Description

| The Linux 2.2 and 2.4 kernels contained a flaw in ptrace(). This vulnerability may permit a local user to have the kernel spawn a child process. From the man page:  *The ptrace system call provides a means by which a parent process may observe and control the execution of another process, and examine and change its core image and registers. It is primarily used to implement breakpoint debugging and system call tracing.*If the kernel is built with modules and kernel module loader enabled and /proc/sys/kernel/modprobe contains the path to a valid executable and ptrace() calls are not blocked, then a local user may be able to exploit this vulnerability to gain root privileges to the system.The CERT/CC has seen active exploitation of this vulnerability. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A local user can exploit this vulnerability to gain elevated privileges, typically root. |
| --- |

### Solution

| This vulnerability has been resolved in Linux 2.2.25 and 2.4.21. Various vendors have also released advisories and updates. Please see the your vendor's advisory for more details. |

GENTOO LINUX SECURITY ANNOUNCEMENT 200303-17
- - ---------------------------------------------------------------------

 PACKAGE : kernel
 SUMMARY : ptrace flaw
 DATE : 2003-03-21 08:59 UTC
 EXPLOIT : local
VERSIONS AFFECTED : All except 2.5
 FIXED VERSION : Kernels with patch applied
 CVE : CAN-2003-0127

- - ---------------------------------------------------------------------

- From advisory:

"The Linux 2.2 and Linux 2.4 kernels have a flaw in ptrace. This hole
allows local users to obtain full privileges. Remote exploitation of
this hole is not possible. Linux 2.5 is not believed to be vulnerable."

Read the full advisory at:
<http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=104791735604202&w=2>

SOLUTION

It is recommended that all Gentoo Linux users upgrade their kernels.

If you are running any of gentoo-sources, gs-sources, pfeifer-sources
sparc-sources or xfs-sources updates are available. Sync your tree and
run emerge <package> to install the latest version of the package. Then
compile and install your new kernel and reboot.

If you are using an other kernel package which hasn't been updated or
download your own sources you can download a patch from
<http://cvs.gentoo.org/~aliz/linux-2.4.20-ptrace.patch>
and manually patch your kernel.

| EnGarde Secure Linux Security Advisory March 18, 2003 |
| <http://www.engardelinux.org/> ESA-20030318-009 |
| |
| Package: kernel |
| Summary: several vulnerabilities. |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 EnGarde Secure Linux is a secure distribution of Linux that features
 improved access control, host and network intrusion detection, Web
 based secure remote management, e-commerce, and integrated open source
 security tools.

OVERVIEW
- --------
 This update fixes several vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel.

 CAN-2002-1380
 -------------
 Local users could cause a denial of service by using the mmap()
 function with the PROT\_READ parameter to access memory pages via the
 /proc/pid/mem interface.

 CAN-2003-0001
 -------------
 Most of the Ethernet card (NIC) device drivers did not pad frames with
 null bytes, leading to the potential leakage of kernel memory.

 CAN-2003-0127
 -------------
 There is a vulnerability in the kernel module loader which could
 allow a local attacker to obtain root privileges by using ptrace to
 attach to a child process spawned by the kernel when a new module is
 loaded.

 The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
 assigned the names CAN-2002-1380, CAN-2003-0001, and CAN-2003-0127 to
 these issues.

 All users are recommended to upgrade immediately using the special
 SOLUTION in this advisory.

SOLUTION
- --------
 Users of the EnGarde Professional edition can use the Guardian Digital
 Secure Network to update their systems automatically.

 EnGarde Community users should upgrade to the most recent version
 as outlined in this advisory. Updates may be obtained from:

ftp://ftp.engardelinux.org/pub/engarde/stable/updates/
<http://ftp.engardelinux.org/pub/engarde/stable/updates/>

 Please read and understand this entire section before you attempt to
 upgrade the kernel.

 Initial Steps
 -------------
 1) Verify the machine is either:

 a) booted into a "standard" kernel; or
 b) LIDS is disabled (/sbin/lidsadm -S -- -LIDS\_GLOBAL)

 2) Determine which kernels you currently have installed:

 # rpm -qa --qf "%{NAME}\" | grep kernel

 3) Download the new kernels that match what you have installed
 (based on step 2) from the "UPDATED PACKAGES" section of this
 advisory.

 Installation Steps
 ------------------
 4) Install the new packages. The packages will automagically
 update /etc/lilo.conf by commenting out any old EnGarde images
 and replacing them with the new ones:

 # rpm --replacefiles -i kernel1 kernel2 ...

 5) Re-run LILO. If you see any errors then open /etc/lilo.conf in
 your favorite text editor and make the appropriate changes:

 # /sbin/lilo

 Final Steps
 -----------
 6) If you did not see any LILO errors then your new kernel is now
 installed and your machine is ready to be rebooted:

 # reboot

UPDATED PACKAGES
- ----------------
 These updated packages are for EnGarde Secure Linux Community
 Edition.
