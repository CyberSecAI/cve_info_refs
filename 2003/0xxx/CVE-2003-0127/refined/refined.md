{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A vulnerability in the Linux 2.2 and 2.4 kernels related to the ptrace() system call.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The ptrace() system call allowed a parent process to observe and control the execution of another process. When combined with the kernel's module loading mechanism, it allowed a local user to spawn a child process with elevated privileges."
    ],
    "impact": "A local user could exploit this vulnerability to gain elevated privileges, typically root access to the system.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access is required. An attacker would need to execute code on the vulnerable system.",
	   "The vulnerability is triggered by a local user leveraging the ptrace system call in conjunction with a kernel module loader that has a path to a valid executable defined in /proc/sys/kernel/modprobe."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": [
      "Local user access to a vulnerable Linux system with kernel module loader enabled and a valid executable in `/proc/sys/kernel/modprobe`",
       "Ability to execute code on the target system."
    ],
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability was actively exploited. The vulnerability has been resolved in Linux 2.2.25 and 2.4.21. Several vendors released advisories and updates. The CERT/CC identified the issue as VU#628849."
