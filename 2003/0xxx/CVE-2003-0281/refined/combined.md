# Buffer Overflow in Firebird — GLSA **200405-18**

A buffer overflow via environmental variables in Firebird may allow a local
user to manipulate or destroy local databases and trojan the Firebird
binaries.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-db/firebird** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.5** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.5** |

### Background

Firebird is an open source relational database that runs on Linux,
Windows, and various UNIX systems.

### Description

A buffer overflow exists in three Firebird binaries (gds\_inet\_server,
gds\_lock\_mgr, and gds\_drop) that is exploitable by setting a large
value to the INTERBASE environment variable.

### Impact

An attacker could control program execution, allowing privilege
escalation to the UID of Firebird, full access to Firebird databases,
and trojaning the Firebird binaries. An attacker could use this to
compromise other user or root accounts.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround.

### Resolution

All users should upgrade to the latest version of Firebird:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=dev-db/firebird-1.5"
 # emerge ">=dev-db/firebird-1.5"
```

Site   : <http://www.snosoft.com>

======================================================================

.: Description:
---------------
interbase-6.0-1.i386.rpm provided with Mandrake 7.2 contains an issue
when reading the enivornment variable "INTERBASE". This issue is
demonstrated below.

[dotslash@ghetto dotslash]$ export INTERBASE=`perl -e 'print "A" x 500'`
[dotslash@ghetto dotslash]$ /usr/local/interbase/bin/gds_drop
Segmentation fault

This issue results in a malloc() overflow.

The following suid root binaries are potentially exploitable.

/usr/local/interbase/bin/gds_drop
/usr/local/interbase/bin/gds_inet_server
/usr/local/interbase/bin/gds_lock_mgr

(gdb) r
Starting program: /usr/local/interbase/bin/gds_drop

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

#4  0x0804a244 in ISC_get_config ()
#5  0x41414141 in ?? ()

.: Impact:
----------

local root can be exploited.

[dotslash@ghetto dotslash]$ id
uid=501(dotslash) gid=1214(snosoft) groups=1214(snosoft),501(dotslash)
[dotslash@ghetto dotslash]$ /etc/hackme/done/interbase_gds_drop_exploit
sh-2.05# id
uid=0(root) gid=1214(snosoft) groups=1214(snosoft),501(dotslash)

.: Systems Affected:
--------------------

This ships with Mandrake 7.2 on one of the extra CD's. If you have
installed from the following packages you should consider yourself
vulnerable: interbase-6.0-1.i386.rpm or ib_source601.tar.gz

.: Solution:
------------

The source code contains numerous strcat() calls ... it was difficult
to tell which actually caused the problem.

Borland.com was notified ... the status on a fix is unknown. Due to
lack of access to version 6.5 it is unknown if current versions are
affected.

---[BACKGROUND

Firebird is a relational database offering many ANSI SQL-92 features
that runs on Linux, Windows, and a variety of Unix platforms. Firebird
offers excellent concurrency, high performance, and powerful language
support for stored procedures and triggers. It has been used in
production systems, under a variety of names since 1981.

For more information on Firebird and InterBase, see:

<http://sourceforge.net/projects/firebird/>
<http://www.ibphoenix.com/>
<http://www.interbase2000.org/>
<http://www.interbase.com/>
<http://www.firebirdsql.org/>

--[DESCRIPTION

Firebird has 3 binarys [gds_inet_server, gds_drop, and gds_lock_mgr],
which all use insufficent bounds checking in conjunction with getenv(),
making each one
succeptable to local exploitation.

Firebird is by default setuid[firebird]. This exploit can lead to
root/escalated
privileges, should the attacker trojan the local firebird application.

--[ANALYSIS

Upon setting a large value for the INTERBASE environment variable a buffer
can be overflowed. Links to the exploit should accompany this advisory.

--[Please note that there is an exploit written for both versions of
firebird.

Exploiting this hole will allow the attacker to, amongst other things,
manipulate and/or destroy the databases, and also add the option to trojan
the firebird binaries. This will in effect allow for compromising of other
users/root accounts.

--[SYSTEMS AFFECTED:

firebird 1.0.0 [BSD/Linux] are vulnerable.
firebird-1.0.2 [BSD/Linux] are vulnerable.

--[Misc

As stated earlier, Linux is also vulnerable. The problem here
is that Linux by defaults sets firebird setuid root. There
exist a few more problems with linux. For example some command
line overflows with certain switches will allow the attacker
to change the flow of execution, of it can be changed using
the enviroment variable [FIREBIRD_LOCK].

This whole package should be revised before the next release.

Firebird  offers excellent concurrency, high performance, and powerful language  support for stored procedures and triggers. It has been used in  production systems, under a variety of names since 1981.     For more information on Firebird and InterBase, see:    <http://sourceforge.net/projects/firebird/>  <http://www.ibphoenix.com/>  <http://www.interbase2000.org/>  <http://www.interbase.com/>  <http://www.firebirdsql.org/>      --[DESCRIPTION    Firebird has 3 binarys [gds_inet_server, gds_drop, and gds_lock_mgr],  which all use insufficent bounds checking in conjunction with getenv(),   making each one  succeptable to local exploitation.    Firebird is by default setuid[firebird]. This exploit can lead to   root/escalated   privileges, should the attacker trojan the local firebird application.        --[ANALYSIS    Upon setting a large value for the INTERBASE environment variable a buffer  can be overflowed. Links to the exploit should accompany this advisory.     --[Please note that there is an exploit written for both versions of   firebird.    Exploiting this hole will allow the attacker to, amongst other things,  manipulate and/or destroy the databases, and also add the option to trojan  the firebird binaries. This will in effect allow for compromising of other  users/root accounts.    --[SYSTEMS AFFECTED:    firebird 1.0.0 [BSD/Linux] are vulnerable.  firebird-1.0.2 [BSD/Linux] are vulnerable.      --[EXPLOIT CODE    /* DSR-firebird.c by bob@dtors.net     -------------------------------    Tested on: Firebird 1.0.2 FreeBSD 4.7-RELEASE    This is Proof Of concept code.    bash-2.05a$ ./DSR-firebird  ( ( Firebird-1.0.2 Local exploit for Freebsd 4.7 ) )  ( (                           by - bob@dtors.net ) )  ----------------------------------------------------    Usage: ./DSR-firebird <target#>   Targets:  1.

The problem here  is that Linux by defaults sets firebird setuid root. There  exist a few more problems with linux. For example some command  line overflows with certain switches will allow the attacker  to change the flow of execution, of it can be changed using  the enviroment variable [FIREBIRD_LOCK].

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
