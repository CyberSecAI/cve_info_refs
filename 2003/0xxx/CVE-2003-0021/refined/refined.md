The provided document discusses multiple vulnerabilities in terminal emulators, including the specific issue related to CVE-2003-0021. Here's the extracted information:

**CVE-2003-0021: Screen Dump Vulnerability in Eterm**

*   **Root Cause:** The Eterm terminal emulator implements a "screen dump" feature that allows writing the current terminal content to a file via an escape sequence.
*   **Weakness:** The vulnerability lies in the fact that Eterm, by default, allows writing to arbitrary files, including overwriting existing ones, via this "screen dump" feature. There is no check to prevent overwriting of existing files.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can use this vulnerability to create or overwrite arbitrary files on the system where Eterm is running. This can be used to create or modify critical files, such as `.rhosts`, `authorized_keys`, `passwd`, or malicious scripts. This allows for local privilege escalation or remote access.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker must be able to display arbitrary data to a user's Eterm terminal. This can be achieved through vulnerabilities in other applications, such as injecting escape sequences into log files of services like Apache, syslog, or any other service which echoes unfiltered data to a terminal.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send data to a vulnerable terminal emulator, which can be accomplished through a variety of means. The attacker does not need to have a local account on the system running the emulator, but must be able to send data that is displayed in the user's terminal window.

**Technical Details:**

*   The escape sequence for the screen dump feature in Eterm is triggered by OSC code 30.
*   The attacker can use a sequence such as `\ec+ +\n\e]<Code>;/home/user/.rhosts\a` to clear the screen, input desired content, and then trigger the screen dump with a path for the target file.
*   Eterm's code for screen dumping includes an `unlink(fname)` function, which deletes the target file before creating and writing to it, meaning that existing files will be overwritten.
*   The document notes that Eterm had disabled this in version 0.9.2, however, many distributions shipped with the vulnerable 0.9.1 version.
*   The provided code shows the different file creation/write functions for `rxvt` and `Eterm` with `rxvt` having the check for an existing file before writing to it:
```c
    /* rxvt */
    if ((fd = open(str, O_RDWR | O_CREAT | O_EXCL, 0600)) >= 0)

    /* Eterm */
    unlink(fname);
    outfd = open(fname, O_CREAT | O_EXCL | O_NDELAY | O_WRONLY, S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR);
```
This shows that `rxvt` will not overwrite an existing file due to the `O_EXCL` flag.
