The provided content is a security advisory detailing multiple vulnerabilities in Clearswift MAILsweeper, specifically related to its handling of various encoding and compression formats. While the advisory mentions CAN-2003-0928, CAN-2003-0929, and CAN-2003-0930 as candidate CVEs, it does not provide a description of the vulnerability associated with CAN-2003-0928. Instead it refers to the CVE entries for specific vulnerabilities such as RAR 3.20 container detection issue as associated with CAN-2003-0928.

Given the description, and the fact that CAN-2003-0928 is a candidate CVE referencing a detection issue for RAR 3.20, the following information can be extracted:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The MAILsweeper product fails to properly detect and analyze the content of certain compressed archive formats, specifically RAR 3.20. This is due to insufficient or incorrect implementation of decoding/decompression functionality for these formats.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Inadequate detection of the RAR 3.20 compression format, leading to a failure to inspect the contents of the archive.
- The product's failure to "fail closed", meaning it allows undetected content to pass through, instead of blocking content it cannot positively identify or analyze.
- Inconsistent detection capabilities across different versions of the same format (e.g., different ZIP/RAR versions).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can bypass the MAILsweeper's attachment blocking policies by embedding malicious content within undetected archive formats, specifically RAR 3.20 in this context. This allows malicious executables or other undesirable content to reach the internal network, potentially leading to malware infections, data breaches, or other security incidents.

**Attack vectors:**
- Email-based attacks. An attacker sends an email containing a malicious attachment packaged in a RAR 3.20 archive.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to send emails to a target organization using a MAILsweeper product. The attacker needs to be able to create a RAR 3.20 archive, package an executable within the archive, and send it to the target.

Based on the details, while the analysis references CVE candidate CAN-2003-0928, the details extracted relate specifically to the RAR 3.20 detection issue.
