> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.

Michal Zalewski, patch from Todd C. Miller of Courtesan Consulting.

Fix a potential buffer overflow in ruleset parsing.  This problem

# Sendmail Open Source

## Email Security and Threat Protection

---

The sendmail Sentrion platform is specifically designed for large, complex environments, but we make a subset of that solution available as an open-source offering. Sentrion is not for everyone, but if you are using open source email for a large complex environment and need an enterprise platform that will enable your messaging roadmap for years to come (virtualization, consolidation, cloud migration, etc.), [speak with a specialist](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/contact) to see if Sendmail Sentrion is right for you.

[Frequently Asked Questions](/us/sendmail/faq)

### Current Sendmail Open Source Release

Sendmail [8.18.1](https://ftp.sendmail.org/sendmail.8.18.1.tar.gz) is available from [ftp.sendmail.org](https://ftp.sendmail.org/). The release has a [gzipped tar](https://ftp.sendmail.org/sendmail.8.18.1.tar.gz) file and a [PGP signature](https://ftp.sendmail.org/sendmail.8.18.1.tar.gz.sig) file. The compressed/gzipped tar files are [signed](#Signing_Keys) by the [2024 signing key](https://www.proofpoint.com/sites/default/files/signing-keys/sendmail2024.asc). See the Security and PGP Signing Keys section for more information about how releases are signed.

### Signing Keys

Security advisories are issued by The Computer Emergency Response Team [CERT](http://www.cert.org/). Sendmail server related security problems should be sent to:

**sendmail-security-*YYYY*@support.sendmail.org**

Replace YYYY with the current year, e.g., 2015. This address is only for reporting security problems in sendmail. When reporting security problems, please use PGP-the public key is available in the file PGPKEYS of the sendmail distribution.

**Please do not use this address to report problems that are not related to the security of the sendmail server.**Questions about [avoiding spam risk](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-reference/spam), how to set up your own certificate authorities, etc. should be posted in comp.mail.sendmail, and Unix-related security in the comp.security.unix newsgroup.

All sendmail distributions are signed with a PGP key named "Sendmail Signing Key/*YYYY*" where *YYYY* is the year of release.

### Contact Us

These addresses are for contributing patches or reporting problems about V8 sendmail. The members of these lists do not have the resources to support vendor versions. Before sending to any of these addresses, please check the [FAQ](/us/sendmail/faq "Sendmail FAQ") and the files README, sendmail/README (on this web-site as Compiling Sendmail) and cf/README (on this web-site as the Configuration README pages) to see if they are already answered; about half of the questions received can be answered in this way.

**Notes**

* Do not send us mail in HTML format, use plain text only (even multipart/alternative with an HTML part will be classified as spam by some of our members and hence an answer will most likely be delayed).
* Do not use 8bit characters in the Subject: nor use some encoding, e.g., =?GB2312?B?, but only plain 7bit ASCII without any charset encoding.
* If you send e-mail to sendmail.org, the answer will most likely not come from a system in the sendmail.org domain. If you use some anti-spam techniques (e.g., challenge-response systems) or you block hosts that are connected via DSL then please do not expect an answer. More and more often replies are blocked which is very annoying. Do not block this address or make sure that your system accepts at least STARTTLS secured mail. A list of IPs is available in the sendmail.org SPF record.
* If you use a challenge/response system, make sure that it does NOT send us a challenge when we reply to your question or when you receive mail from the announce list. We will not reply to those annoying mails.
* If you are using the blacklist from spamlist.org then please do not send us e-mail, the reply of the sendmail maintainer will not reach you.
* Do not send us mail in proprietary formats.
* The mailservers for support.sendmail.org now (2004-11-24) use the following DNSBLs:
  + sbl-xbl.spamhaus.org
  + dnsbl.sorbs.net

### DKIM

The [Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM)](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/corporate-blog/post/what-is-dkim) Internet standard enables email senders to digitally sign their messages so that receivers can verify that those messages have not been forged. The DKIM sender authentication scheme allows the recipient of a message to confirm a message originated with the sender’s domain and that the message content has not been altered. A cryptography-based solution, DKIM provides businesses an industry-standard method for mitigating [email fraud](/us/products/email-protection/email-fraud-defense "Email Fraud Defense") and [protecting an organization’s brand](/us/solutions/digital-risk/digital-brand-protection "Digital Brand Protection") and reputation at a relatively low implementation cost.

DKIM has been approved by the IETF as a draft standard (RFC 4871). The protocol was developed through the cooperation of Sendmail, Cisco Systems and Yahoo!

Since being approved by the IETF, a new open source project was started. The OpenDKIM Project is a community effort to develop and maintain a C library for producing DKIM-aware applications and an open source milter for providing DKIM service.

The project started from a code fork of version 2.8.3 of the open source [dkim-milter](http://sourceforge.net/projects/dkim-milter/) package developed and maintained by Sendmail, Inc.

The Sendmail [Sentrion Message Processing Engine](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/products/email-protection/open-source-email-solution) comes standard with OpenDKIM. More information is available at [opendkim.org](http://opendkim.org/) and [dkim.org](http://dkim.org/)

Package:             sendmail
Vulnerability:       remote root exploit
OpenPKG Specific:    no

Affected Releases:   Affected Packages:          Corrected Packages:
OpenPKG CURRENT      <= sendmail-8.12.9-20030801 >= sendmail-8.12.10-20030917
OpenPKG 1.3          <= sendmail-8.12.9-1.3.0    >= sendmail-8.12.9-1.3.1
OpenPKG 1.2          <= sendmail-8.12.7-1.2.3    >= sendmail-8.12.7-1.2.4

Dependent Packages:  none

Description:
  According to a confirmed [[1]](#1) security advisory from Michal Zalewski
  [[2]](#2), a remotely exploitable vulnerability exists in all versions
  prior to 8.12.10 of the Sendmail [[0]](#0) MTA. An error in its prescan()
  function could allow an attacker to write past the end of a buffer,
  corrupting memory structures. Depending on platform and operating
  system architecture, the attacker may be able to execute arbitrary
  code with a specially crafted email message.

  The email attack vector is message-oriented as opposed to
  connection-oriented. This means that the vulnerability is triggered
  by the contents of a specially crafted email message rather than by
  lower-level network traffic. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
  (CVE) project assigned the id CAN-2003-0694 [[3]](#3) to the problem.

  Additionally, we have included a fix for a potential buffer overflow
  in Sendmail's ruleset parsing. This problem is not exploitable in the
  default Sendmail configuration; it is exploitable only if non-standard
  rulesets recipient (2), final (4), or mailer-specific envelope
  recipients rulesets are used. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
  (CVE) project assigned the id CAN-2003-0681 [[4]](#4) to this problem.

  Please check whether you are affected by running "<prefix>/bin/rpm
  -q sendmail". If you have the "sendmail" package installed and its
  version is affected (see above), we recommend that you immediately
  upgrade it (see Solution) [5][[6]](#6)

Solution:
  Select the updated source RPM appropriate for your OpenPKG release
  [7][[8]](#8), fetch it from the OpenPKG FTP service [9][[10]](#10) or a mirror
  location, verify its integrity [[11]](#11), build a corresponding binary
  RPM from it [[5]](#5) and update your OpenPKG installation by applying the
  binary RPM [[6]](#6). For the current release OpenPKG 1.3, perform the
  following operations to permanently fix the security problem (for
  other releases adjust accordingly).

  $ ftp ftp.openpkg.org
  ftp> bin
  ftp> cd release/1.3/UPD
  ftp> get sendmail-8.12.9-1.3.1.src.rpm
  ftp> bye
  $ <prefix>/bin/rpm -v --checksig sendmail-8.12.9-1.3.1.src.rpm
  $ <prefix>/bin/rpm --rebuild sendmail-8.12.9-1.3.1.src.rpm
  $ su -
  # <prefix>/bin/rpm -Fvh <prefix>/RPM/PKG/sendmail-8.12.9-1.3.1.*.rpm
