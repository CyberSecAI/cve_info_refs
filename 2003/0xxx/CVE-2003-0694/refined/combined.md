## History

The CERT Division is the birthplace of cybersecurity. For nearly 30 years, the CERT Division of the SEI has partnered with government, industry, law enforcement, and academia to advance cybersecurity and improve the security and resilience of computer systems and networks.

Originally focused on incident response, we have expanded into cybersecurity areas such as network situational awareness, malicious code analysis, secure coding, resilience management, insider threats, digital investigations and intelligence, workforce development, DevOps, forensics, software assurance, vulnerability discovery and analysis, and risk management.

## Former Director Richard Pethia

[Richard Pethia](/about/leadership/display.cfm?customel_datapageid_2623=3545) was founding director of the SEI's CERT Division. Pethia, who served as director of CERT from 1988 to 2016, guided the organization through tremendous growth and change. Under Pethia's leadership, the unit expanded and evolved from the CERT Coordination Center—a small group focused on computer incident response—to a research organization of more than 200 professionals dedicated to solving problems with widespread cybersecurity implications.

# Sendmail Open Source

## Email Security and Threat Protection

---

The sendmail Sentrion platform is specifically designed for large, complex environments, but we make a subset of that solution available as an open-source offering. Sentrion is not for everyone, but if you are using open source email for a large complex environment and need an enterprise platform that will enable your messaging roadmap for years to come (virtualization, consolidation, cloud migration, etc.), [speak with a specialist](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/contact) to see if Sendmail Sentrion is right for you.

[Frequently Asked Questions](/us/sendmail/faq)

### Current Sendmail Open Source Release

Sendmail [8.18.1](https://ftp.sendmail.org/sendmail.8.18.1.tar.gz) is available from [ftp.sendmail.org](https://ftp.sendmail.org/). The release has a [gzipped tar](https://ftp.sendmail.org/sendmail.8.18.1.tar.gz) file and a [PGP signature](https://ftp.sendmail.org/sendmail.8.18.1.tar.gz.sig) file. The compressed/gzipped tar files are [signed](#Signing_Keys) by the [2024 signing key](https://www.proofpoint.com/sites/default/files/signing-keys/sendmail2024.asc). See the Security and PGP Signing Keys section for more information about how releases are signed.

### Signing Keys

Security advisories are issued by The Computer Emergency Response Team [CERT](http://www.cert.org/). Sendmail server related security problems should be sent to:

**sendmail-security-*YYYY*@support.sendmail.org**

Replace YYYY with the current year, e.g., 2015. This address is only for reporting security problems in sendmail. When reporting security problems, please use PGP-the public key is available in the file PGPKEYS of the sendmail distribution.

**Please do not use this address to report problems that are not related to the security of the sendmail server.**Questions about [avoiding spam risk](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-reference/spam), how to set up your own certificate authorities, etc. should be posted in comp.mail.sendmail, and Unix-related security in the comp.security.unix newsgroup.

All sendmail distributions are signed with a PGP key named "Sendmail Signing Key/*YYYY*" where *YYYY* is the year of release.

### Contact Us

These addresses are for contributing patches or reporting problems about V8 sendmail. The members of these lists do not have the resources to support vendor versions. Before sending to any of these addresses, please check the [FAQ](/us/sendmail/faq "Sendmail FAQ") and the files README, sendmail/README (on this web-site as Compiling Sendmail) and cf/README (on this web-site as the Configuration README pages) to see if they are already answered; about half of the questions received can be answered in this way.

**Notes**

* Do not send us mail in HTML format, use plain text only (even multipart/alternative with an HTML part will be classified as spam by some of our members and hence an answer will most likely be delayed).
* Do not use 8bit characters in the Subject: nor use some encoding, e.g., =?GB2312?B?, but only plain 7bit ASCII without any charset encoding.
* If you send e-mail to sendmail.org, the answer will most likely not come from a system in the sendmail.org domain. If you use some anti-spam techniques (e.g., challenge-response systems) or you block hosts that are connected via DSL then please do not expect an answer. More and more often replies are blocked which is very annoying. Do not block this address or make sure that your system accepts at least STARTTLS secured mail. A list of IPs is available in the sendmail.org SPF record.
* If you use a challenge/response system, make sure that it does NOT send us a challenge when we reply to your question or when you receive mail from the announce list. We will not reply to those annoying mails.
* If you are using the blacklist from spamlist.org then please do not send us e-mail, the reply of the sendmail maintainer will not reach you.
* Do not send us mail in proprietary formats.
* The mailservers for support.sendmail.org now (2004-11-24) use the following DNSBLs:
  + sbl-xbl.spamhaus.org
  + dnsbl.sorbs.net
  + list.dsbl.org
  + bl.spamcop.net
* The mailserver for support.sendmail.org performs strict RFC checks, for example, it does not accept mail if the domain part has an [MX record](/us/threat-reference/mx-record "MX Record") that points to an IP address (instead of hostname as required).

If you have a question about sendmail, then please post it to the Usenet group comp.mail.sendmail. This newsgroup is dedicated to sendmail. Please make sure you check the usual resources before posting and follow the netiquette.

E-mail addresses to contact sendmail.org are (do *not* send questions about sendmail to these addresses, see above instead; replace YYYY with the current year, e.g., 2006, in all of these addresses):

* sendmail-YYYY@support.sendmail.org for contributing patches, feature requests, and general comments but not questions how to use, install, or configure sendmail;
* sendmail-bugs-YYYY@support.sendmail.org to report implementation bugs;
* sendmail-faq-YYYY@support.sendmail.org only for comments / questions about the FAQ. Please mark your mail clearly with "FAQ: item" where item is the entry in the faq to which you are referring. If it is a general comment about the FAQ, use "FAQ: general", if it is an addition, use "FAQ: new".
* sendmail-security-YYYY@support.sendmail.org (use this only to report related bugs or problems in sendmail). Please do not use this to ask about problems with your configuration, including how to stop spam, how to set up your own certificate authority, how to make sendmail work with S/MIME, etc. All such questions should be asked in comp.mail.sendmail. Also, please do not tell us that you were able to forge mail by using telnet to connect to port 25; this is fundamental to the Internet design for [SMTP](/us/threat-reference/smtp-relay "SMTP Relay"), and not a sendmail bug. Please use encryption to send mail to this address.
* sendmail-mirror-YYYY@support.sendmail.org for updates about a mirror (e.g., a new mirror or an address change).
* webmaster-YYYY@support.sendmail.org for comments about the website.

These are not open lists, meaning that subscription is by invitation only.

### DKIM

The [Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM)](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/corporate-blog/post/what-is-dkim) Internet standard enables email senders to digitally sign their messages so that receivers can verify that those messages have not been forged. The DKIM sender authentication scheme allows the recipient of a message to confirm a message originated with the sender’s domain and that the message content has not been altered. A cryptography-based solution, DKIM provides businesses an industry-standard method for mitigating [email fraud](/us/products/email-protection/email-fraud-defense "Email Fraud Defense") and [protecting an organization’s brand](/us/solutions/digital-risk/digital-brand-protection "Digital Brand Protection") and reputation at a relatively low implementation cost.

DKIM has been approved by the IETF as a draft standard (RFC 4871). The protocol was developed through the cooperation of Sendmail, Cisco Systems and Yahoo!

Since being approved by the IETF, a new open source project was started. The OpenDKIM Project is a community effort to develop and maintain a C library for producing DKIM-aware applications and an open source milter for providing DKIM service.

The project started from a code fork of version 2.8.3 of the open source [dkim-milter](http://sourceforge.net/projects/dkim-milter/) package developed and maintained by Sendmail, Inc.

The Sendmail [Sentrion Message Processing Engine](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/products/email-protection/open-source-email-solution) comes standard with OpenDKIM. More information is available at [opendkim.org](http://opendkim.org/) and [dkim.org](http://dkim.org/)

Hello lists,

--------
Overview
--------

  There seems to be a remotely exploitable vulnerability in Sendmail up to
  and including the latest version, 8.12.9. The problem lies in prescan()
  function, but is not related to previous issues with this code.

  The primary attack vector is an indirect invocation via parseaddr(),
  although other routes are possible. Heap or stack structures, depending
  on the calling location, can be overwritten due to the ability to go
  past end of the input buffer in strtok()-alike routines.

  This is an early release, thanks to my sheer stupidity.

--------------
Attack details
--------------

  Local exploitation on little endian Linux is confirmed to be trivial
  via recipient.c and sendtolist(), with a pointer overwrite leading to a
  neat case of free() on user-supplied data, i.e.:

  eip = 0x40178ae2
  edx = 0x41414141
  esi = 0x61616161

  SEGV in chunk_free (ar_ptr=0x4022a160, p=0x81337e0) at malloc.c:3242

  0x40178ae2 <chunk_free+486>:    mov    %esi,0xc(%edx)
  0x40178ae5 <chunk_free+489>:    mov    %edx,0x8(%esi)

  Remote attack is believed to be possible.

----------------
Workaround / fix
----------------

  Vendor was notified, and released an early patch attached below.
  There are no known workarounds.

Package:             sendmail
Vulnerability:       remote root exploit
OpenPKG Specific:    no

Affected Releases:   Affected Packages:          Corrected Packages:
OpenPKG CURRENT      <= sendmail-8.12.9-20030801 >= sendmail-8.12.10-20030917
OpenPKG 1.3          <= sendmail-8.12.9-1.3.0    >= sendmail-8.12.9-1.3.1

Dependent Packages:  none

Description:
  According to a confirmed [[1]](#1) security advisory from Michal Zalewski
  [[2]](#2), a remotely exploitable vulnerability exists in all versions
  prior to 8.12.10 of the Sendmail [[0]](#0) MTA. An error in its prescan()
  function could allow an attacker to write past the end of a buffer,
  corrupting memory structures. Depending on platform and operating
  system architecture, the attacker may be able to execute arbitrary
  code with a specially crafted email message.

  The email attack vector is message-oriented as opposed to
  connection-oriented. This means that the vulnerability is triggered
  by the contents of a specially crafted email message rather than by
  lower-level network traffic. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
  (CVE) project assigned the id CAN-2003-0694 [[3]](#3) to the problem.

  Additionally, we have included a fix for a potential buffer overflow
  in Sendmail's ruleset parsing. This problem is not exploitable in the
  default Sendmail configuration; it is exploitable only if non-standard
  rulesets recipient (2), final (4), or mailer-specific envelope
  recipients rulesets are used. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
  (CVE) project assigned the id CAN-2003-0681 [[4]](#4) to this problem.

  Please check whether you are affected by running "<prefix>/bin/rpm
  -q sendmail". If you have the "sendmail" package installed and its
  version is affected (see above), we recommend that you immediately
  upgrade it (see Solution) [5][[6]](#6)

Solution:
  Select the updated source RPM appropriate for your OpenPKG release
  [7][[8]](#8), fetch it from the OpenPKG FTP service [9][[10]](#10) or a mirror
  location, verify its integrity [[11]](#11), build a corresponding binary
  RPM from it [[5]](#5) and update your OpenPKG installation by applying the
  binary RPM [[6]](#6). For the current release OpenPKG 1.3, perform the
  following operations to permanently fix the security problem (for
  other releases adjust accordingly).

  $ ftp ftp.openpkg.org
  ftp> bin
  ftp> cd release/1.3/UPD
  ftp> get sendmail-8.12.9-1.3.1.src.rpm
  ftp> bye
  $ <prefix>/bin/rpm -v --checksig sendmail-8.12.9-1.3.1.src.rpm
  $ <prefix>/bin/rpm --rebuild sendmail-8.12.9-1.3.1.src.rpm

## Sendmail prescan() buffer overflow vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#784980

Original Release Date: 2003-09-17 | Last Revised: 2003-09-29

---

### Overview

Sendmail contains a buffer overflow vulnerability in code that parses email addresses. This vulnerability could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| Sendmail is a widely used mail transfer agent (MTA). There is a buffer overflow vulnerability in code that parses email addresses.  When processing email messages, sendmail creates tokens from address elements (user, host, domain). The code that performs this function (prescan() in parseaddr.c) contains a vulnerability that could allow a remote attacker to overwrite memory structures and execute arbitary code. The attacker could exploit this vulnerability using an email message with a specially crafted address. Such a message could be passed through MTAs that are not vulnerable.Further information is available in a [message](http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/fulldisclosure/2003-q3/4119.html) by Michal Zalewski.This is a different vulnerability than the one described in CA-2003-12/VU#897604. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Sendmail process, typically root. The attacker may also be able to cause a denial of service. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade or Patch**Upgrade or apply a patch as specified by your vendor. Sendmail has released version [8.12.10](http://www.sendmail.org/8.12.10.html) and a [patch](http://www.sendmail.org/patches/parse8.359.2.8) that resolve this issue. |
| --- |

| **Enable RunAsUser**Consider setting the RunAsUser option to reduce the impact of this vulnerability. It is typically considered to be a good security practice to limit the privileges of applications and services whenever possible. |

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

Sendmail, Inc., and the Sendmail Consortium announce the availability
of sendmail 8.12.10.  It contains a fix for a security problem
discovered by Michal Zalewski whom we thank for bringing this problem
to our attention.  We also want to thank Todd C. Miller for providing
a patch.  sendmail 8.12.10 also includes fixes for other potential
problems, see the release notes below for more details.  Sendmail
urges all users to either upgrade to sendmail 8.12.10 or apply a
patch which is part of this announcement.  Remember to check the
PGP signatures of patches or releases obtained via FTP or HTTP (to
check the correctness of the patch in this announcement please
verify the PGP signature of it).  For those not running the open
source version, check with your vendor for a patch.

For a complete list of changes see the release notes down below.

Please send bug reports to sendmail-bugs@sendmail.org as usual.
Please send security reports to sendmail-security@sendmail.org using
PGP encryption.

Note: We have changed the way we digitally sign the source code
distributions to simplify verification: in contrast to earlier
versions two .sig files are provided, one each for the gzip'ed
version and the compressed version. That is, instead of signing the
tar file, we sign the compressed/gzip'ed files, so you do not need
to uncompress the file before checking the signature.

This version can be found at

ftp://ftp.sendmail.org/pub/sendmail/sendmail.8.12.10.tar.gz
ftp://ftp.sendmail.org/pub/sendmail/sendmail.8.12.10.tar.gz.sig
ftp://ftp.sendmail.org/pub/sendmail/sendmail.8.12.10.tar.Z
ftp://ftp.sendmail.org/pub/sendmail/sendmail.8.12.10.tar.Z.sig

and the usual mirror sites.

MD5 signatures:

393f5d09d462f522c8288363870b2b42 sendmail.8.12.10.tar.gz
345042839dec70f0a0b5aaeafcf3a0e3 sendmail.8.12.10.tar.gz.sig
36b2b74577a96f79c242ff036321c2ff sendmail.8.12.10.tar.Z
1b9cd61e1342207148d950feafab0f07 sendmail.8.12.10.tar.Z.sig

You either need the first two files or the third and fourth, i.e.,
the gzip'ed version or the compressed version and the corresponding
.sig file.  The PGP signature was created using the Sendmail Signing
Key/2003, available on the web site (<http://www.sendmail.org/>) or
on the public key servers.

Since sendmail 8.11 and later includes hooks to cryptography, the
following information from OpenSSL applies to sendmail as well.

   PLEASE REMEMBER THAT EXPORT/IMPORT AND/OR USE OF STRONG CRYPTOGRAPHY
   SOFTWARE, PROVIDING CRYPTOGRAPHY HOOKS OR EVEN JUST COMMUNICATING
   TECHNICAL DETAILS ABOUT CRYPTOGRAPHY SOFTWARE IS ILLEGAL IN SOME
   PARTS OF THE WORLD.  SO, WHEN YOU IMPORT THIS PACKAGE TO YOUR
   COUNTRY, RE-DISTRIBUTE IT FROM THERE OR EVEN JUST EMAIL TECHNICAL
   SUGGESTIONS OR EVEN SOURCE PATCHES TO THE AUTHOR OR OTHER PEOPLE
   YOU ARE STRONGLY ADVISED TO PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO ANY EXPORT/IMPORT
   AND/OR USE LAWS WHICH APPLY TO YOU. THE AUTHORS ARE NOT LIABLE FOR
   ANY VIOLATIONS YOU MAKE HERE. SO BE CAREFUL, IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY.

This listing shows the version of the sendmail binary, the version
of the sendmail configuration files, the date of release, and a
summary of the changes in that release.

8.12.10/8.12.102003/09/24
SECURITY: Fix a buffer overflow in address parsing.  Problem
detected by Michal Zalewski, patch from Todd C. Miller
of Courtesan Consulting.
Fix a potential buffer overflow in ruleset parsing.  This problem
is not exploitable in the default sendmail configuration;
only if non-standard rulesets recipient (2), final (4), or
mailer-specific envelope recipients rulesets are used then
a problem may occur.  Problem noted by Timo Sirainen.
Accept 0 (and 0/0) as valid input for set MaxMimeHeaderLength.
Problem noted by Thomas Schulz.
Add several checks to avoid (theoretical) buffer over/underflows.
Properly count message size when performing 7->8 or 8->7 bit MIME
conversions.  Problem noted by Werner Wiethege.
Properly compute message priority based on size of entire message,
not just header.  Problem noted by Axel Holscher.
Reset SevenBitInput to its configured value between SMTP
transactions for broken clients which do not properly
announce 8 bit data.  Problem noted by Stefan Roehrich.
Set {addr\_type} during queue runs when processing recipients.
Based on patch from Arne Jansen.
Better error handling in case of (very unlikely) queue-id conflicts.
Perform better error recovery for address parsing, e.g., when
encountering a comment that is too long.  Problem noted by
Tanel Kokk, Union Bank of Estonia.
Add ':' to the allowed character list for bogus HELO/EHLO
checking.  It is used for IPv6 domain literals.  Patch from
Iwaizako Takahiro of FreeBit Co., Ltd.
Reset SASL connection context after a failed authentication attempt.
Based on patch from Rob Siemborski of CMU.
Check Berkeley DB compile time version against run time version
to make sure they match.
Do not attempt AAAA (IPv6) DNS lookups if IPv6 is not enabled
in the kernel.
When a milter adds recipients and one of them causes an error,
do not ignore the other recipients.  Problem noted by
Bart Duchesne.
CONFIG: Use specified SMTP error code in mailertable entries which
lack a DSN, i.e., "error:### Text".  Problem noted by
Craig Hunt.
CONFIG: Call Local\_trust\_auth with the correct argument.  Patch
from Jerome Borsboom.
CONTRIB: Better handling of temporary filenames for doublebounce.pl
and expn.pl to avoid file overwrites, etc.  Patches from
Richard A. Nelson of Debian and Paul Szabo.
MAIL.LOCAL: Fix obscure race condition that could lead to an
improper mailbox truncation if close() fails after the
mailbox is fsync()'ed and a new message is delivered
after the close() and before the truncate().
MAIL.LOCAL: If mail delivery fails, do not leave behind a
stale lockfile (which is ignored after the lock timeout).
Patch from Oleg Bulyzhin of Cronyx Plus LLC.
Portability:
Port for AIX 5.2.  Thanks to Steve Hubert of University
of Washington for providing access to a computer
with AIX 5.2.
setreuid(2) works on OpenBSD 3.3.  Patch from
Todd C. Miller of Courtesan Consulting.
Allow for custom definition of SMRSH\_CMDDIR and SMRSH\_PATH
on all operating systems.  Patch from Robert Harker
of Harker Systems.
Use strerror(3) on Linux.  If this causes a problem on
your Linux distribution, compile with
-DHASSTRERROR=0 and tell sendmail.org about it.
Added Files:
devtools/OS/AIX.5.2

Instructions to extract and apply the patch for sendmail:

Store the data between "========= begin patch ========" and "=========
end patch ==========" into a file called "/PATH/TO/patch.sm" (replace
"/PATH/TO" with a path of your choice) and apply the following
command in the sendmail-VERSION/sendmail/ directory (note: if you
have a really old version then cd to sendmail-VERSION/src/)

patch < /PATH/TO/patch.sm

You should also edit the file version.c and change the version
number to indicate that you changed sendmail. We suggest to add the
date, e.g., change "8.12.9" to "8.12.9-20030924". Then recompile
sendmail, install the new binary, and restart the daemon.
