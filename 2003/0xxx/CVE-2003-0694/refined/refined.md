    "root_cause": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `prescan()` function of Sendmail, specifically in how it parses email addresses. The vulnerability occurs due to an insufficient bounds check when tokenizing address elements, potentially allowing an attacker to write past the end of a buffer.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow",
      "Insufficient Input Validation"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Sendmail process, typically root, or cause a denial of service. Memory corruption can occur, leading to unexpected program behavior, crashes, or potential for privilege escalation.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is a specially crafted email message containing a malicious email address. This message could be passed through MTAs that are not vulnerable.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send emails to a vulnerable Sendmail server. No local access is needed."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The provided content offers more details than the official CVE description. It includes specifics on the vulnerable function (`prescan()` in `parseaddr.c`), the mechanism of exploitation (overwriting memory structures via crafted email addresses), and a patch for the vulnerability. It also mentions that the issue is not related to previous vulnerabilities in the `prescan()` function. Additionally, the provided content identifies a second potential buffer overflow in Sendmail's ruleset parsing (CAN-2003-0681)."
