Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2003-0532:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from Internet Explorer's improper handling of the `OBJECT` tag's `DATA` attribute, specifically when loading HTML Applications (HTAs).
*   The browser does not validate the nature of the file being loaded via the `DATA` attribute. It relies on the `Content-Type` header provided by the server.
*   If a server responds with `Content-Type: application/hta` for a file, Internet Explorer will execute it as an HTA, regardless of the actual file extension or if it's served from a seemingly safe URL.
*   IE incorrectly prioritizes the returned MIME type from the server when processing HTAs, using it for execution context but not security context.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **MIME Type Handling Bypass:** Internet Explorer trusts the `Content-Type` header from the server without proper validation, allowing an attacker to serve malicious content as a seemingly safe file type.
*   **Object Tag Handling:** The `OBJECT` tag's `DATA` attribute, which is meant for embedding objects, is not properly checked, leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   **HTA Execution:** HTML Applications (HTAs), which have elevated permissions, can be executed without the user's knowledge or consent via the `OBJECT` tag when the `Content-Type` header is set to `application/hta`.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The browser fails to validate the file content against the declared MIME type, allowing the execution of malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine with the same privileges as the user running Internet Explorer.
*   **Malware Installation:** Malicious programs, such as trojans (e.g., "bo2k", "subseven"), backdoors, DDoS tools, or other malware, can be installed silently without user interaction.
*   **Data Theft/Manipulation:** Attackers can access sensitive data, such as AIM credentials from the registry, or modify system settings, such as DNS configurations.
*   **System Compromise:** Full control of the system can be obtained by exploiting the vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Web Pages:** Attackers can host specially crafted web pages containing the vulnerable `OBJECT` tag. When a user visits the page, the malicious HTA can be executed.
*   **HTML-based Emails:** The attack can be carried out using HTML-formatted emails containing the vulnerable tag.
*   **Other HTML parsing applications:** Any application using the Internet Explorer rendering engine (MSHTML) or the WebBrowser ActiveX control are potentially vulnerable.
*   **Data Binding:** HTML can be generated via data binding of an XML source to an HTML consumer, which can be used to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Scripted Generation:** HTML can be generated using scripts, providing another avenue of attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Web Server Control:** Attackers must control a web server to serve a malicious HTA with the correct `Content-Type` header (`application/hta`).
*   **Social Engineering:** Attackers often need to convince victims to visit a malicious web page or open a specially crafted email.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** Attackers need knowledge of the vulnerability to craft the malicious HTML and HTA files.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was initially addressed by Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS03-032](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS03-032.asp), but this patch did not fully resolve all attack vectors.
*   A subsequent bulletin, [MS03-040](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS03-040.asp), provided a more complete fix, addressing additional attack vectors not covered by MS03-032.
*   The vulnerability affects all versions of Internet Explorer 5.01, 5.5 and 6.0. Windows Server 2003 is less vulnerable by default due to its Enhanced Security Configuration but this can be easily disabled.
*   The use of a file with a safe extension (e.g., `.jpg`) while serving a HTA file was a method used to bypass file extension checks.
*   The attack doesn't require any user interaction beyond viewing the webpage or opening the HTML email.
*   Various mitigation techniques are mentioned, such as disabling ActiveX, blocking the `application/hta` MIME type, and blocking `mshta.exe`, but it is stressed that these are not complete solutions.
