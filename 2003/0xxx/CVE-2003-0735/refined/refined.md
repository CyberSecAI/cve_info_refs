Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2003-0735:

**Root Cause:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Improper input validation in the `calendar` module of phpWebSite allows attackers to inject malicious SQL queries through URL parameters. Specifically, the `startDate` and `endDate` parameters within the `mod_calendar_events` table are vulnerable.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in several modules (`calendar`, `fatcat`, `pagemaster`, `search`) allows attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code via URL parameters.
*   **Path Disclosure:**  Improper error handling in the `TimeZone.php` script reveals the server's internal file paths when invalid date values are provided in the `calendar` module.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A buffer overflow vulnerability in the `calendar` module can be triggered by sending an excessive amount of data via the `year` parameter leading to a crash of the MySQL server and the phpWebSite scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Vulnerable parameters are not properly sanitized before being used in SQL queries. This allows for arbitrary SQL code to be executed.
*   **XSS:** User inputs are not sanitized before being outputted to the web page. This allows malicious javascript to execute within the user's browser.
*   **Path Disclosure:** Error messages reveal sensitive path information due to improper handling of errors.
*   **DoS:** Inadequate input validation leads to a buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially gaining unauthorized access to sensitive data (configuration values, authentication data) or modifying data.
    *   Complete control of the database is possible depending on the database user privileges.
*   **XSS:**
    *   Attackers can inject malicious scripts into web pages, allowing them to steal cookies, authentication tokens, and other sensitive user information.
    *   Malicious scripts could redirect users to phishing sites or perform other client-side attacks.
*  **Path Disclosure:**
    *   Reveals internal file paths, providing information that could be useful for further attacks.
*   **DoS:**
    *   The server can crash, causing unavailability of the website and its services.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Crafting malicious URLs with specially formatted `year`, `month`, and possibly other date-related parameters within the `calendar` module.
*  **XSS:** Injecting malicious JavaScript code into URLs using vulnerable parameters in the `calendar`, `fatcat`, `pagemaster`, and `search` modules.
*   **Path Disclosure:** Providing invalid values in date-related parameters for the `calendar` module in order to trigger errors that reveal file paths.
*   **DoS:**  Sending a long string of characters via the `year` parameter in a `calendar` module URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **SQL Injection:**  The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable phpWebSite instance. A basic understanding of SQL is required.
*   **XSS:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable phpWebSite instance and have knowledge of javascript.
*   **Path Disclosure:**  The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable phpWebSite instance.
*   **DoS:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable phpWebSite instance.
