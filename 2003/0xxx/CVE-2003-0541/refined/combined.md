Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2003-0541
Debian Bug     : 279726

Alan Cox discovered a problem in gtkhtml, an HTML rendering widget
used by the Evolution mail reader.  Certain malformed messages could
cause a cras due to a null pointer dereference.

For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in

We recommend that you upgrade your gtkhtml package and restart
Evolution.
