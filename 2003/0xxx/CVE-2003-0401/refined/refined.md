- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper access control on a help application installed under the `/vgn` web directory in Vignette software. Specifically, accessing a template directly through a web browser results in a dump of internal information.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information disclosure due to the lack of proper access control. The vulnerability allows the retrieval of internal variable names, private PATHs, and other internal server state information.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can gain knowledge of internal server configurations, private paths, and variable names which may aid in further attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is accessed via HTTP by directly requesting the vulnerable template, typically located at `/vgn/style`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected server. No special authentication or user privileges appear to be required.
