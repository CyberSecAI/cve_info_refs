Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2003-0855:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `gnksa_split_from` function within the Pan newsreader application. This function is responsible for parsing the "From:" header of newsgroup postings. The vulnerability occurs when processing a sender's email address with an excessive length, leading to a crash.
- The vulnerability also occurs when the server doesn't send a carriage return character (`^M`) at the end of each line when listing newsgroups.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Buffer overflow in the `gnksa_split_from` function.
- Improper handling of long email addresses in the "From:" header
- Improper handling of server responses missing a carriage return.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS) by causing Pan to crash when viewing a newsgroup posting with a long email address in the "From:" header or when connecting to a server that sends incomplete newgroup listing.
- The vulnerability could also crash every pan client viewing the group with the malicious message.

**Attack vectors:**
- Posting a message with an extremely long email address in the "From:" header to a newsgroup.
- Connecting to a news server that returns newsgroup listings without a carriage return character at the end of each line.
- Viewing a newsgroup with a malicious posting.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to post messages to a newsgroup accessible by the targeted Pan user
- Ability to set up or utilize a malformed news server.
- No special privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability, as it is triggered during normal use of the Pan newsreader application.

**Additional Details:**
- The bug report from bugzilla.gnome.org indicates the vulnerability was addressed in version 0.13.4.
- Red Hat bugzilla entry confirms the vulnerability. It was fixed in RHSA-2003:311.
- The vulnerability is described as causing a null byte to be written to 0x00, causing a crash that cannot be exploited further, limiting the impact to DoS.
