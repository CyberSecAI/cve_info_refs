## Novell NetWare Enterprise Web Server /perl/ handler vulnerable to buffer overflow

#### Vulnerability Note VU#185593

Original Release Date: 2003-07-23 | Last Revised: 2003-08-08

---

### Overview

Novell NetWare Enterprise Web Server contains a buffer overflow vulnerability that can be exploited via the /perl/ HTTP request handler. A remote attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the server process.

### Description

| Novell NetWare 5.1 and 6.0 include a web server called NetWare Enterprise Server. The server contains a buffer overflow vulnerability that can be triggered by a specially crafted HTTP request directed to the /perl/ handler. The vulnerability occurs in the module CGI2PERL.NLM, which is mapped to the /perl/ directory in an HTTP request. Further information is available in Novell Technical Information Document [2966549](http://support.novell.com/cgi-bin/search/searchtid.cgi?/2966549.htm) and PROTEGO Security Advisory [#PSA200301](http://www.protego.dk/advisories/200301.html).  NetWare 5.1 with NetWare Enterprise Web Server 3.6 and certain NetWare 6.0 systems (NetWare Enterprise Web Server 6.00d) are affected. In particular, NetWare 6.0 systems that have been upgraded from 5.1 may be affected. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker could cause the web server to hang or restart ([ABEND](http://developer.novell.com/ndk/doc/general/glossenu/data/alffzwf.html)), resulting in a denial of service. Since EIP is overwritten, it may be possible for the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the server process (Admin). |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply a patch**Apply the appropriate patch referenced in Novell TID [2966549](http://support.novell.com/cgi-bin/search/searchtid.cgi?/2966549.htm). |
| --- |

| **Unmap /perl/ handler**If it is not needed, unmap the /perl/ request handler. Information about how to configure the /perl/ CGI directory can be found in Novell's [Perl documentation](http://developer.novell.com/ndk/doc/perl5/prl57enu/data/hyyq6w6r.html) for Netware Enterprise Web Server. |

============================== Summary ==============================

Security Alert: NOVL-2003-2966549
Title: Enterprise Web Server PERL Handler Buffer Overflow
Date: 23-Jul-2003
Revision: Original
Product Name: Netware Enterprise Web Server
OS/Platform(s): Netware 5.1, 6.0
Reference URL: <http://support.novell.com/servlet/tidfinder/2966549>
Vendor Name: Novell, Inc.
Vendor URL: <http://www.novell.com>
Security Alerts: <http://support.novell.com/security-alerts>
Affects: cgi2perl.nlm
Identifiers: CERT VU# 185593, CVE: CAN-2003-0562
Credits: Uffe Nielsen

============================ Description ============================

A Buffer Overflow in the PERL handler, (/perl/) may result in a
server ABEND.  The problem is not in the Netscape-based Enterprise
Web Server, but in the Novell-supplied cgi2perl.nlm handler to PERL.

============================== Impact ===============================

One or more server ABENDs may be triggered by buffer overflows,
resulting in degraded performance or crash of the server, in turn
causing in a denial of service to legitimate users of the system.
There is no known ROOT shell exploit from this kind of failure on
Netware.

======================== Recommended Actions ========================

Topic: Buffer Overflow in Netware Web Server PERL Handler
Platform : Netware 5.1 SP6, Netware 6 under certain conditions.
Application : NetWare Enterprise Web Server
Advisory URL: <http://www.protego.dk/advisories/200301.html>
Identifiers: CERT: VU# 185593, CVE: CAN-2003-0562
Vendor Name: Novell, Inc.
Vendor URL: <http://www.novell.com>
Vendor contacted: 10-Feb-2003
Public release: 23-Jul-2003

Problem:
The Netware Enterprise Server does not perform proper bounds check on
requests passed to the perl interpreter through the perl virtual
directory. This results in a buffer overflow condition, when large
requests are sent to the perl interpreter.

Details:
The issue can be triggered by requesting the perl virtual directory
followed by a long string.

[http://server/perl/aaaaaa...[Unspecified](http://server/perl/aaaaaa...%5BUnspecified) number of characters]

The vulnerability occurs in the CGI2PERL.NLM module.

Impact:
A request like the above will overrun the allocated buffer and overwrite
EIP, causing the server to ABEND and either suspend the process or
restart itself, thereby creating a Denial of Service situation.

Corrective actions:
Novell has made a patch for this issue:

============================ Description ============================

A Buffer Overflow in the PERL handler, (/perl/) may result in a
server ABEND.  The problem is not in the Netscape-based Enterprise
Web Server, but in the Novell-supplied cgi2perl.nlm handler to PERL.

============================== Impact ===============================

One or more server ABENDs may be triggered by buffer overflows,
resulting in degraded performance or crash of the server, in turn
causing in a denial of service to legitimate users of the system.
There is no known ROOT shell exploit from this kind of failure on
Netware.
