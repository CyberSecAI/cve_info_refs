Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `cgi2perl.nlm` module, specifically when handling requests to the `/perl/` directory in the Novell NetWare Enterprise Web Server. The server does not properly validate the size of incoming requests before passing them to the Perl interpreter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The primary weakness is a classic buffer overflow. By sending a large string to the `/perl/` handler, an attacker can write past the allocated buffer in memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The most immediate impact is a denial of service. Overwriting memory, specifically the EIP (Extended Instruction Pointer), causes the web server to ABEND (abnormal end), which can lead to the server process being suspended or restarted.
- **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** While not explicitly confirmed in all sources, the vulnerability's nature (overwriting EIP) opens the possibility of arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the server process (typically Admin/root). However, the Novell advisory states "There is no known ROOT shell exploit from this kind of failure on Netware."

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The attack vector is through a specially crafted HTTP request directed to the `/perl/` handler.
- **Long String:** The malicious HTTP request includes a long string following the `/perl/` virtual directory which overflows the buffer.  An example given is `http://server/perl/aaaaaa...` where "a" repeats many times.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server. This typically means the attacker can reach the web server over a network.
- **No Authentication Required:**  The vulnerability is exploitable without authentication.
