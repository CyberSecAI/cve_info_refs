Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `asf_http_request` function within the `asf_streaming.c` file of MPlayer. Specifically, the `sprintf` calls are vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The `sprintf` function writes data into a fixed-size buffer (`char str[250]`) without proper bounds checking, leading to a buffer overflow when the hostname or port values are excessively long.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The vulnerability is triggered by parsing an ASX file where the URL within the `<ref>` tag can contain a very long hostname, which is not properly validated before being used in `sprintf`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** By crafting a malicious ASX file with an overly long URL, an attacker can cause a buffer overflow in `asf_http_request` and overwrite the return address, leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious ASX files:** Attackers can host malicious ASX files on websites or send them to victims via other means.
- **ASX Streaming:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable when playing ASX streaming content.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to host a malicious ASX file** on a web server or have the victim open it locally.
- **Network connectivity** to the malicious server if the victim is opening a streamed ASX file.
- **Basic knowledge of ASX file structure and the vulnerability.**
- The attacker has to control the answer of the HTTP request performed by mplayer during the parsing of the ASX file, which requires an attacker controlled server.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable code is in `asf_streaming.c` within the `asf_http_request` function.
- Two vulnerable `sprintf` calls exist in the function:
    ```c
    sprintf( str, "Host: %s:%d", server_url->hostname, server_url->port );
    sprintf( str, "Host: %s:%d", url->hostname, url->port );
    ```
- A specially crafted ASX file that includes a very long hostname in the `<ref href>` tag can be used to trigger the vulnerability. The attack is made possible if the response of the crafted http request sends "\n\n", which allows to overwrite the return address, as the buffer will contain the crafted header + "\n\n", after this the function will return using the overwritten return address.
- The `MAXHOSTLEN` size restriction is bypassed by including the "\n\n" in the HTTP answer.
