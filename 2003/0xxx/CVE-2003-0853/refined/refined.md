  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve": "CVE-2003-0853",
      "is_related": true,
      "summary": "A vulnerability exists in `/bin/ls` (part of coreutils), specifically when used in wu-ftpd. It's related to excessive memory consumption when called with large `-w` parameters and an integer overflow, although the latter isn't readily exploitable.",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow in the `-w` parameter of `/bin/ls`, which is used to determine the output width. Additionally, when used in wu-ftpd, a large value to -w leads to excessive memory allocation resulting in denial of service.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Integer Overflow",
        "Denial of Service due to excessive memory consumption"
      ],
      "impact": "Denial of Service, causing excessive memory consumption leading to the termination of the `ls` process by the kernel. Although there is an integer overflow, the content does not confirm memory corruption that can lead to arbitrary code execution.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Command line argument manipulation (`-w` parameter)",
         "Through vulnerable applications such as wu-ftpd"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker can remotely trigger the vulnerability by issuing a crafted FTP command when `ls` is used within wu-ftpd.  For the command line, local access is needed to execute the program with the malicious parameters."
