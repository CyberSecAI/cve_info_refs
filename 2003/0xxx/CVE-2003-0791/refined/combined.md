Script.thaw deserializes a script from a string. You can then run the script.
A savvy attacker who knows JS bytecode and engine internals, and the target
machine architecture, can call a native function!

This is so embarrassing, I think I'm going to go get drunk. This hole has been
around since rev 3.2 of jsscript.c on 4/24/98 (Mozilla began, in general, with
rev 3.1 on 3/31/98). The script freeze/thaw stuff was used by servers including
some that shaver was working on at the time. We never included it in any
security review, for some reason.
Shaver, pour one for me at dinner tonight!

Did I say "call a native function" in [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=221526#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - JS Script.thaw is a security hole")? I meant "forge a native
function and then call any native code it likes."

So the fix excludes Script.prototype.freeze/thaw and Script.thaw from being
compiled into the MOZILLA\_CLIENT embedding of SpiderMonkey. Other browser
embedders need to be apprised. In general, any web browser embedding should
follow our lead and defined MOZILLA\_CLIENT, I think.

Cc'ing bryner, who is helping respin Firebird.
Cc'ing scole, whom I hereby swear to secrecy, and ask whether any planetweb
remnant exists that might need the patch. Steve, do you recall whether
planetweb defined MOZILLA\_CLIENT in its SpiderMonkey embedding?

|  | |

No, Planetweb never #defined MOZILLA\_CLIENT. (It's not clear that we want to,
given the other uses of MOZILLA\_CLIENT in the engine.)
I'm not too worried about this, though. Can the 'custom native function' be
present in the spoof string? Or does it have to reside somewhere else in the
running binary image of the embedding? If it has to live in the embedding
already, then I'm not worried at all.
In any event, our embeddings don't (generally speaking) contain much that needs
to be protected, and the hardware architecture details are usually kept pretty
much under wraps. (Not that that would stop a determined hacker, of course.)
I'll let management at PW know the story, though.
[This needs more attention by embedders than hiding behind a security-bug will
give, though. Should freeze and thaw be turned off unless explicitly turned on,
perhaps? Then you don't really have to announce it, and the people who don't
pay lots of attention get the fix, too.]

Steve: the forged native function and its native code come from the string being
thawed into a script. So this is a wide-open hole, if the attacker knows the JS
engine's internals and the target architecture.
Good point about turning freeze and thaw off in general. We'll need a separate
JS\_HAS\_SCRIPT\_FREEZE\_THAW macro in jsconfig.h, defined to 0 for all versions
configured there. I'll ponder that.

|  | |

MOZILLA\_CLIENT is actually good to define for all web browser embeddings of the
SpiderMonkey engine, because it turns off ECMA-standard things that are unsafe
on (Script.thaw), or incompatible (escape, unescape) with, the web.

I overstated the ease of exploit: there doesn't seem to be a way to serialize a
native function, or to corrupt a deserialized scripted function so that it
morphs into a native function. That means any exploit will have to use buffer
overrun techniques (malloc size parameter wraparound). Not easy, but possible.
I'm changing the comment above script\_freeze like so:
- \* we take them out of the Mozilla client altogether. Script.thaw is a hole
- \* wide enough that you could hack your own native function and call it!
+ \* we take them out of the Mozilla client altogether. Fortunately, there is
+ \* no way to serialize a native function (see fun\_xdrObject in jsfun.c).
I'll make this change to the trunk and all the branches, unless someone thinks I
should not make it in an old branch. I'd like the branches to be consistent,
though.

Per [comment 13](/show_bug.cgi?id=221526#c13 "RESOLVED FIXED - JS Script.thaw is a security hole"), this is not huge, just as big as any hard-to-exploit but
presumably exploitable malloc-size-param-overflow bug.

Since discussion is (sort of) active on this bug again: Is it appropriate to
think about/work on the jsconfig.h change mentioned in [comment 10](/show_bug.cgi?id=221526#c10 "RESOLVED FIXED - JS Script.thaw is a security hole")? Or is a new
bug a better spot for that?

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
