  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2003-0244",
      "root_cause": "The Linux kernel's routing cache (dst cache) implementation uses a weak, GF(2)-linear hash function, making it easy to create collisions. When these collisions occur, the hash table degrades into a linear list, drastically increasing the time required to look up entries. This affects routing performance by causing the system to slow down or freeze.",

        "Weak hash function (GF(2)-linear) in the routing cache implementation.",
        "Predictable hash bucket calculation for traffic flows allowing attackers to control hash collisions."
      ],
      "impact": "Denial of service (DoS) due to increased lookup times in the routing cache, potentially leading to system freeze.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Sending specially crafted packets with specific source addresses and TOS values that cause hash collisions."

     "cve_id": "CVE-2003-0244",
      "root_cause": "The Netfilter connection tracking mechanism also uses a hash table, which is similarly vulnerable to algorithmic complexity attacks due to a weak hash function.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Weak hash function in the Netfilter connection tracking implementation.",
        "Vulnerability to collision attacks due to the ability to manipulate hash calculations."

      "impact": "Denial of service (DoS) due to the Netfilter connection tracking table becoming inefficient under stress.",

        "Exploiting weaknesses in the Netfilter connection tracking's hash function by sending crafted packets."
