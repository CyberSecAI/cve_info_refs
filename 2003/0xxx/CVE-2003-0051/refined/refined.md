The provided content is related to CVE-2003-0051.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `parse_xml.cgi` application within the QuickTime/Darwin Streaming Administration Server reveals the physical installation path due to insufficient input validation. Specifically, passing a NULL character as the filename parameter to this CGI application causes the server to disclose the path.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Physical Path Revelation

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can obtain the physical path where the Darwin/QuickTime admin servers are installed.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted GET request to the vulnerable `parse_xml.cgi` with a NULL character as the filename parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker with network access to the administration server can exploit this. No prior authentication is required.
