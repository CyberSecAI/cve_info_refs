- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The UBB software does not properly filter the "displayed name" attribute within the `ubber` cookie, allowing for the injection of arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - **Cross-site scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is the lack of input sanitization, which enables attackers to inject malicious scripts into the forum page via the `ubber` cookie.
    - **Cookie manipulation:** The vulnerability leverages the ability to manually alter the `ubber` cookie.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - **Account hijacking:** Attackers can steal session cookies containing usernames, passwords, and user IDs.
    - **Arbitrary code execution:** By injecting malicious JavaScript, attackers can execute arbitrary code within the victim's browser, potentially leading to further attacks.
    - **Forum defacement:** Attackers can insert custom HTML content to deface the forum.
    - **Redirection attacks:** Attackers can force automatic redirects to logout pages or other malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - The attack vector involves manipulating the `ubber` cookie by modifying the `[displayed name]` attribute to include malicious HTML/JavaScript.
    - The injected script is executed when the forum overview page or latest posts overview page is rendered.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Attackers need the ability to manually modify the `ubber` cookie.
    - Attackers need to be able to post a new topic on the forum for the injected script to be rendered on the forum overview page.
