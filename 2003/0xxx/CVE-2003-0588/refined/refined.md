The provided content describes a vulnerability in Digi-news and Digi-ads version 1.1.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an incorrect logical operator used in the authentication check within the `admin.php` script. Instead of using a logical OR (||), the code uses a logical AND (&&) in the conditional statement checking user and password cookies. This allows an attacker to bypass authentication using a valid username without knowing the password.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Authentication bypass:** The flawed logic in the authentication check allows unauthorized access to the admin area by sending a cookie with the correct username, regardless of the password.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Full administrative access:** Exploitation grants an attacker full access to the administration panel of Digi-news or Digi-ads.
- **Data manipulation:** This enables the attacker to add, edit, or delete news or ads.
- **Potential for further attacks:** The attacker can potentially upload malicious code or perform other attacks on the web server.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP cookie manipulation:** Attackers can exploit this by sending a crafted HTTP cookie with a valid username (e.g., "admin") to `admin.php`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests with custom headers (specifically, cookie headers).
- The attacker needs to know a valid username (default user "admin" is provided).
