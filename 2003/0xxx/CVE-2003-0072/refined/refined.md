{
  "CVE-2003-0072": {
    "Description": "Array overrun in Kerberos principal name handling.",
    "Root cause": "Buffer overrun and underrun problems in Kerberos principal name handling, specifically when dealing with unusual cases such as names with zero components, names with one empty component, or host-based service principal names with no host name component.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overrun",
      "Array Overrun",
	   "Buffer Underrun"
    ],
    "Impact": "Corruption of the malloc pool, potentially leading to program crashes. In the KDC, it could lead to crashing by referencing data past the end of an array. Depending on the malloc implementation and platform, more serious exploits may be possible.",
    "Attack vectors": "Exploiting specially crafted Kerberos principal names.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Attacker needs to supply a crafted principal name. This could be a result of a misconfigured realm or a malicious client supplying broken names."
