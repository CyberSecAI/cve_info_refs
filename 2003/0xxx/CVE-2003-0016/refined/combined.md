## Apache allows arbitrary code execution via crafted POST request containing MS-DOS device name

#### Vulnerability Note VU#825177

Original Release Date: 2003-02-12 | Last Revised: 2003-02-12

---

### Overview

Due to a flaw in the [Apache](http://www.apache.org/) web server's handling of MS-DOS device names, an attacker may be able to remotely execute code on systems running the Apache web server under some versions of Microsoft Windows.

### Description

| The [Apache HTTP server](http://httpd.apache.org/) fails to filter POST requests for MS-DOS style device names. As a result, an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary script commands on systems running Apache under versions of Windows that use these device names (i.e., Microsoft Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows Millenium Edition).  An attacker issuing a carefully crafted POST may be able to execute a filtered type as a CGI, thereby allowing them to execute abitrary script commands. |
| --- |

### Impact

| Intruders may be able to remotely execute code on the vulnerable system. Since Microsoft Windows 95, Windows 98 and Windows Millenium Edition do not provide any separation of user privileges, exploitation of this vulnerability results in a root compromise of the affected system. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply a patch from the vendor**The Apache Software Foundation has released [version 2.0.44](http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/Announcement2.html) of the [Apache HTTP server](http://httpd.apache.org/) to address this vulnerability. Users are encouraged to upgrade to this version of the software.Furthermore, users of the Microsoft Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows 98 Second Edition operating systems are encouraged to apply the patches referenced in Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS00-017](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS00-017.asp) in order to prevent other applications from exploiting this vulnerability. |

The Apache Software Foundation and The Apache HTTP Server Project are
pleased to announce the seventh public release of the Apache 2.0
HTTP Server.  This Announcement notes the significant changes in
2.0.44 as compared to 2.0.43.

This version of Apache is principally a security and bug fix release.
A summary of the bug fixes is given at the end of this document.
Of particular note is that 2.0.44 addresses three security
vulnerabilities affecting the Windows platform.

VU#979793 Versions of Windows 9x and Me could be crashed by a malicious
request to Apache that contains a MS-DOS device name.  This is a known
security issues in Microsoft Windows for a which a fix is available:
<http://www.microsoft.com/technet/Security/Bulletin/ms00-017.asp>
Apache 2.0.44 has also been patched to correctly filter MS-DOS device
names preventing the crash even if the Microsoft update is not applied
(cve.mitre.org: CAN-2003-0016 [[1]](#1)).

VU#825177 As a consequence of VU#979793, a remote attacker can
run arbitrary code on a server running Apache under Windows 9x and Me
by sending a carefully crafted POST request containing a MS-DOS device
name (cve.mitre.org: CAN-2003-0016 [[1]](#1)).

On Windows platforms Apache could be forced to serve unexpected files
by appending illegal characters such as '<' to the request URL
(cve.mitre.org: CAN-2003-0017 [[2]](#2)).

The Apache Software Foundation would like to thank Matthew Murphy and
Lionel Brits for the responsible reporting of these issues.

The 2.0.44 release marks a change in the Apache release process and a new
level of stability in the 2.0 series.  Beginning with this release, we
will make every effort to retain forward compatibility in the
configuration and module API, so that upgrading along the 2.0 series
should be much easier.  This compatibility extends backwards to 2.0.42, so
users of that version or later should be able to upgrade without changing
configurations or updating DSO modules.  (Users of earlier releases will
need to recompile all modules in order to upgrade to 2.0.44.)

We consider this release to be the best version of Apache available
and encourage users of all prior versions to upgrade.

Apache 2.0.44 is available for download from

    <http://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi>

Please see the CHANGES_2.0 file, linked from the above page, for
a full list of changes.

Apache 2.0 offers numerous enhancements, improvements, and performance
boosts over the 1.3 codebase.  For an overview of new features introduced
after 1.3 please see

    <http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/new_features_2_0.html>

When upgrading or installing this version of Apache, please keep
in mind the following:

If you intend to use Apache with one of the threaded MPMs, you must
ensure that the modules (and the libraries they depend on) that you
will be using are thread-safe.  Please contact the vendors of these
modules to obtain this information.

                   Apache 2.0.44 Major changes

Security vulnerabilities closed since Apache 2.0.43

 *) Fixed the security vulnerability noted in VU#979793: Apache vulnerable
    to DoS via request for MS-DOS device on Windows 9x and Me.

 *) Fixed the security vulnerability noted in VU#825177: Apache allows
    arbitrary code execution via crafted POST request containing MS-DOS
    device name on Windows 9x and Me.

 *) Fix CAN-2002-0017: On Windows platforms Apache could be forced to serve
    unexpected files by appending illegal characters such as '<' to the
    request URL.

Bugs fixed and features added since Apache 2.0.43

 *) mod_autoindex: Bring forward the IndexOptions IgnoreCase option
    from Apache 1.3.  PR 14276
    [David Shane Holden <dpejesh@yahoo.com>, William Rowe]

 *) mod_mime: Workaround to prevent a segfault if r->filename=NULL
    [Brian Pane]

 *) Reorder the definitions for mod_ldap and mod_auth_ldap within
    config.m4 to make sure the parent mod_ldap is defined first.
    This ensures that mod_ldap comes before mod_auth_ldap in the
    httpd.conf file, which is necessary for mod_auth_ldap to load.
    PR 14256  [Graham Leggett]

 *) Fix the building of cgi command lines when the query string
    contains '='.  PR 13914  [Ville Skyttä <ville.skytta@iki.fi>,
    Jeff Trawick]

 *) Rename CacheMaxStreamingBuffer to MCacheMaxStreamingBuffer. Move
    implementation of MCacheMaxStreamingBuffer from mod_cache to
    mod_mem_cache. MCacheMaxStreamingBuffer now defaults to the
    lesser of 100,000 bytes or MCacheMaxCacheObjectSize. This should
    eliminate the need for explicitly coding MCacheMaxStreamingBuffer
    in most configurations. [Bill Stoddard]

 *) Replace APU_HAS_LDAPSSL_CLIENT_INIT with APU_HAS_LDAP_NETSCAPE_SSL
    as set by apr-util in util_ldap.c. This should allow mod_ldap
    to work with the Netscape/Mozilla LDAP library. [Øyvin Sømme
    <somme@oslo.westerngeco.slb.com>, Graham Leggett]

 *) Fix critical bug in new --enable-v4-mapped configure option
    implementation which broke IPv4 listening sockets on some
    systems.  [hiroyuki hanai <hanai@imgsrc.co.jp>]

 *) mod_setenvif: Fix BrowserMatchNoCase support for non-regex
    patterns [André Malo <nd@perlig.de>]

 *) Add version string to provider API.  [Justin Erenkrantz]

 *) mod_negotiation: Set the appropriate mime response headers
    (Content-Type, charset, Content-Language and Content-Encoding)
    for negotated type-map "Body:" responses (such as the error
    pages.)  [André Malo <nd@perlig.de>]

 *) mod_log_config: Allow '%%' escaping in CustomLog format
    strings to insert a literal, single '%'.
    [André Malo <nd@perlig.de>]

 *) mod_autoindex: AddDescription directives for directories
    now work as in Apache 1.3, where no trailing '/' is
    specified on the directory name.  Previously, the trailing
    '/' *had* to be specified, which was incompatible with
    Apache 1.3.  PR 7990  [Jeff Trawick]

 *) Fix for PR 14556. The expiry calculations in mod_cache were
    trying to perform "now + ((date - lastmod) * factor)" where
    date == lastmod resulting in "now + 0". The code now follows
    the else path (using the default expiration) if date is
    equal to lastmod. [rx@armstrike.com (Sergey), Paul J. Reder]

 *) Use AP_DECLARE in the debug versions of ap_strXXX in case the
    default calling convention is not the same as the one used by
    AP_DECLARE.  [Juan Rivera <Juan.Rivera@citrix.com>]

 *) mod_cache: Don't cache response header fields designated
    as hop-by-hop headers in HTTP/1.1 (RFC 2616 Section 13.5.1).
    [Estrade Matthieu <estrade-m@ifrance.com>, Brian Pane]

 *) mod_cgid: Handle environment variables containing newlines.
    PR 14550  [Piotr Czejkowski <apache@czarny.eu.org>, Jeff
    Trawick]

 *) Move mod_ext_filter out of experimental and into filters.
    [Jeff Trawick]

 *) Fixed a memory leak in mod_deflate with dynamic content.
    PR 14321  [Ken Franken <kfranken@decisionmark.com>]

 *) Add --[enable|disable]-v4-mapped configure option to control
    whether or not Apache expects to handle IPv4 connections
    on IPv6 listening sockets.  Either setting will work on
    systems with the IPV6_V6ONLY socket option.  --enable-v4-mapped
    must be used on systems that always allow IPv4 connections on
    IPv6 listening sockets.  PR 14037 (Bugzilla), PR 7492 (Gnats)
    [Jeff Trawick]

 *) This fixes a problem where the underlying cache code
    indicated that there was one more element on the cache
    than there actually was. This happened since element 0
    exists but is not used. This code allocates the correct
    number of useable elements and reports the number of
    actually used elements. The previous code only allowed
    MCacheMaxObjectCount-1 objects to be stored in the
    cache. [Paul J. Reder]

 *) mod_setenvif: Add SERVER_ADDR special keyword to allow
    envariable setting according to the server IP address
    which received the request.  [Ken Coar]

 *) mod_cgid: Terminate CGI scripts when the client connection
    drops.  PR 8388  [Jeff Trawick]

 *) Rearrange OpenSSL engine initialization to support RAND
    redirection on crypto accelerator.
    [Frederic DONNAT <frederic.donnat@zencod.com>]

 *) Always emit Vary header if mod_deflate is involved in the
    request.  [Andre Malo <nd@perlig.de>]

 *) mod_isapi: Stop unsetting the 'empty' query string result with
    a NULL argument in ecb->lpszQueryString, eliminating segfaults
    for some ISAPI modules.  PR 14399
    [Detlev Vendt <detlev.vendt@brillit.de>]

 *) mod_isapi: Fix an issue where the HSE_REQ_DONE_WITH_SESSION
    notification is received before the HttpExtensionProc() returns
    HSE_STATUS_PENDING.  This only affected isapi .dll's configured
    with the ISAPIFakeAsync on directive.  PR 11918
    [John DeSetto <jdesetto@radiantsystems.com>, William Rowe]

 *) mod_isapi: Fix the issue where all results from mod_isapi would
    run through the core die handler resulting in invalid responses
    or access log entries.  PR 10216 [William Rowe]

 *) Improves the user friendliness of the CacheRoot processing
    over my last pass. This version avoids the pool allocations
    but doesn't avoid all of the runtime checks. It no longer
    terminates during post-config processing. An error is logged
    once per worker, indicating that the CacheRoot needs to be set.
    [Paul J. Reder]

 *) Fix a bug where we keep files open until the end of a
    keepalive connection, which can result in:
    (24)Too many open files: file permissions deny server access
    especially on threaded servers.  [Greg Ames, Jeff Trawick]

 *) Fix a bug in which mod_proxy sent an invalid Content-Length
    when a proxied URL was invoked as a server-side include within
    a page generated in response to a form POST.  [Brian Pane]

 *) Added code to process min and max file size directives and to
    init the expirychk flag in mod_disk_cache. Added a clarifying
    comment to cache_util.   [Paul J. Reder]

 *) The value emitted by ServerSignature now mimics the Server HTTP
    header as controlled by ServerTokens.  [Francis Daly <deva@daoine.org>]

 *) Gracefully handly retry situations in the SSL input filter,
    by following the SSL libraries' retry semantics.
    [William Rowe]

 *) Terminate CGI scripts when the client connection drops.  This
    fix only applies to some normal paths in mod_cgi.  mod_cgid
    is still busted.  PR 8388  [Jeff Trawick]

 *) Fix a bug where 416 "Range not satisfiable" was being
    returned for content that should have been redirected.
    [Greg Ames]

 *) Fix memory leak in mod_ssl from internal SSL library allocations
    within SSL_get_peer_certificate and X509_get_pubkey.
    [Zvi Har'El <rl@math.technion.ac.il>
     Madhusudan Mathihalli <madhusudan_mathihalli@hp.com>].

 *) mod_ssl uses free() inappropriately in several places, to free
    memory which has been previously allocated inside OpenSSL.
    Such memory should be freed with OPENSSL_free(), not with free().
    [Nadav Har'El <nyh@math.technion.ac.il>,
     Madhusudan Mathihalli <madhusudan_mathihalli@hp.com>].

 *) Emit a message to the error log when we return 404 because
    the URI contained '%2f'.  (This was previously nastily silent
    and difficult to debug.)  [Ken Coar]

 *) Fix streaming output from an nph- CGI script.  CGI:IRC now
    works.  PR 8482  [Jeff Trawick]

 *) More accurate logging of bytes sent in mod_logio when
    the client terminates the connection before the response
    is completely sent  [Bojan Smojver <bojan@rexursive.com>]

 *) Fix some problems in the perchild MPM.
    [Jonas Eriksson <jonas@webkonsulterna.com>]

 *) Change the CacheRoot processing to check for a required
    value at config time. This saves a lot of wasted processing
    if the mod_disk_cache module is loaded but no CacheRoot
    was provided. This fix also adds code to log an error
    and avoid useless pallocs and procesing when the computed
    cache file name cannot be opened. This also updates the
     docs accordingly.  [Paul J. Reder]

 *) Introduce the EnableSendfile directive, allowing users of NFS
    shares to disable sendfile mechanics when they either fail
    outright or provide intermitantly corrupted data.  PR
    [William Rowe]

 *) Resolve the error "An operation was attempted on something
    that is not a socket.  : winnt_accept: AcceptEx failed.
    Attempting to recover." for users of various firewall and
    anti-virus software on Windows.  PR 8325  [William Rowe]

 *) Add the ProxyBadHeader directive, which gives the admin some
    control on how mod_proxy should handle bogus HTTP headers from
    proxied servers. This allows 2.0 to "emulate" 1.3's behavior if
    desired. [Jim Jagielski]

 *) Change the LDAP modules to export their symbols correctly
    during a Windows build. Add dsp files for Windows. Update
    README.ldap file for Windows build instructions.
    [Andre Schild <A.Schild@aarboard.ch>]

 *) Performance improvements for the code that generates HTTP
    response headers  [Brian Pane]

 *) Add -S as a synonym for -t -DDUMP_VHOSTS.
    [Thom May <thom@planetarytramp.net>]

 *) Fix a bug with dbm rewrite maps which caused the wrong value to
    be used when the key was not found in the dbm.  PR 13204
    [Jeff Trawick]

 *) Fix a problem with streaming script output and mod_cgid.
    [Jeff Trawick]

 *) Add ap_register_provider/ap_lookup_provider API.
    [John K. Sterling <john@sterls.com>, Justin Erenkrantz]

As an example,   a file in the document root called "`aa`" would be returned   by a request to Apache of `http://www.example.com/fred/<a`.  This issue was reported to the Apache Security Team by Lionel Brits   on 25th November 2002.   The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project   has assigned the name   [CAN-2003-0017](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0017)   to this issue. * Apache 2.0 before 2.0.44 on Windows platforms can be made to   crash or in some cases execute arbitrary code by malicious requests   that contain MS-DOS device names.  Part of this issue is not just limited to Apache, it is a known   security issue that various MS-DOS device names when accessed can cause some Windows   versions to crash. A   [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/Security/Bulletin/ms00-017.asp)   security bulletin contains a patch that should also be applied to   vulnerable systems.  This issue was reported to the Apache Security Team by Matthew Murphy   on 4th December 2002.   The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project   has assigned the name   [CAN-2003-0016](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0016)   to this issue.   These issues have both been fixed in Apache 2.0.44 which is now available. Windows users will also need to apply a patch to get Apache 2.0.44 to work correctly on their systems. The patch is [available for download](http://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi) and more information about the problem is available in [BZ#16288](http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=16288)   ---  In the news  Cross-Site Tracing issues Earlier this week a paper was published, ["Cross-Site Tracing"](http://www.cgisecurity.com/whitehat-mirror/WH-WhitePaper_XST_ebook.pdf) which gave details of how the `TRACE` HTTP request could be used in Cross-Site Scripting attacks. Unfortunately this issue has not been very well understood by the media and has received a unwarranted amount of attention.  When an HTTP `TRACE` request is sent to a web server that supports it, that server will respond echoing the data that is passed to it, including any HTTP headers. The paper explains that some browsers can be scripted to perform a `TRACE` request. A browser with this functionality could be made to issue a `TRACE` request against an arbitrary site and pass the results on elsewhere. Since browsers will only send authentication details and cookies to the sites that issue them this means a user having a browser with this functionality could be tricked into sending their cookies or authentication details for arbitrary sites to an attacker.  For example, if you visited a page that an attacker has carefully crafted, the page could cause your browser to bounce a `TRACE` request against some site for which you have authentication cookies. The result of the `TRACE` will be a copy of what was sent to the site, which will therefore include those cookies or authentication data. The carefully crafted page can then pass that information on to the attacker.  `TRACE` requests can be disabled by making a change to the Apache server configuration. Unfortunately it is not possible to do this using the `Limit` directive since the processing for the `TRACE` request skips this authorisation checking. Instead the following lines can be added which make use of the `mod_rewrite` module. ```  RewriteEngine On  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} ^TRACE  RewriteRule .* - [F]   ```  Although the particular attack highlighted made use of the `TRACE` functionality to grab authentication details, this isn't a vulnerability in `TRACE`, or in the Apache web server. The same browser functionality that permits the published attack can be used for different attacks even if `TRACE` is disabled on the remote web server. For example an attacker could create a carefully crafted page that when visited submits a hidden request to some arbitrary site through your browser, grabs the result and passes it to the attacker.   ---  Apache 2.0.44 Released Apache 2.0.44 was released on 21st January 2003 and is now the latest version of the Apache 2.0 server. The previous release was 2.0.43, released on the 3rd October 2002. [See what was new in Apache 2.0.43](http://www.apacheweek.com/features/apache2043).  [Apache 2.0.44 is available for download](http://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi).  This is a security, bug fix and minor upgrade release. Due to security issues, any sites using versions prior to Apache 2.0.44 on Windows should upgrade to Apache 2.0.44. [Read more about the other security issues that affect Apache 2.0](http://www.apacheweek.com/features/security-20).   Security issues  * Apache was vulnerable to a denial of service attack via a   request for MS-DOS device name on Windows 9x and Me. [CAN-2003-0016](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0016) * Apache allowed arbitrary code execution via crafted POST   request containing MS-DOS device name on Windows 9x and Me. * Apache could be forced to serve unexpected files on   Windows platforms by appending illegal characters such as '<' to the   request URL. [CAN-2002-0017](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2002-0017)   Bugs fixed The following bugs were found in Apache 2.0.43 and have been fixed in Apache 2.0.44:   * Allow escaping % sign in `CustomLog`   format strings * `mod_setenvif`: fix   `BrowserMatchNoCase` for non-regex patterns. * Return appropriate MIME response headers for negotiated   responses from a body embedded in a type-map * Prevent 416 "Range not satisfiable" response in place of a   redirect * Prevent files being left open for the duration of a   keepalive connection, which could cause a "Too many open files"   error * `mod_ssl`: several fixes for memory   handling and leaks * `mod_proxy`: fix invalid   `Content-Length` from pages fetched during server-side   include processing. * LDAP modules: ensure correct load order in httpd.conf   ([BZ#14256](http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=14256)); fix compatibility with Netscape LDAP libraries;   fix Win32 build * `mod_deflate`: fix a memory leak when   compressing dynamic content; always emit   `Vary` headers * `mod_isapi`: fix several compatibility   problems ([BZ#14399](http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=14399), [BZ#10408](http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=10408)), and fix bug which   caused invalid responses or log entries ([BZ#10216](http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=10216)) * CGI modules: fix streaming output from "nph-" scripts, for   example CGI::IRC ([BZ#8482](http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=8482)); fix construction of command line   from query strings ([BZ#13914](http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=13914)), handle environment variables   which contain newlines in `mod_cgid` ([BZ#14550](http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=14550)); terminate CGI scripts when connection is dropped ([BZ#8388](http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=8388)) * Caching modules: many bug fixes (including [BZ#14556](http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=14556)), and an HTTP compliance fix ([BZ#14556](http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=14556))   New features  * Add an `--enable-v4-mapped` configure option to   allow or disallow connections from IPv4-mapped addresses to IPv6   addresses, on applicable platforms ([BZ#14037](http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=14037), [PR#7492](http://archive.apache.org/gnats/7492)) * Add `IndexOptions IgnoreCase` option   to `mod_autoindex` ([BZ#14276](http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=14276)) * Add `EnableSendfile` directive to   disable use of `sendfile()` when necessary (for instance   when serving an NFS share) * Add `ProxyBadHeader` directive to   dictate handling of invalid HTTP responses headers * Add `SERVER_ADDR` keyword to   `mod_setenvif`, to represent the server IP address for   a particular request * Performance improvements * Add `-S` command-line option to   `httpd`, equivalent to `-t -DDUMP_VHOSTS`  ---  Featured articles In this section we highlight some of the articles on the web that are of interest to Apache users.  ["Unifying Web Clusters with Spread"](http://www.samag.com/documents/s%3D7789/sam0302a/0302a.htm) describes how Spread, a toolkit that provides a messaging service, can be used to implement distributed logging and to monitor applications running on many Web servers easily. The Apache module, `mod_log_spread` is an example where Spread is used to gather access logs for large web clusters into a single access log file.  O'Reilly ONLamp.com shows you [how to configure and build your very own PHP 4.3](http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/php/2003/01/17/phpcookbook.html) on Mac OS X. It provides a step-by-step guide on configuring PHP to enable additional extensions such as support for reading and writing XML using the DOM, and communicating with LDAP servers, and other parameters for a basic Apache and PHP installation.  ["Security with PHP Superglobals"](http://www.linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=6559) explains the concept of PHP Superglobals in layman terms. It starts by discussing two methods for submitting data through web forms known as `GET` and `POST`. Then it looks at the problem of identifying the origins of the variables and how Superglobals attempt to solve this. | | --- | | ---   This issue brought to you by: Mark J Cox, Joe Orton, Min Min Tsan | |  |

## Apache vulnerable to DoS via request for MS-DOS device

#### Vulnerability Note VU#979793

Original Release Date: 2003-02-12 | Last Revised: 2003-02-12

---

### Overview

Systems running the [Apache](http://www.apache.org/) web server under some versions of Microsoft Windows may be vulnerable to a remote denial-of-service condition.

### Description

| The [Apache HTTP server](http://httpd.apache.org/) fails to filter GET requests for MS-DOS style device names. This results in a denial-of-service vulnerability on systems running Apache under operating systems that use these device names (i.e., Microsoft Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows Millenium Edition). |
| --- |

### Impact

| Remote intruders can cause the Apache server program to crash. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply a patch from the vendor**  The Apache Software Foundation has released [version 2.0.44](http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/Announcement2.html) of the [Apache HTTP server](http://httpd.apache.org/) to address this vulnerability. Users are encouraged to upgrade to this version of the software.Furthermore, users of the Microsoft Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows 98 Second Edition operating systems are encouraged to apply the patches referenced in Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS00-017](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS00-017.asp) in order to prevent other applications from exploiting this vulnerability. |
