Ok here it is
Remote pine exploit
quite efficient since no "real offsets are needed" especially in the
first method of exploitation

Worx against grsec high security with random stack with "hard" method
since it is a return to libc tested vs slackware grsec

portbind on 6682 with FULL therminal support i.e. launch bx from ur exp =D

autodiscovers targets/offsets needed

redhat works too but only "easy" method... because of a pop ebp before a
ret.. there is no leave

worm can easily b made especially with "bruteforce" with about 99%
success!!

have fun =P

sorry i forgot to attach code ;D

 * Mon Sep 15 09:35:01 CEST 2003
 *
 * (remote?) Pine <= 4.56 exploit
 * by sorbo (sorbox@yahoo.com)
 * <http://www.darkircop.org>
 *
 * Ok won't talk much about the bug since as usual idefense advisories
 * are *proper* advisories and explain everything... exploiting the bug
 * is trivial after reading the adv:
 * <http://www.idefense.com/advisory/09.10.03.txt>
 * thanx zen ;D
 *
 * There are two ways of doing this:
 * 1) standard shellcode
 * we don't need offset here because of nature of hole...
 * all we need is distance from a variable to eip which is quite fixed
 * it is not like we need an "offset somewhere in stack"
 * just a relative distance
 *
 * 2) ret to libc (should work on fbsd too)
 * this requires our command string somewhere in memory
 * we may use .bss (fixed)
 * we also need distance from variable to ebp (quite fixed)
 * and we need addr of system (fixed)
 * This is "own" grsec since we don't really run a shellcode
 * and directly overwrite eip
 *
 * In both method i said u need the dist from var -> eip/ebp
 * this can actually be "bruteforced"
 * I didn't show this since this is a PoC and uses "exact offsets"
 * All u do is supply multiple charsets and overwrite larger areas of memory
 * This makes method 1 100% successfull (or letys say 99.9%)
 * (nice for remote exploitation)
 *
 * Method 2 is "slightly harder" to bruteforce since u must NOT overwrite
 * eip... so u must "stop ur bruteforce ad ebp" somehow... but thats kinda
 * gay ;D
 *
 * With unfallable method one a worm can easily be done...
 * shellcode that listens and uploads worm...
 * and executes a grep \@ /var/spool/mail/bla or whatever to get emails
 * or pine addr book
 *
 * also for normal "owning" u can use reverse telnetd shellcode
 * so u just keep a server up and don't have to "wait" for person
 * to launch sploit
 *
 * Greetz: zen-parse (thanks for your patience (if im not in ur ignore ;D))
 *		non metto i soliti stronzi de merda nei greetz (tipo gunzip ;D)
 *		e specialmente kuelle ke non me la danno ;D ahahah
 *
 *		#areyoucrazy@ircnet
 *			(most leet chan... fill it up with ur bots ;D)
 *
 *	and last but not least... the world must know: s0lar TI AMO!!!
 *
 *
 * ok enough... hope this exp is lame enough i wanted to close my summer
 * vacation with it and proove the world i had nothing better to do =D
 * college is starting c ya
 *
 * to own remotely: ./sorpine -o 1 -t bla@bla.com | sendmail -t
 *
 * Enjoy have fun!
