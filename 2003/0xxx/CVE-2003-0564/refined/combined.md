## Multiple vulnerabilities in S/MIME implementations

#### Vulnerability Note VU#428230

Original Release Date: 2003-11-04 | Last Revised: 2003-12-08

---

### Overview

Multiple vulnerabilities exist in different vendors' S/MIME (Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) implementations. The impacts of these vulnerabilities are varied and range from denial of service to potential remote execution of arbitrary code.

### Description

| The U.K. National Infrastructure Security Co-ordination Center (NISCC) has reported multiple vulnerabilities in different vendors' implementations of the Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) protocol. S/MIME allows binary objects and attachments to be sent across an email system. S/MIME extends the MIME specification by including the secure data in an attachment encoded using [ASN.1](http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/asn1/). If one of the entities in an email system knowingly or unknowingly send an exceptional ASN.1 element that cannot be handled properly by another party, the behavior of the application receiving such an element is unpredictable.  A test suite developed by NISCC has exposed vulnerabilities in a variety of S/MIME implementations. While most of these vulnerabilities exist in ASN.1 parsing routines, some vulnerabilities may occur elsewhere. Note that cryptographic libraries that implement S/MIME frequently provide more general-purpose cryptographic utility. In such libraries, it is common for ASN.1 parsing code to be shared between S/MIME and other cryptographic functions.Due to the general lack of specific vulnerability information, this document covers multiple vulnerabilities in different S/MIME implementations. Information about individual vendors is available in the Systems Affected section.  Further information is available in NISCC Vulnerability Advisory - [006489/SMIME](http://www.uniras.gov.uk/vuls/2003/006489/smime.htm) |

### Impact

1. Topic:

Updated mozilla, galeon and epiphany packages that fix multiple
vulnerabilities are now available.

Mozilla is an open-source Web browser, designed for standards
compliance, performance, and portability.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386
Red Hat Linux 9 - i386
Fedora Core 1 - i386

3. Problem description:

Note that some of these issues have already been fixed in Redhat 9 and
Fedora Core 1. Please refer to previous advisories for details.

NISCC testing of implementations of the S/MIME protocol uncovered a number
of bugs in NSS versions prior to 3.9. The parsing of unexpected ASN.1
constructs within S/MIME data could cause Mozilla to crash or consume large
amounts of memory. A remote attacker could potentially trigger these bugs
by sending a carefully-crafted S/MIME message to a victim. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
CAN-2003-0564 to this issue.

Andreas Sandblad discovered a cross-site scripting issue that affects
various versions of Mozilla. When linking to a new page it is still
possible to interact with the old page before the new page has been
successfully loaded. Any Javascript events will be invoked in the context
of the new page, making cross-site scripting possible if the different
pages belong to different domains. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0191 to
this issue.

Flaws have been found in the cookie path handling between a number of Web
browsers and servers. The HTTP cookie standard allows a Web server
supplying a cookie to a client to specify a subset of URLs on the origin
server to which the cookie applies. Web servers such as Apache do not
filter returned cookies and assume that the client will only send back
cookies for requests that fall within the server-supplied subset of URLs.
However, by supplying URLs that use path traversal (/../) and character
encoding, it is possible to fool many browsers into sending a cookie to a
path outside of the originally-specified subset. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
CAN-2003-0594 to this issue.

Zen Parse reported improper input validation to the SOAPParameter object
constructor leading to an integer overflow and controllable heap
corruption. Malicious JavaScript could be written to utilize this flaw and
could allow arbitrary code execution. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0722 to
this issue.

During a source code audit, Chris Evans discovered a buffer overflow and
integer overflows which affect the libpng code inside Mozilla. An attacker
could create a carefully crafted PNG file in such a way that it would cause
Mozilla to crash or execute arbitrary code when the image was viewed.
(CAN-2004-0597, CAN-2004-0599)

Zen Parse reported a flaw in the POP3 capability. A malicious POP3 server
could send a carefully crafted response that would cause a heap overflow
and potentially allow execution of arbitrary code as the user running
Mozilla. (CAN-2004-0757)

Marcel Boesch found a flaw that allows a CA certificate to be imported with
a DN the same as that of the built-in CA root certificates, which can cause
a denial of service to SSL pages, as the malicious certificate is treated
as invalid. (CAN-2004-0758)

Met - Martin Hassman reported a flaw in Mozilla that could allow malicious
Javascript code to upload local files from a users machine without
requiring confirmation. (CAN-2004-0759)

Mindlock Security reported a flaw in ftp URI handling. By using a NULL
character (%00) in a ftp URI, Mozilla can be confused into opening a
resource as a different MIME type. (CAN-2004-0760)

Mozilla does not properly prevent a frame in one domain from injecting
content into a frame that belongs to another domain, which facilitates
website spoofing and other attacks, also known as the frame injection
vulnerability. (CAN-2004-0718)

Tolga Tarhan reported a flaw that can allow a malicious webpage to use a
redirect sequence to spoof the security lock icon that makes a webpage
appear to be encrypted. (CAN-2004-0761)

Jesse Ruderman reported a security issue that affects a number of browsers
including Mozilla that could allow malicious websites to install arbitrary
extensions by using interactive events to manipulate the XPInstall Security
dialog box. (CAN-2004-0762)

Emmanouel Kellinis discovered a caching flaw in Mozilla which allows
malicious websites to spoof certificates of trusted websites via
redirects and Javascript that uses the "onunload" method. (CAN-2004-0763)

Mozilla allowed malicious websites to hijack the user interface via the
"chrome" flag and XML User Interface Language (XUL) files. (CAN-2004-0764)

The cert_TestHostName function in Mozilla only checks the hostname portion
of a certificate when the hostname portion of the URI is not a fully
qualified domain name (FQDN). This flaw could be used for spoofing if an
attacker had control of machines on a default DNS search path. (CAN-2004-0765)

Jesse Ruderman discovered a cross-domain scripting bug in Mozilla. If
a user is tricked into dragging a javascript link into another frame or
page, it becomes possible for an attacker to steal or modify sensitive
information from that site. Additionally, if a user is tricked into
dragging two links in sequence to another window (not frame), it is
possible for the attacker to execute arbitrary commands. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
CAN-2004-0905 to this issue.

Gael Delalleau discovered an integer overflow which affects the BMP
handling code inside Mozilla. An attacker could create a carefully crafted
BMP file in such a way that it would cause Mozilla to crash or execute
arbitrary code when the image is viewed. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0904 to
this issue.

Georgi Guninski discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in the vCard
display routines. An attacker could create a carefully crafted vCard file
in such a way that it would cause Mozilla to crash or execute arbitrary
code when viewed. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0903 to this issue.

Wladimir Palant discovered a flaw in the way javascript interacts with
the clipboard. It is possible that an attacker could use malicious
javascript code to steal sensitive data which has been copied into the
clipboard. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0908 to this issue.

Georgi Guninski discovered a heap based buffer overflow in the "Send
Page" feature. It is possible that an attacker could construct a link in
such a way that a user attempting to forward it could result in a crash or
arbitrary code execution. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0902 to this issue.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains
the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you have yum or
apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content. Please visit
<http://www.fedoralegacy.org/docs/> for directions on how to configure yum
and apt-get.
