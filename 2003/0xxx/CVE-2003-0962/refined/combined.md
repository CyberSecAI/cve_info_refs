Trustix Secure Linux Security Advisory #2003-0048

Package name:      rsync
Summary:           remote code execution
Date:              2003-12-04
Affected versions: TSL 1.2, 1.5, 2.0

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
Package description:
  Rsync uses a quick and reliable algorithm to very quickly bring
  remote and host files into sync.  Rsync is fast because it just
  sends the differences in the files over the network (instead of
  sending the complete files). Rsync is often used as a very powerful
  mirroring process or just as a more capable replacement for the
  rcp command.  A technical report which describes the rsync algorithm
  is included in this package.

Problem description:
  All versions of rsync prior to 2.5.7 contains a heap overflow that can
  be used to exceute arbitary code from remote.
  The Common Vulnerabilites and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
  assigned the name CAN-2003-0962 to this issue.

Action:
  We recommend that all systems with this package installed be upgraded.
  Please note that if you do not need the functionality provided by this
  package, you may want to remove it from your system.

Location:
  All TSL updates are available from

OpenPKG Security Advisory                            The OpenPKG Project
<http://www.openpkg.org/security.html>              <http://www.openpkg.org>
openpkg-security@openpkg.org                         openpkg@openpkg.org
OpenPKG-SA-2003.051                                          04-Dec-2003
________________________________________________________________________

Package:             rsync
Vulnerability:       arbitrary code execution
OpenPKG Specific:    no

Affected Releases:   Affected Packages:          Corrected Packages:
OpenPKG CURRENT      <= rsync-2.5.6-20030807     >= rsync-2.5.7-20031204
OpenPKG 1.3          <= rsync-2.5.6-1.3.0        >= rsync-2.5.6-1.3.1
OpenPKG 1.2          <= rsync-2.5.5-1.2.0        >= rsync-2.5.5-1.2.1

Dependent Packages:  none

Description:
  According to a rsync security advisory [[0]](#0), a heap overflow
  vulnerability exists in rsync [[1]](#1) version 2.5.6 and earlier when used
  as a rsync server which typically listens on TCP port 873. An exploit
  is already known. A successful attack can lead to arbitrary code
  execution in the run-time environment of the rsync server process. The
  attack is known to be considerably easier when the "use chroot = no"
  option is set in rsync.conf, which is not the default in OpenPKG. The
  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project assigned the id
  CAN-2003-0962 [[2]](#2) to the problem.

  Please check whether you are affected by running "<prefix>/bin/rpm -q
  rsync". If you have the "rsync" package installed and its version is
  affected (see above), we recommend that you immediately upgrade it
  (see Solution). [3][[4]](#4)

Solution:
  Select the updated source RPM appropriate for your OpenPKG release
  [5][[6]](#6), fetch it from the OpenPKG FTP service [7][[8]](#8) or a mirror
  location, verify its integrity [[9]](#9), build a corresponding binary RPM
  from it [[3]](#3) and update your OpenPKG installation by applying the binary
  RPM [[4]](#4). For the current release OpenPKG 1.3, perform the following
  operations to permanently fix the security problem (for other releases
  adjust accordingly).

  $ ftp ftp.openpkg.org
  ftp> bin
  ftp> cd release/1.3/UPD
  ftp> get rsync-2.5.6-1.3.1.src.rpm
  ftp> bye
  $ <prefix>/bin/rpm -v --checksig rsync-2.5.6-1.3.1.src.rpm
  $ <prefix>/bin/rpm --rebuild rsync-2.5.6-1.3.1.src.rpm
  $ su -
  # <prefix>/bin/rpm -Fvh <prefix>/RPM/PKG/rsync-2.5.6-1.3.1.*.rpm

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

rsync 2.5.6 security advisory
-----------------------------

December 4th 2003

Background
----------

The rsync team has received evidence that a vulnerability in rsync was
recently used in combination with a Linux kernel vulnerability to
compromise the security of a public rsync server. While the forensic
evidence we have is incomplete, we have pieced together the most
likely way that this attack was conducted and we are releasing this
advisory as a result of our investigations to date.

Our conclusions are that:

 - rsync version 2.5.6 contains a heap overflow vulnerability that can
   be used to remotely run arbitrary code.

 - While this heap overflow vulnerability could not be used by itself
   to obtain root access on a rsync server, it could be used in
   combination with the recently announced brk vulnerability in the
   Linux kernel to produce a full remote compromise.

 - The server that was compromised was using a non-default rsyncd.conf
   option "use chroot = no". The use of this option made the attack on
   the compromised server considerably easier. A successful attack is
   almost certainly still possible without this option, but it would
   be much more difficult.

Please note that this vulnerability only affects the use of rsync as a
"rsync server". To see if you are running a rsync server you should
use the netstat command to see if you are listening on TCP port
873. If you are not listening on TCP port 873 then you are not running
a rsync server.

New rsync release
-----------------

In response we have released a new version of rsync, version
2.5.7. This is based on the current stable 2.5.6 release with only the
changes necessary to prevent this heap overflow vulnerability. There
are no new features in this release.

We recommend that anyone running a rsync server take the following
steps:

   1) update to rsync version 2.5.7 immediately

   2) if you are running a Linux kernel prior to version 2.4.23 then
      you should upgrade your kernel immediately. Note that some
      distribution vendors may have patched versions of the 2.4.x
      series kernel that fix the brk vulnerability in versions before
      2.4.23. Check with your vendor security site to ensure that you
      are not vulnerable to the brk problem.

   3) review your /etc/rsyncd.conf configuration file. If you are
      using the option "use chroot = no" then remove that line or
      change it to "use chroot = yes".  If you find that you need that
      option for your rsync service then you should disable your rsync
      service until you have discussed a workaround with the rsync
      maintainers on the rsync mailing list.  The disabling of the
      chroot option should not be needed for any normal rsync server.

The patches and full source for rsync version 2.5.7 are available from
<http://rsync.samba.org/> and mirror sites. We expect that vendors will
produce updated packages for their distributions shortly.

GENTOO LINUX SECURITY ANNOUNCEMENT 200312-03
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

GLSA:        200312-03
summary:     exploitable heap overflow in rsync
severity:    high
date:        2003-12-04
exploit:     remote
affected:    <2.5.6*
fixed:       >=2.5.7

DESCRIPTION:

Rsync version 2.5.6 contains a vulnerability that can be used to run
arbitrary code. The Gentoo infrastructure team has some reasonably good
forensic evidence that this exploit may have been used in combination with
the Linux kernel brk vulnerability (see GLSA 200312-02) to exploit a
rsync.gentoo.org rotation server (see GLSA-200312-01.)

Please see <http://lwn.net/Articles/61541/> for the security advisory released
by the rsync development team.

SOLUTION:

To address this vulnerability, all Gentoo users should:

  Read GLSA-200312-02 and ensure that all systems are upgraded to a version
  of the Linux kernel without the brk vulnerability

  Upgrade to version 2.5.7 of rsync. This can be done by typing:

  	emerge sync;
  	emerge >=net-misc/rsync-2.5.7

  Review your /etc/rsyncd.conf configuration file; ensure that the use
  chroot="no" command is commented out or removed, or change use chroot="no"
  to use chroot="yes". Then, if necessary, restart rsyncd by typing:

  	/etc/init.d/rsyncd restart

//end

## Integer overflow vulnerability in rsync

#### Vulnerability Note VU#325603

Original Release Date: 2003-12-09 | Last Revised: 2006-05-01

---

### Overview

Some versions of the [rsync](http://rsync.samba.org/) program contain a remotely exploitable vulnerability. This vulnerability may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system.

### Description

| rsync is an open source utility that provides fast incremental file transfer. It features the ability to operate as either a client or server when transferring data over a network.  An integer overflow error has been discovered in a portion of rsync's memory handling routines. An attacker sending an extremely large, specifically crafted file may be able to exploit this error to execute arbitrary code from the heap of the rsync process address space. This error results in a vulnerability primarily when the rsync program is used in server mode, accepting input from remote clients over the network.Versions of the rsync software 2.5.6 and earlier contain this flaw. **Note:** We have received reports of this vulnerability being used to successfully compromise systems. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code in the context of the user running the rsync server, often root. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply patches**rsync version 2.5.7 has been released and contains patches to address this vulnerability.Users using packaged versions of the rsync software are encouraged to review the vendor information in the Systems Affected section of this document for more details. Users compiling the rsync software from the distribution source code can obtain the patched version from the [rsync homepage](http://rsync.samba.org/). |
| --- |

| **Workarounds**  Administrators, particularly those who are unable to apply the patches in a timely fashion, are encouraged to consider implementing the following workarounds:     + Disable the rsync service on systems that do not require it to be running. + Filter access to the rsync service. The rsync service normally runs on port 873/tcp. Limiting access to this port from trusted clients may reduce exposure to this vulnerability. |

Debian Security Advisory DSA 404-1                     security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                             Martin Schulze
December 4th, 2003                      <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : rsync
Vulnerability  : heap overflow
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2003-0962

The rsync team has received evidence that a vulnerability in all
versions of rsync prior to 2.5.7, a fast remote file copy program, was
recently used in combination with a Linux kernel vulnerability to
compromise the security of a public rsync server.

While this heap overflow vulnerability could not be used by itself to
obtain root access on an rsync server, it could be used in combination
with the recently announced do\_brk() vulnerability in the Linux kernel
to produce a full remote compromise.

Please note that this vulnerability only affects the use of rsync as
an "rsync server".  To see if you are running a rsync server you
should use the command "netstat -a -n" to see if you are listening on
TCP port 873.  If you are not listening on TCP port 873 then you are
not running an rsync server.

For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.5.5-0.2.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.5.6-1.1.

However, since the Debian infrastructure is not yet fully functional
after the recent break-in, packages for the unstable distribution are
not able to enter the archive for a while.  Hence they were placed in
my home directory on the security machine:

               <<http://klecker.debian.org/~joey/rsync/>>

We recommend that you upgrade your rsync package immediately if you
are providing remote sync services.  If you are running testing and
provide remote sync services please use the packages for woody.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for

DESCRIPTION
 "rsync"[1] is a program used mainly to mirror files between remote
 sites.

 rsync versions prior to 2.5.7 have a heap buffer overflow
 vulnerability[2] which can be exploited by remote attackers to
 execute arbitrary code.

 This vulnerability specially affects installations where rsync is
 used as a server/daemon, that is, where it was started with the
 --daemon command line argument.

 A new rsync version, 2.5.7, was released by the authors to address
 this vulnerability.

SOLUTION
 It is recommended that all rsync users upgrade their packages.

 IMPORTANT: after the update, the rsync server must be restarted
 manually if it was already running.

### [OpenBSD](#CRDY-5U2QQK) Affected

Updated:  December 08, 2003

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

A heap overflow exists in rsync versions 2.5.6 and below that can
be used by an attacker to run arbitrary code.  The bug only affects
rsync in server (daemon) mode and occurs \*after\* rsync has dropped
privileges.  By default, server will chroot(2) to the root of the
file tree being served which significantly mitigates the impact of
the bug.  Installations that disable this behavior by placing "use
chroot = no" in rsyncd.conf are vulnerable to attack.

Sites that do run rsync in server mode should update their rsync
package as soon as possible.  The rsync port has been updated in
the 3.3 and 3.4 -stable branches and a new binary package has been
built for OpenBSD 3.4/i386.  It can be downloaded from:

ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/3.4/packages/i386/rsync-2.5.7.tgz

1)  problem description, brief discussion, solution, upgrade information

    The rsync suite provides client and server tools to easily support an
    administrator keeping the files of different machines in sync.
    In most private networks the rsync client tool is used via SSH to fulfill
    his tasks. In an open environment rsync is run in server mode accepting
    connections from many untrusted hosts with, but mostly without,
    authentication.
    The rsync server drops its root privileges soon after it was started and
    per default creates a chroot environment.
    Due to insufficient integer/bounds checking in the server code a heap
    overflow can be triggered remotely to execute arbitrary code. This code
    does not get executed as root and access is limited to the chroot
    environment. The chroot environment maybe broken afterwards by abusing
    further holes in system software or holes in the chroot setup.

    Your are not vulnerable as long as you do not use rsync in server mode
    or you use authentication to access the rsync server.

    As a temporary workaround you can disable access to your rsync server for
    untrusted parties, enable authentication or switch back to rsync via SSH.

    Please download the update package for your distribution and verify its
    integrity by the methods listed in section 3) of this announcement.
    Then, install the package using the command "rpm -Fhv file.rpm" to apply
    the update.
    Our maintenance customers are being notified individually. The packages
    are being offered to install from the maintenance web.

2)  Pending vulnerabilities in SUSE Distributions and Workarounds:

    - discontinue of SuSE Linux 7.3
    Two years after the release, SUSE will discontinue providing updates
    and security fixes for the SuSE Linux 7.3 consumer product on the
    Intel i386 and the PPC Power PC architectures. Vulnerabilities found
    after December 15th 2003 will not be fixed any more for SuSE Linux
    7.3.
    Directory structures referring to the SuSE Linux 7.3 release will be
    moved to the discontinued/ tree on our main ftp server ftp.suse.com
    the distribution directories first, followed by the update/ directory
    tree in January 2004.
    Please note that our SuSE Linux Enterprise Server family products have
    a much longer support period. These products are not concerned by this
    announcement.

    - KDE
    New KDE packages are currently being tested. These packages fixes
    several vulnerabilities:
      + remote root compromise (CAN-2003-0690)
      + weak cookies (CAN-2003-0692)
      + SSL man-in-the-middle attack
      + information leak through HTML-referrer (CAN-2003-0459)
      + wrong file permissions of config files
    The packages will be release as soon as testing is finished.

    - mc
    By using a special combination of links in archive-files it is possible
    to execute arbitrary commands while mc tries to open it in its VFS.
    The packages are currently tested and will be release as soon as
    possible.

    - apache1/2
    The widely used HTTP server apache has several security vulnerabilities:
      - locally exploitable buffer overflow in the regular expression code.
        The attacker must be able to modify .htaccess or httpd.conf.
        (affects: mod\_alias and mod\_rewrite)
      - under some circumstances mod\_cgid will output its data to the
        wrong client (affects: apache2)
    Update packages are available on our FTP servers.

    - freeradius
    Two vulnerabilities were found in the FreeRADIUS package.
    The remote denial-of-service attack bug was fixed and new packages
    will be released as soon as testing was successfully finished.
    The other bug is a remote buffer overflow in the module rlm\_smb.
    We do not ship this module and will fix it for future releases.

    - screen
    A buffer overflow in screen was reported. Since SuSE Linux 8.0
    we do not ship screen with the s-bit anymore. An update package
    will be released for 7.3 as soon as possible.

    - mod\_gzip
    The apache module mod\_gzip is vulnerable to remote code execution
    while running in debug-mode. We do not ship this module in debug-mode
    but future versions will include the fix.
    Additionally the mod\_gzip code was audited to fix more possible security
    related bugs.

    - unace
    The tool unace for handling the archive format ACE is vulnerable to
    a buffer overflow that can be triggered with long file-names as command
    line argument. This only affects unace version 2.5. Unfortunately this
    tool is provided closed source only from the author. Therefore we are
    unable to check for other bugs or look at the patch.
    Update packages are available from our FTP servers.

3)  standard appendix: authenticity verification, additional information

  - Package authenticity verification:

    SUSE update packages are available on many mirror ftp servers all over
    the world. While this service is being considered valuable and important
    to the free and open source software community, many users wish to be
    sure about the origin of the package and its content before installing
    the package. There are two verification methods that can be used
    independently from each other to prove the authenticity of a downloaded
    file or rpm package:
    1) md5sums as provided in the (cryptographically signed) announcement.
    2) using the internal gpg signatures of the rpm package.

    1) execute the command
        md5sum <name-of-the-file.rpm>
       after you downloaded the file from a SUSE ftp server or its mirrors.
       Then, compare the resulting md5sum with the one that is listed in the
       announcement. Since the announcement containing the checksums is
       cryptographically signed (usually using the key security@suse.de),
       the checksums show proof of the authenticity of the package.
       We disrecommend to subscribe to security lists which cause the
       email message containing the announcement to be modified so that
       the signature does not match after transport through the mailing
       list software.
       Downsides: You must be able to verify the authenticity of the
       announcement in the first place. If RPM packages are being rebuilt
       and a new version of a package is published on the ftp server, all
       md5 sums for the files are useless.

    2) rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the authenticity
       of an rpm package. Use the command
        rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
       to verify the signature of the package, where <file.rpm> is the
       filename of the rpm package that you have downloaded. Of course,
       package authenticity verification can only target an un-installed rpm
       package file.
       Prerequisites:
        a) gpg is installed
        b) The package is signed using a certain key. The public part of this
           key must be installed by the gpg program in the directory
           ~/.gnupg/ under the user's home directory who performs the
           signature verification (usually root). You can import the key
           that is used by SUSE in rpm packages for SUSE Linux by saving
           this announcement to a file ("announcement.txt") and
           running the command (do "su -" to be root):
            gpg --batch; gpg < announcement.txt | gpg --import
           SUSE Linux distributions version 7.1 and thereafter install the
           key "build@suse.de" upon installation or upgrade, provided that
           the package gpg is installed. The file containing the public key
           is placed at the top-level directory of the first CD (pubring.gpg)
           and at ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/suse/pubring.gpg-build.suse.de .

  - SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
    subscribe:

    suse-security@suse.com
        -   general/linux/SUSE security discussion.
            All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
            To subscribe, send an email to
                <suse-security-subscribe@suse.com>.

    suse-security-announce@suse.com
        -   SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
            Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
            To subscribe, send an email to
                <suse-security-announce-subscribe@suse.com>.

    For general information or the frequently asked questions (faq)
    send mail to:
        <suse-security-info@suse.com> or
        <suse-security-faq@suse.com> respectively.

[slackware-security]  rsync security update (SSA:2003-337-01)

Rsync is a file transfer client and server.

A security problem which may lead to unauthorized machine access
or code execution has been fixed by upgrading to rsync-2.5.7.
This problem only affects machines running rsync in daemon mode,
and is easier to exploit if the non-default option "use chroot = no"
is used in the /etc/rsyncd.conf config file.

Any sites running an rsync server should upgrade immediately.

For complete information, see the rsync home page:

  <http://rsync.samba.org>

Here are the details from the Slackware 9.1 ChangeLog:
+--------------------------+

Trustix Secure Linux Security Advisory #2003-0048

Package name:      rsync
Summary:           remote code execution
Date:              2003-12-04
Affected versions: TSL 1.2, 1.5, 2.0

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
Package description:
  Rsync uses a quick and reliable algorithm to very quickly bring
  remote and host files into sync.  Rsync is fast because it just
  sends the differences in the files over the network (instead of
  sending the complete files). Rsync is often used as a very powerful
  mirroring process or just as a more capable replacement for the
  rcp command.  A technical report which describes the rsync algorithm
  is included in this package.

Problem description:
  All versions of rsync prior to 2.5.7 contains a heap overflow that can
  be used to exceute arbitary code from remote.
  The Common Vulnerabilites and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
  assigned the name CAN-2003-0962 to this issue.

Action:
  We recommend that all systems with this package installed be upgraded.
  Please note that if you do not need the functionality provided by this
  package, you may want to remove it from your system.

===========================================================

 More information :
    The glibc package contains the standard C libraries used by applications.

    When a user is a member of a large number of groups,the getgrouplist function in
    glibc allows attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation fault)
    and execute arbitrary code.

 Impact :
    This may allow attackers to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code.

 Affected Products :
    - Turbolinux 8 Server
    - Turbolinux 8 Workstation
    - Turbolinux 7 Server
    - Turbolinux 7 Workstation

 Solution :
    Please use turbopkg(zabom) tool to apply the update.

===========================================================
\* rsync -> Heap overflow
===========================================================

More information :
    rsync uses the "rsync algorithm" which provides a very fast method for
    bringing remote files into sync. It does this by sending just the
    differences in the files across the link, without requiring that both
    sets of files are present at one of the ends of the link beforehand.
    Rsync version 2.5.6 and earlier contains a heap overflow vulnerability
    that can be used to remotely run arbitrary code.

    Please note that this vulnerability only affects the use of rsync as a "rsync server".

 Impact :
    This vulnerability may allow remote third party to gain the root privileges.

 Affected Products :
    - Turbolinux 10 Desktop
    - Turbolinux 8 Server
    - Turbolinux 8 Workstation
    - Turbolinux 7 Server
    - Turbolinux 7 Workstation
    - Turbolinux Server 6.5
    - Turbolinux Advanced Server 6
    - Turbolinux Server 6.1
    - Turbolinux Workstation 6.0

 Solution :
    Please use turbopkg(zabom) tool to apply the update.
 ---------------------------------------------
 # turbopkg
 or
   zabom-1.x
 # zabom update rsync
   zabom-2.x
 # zabom -u rsync
