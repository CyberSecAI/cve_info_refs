```
Root cause of vulnerability: Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `msg.asp` page.
Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application fails to properly sanitize user-controlled input passed through the `message` parameter.
Impact of exploitation: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript or HTML code into the web page, potentially leading to cookie theft, session hijacking, or other client-side attacks. Injected iframes can be used to redirect users to malicious sites or display content from a different source.
Attack vectors: The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the XSS payload in the `message` parameter and tricks a user into accessing it.
Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to create or modify URLs that are then accessed by the victim. No special access to the server is required.
