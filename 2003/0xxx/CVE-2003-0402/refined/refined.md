The provided content describes a user enumeration vulnerability in Vignette software. Here's a breakdown:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The default login template (`/vgn/login`) in Vignette provides different responses depending on whether a username exists, doesn't exist, or is disabled. This allows attackers to distinguish between these states.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **User Enumeration:** The application reveals information about the validity of usernames, making it possible to enumerate valid accounts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can gather a list of valid usernames.
- **Brute-Force Attacks:**  Knowledge of valid usernames makes brute-force password attacks more efficient, as attackers can target known valid accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending requests to the `/vgn/login` template.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to access the `/vgn/login` page of the Vignette application. No special privileges or authentication are required to perform the enumeration.

**Additional Details:**
- This vulnerability was tested in Vignette StoryServer 5 and Vignette V/5, but the report suggests that all currently available versions might be vulnerable.
- The recommended solution is to modify the `/vgn/login` template to avoid providing explicit error messages that differentiate between user states.
