The provided content describes a directory traversal vulnerability in NetMeeting's file transfer feature.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Insufficient input validation when processing filenames during file transfers. Specifically, the application does not properly sanitize filenames containing "..\..\" sequences, allowing path traversal.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Directory traversal vulnerability: The application allows an attacker to write files to arbitrary locations within the filesystem, escaping the intended destination directory for received files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary file creation: An attacker can create files in any directory on the victim's system.
- Arbitrary code execution: By placing malicious DLLs in NetMeeting's directory or executables in the system's startup directory, the attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution when NetMeeting or the system is next started.
- Potential for hiding malicious actions: An attacker can send the malicious file and then disrupt the NetMeeting connection to hide the file transfer dialog.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network: The vulnerability is exploited through a NetMeeting file transfer during a conference.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be a participant in a NetMeeting conference with the victim.
- The attacker needs to be able to send files via NetMeeting's file transfer feature.
- They need to modify the filename during the transfer process using a debugger or similar method to inject "..\..\" sequences. This can be automated.
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of the target system's file paths to place the malicious files effectively.
