Subject:    Local root exploit in SuSE Linux 7.3Pro

Affected:               SuSE Linux 7.3Pro
Not affected:           SuSE Linux 8.2Pro, non-SuSE distributions
Possibly affected:      other SuSE distributions
Vulnerable package:     javarunt

Impact:                 Local user can gain root privileges
Exploit type:           Symlink attack
Release date:           October 6th 2003
Vendor status:          SuSE was contacted on September 4th (> 1 month ago).
                        No SuSE-patch yet.

A symlink vulnerability exists in the shell script
/sbin/conf.d/SuSEconfig.javarunt. This file is part of the package "javarunt"
(Java runtime environment).

This vulnerability can be used by a local attacker to gain root privileges. An
exploit has already been written by me, but I will not release it before
October 20th.

Workaround:
As there is no SuSE patch available yet, you will have to fix this yourself.
You can use the following quick'n'dirty patch to fix the issue. Note however
that I am NOT responsible if you mess up your system! You should know what
you're doing!

In the mentioned script you should replace _every_ occurrence of

/tmp/.java_wrapper

with the following:

/root/.java_wrapper.$$

Again, this is not pretty but it should work.

This advisory, contact information and the exploit can be found at

Beware of he, who would deny you access to information. For in his heart, he
dreams himself your master.

Hash: SHA1

I am answering both mails from Stefan Nordhausen to bugtraq, about symlink
race conditions in the packages susewm (1) and javarunt (Java Runtime
Environment) (2).

These bugs are confirmed and are being processed, according to their
severity. Which also means that these two bugs have been superseded by
more severe ones in our queue.
There will soon be update packages for the affected products, of course.

We thank Stefan Nordhausen for notifying these weaknesses to SuSE
Security.

Thanks,
Roman Drahtmüller,
SuSE Security.
