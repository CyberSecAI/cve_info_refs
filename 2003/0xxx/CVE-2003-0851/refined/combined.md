# Security Contacts and Procedures

Red Hat takes security very seriously, and we aim to take immediate action to
address serious security-related problems that involve our products or
services.

Please report any suspected security vulnerability in a Red Hat product or service to Red Hat Product Security at secalert@redhat.com. You can use our [GPG key](#contact) to communicate with us securely.

To report an issue in any Red Hat branded website or online service, please contact Red Hat Information Security at site-security@redhat.com.

## When to contact Red Hat Product Security

You should contact Red Hat Product Security if:

* You think there might be a security vulnerability in a Red Hat product or service.
* You want to provide feedback about our standards of service and performance. If you feel your security concern is not dealt with in a satisfactory manner, please contact secalert@redhat.com.

In all other cases, you should contact [Red Hat Customer Experience & Engagement](/site/support/).

You should contact Red Hat Customer Experience & Engagement if:

* You are unsure about how a known vulnerability affects a Red Hat product or service.
* You wish to report an issue in a language other than English.
* You require technical assistance for a security function (for example, "How do I configure my firewall?").
* You need help upgrading packages due to security alerts. (Refer to "How do I apply package updates from the Red Hat Network?" for information on upgrading packages.)
* Your issue is not security related.

In any of these cases, please contact [Red Hat Customer Experience & Engagement](/site/support/) instead.

## Who reads email sent to secalert@redhat.com?

Only members of Red Hat Product Security, a restricted
and carefully chosen group of Red Hat employees, will have access to
material sent to the secalert@redhat.com address. No outside users can subscribe to this list.

## Reporting security vulnerabilities in Red Hat Offerings

Red Hat Product Security welcomes and encourages all potential vulnerability submissions. For us to provide the best customer service and address issues in a timely manner, please provide the following information, if known:

* The version number of the affected component, such as the rpm package, container image, and java component.
* The environment and corresponding version(s) where the issue was discovered, for example, the operating system's name, version, architecture, or container platform.
* The steps to reproduce, if available.
* The ways an attacker could exploit this vulnerability on a system.
* Is the vulnerability already known to the public? If not, when is the planned date for disclosure?
* The immediate impact if an attacker exploits the vulnerability, such as a denial of service, privilege escalation, or remote code execution.

## How to contact us securely

Red Hat Product Security uses an OpenPGP key to secure our email communications. Mail sent to secalert@redhat.com can be encrypted with this public key. We expect to change the key we use from time to time. Should we change the key, the previous keys will be revoked, and the [rhsa-announce](http://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/rhsa-announce) mailing list will be notified of the change.

advisories are available from [Red Hat Product Security](/site/security/updates/) and via the [Red Hat Customer Portal](/site/security/updates/active/).

## Common Criteria Timely Updates

Refer to the [Life Cycle Security Update Policy](https://access.redhat.com/security/lifecycle-security-update-policy) for information on Red Hat's security update policy as well as information on embargoed (undisclosed) vulnerability handling.

### Resources include the following:

[Red Hat Security Updates (Advisories)](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/security-advisories)

[Red Hat CVE Database](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/cve)

[Red Hat Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure (CVE) Program](https://access.redhat.com/articles/red_hat_cve_program)

## Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD)

Red Hat engages with partners, vendors, researchers, and community coordinators to disclose newly discovered vulnerabilities in hardware, software, and services. Multi-party coordination is a complex process, and understanding the parties' vulnerability disclosure policies, vulnerability handling policies, and contractual agreements opens the way to trusted communication and collaboration. Increasing transparency between parties assures that vendors can understand and manage the risk imposed by the vulnerability and facilitate engagements with other parties. The aim of CVD is to provide timely and consistent guidance to parties and customers to help them protect themselves.

Please see the [Red Hat CNA Vulnerability Disclosure Policy](https://access.redhat.com/articles/red_hat_cna_vulnerability_disclosure_policy) for details on how Red Hat discloses security vulnerabilities under the Red Hat/Fedora scope.

For more information on CVD, please review the information provided in the following links:

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# RHSA-2004:119 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

openssl security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

Updated OpenSSL packages that fix a remote denial of service vulnerability
are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1.

## Description

OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3) and
Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols as well as a full-strength
general purpose cryptography library.

Testing performed by the OpenSSL group using the Codenomicon TLS Test Tool
uncovered a bug in older versions of OpenSSL 0.9.6 prior to 0.9.6d that can
lead to a denial of service attack (infinite loop). The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
CAN-2004-0081 to this issue.

Testing performed by Novell using a test suite provided by NISCC uncovered
an issue in the ASN.1 parser in versions of OpenSSL 0.9.6 prior to 0.9.6l
which could cause large recursion and possibly lead to a denial of service
attack if used where stack space is limited. The Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0851
to this issue.

These updated packages contain patches provided by the OpenSSL group that
protect against these issues.

NOTE: Because server applications are affected by this issue, users are
advised to either restart all services using OpenSSL functionality or
restart their system after installing these updated packages.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade. Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated. Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated. Note that you
can also use wildcards (\*.rpm) if your current directory \*only\* contains the
desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network. Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates. To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

If up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL
Certificate Errors, you need to install a version of the
up2date client with an updated certificate. The latest version of
up2date is available from the Red Hat FTP site and may also be
downloaded directly from the RHN website:

<https://rhn.redhat.com/help/latest-up2date.pxt>

Fedora Legacy would like to thank Michal Jaegermann for bringing this issue
to our attention.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you have yum or
apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content. Please visit
<http://www.fedoralegacy.org/docs> for directions on how to configure yum
and apt-get.

## OpenSSL 0.9.6k does not properly handle ASN.1 sequences

#### Vulnerability Note VU#412478

Original Release Date: 2003-11-04 | Last Revised: 2003-11-05

---

### Overview

A vulnerability in the way OpenSSL handles ASN.1 elements could allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service on systems running Microsoft Windows.

### Description

| [OpenSSL](http://www.openssl.org/) implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols and includes a general purpose cryptographic library. SSL and TLS are commonly used to provide authentication, encryption, integrity, and non-repudiation services to network applications such as HTTP, IMAP, POP3, LDAP, and others. Clients and servers exchange authentication information in X.509 certificates. While the SSL and TLS protocols are not directly based on ASN.1, they do rely on ASN.1 objects used in X.509 certificates and other cryptographic elements (e.g. PKCS#1 encoded RSA values).  OpenSSL 0.9.6k does not properly handle certain ASN.1 sequences. As a result, OpenSSL performs a recursive function call that could exhaust system resources and crash the process using the OpenSSL library. This denial-of-service condition has only been observed on Microsoft Windows platforms. OpenSSL 0.9.7 is not affected.From the OpenSSL [advisory](http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20031104.txt):  ``` A bug in OpenSSL 0.9.6 would cause certain ASN.1 sequences to triggera large recursion.  On platforms such as Windows this large recursioncannot be handled correctly and so the bug causes OpenSSL to crash.  Aremote attacker could exploit this flaw if they can send arbitraryASN.1 sequences which would cause OpenSSL to crash.  This could beperformed for example by sending a client certificate to a SSL/TLSenabled server which is configured to accept them. ``` The U.K. National Infrastructure Security Co-ordination Centre ([NISCC](http://www.niscc.gov.uk/)) is tracking this vulnerability as [NISCC/006489/openssl2](http://www.uniras.gov.uk/vuls/2003/006489/openssl2.htm). |
| --- |

### Impact

| By providing specially crafted ASN.1 encoded data to a vulnerable system, a remote attacker could cause a denial of service by consuming system resources. This has only been observed on Microsoft Windows systems. One potential attack vector is a client certificate message containing specially crafted X.509 certificates. Note that OpenSSL versions 0.9.7c or 0.9.6k and above do not accept unsolicited client certificates (VU#732952). |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade or Patch**Upgrade to OpenSSL 0.9.7c or 0.9.6l. Alternatively, upgrade or apply a patch as specified by your vendor. Further information is available in an [advisory](http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20031104.txt) from OpenSSL. Note that it is necessary to recompile any applications that are statically linked to OpenSSL libraries. |
