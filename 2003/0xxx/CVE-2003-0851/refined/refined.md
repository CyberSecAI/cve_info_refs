        "vulnerability": "The description from Red Hat Bugzilla indicates that this CVE is related to a vulnerability in the ASN.1 parser of OpenSSL versions prior to 0.9.6l which could cause large recursion, leading to a potential denial of service attack, particularly on systems with limited stack space.",
         "weaknesses": [
          "Improper handling of ASN.1 sequences leading to excessive recursion."

         "additional_details": "This vulnerability was discovered during testing by Novell using a test suite provided by NISCC and affects OpenSSL versions before 0.9.6l. It can result in a denial of service due to stack overflow. The bug report also links to the RHSA-2004:119 errata that addresses the issue."
