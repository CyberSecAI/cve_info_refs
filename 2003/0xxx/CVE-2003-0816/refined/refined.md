{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) does not properly validate the source domain of script contained within a URL, specifically javascript: URLs. This allows an attacker to bypass the browser's cross-domain security model, which is designed to prevent scripts from different domains from accessing each other's data.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper validation of URL source",
      "Cross-domain security model bypass",
      "Script injection"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running IE. Additionally, they can read or modify data in other websites by reading cookies or modifying content.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafted HTML documents (web page or HTML email)",
      "Use of DHTML methods (window.open(), external.NavigateAndFind()) with crafted javascript: URLs",
      "Exploiting vulnerabilities via a crafted javascript: URL cached in the browser's history",
       "Using IFRAME or BASE href to store a target domain or crafted javascript: URL",
       "Referencing a frame with a crafted URL using the file: protocol"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to convince a victim to open a crafted HTML document (either a web page or an HTML email). No other special capabilities are required once the document is opened.",
     "additional_information": "The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a javascript: URL and then causing it to be executed in a different security domain. The attacker could exploit this by:  1) Opening a frame with a crafted javascript: URL and accessing it from the same frame after opening a page in the target domain.  2) Using an IFRAME element or BASE href to store a target domain or crafted javascript: URL, then opening a frame in the target domain, and finally referencing the stored URL from the same frame.  3) Opening a frame in the target domain and referencing it with a crafted URL using the file: protocol. Specific methods like window.open(), external.NavigateAndFind(), and even caching vulnerabilities in the browser history can be leveraged to trigger the vulnerability. The attacker can execute arbitrary code by causing the script to be evaluated in the Local Machine Zone. Furthermore, they can exploit vulnerabilities through a crafted HTML document and utilizing known TARGET values (like _search, or _media)."
