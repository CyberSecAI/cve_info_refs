{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `make_wtmp` function within the `acct.c` file of the Cistron RADIUS daemon. The vulnerability occurs when the NAS-Port number (`ut->nas_port`) exceeds 2^31, which can cause the `sprintf` function to write a negative number (up to 11 characters) into a 32-byte buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow",
      "Integer Overflow leading to incorrect formatting"
    ],
    "impact": "The buffer overflow can overwrite other data structures in memory, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.  Specifically, the overflow can overwrite the return address on the stack, causing the program to jump to an attacker controlled location. The attacker may be able to gain root privileges on the RADIUS server through a crafted sequence of RADIUS accounting records.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafted RADIUS accounting packets with a large NAS-Port number."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must obtain or guess a RADIUS key to send crafted accounting packets to the RADIUS server. This could potentially be achieved through vulnerable shell servers that authenticate via RADIUS and have a world readable configuration file `/etc/pam_radius_auth.conf`.",
    "additional_details": "The overflow is not just a single byte overflow as initially thought. The overflow can overwrite parts of other strings from previous packets in memory leading to a more severe situation than a single byte overflow. The vulnerability can cause a segmentation fault and crash the accounting process. This bug is exploitable as the data which overwrites the status and NAS IP are not random."
