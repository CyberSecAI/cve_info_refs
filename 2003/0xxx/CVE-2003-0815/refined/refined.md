      "cve_id": "CVE-2003-0815",
      "is_related": true,
      "technical_description": "This vulnerability involves a function pointer override within Internet Explorer's cross-domain security model. This model is designed to prevent windows from different domains from sharing information. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker could execute script within the My Computer zone, potentially leading to the ability to access information from other websites, access local files, and run arbitrary code on the user's system, with the same privileges as the logged-on user.",
       "root_cause": "A programming function in Internet Explorer improperly handles cross-domain security checks, allowing an attacker to bypass the intended security restrictions.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Cross-domain security model bypass",
        "Improper handling of function pointers"
      ],
      "impact": "Remote Code Execution. Successful exploitation could lead to the attacker gaining access to sensitive information, local files, and the ability to execute arbitrary code on the user's machine.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Malicious Web site: An attacker could host a malicious website containing a specially crafted page designed to exploit this vulnerability.",
        "HTML email: An attacker could send a specially crafted HTML email designed to exploit this vulnerability."
      ],
        "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to host a malicious website or send a crafted HTML email to entice a user to interact with the malicious content and exploit the vulnerability within the user's browser."
