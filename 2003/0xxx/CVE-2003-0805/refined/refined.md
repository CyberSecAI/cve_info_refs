Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities in UMN gopherd:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **FTP Gateway Buffer Overflow:** The `GopherFile` function in `ftp.c` copies a filename from an FTP LIST response into a fixed-size buffer `tmpName` using `strcpy` without any bounds checking. A long filename in the FTP response can cause a buffer overflow.
*   **GSisText() Buffer Overflow:** The `GSisText` function in `GSgopherobj.c` copies the "view" string into a fixed-size buffer `viewstowage` using `strcpy`, without checking its length. A long "view" string provided by a client can cause a buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** Both vulnerabilities are classic buffer overflows due to the use of `strcpy` without input sanitization or length checks.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The server fails to validate the length of strings received from the client or external sources (FTP server), leading to exploitable overflows.
*   **Use of Insecure Functions:** The reliance on `strcpy` without proper checks is a significant weakness.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of both vulnerabilities leads to arbitrary code execution on the server. This allows an attacker to potentially gain control of the server.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The ftp gateway exploit needs to be run as root to bind to port 21, so if successful an attacker could gain root privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **FTP Gateway Exploit:** Requires a malicious FTP server on port 21. The attacker sends a crafted LIST response with an overly long filename that overflows the `tmpName` buffer in the UMN gopherd server. The gopher client requests a gopher url with an ftp:// scheme, which triggers the vulnerable code.
*   **GSisText() Exploit:** The attacker sends a crafted gopher request with a long "view" string. The request must start with a specific character (h, 0, 4, 5, 9, s, I, or g) followed by a tab, the long string, and then a tab and a "1". The overflow occurs when processing the crafted view string.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the UMN gopherd server.
*   **FTP Server (for FTP Gateway Exploit):** The attacker needs to operate a malicious FTP server on port 21, which the vulnerable gopherd server connects to. This exploit also needs to be run as root on the attacking machine.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know the location of the vulnerabilities and how to craft exploit payloads.

**Additional Details:**
* The provided exploits include shellcode that opens a bind shell on port 45295.
* The ftp exploit sets up a fake ftp server locally to connect to, in order to send the crafted ftp response.
* The GSisText exploit uses a brute force approach by trying various return addresses.
* The vulnerabilities exist in gopherd versions v3.0.5, v3.0.4, v3.0.3, v3.0.2, v3.0.1, v3.0.0(-1), and v2.3.1 (patch level 0 through 15). It is assumed versions before 2.3.1 are vulnerable as well.
* The maintainers of the UMN gopher software have deprecated gopherd and recommend migrating to PyGopherd.
