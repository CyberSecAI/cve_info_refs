Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2003-0987:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The `mod_digest` module in Apache 1.3 did not properly verify the nonce of a client response during Digest authentication. It failed to check if the nonce was generated by the server, allowing for potential replay attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Nonce Verification:** The core issue was the lack of proper verification of the nonce received from the client. The server did not validate if it had previously issued that nonce.
*   **Replay Attack:** An attacker could potentially capture a valid authentication response (including the nonce) from a legitimate user and reuse it to gain unauthorized access, bypassing authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** Successful exploitation would allow an attacker to bypass authentication and gain access to protected resources, impersonating a legitimate user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Sniffing:** An attacker would likely need to eavesdrop on network traffic to capture a valid authentication exchange between a legitimate user and the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be in a position to capture network traffic between a client and the vulnerable Apache server.
*   **Knowledge of Authentication Flow:** The attacker needs an understanding of the Digest authentication process to replay captured requests correctly.

**Additional details from the content:**

*   The fix involves adding a secret, `AuthNonce`, which is used to generate a unique nonce, and adding a check to verify if a nonce was actually issued by the server.
*   The fix was implemented by adding a function `ap_auth_nonce` to generate a per-realm nonce and use this value to create a md5 hash. The server will verify the client provided md5 hash value with one generated using the stored `AuthNonce` value.
*   The documentation was updated to recommend setting an `AuthNonce` directive.
*   The advisory notes that `mod_auth_digest` does not have this vulnerability.
*   The advisory notes this issue does not affect `mod_auth_digest`.
*   The fix for this vulnerability involves changes to `src/ApacheCore.def`, `src/ApacheCoreOS2.def`, `src/CHANGES`, `src/include/ap_mmn.h`, `src/include/http_core.h`, `src/main/http_core.c`, `src/main/http_protocol.c`, `src/modules/standard/mod_digest.c`, and documentation in `htdocs/manual/mod/mod_digest.html`, and `htdocs/manual/mod/core.html.en`
