- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A buffer overflow occurs when Eudora processes an attachment filename containing an excessive number of dots and characters.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The vulnerability is a buffer overflow due to insufficient bounds checking when parsing the attachment filename.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The primary impact is a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, causing Eudora to crash. The application becomes unusable until the offending email is removed from the mailbox using an external utility. The exception log shows an access violation in KERNEL32.DLL.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves sending a specially crafted email with an attachment filename containing a long sequence of ".A" substrings.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker only needs to send a malicious email to a victim using the vulnerable version of Eudora. No other special capabilities or positioning is required. The attacker does need to craft the malicious filename.
