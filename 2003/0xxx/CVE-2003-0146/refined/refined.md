  "CVE-2003-0146": {
    "relevant_content": true,
    "summary": "Multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities were discovered in NetPBM, a set of graphics conversion tools. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by loading specially crafted image files.",
    "details": [
      {
        "type": "Root cause",
        "text": "The root cause of the vulnerability is due to multiple math overflow errors within the NetPBM code, specifically in calculations involving image dimensions and color depth. Some of these overflows are straightforward multiplications of dimensions, while others are related to handling large filenames and signed value overflows."
      },
      {
        "type": "Weaknesses",
        "text": "The vulnerabilities are buffer overflows that occur due to improper handling of image file data during processing. Specifically, these occur when allocating memory based on multiplication of image dimensions and depth that can result in integer overflows. There are also signed integer overflow issues and incorrect handling of large file names."
      },
       {
        "type": "Impact",
        "text": "The impact of these vulnerabilities could range from denial of service to potential code execution. Successful exploitation is achieved by loading a malicious image file into a vulnerable application using NetPBM.  The practical impact may be limited as NetPBM itself is not setuid, but applications that use it may be vulnerable."
      },
      {
        "type": "Attack vectors",
         "text": "The attack vector is through malicious image files processed by software using the NetPBM library."
      },
      {
        "type": "Required attacker capabilities",
        "text": "The attacker would need to create a malicious image file designed to trigger the overflow when processed by NetPBM. The attacker would need to entice a user or application to process the malicious image. "
