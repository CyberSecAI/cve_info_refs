#### Paper 2003/052

### Attacking RSA-based Sessions in SSL/TLS

Vlastimil Klima, Ondrej Pokorny, and Tomas Rosa

##### Abstract

In this paper we present a practically feasible attack on RSA-based sessions in SSL/TLS protocols. These protocols incorporate the PKCS#1 (v. 1.5) encoding method for the RSA encryption of a premaster-secret value. The premaster-secret is the only secret value that is used for deriving all the particular session keys. Therefore, an attacker who can recover the premaster-secret can decrypt the whole captured SSL/TLS session. We show that incorporating a version number check over PKCS#1 plaintext used in the SSL/TLS creates a side channel that allows the attacker to invert the RSA encryption. The attacker can then either recover the premaster-secret or sign a message on behalf of the server. Practical tests showed that two thirds of randomly chosen Internet SSL/TLS servers were vulnerable. The attack is an extension of Bleichenbacher’s attack on PKCS#1 (v. 1.5). We introduce the concept of a bad-version oracle (BVO) that covers the side channel leakage, and present several methods that speed up the original algorithm. Our attack was successfully tested in practice and the results of complexity measurements are presented in the paper. Plugging a testing server (2x Pentium III/1.4 GHz, 1 GB RAM, 100 Mb/s Ethernet, OS RedHat 7.2, Apache 1.3.27), it was possible to achieve a speed of 67.7 BVO calls per second for a 1024 bits RSA key. The median time for a whole attack on the premaster-secret could be then estimated as 54 hours and 42 minutes. We also propose and discuss countermeasures, which are both cryptographically acceptable and practically feasible.

## SSL/TLS implementations disclose side channel information via PKCS #1 v1.5 version number extension

#### Vulnerability Note VU#888801

Original Release Date: 2003-04-23 | Last Revised: 2004-08-25

---

### Overview

SSL/TLS implementations that respond distinctively to an incorrect PKCS #1 v1.5 encoded SSL/TLS version number expose the premaster secret to a modified Bleichenbacher attack. An attacker could decrypt a given SSL/TLS session or forge a signature on behalf of a vulnerable application's private RSA key.

### Description

| Vlastimil Klíma, Ondᖞj Pokorný, and Tomáš Rosa have published a research [paper](http://eprint.iacr.org/2003/052/) describing a modified Bleichenbacher attack against RSA-based SSL/TLS applications. As in Bleichenbacher, the new attack uses side channel information from error messages and seeks to discover the premaster secret that is used as a basis for SSL/TLS session keys.  The Bleichenbacher attack ([CA-1998-07](http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-1998-07.html)) is computationally feasible against RSA-based applications that use Public-Key Cryptography Standard ([PKCS](http://www.rsasecurity.com/rsalabs/pkcs/index.html)) #1 v1.5 and return distinctive errors when the premaster secret in the Client hello message is not properly formatted. By sending a large number of chosen ciphertexts (premaster secrets) and monitoring the applications' responses, an attacker can discover the correct premaster secret for a given SSL/TLS session. With the premaster secret for a previously captured SSL/TLS session, the attacker can generate the correct master secret and session keys and decrypt the captured session. For more information about the Bleichenbacher attack, see [*Chosen Ciphertext Attacks Against Protocols Based on the RSA Encryption Standard PKCS #1*](http://link.springer.de/link/service/series/0558/papers/1462/14620001.pdf), RSA Laboratories Bulletin Number 7, and CERT Advisory [CA-1998-07](http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-1998-07.html).A widely accepted defense against the Bleichenbacher attack is for an RSA/PKCS #1 application to discard a malformed premaster secret, replace it with a random value, and proceed to generate a master secret and session keys. Since the client and server use different values for the premaster secret, they will generate different session keys, and the SSL/TLS session will fail. Note that the server must not provide a response that is distinguishable based on syntax (i.e. "Bad PKCS #1 format") or time (i.e. sending an error message immediately after discovering that the premaster secret is malformed).The Klíma-Pokorný-Rosa attack exploits server responses to an incorrect or unexpected SSL/TLS version number that is included as part of the premaster secret ([RFC 2246](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2246.txt) section 7.4.7.1). If a server decrypts a properly formatted PKCS #1 premaster secret and discovers that the SSL/TLS version number is not what was expected, the server may immediately send an error message ("Bad SSL/TLS version number"). The authors term a server that exhibits this behavior a "bad version oracle (BVO)." Instead of using an error response to improper PKCS #1 formatting, this new attack uses an error response to an incorrect SSL/TLS version number. Klíma-Pokorný-Rosa have also introduced some optimizations to the Bleichenbacher attack, partly due to the SSL/TLS standard only using a subset of the PKCS #1 v1.5 format (section 3.2). This allows an attacker to search less space for the correct premaster secret.This attack is feasible using widely available hardware. Under ideal laboratory conditions (100Mbps closed network, unloaded server with 2 X Pentium III 1.4GHz CPUs and 1 GB of RAM, Red Hat Linux 7.2, Apache 1.3.27/mod\_ssl), the median time required for a successful attack is around 54.7 hours (~13 million guesses).Since the SSL/TLS version number is a protocol-specific extension of the PKCS #1 format, other applications that use RSA/PKCS #1 to exchange keying information are not vulnerable to this attack. In particular, SSH1 using RSA only encrypts a session key. No version or other information is included. IKE authenticated with public key encryption is further protected by an ephemeral Diffe-Hellman exchange. For specific vendor information, see the Systems Affected section below. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker who is able to capture an encrypted SSL/TLS session and query the server while it is using the same private RSA key that was used for the captured session could decrypt the captured session. An attacker could also forge a signature that appeared to be from the server (section 3.4). |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade or Patch**Upgrade or apply a patch as specified by your vendor. In order to defeat this specific attack, an SSL/TLS server must not respond distinctively when a premaster secret sent by the client contains an incorrect or unexpected SSL/TLS version number. The paper recommends that an SSL/TLS server always replace the client-provided version number with the expected version number as determined from either the Client hello or Server hello messages (section 6.2). |
| --- |

| **Manage private keys**Use different private keys for different applications and servers and change keys as appropriate for your site and security policy. An attacker cannot decrypt a premaster secret encrypted with one RSA key by querying a server that uses a different key.**Monitor SSL/TLS applications and servers**Monitor RSA applications and servers for signs of attack. In the case of an attack against SSL/TLS web servers, logs may show a relatively high number of network connections and failed attempts to establish SSL/TLS sessions. Depending on baseline performance, servers may show increased CPU usage or an above average number of network connections. |

### Vendor Statement

PuTTY cannot be vulnerable to any attack of this type in the SSH1 transport layer, since it is an SSH client only and the RSA decryption is done in the server.

1) problem description, brief discussion, solution, upgrade information
Researchers from the University of Stanford have discovered certain
weaknesses in OpenSSL's RSA decryption algorithm. It allows remote
attackers to compute the private RSA key of a server by observing
its timing behavior. This bug has been fixed by enabling "RSA blinding",
by default.
Additionally an extension of the "Bleichenbacher attack" has been
developed by Czech researchers against OpenSSL. This weakness has
also been fixed.
Please download the update package for your distribution and verify its
integrity by the methods listed in section 3) of this announcement.
Then, install the package using the command "rpm -Fhv file.rpm" to apply
the update.
Our maintenance customers are being notified individually. The packages
are being offered to install from the maintenance web.

2) Pending vulnerabilities in SuSE Distributions and Workarounds:
- glibc
New glibc packages will be available soon which fix a RPC XDR integer
overflow. The packages are currently being tested.
- vnc
VNC (Virtual Network Computing) uses a weak cookie generation process
which can be exploited by an attacker to bypass authentication.
New packages are currently being tested and will be available on our
FTP servers soon.

3) standard appendix: authenticity verification, additional information
- Package authenticity verification:
SuSE update packages are available on many mirror ftp servers all over
the world. While this service is being considered valuable and important
to the free and open source software community, many users wish to be
sure about the origin of the package and its content before installing
the package. There are two verification methods that can be used
independently from each other to prove the authenticity of a downloaded
file or rpm package:
1) md5sums as provided in the (cryptographically signed) announcement.
2) using the internal gpg signatures of the rpm package.
1) execute the command
md5sum <name-of-the-file.rpm>
after you downloaded the file from a SuSE ftp server or its mirrors.
Then, compare the resulting md5sum with the one that is listed in the
announcement. Since the announcement containing the checksums is
cryptographically signed (usually using the key security@suse.de),
the checksums show proof of the authenticity of the package.
We disrecommend to subscribe to security lists which cause the
email message containing the announcement to be modified so that
the signature does not match after transport through the mailing
list software.
Downsides: You must be able to verify the authenticity of the
announcement in the first place. If RPM packages are being rebuilt
and a new version of a package is published on the ftp server, all
md5 sums for the files are useless.
2) rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the authenticity
of an rpm package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, where <file.rpm> is the
filename of the rpm package that you have downloaded. Of course,
package authenticity verification can only target an un-installed rpm
package file.
Prerequisites:
a) gpg is installed
b) The package is signed using a certain key. The public part of this
key must be installed by the gpg program in the directory
~/.gnupg/ under the user's home directory who performs the
signature verification (usually root). You can import the key
that is used by SuSE in rpm packages for SuSE Linux by saving
this announcement to a file ("announcement.txt") and
running the command (do "su -" to be root):
gpg --batch; gpg < announcement.txt | gpg --import
SuSE Linux distributions version 7.1 and thereafter install the
key "build@suse.de" upon installation or upgrade, provided that
the package gpg is installed. The file containing the public key
is placed at the top-level directory of the first CD (pubring.gpg)
and at ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/suse/pubring.gpg-build.suse.de .
