{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization within the DEC UDK processing of XFree86's xterm application. Specifically, a specific escape sequence can trigger an infinite loop in the process consuming resources.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
       "Denial of service"
    ],
    "impact": "A denial of service attack. The process gets stuck in an infinite loop, consuming resources and potentially making the terminal unresponsive. This could prevent an administrator from seeing subsequent logs during a compromise.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker can display a specially crafted escape sequence to the vulnerable terminal emulator through various means (e.g., syslog, command output, etc.).",
     "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send the malicious escape sequence to the terminal. This could be achieved remotely or through local access.",
    "affected_components": [
        "xterm"
    ]
