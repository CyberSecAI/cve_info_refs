Security advisory 20031006 - Appendix A (proof of concept)
- ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Product:                  slocate
  Vulnerability type:       buffer overflow (corrupt heap)
  Impact:                   gaining elevated privileges
  Severity:                 medium (exploitation proved)
  Issue date:               2003/10/11
  Last updated:             2003/10/11

  Security advisory:        SA-20031006
======================================================================

Description
- -----------

Mr. Hornik has discovered vulnerability SA-20031006 in slocate package
version  2.6.  This  is  proof  that  exploitation  is possible and so
unauthorized   users  may  run  arbitraty  code  under  slocate  group
privileges and so read global slocate database.

Exploitation
- ------------

The  exploitation  which  allows overwriting memory management data of
the  heap  was  described  in  original  advisory. We are reffering to
source  lines  from  slocate-2.6-1.src.rpm  from  RH 7.3 here too. The
attached  source  code constants are for RH 7.3 on i686 on 2003/10/10,
except that some parts of them are * here.

The  main  idea  behind  the exploitation is not straightforward, so I
describe  it  below.  The  attached  source code prepares test.db with
following  properties.  It  exploits the bug by:

slocate -i -d test.db `perl -e 'print "B"x1024'`

1, We overwrite one byte of the buffer management headers the overflow
allows  to  overwrite  - it is highest byte of size of memory block of
codedpath. We will trigger realloc on main.c:1269 later.

2,  We are playing here with codedpath, casestr and bucket_of_holding.
They  are  allocated  in this order. When casestr is big enough, it is
placed   on   the   heap  after  codedpath.  By  big  enough  database
bucket_of_holding is reallocated to 0x4002**** region later.

3,  We  need to prepare the area where the codedpath ends according to
overwriten block size so chunk_free called from chunk_realloc will not
fail  because  of  accessing inaccessible memory or finding bad values
there.  But only the highest byte of memory block size can be changed,
so the size change will be multiply of 0x1000000. The needed data (two
small blocks just after overwriten codepath, first memory block marked
as  used)  are  placed  on  0x400*****  by  having them on appropriate
position in database. The change in size is 0x38 * 0x1000000.

4,  We  trigger realloc on main.c:1269, so overwriten block size value
is  used.  We  trigger  realloc  by  prepare path which is longer than
initial  size  (4096  bytes).  We  are  reallocating  to size which is
smaller  than  the overwriten size and big enough to end after casestr
ends.

5,  Then  we  can  overwrite casestr and memory after it by writing to
codedpath  because  memory  management thinks codedpath is so long. We
will  overwrite  the  size  of  memory block of casestr to 0x508 (from
0x408).  Later  free(casestr)  is called and it seems it is top in its
memory  area so free behaves differently than we want. We change it so
comparison of address of next block with top simply fails.

6,  We  place fake memory blocks after casestr such that free(casestr)
overwrites  address  of  close() in GOT to point to our arbitrary code
(by  setting  fake  backward and forward pointers in next (free) block
after  casestr).  On main.c:1357 close(fd) is called and our code gets
the  control.  We  setregid(slocate,slocate) and run the shell. That's
it.

======================================================================
Security advisory 20031006
- ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Product:                  slocate
  Vulnerability type:       buffer overflow (corrupt heap)
  Extended type:            possibly gaining elevated privileges
  Severity:                 low
  Issue date:               2003/10/06
  Last updated:             2003/10/06
======================================================================

Description
- -----------

Mr.  Hornik  has  discovered  buffer overflow vulnerability in slocate
version 2.6. Many Linux distributions have their slocate package based
on  this  version.  We found at least RedHat package to be vulnerable.
The  vulnerability  corrupts  heap  management structures and possibly
leads to gaining slocate group privileges, which allows reading global
slocate database and thus obtaining list of all files in the system by
unauthorized user.

Vulnerability
- -------------

Program slocate works on user supplied database with setgid to slocate
group.  With  user  prepared  slocate  database  one can cause (we are
reffering to source lines from slocate-2.6-1.src.rpm from RH 7.3) that
pathlen  after  executing  main.c:1255  will have value -1. It must be
caused by not the first path in the database because it is verified in
validate_db.  Then  on  line main.c:1275 the last byte of memory block
header  (this memory block size) will be overwritten with user suplied
value. The codedpath is never freed by the code, but it is possible to
trigger realloc on line 1269 later by data in database.

Because  of  not freeing some dynamic memory, using multiple databases
and  multiple  search  patterns  it should be possible to prepare heap
before  triggering  this  vulnerability  to  allow  later execution of
arbitrary  code,  thus  gaining  slocate group privileges. This allows
reading  of  global  slocate  database  with  list of all files in the
system  by  unauthorized  user.  The  exploit is not available at this
time.

Suggested  and  correct  patch  is to change condition on line 1263 to
pathlen <= 0.

Who is affected?
- ----------------

Affected are all RedHat distributions up to version 9.0 including.

slocate  version  2.6 and below is vulnerable. slocate version 2.7 and
all packages based on this version are not vulnerable.

Recommendations
- ---------------

We  recommend to upgrade slocate package to the fixed version.

If  obtaining the list of all files on the system by unauthorized user
is  security  risk  for  your  system  we  recommend to remove slocate
database  and  disable automatic generation of this database (as daily
cron  job)  or  remove  slocate utility or generate database only from
safe files until fixed version is installed.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
