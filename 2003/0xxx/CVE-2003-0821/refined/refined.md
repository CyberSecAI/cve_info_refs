  "vulnerability_details": {
    "excel": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists because of the method Excel uses to check the spreadsheet before reading the macro instructions.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper macro security checks."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can bypass macro security, allowing malicious XLM (Excel 4) macros to execute automatically, regardless of the security level. This can lead to actions like changing data, communicating with websites, reformatting the hard disk, or altering application security settings.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Crafting a malicious Excel spreadsheet containing a malicious macro.",
        "Persuading a user to open the crafted file."

    },
    "word": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists due to the way Word checks the length of a data value (Macro names) embedded in a document.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Buffer overflow due to improper length validation of macro names."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can overflow a data value in Word, allowing arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user opening the document. This could lead to actions like adding, changing, or deleting data/files, communicating with websites, or formatting the hard drive.",
        "attack_vectors": [
        "Crafting a malicious Word document containing a malicious macro.",
        "Persuading a user to open the crafted file."
