| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=23850#c0)  TTSG Internet Services, Inc.    2003-10-15 21:11:26 UTC  ``` 1) Create directory off root of server 2) Put in following .htaccess  AuthType Basic  AuthName Restricted Satisfy Any  AuthDBMUserFile /local/server/.htpasswd  <Limit GET POST> order deny,allow deny from all allow from 216.231.111.17 allow from 64.21.99.146  require valid-user  </Limit>  3) Access from 216.231.111.17, requests a password 4) Access from 64.21.99.146, doesn't request a password 5) Put change statement to "allow from 216.231.111.17/32" 6) Access from 216.231.111.17 no longer asks for password 7) Add "Allow from 204.107.90.128" (Out of the /19 that the server and 216.231.111.17 are in, but still advertised via BGP locally) and can't access. Use "Allow from 204.107.90.128/32", can.  Why does it seem like if the IP is in a network local we have to put /32 on it, and if its remote it works ok? ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=23850#c1)  Joshua Slive    2003-10-17 14:20:11 UTC  ``` I'm very skeptical you've identified a bug here for several reasons:  1. I've never heard of any problem remotely like this before, and these features are used frequently.  2. The fact that you are using <Limit GET POST> shows that you are not following recommended practices for apache configuration, and therefore there could be many other things wrong with your config.  I suggest you start with an absolutely default install of apache with no extra modules and no config modifications except the ones you suggest below.  If it still doesn't work, you can reopen this bug, but be sure to provide more details about what is in your logs, the exact OS version, etc.  Thanks for using Apache! ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=23850#c2)  TTSG Internet Services, Inc.    2003-11-02 01:25:05 UTC  ``` Hi,  Ok, we did some investigation.   1) Download/uncompress/untar source 2) Compile with gcc 3.2.3 with just ./configure;make;make install 3) Create a directory under htdocs called testing, put in an .htaccess of :  AuthDBMUserFile /local/wwwcust/passes/sample AuthDBMGroupFile /dev/null AuthName Members_Only AuthType Basic  Satisfy Any  order deny,allow  deny from all  allow from 24.193.48.116  allow from 202.139.152  allow from 210.80.149  allow from 216.183.31.224/27  allow from 209.88.233.224/27  allow from 209.88.69.192/27  allow from 209.135.126  allow from 64.8.218  allow from 63.201.23  allow from 217.145.67.0/25  allow from 62.39.85  allow from 216.231.111.14 require valid-user  4) Edit the stock httpd.conf where it depicts the default document root like <Directory /usr/local/etc/httpd/htdocs> and change the "AllowOverride None" to "AllowOverride All". Start server 5) From 216.231.111.14 attempt to access the directory, it will ask for an id/pass 6) Change it to 216.231.111.14/32, it works.  Delete all directories and configs.   Start the instructions again, except in step 2 , change it to "CC=gcc -m32" infront of the ./configure;make;make install At step 5, it will let you in immediately.   So, it seems, in 64 bit mode it has issues, but not 32 bit.  We can reproduce this on mutiple machine that we own, and others own. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=23850#c3)  Joshua Slive    2003-11-02 03:03:29 UTC  ``` Interesting.  I assume that it doesn't matter if you remove the Auth*/Require/Satisfy directives and just test mod_access?  I don't have a solaris system handy to test on, but if someone does, I'm sure they'd be interested in your exact OS/patch level. ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=23850#c4)  TTSG Internet Services, Inc.    2003-11-02 20:31:00 UTC  ``` With only the following in .htaccess:   order deny,allow deny from all allow from 216.231.113.11 allow from 24.193.48.116   I see the same symptoms, coming from the 24.* address I get in (Outside our network) , from 216.* (local subnet) I get forbidden, if I add the /32 it works fine.  This server is running Solaris 9, kernel patch level 112233-07, apache 1.3.28 compiled with 64-bit gcc3.2.3 with a standard build , using gnu make 3.80 (also built 64-bit). ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=23850#c5)  Joe Orton    2003-11-02 23:01:52 UTC  ``` What's the result of running:  $ cd srclib/apr/test $ make testall $ ./testall -v testipsub  from the 64-bit build tree?  ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=23850#c6)  TTSG Internet Services, Inc.    2003-11-02 23:19:20 UTC  ``` Hi,  I find no "apr" directory anywhere in the Apache 1.3.X tree when I untar it.  Thanks, Tuc/TTSG Internet Services, Inc. ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=23850#c7)  Joe Orton    2004-03-07 22:11:04 UTC  ``` This was found and fixed independently by Henning Brauer from the OpenBSD team; the fix is checked in here for the next 1.3 release; thanks for the report.  <http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/apache-1.3/src/modules/standard/mod_access.c?r1=1.46&r2=1.47>   ``` |  |

# Apache 1.3: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200405-22**

Several security vulnerabilities have been fixed in the latest release of
Apache 1.3.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-servers/apache** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.3.31** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.3.31** |

### Background

The Apache HTTP Server Project is an effort to develop and maintain an
open-source HTTP server for modern operating systems. The goal of this
project is to provide a secure, efficient and extensible server that
provides services in tune with the current HTTP standards.

### Description

On 64-bit big-endian platforms, mod\_access does not properly parse
Allow/Deny rules using IP addresses without a netmask which could result in
failure to match certain IP addresses.

Terminal escape sequences are not filtered from error logs. This could be
used by an attacker to insert escape sequences into a terminal emulater
vulnerable to escape sequences.

mod\_digest does not properly verify the nonce of a client response by using
a AuthNonce secret. This could permit an attacker to replay the response of
another website. This does not affect mod\_auth\_digest.

On certain platforms there is a starvation issue where listening sockets
fails to handle short-lived connection on a rarely-accessed listening
socket. This causes the child to hold the accept mutex and block out new
connections until another connection arrives on the same rarely-accessed
listening socket thus leading to a denial of service.

### Impact

These vulnerabilities could lead to attackers bypassing intended access
restrictions, denial of service, and possibly execution of arbitrary code.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All users should upgrade to the latest stable version of Apache 1.3.

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=www-servers/apache-1.3.31"
 # emerge ">=www-servers/apache-1.3.31"
```

These include a possible denial-of-service attack as well as the ability to possible pipe shell escapes through Apache's errorlog (which could create an exploit if the error log is read in a terminal program that does not filter such escapes).  We recommend that sites running Apache upgrade to the new Apache package.  More details about these issues may be found in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database:    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0987   http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0020   http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0174   http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0993   Here are the details from the Slackware 9.1 ChangeLog: +--------------------------+ Wed May 12 13:06:39 PDT 2004 patches/packages/apache-1.3.29-i486-2.tgz:  Patched four security issues   in the Apache web server as noted on http://httpd.apache.org.   These security fixes were backported from Apache 1.3.31:      In mod_digest, verify whether the nonce returned in the client     response is one we issued ourselves.

# Apache HTTP Server 1.3 vulnerabilities

This page lists all security vulnerabilities fixed in released versions of Apache HTTP Server 1.3. Each vulnerability is given a security [impact rating](/security/impact_levels.html) by the Apache security team - please note that this rating may well vary from platform to platform. We also list the versions the flaw is known to affect, and where a flaw has not been verified list the version with a question mark.

Please note that if a vulnerability is shown below as being fixed in a "-dev" release then this means that a fix has been applied to the development source tree and will be part of an upcoming full release.

Please send comments or corrections for these vulnerabilities to the [Security Team](/security_report.html).

### Apache httpd 1.3 has had no new releases since 2010 and should not be used. This page only lists security issues that occurred before March 2010. Subsequent issues may have affected 1.3 but will not be investigated or listed here. Users are advised to upgrade to the currently supported released version to address known issues.

### moderate: Expect header Cross-Site Scripting ([CVE-2006-3918](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2006-3918))

A flaw in the handling of invalid Expect headers. If an attacker can influence the Expect header that a victim sends to a target site they could perform a cross-site scripting attack. It is known that some versions of Flash can set an arbitrary Expect header which can trigger this flaw. Not marked as a security issue for 2.0 or 2.2 as the cross-site scripting is only returned to the victim after the server times out a connection.

### moderate: mod\_proxy buffer overflow ([CVE-2004-0492](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-0492))

A buffer overflow was found in the Apache proxy module, mod\_proxy, which can be triggered by receiving an invalid Content-Length header. In order to exploit this issue an attacker would need to get an Apache installation that was configured as a proxy to connect to a malicious site. This would cause the Apache child processing the request to crash, although this does not represent a significant Denial of Service attack as requests will continue to be handled by other Apache child processes. This issue may lead to remote arbitrary code execution on some BSD platforms.

### low: mod\_digest nonce checking ([CVE-2003-0987](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2003-0987))

mod\_digest does not properly verify the nonce of a client response by using a AuthNonce secret. This could allow a malicious user who is able to sniff network traffic to conduct a replay attack against a website using Digest protection. Note that mod\_digest implements an older version of the MD5 Digest Authentication specification which is known not to work with modern browsers. This issue does not affect mod\_auth\_digest.

### important: Multiple header Denial of Service vulnerability ([CVE-1999-1199](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-1999-1199))

A serious problem exists when a client sends a large number of headers with the same header name. Apache uses up memory faster than the amount of memory required to simply store the received data itself. That is, memory use increases faster and faster as more headers are received, rather than increasing at a constant rate. This makes a denial of service attack based on this method more effective than methods which cause Apache to use memory at a constant rate, since the attacker has to send less data.
