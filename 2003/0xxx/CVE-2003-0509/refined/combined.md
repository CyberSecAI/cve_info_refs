<http://www.cyberstrong.com/eshop/features.asp>
I know there's lotsa features there.

Details:
CyberStrong provide trial/demo software, in encrypted thought.
But the encryption not as big as its sounds like.

Well, the bugs lies on the application libraries.
And got fired via 10expand.asp, 10browse.asp, and 20review.asp.

With manipulated SQL injection, an attacker would be able to gain some
information including admin's user and admin's password.
Which is can be used thorugh web based admin interface on
/admin/mlogin.asp.

Exploits/POC:
http://[target]/eshop/10Expand.asp?ProductCode='
http://[target]/eshop/20Review.asp?ProductCode='

Vendor Response:
Contacted. No response.

Recommendation:
No recommendation for this.
For workaround, just protect /admin dir with .htpasswd.
(but its not very effective, an attacker still can do query, but at least it
would be slowing their jobs)
