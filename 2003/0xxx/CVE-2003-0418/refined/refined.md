Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The Linux 2.0 kernel's IP stack incorrectly calculates the size of an ICMP citation when generating ICMP error messages. This miscalculation leads to the inclusion of extra bytes of memory in the ICMP response.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Incorrect ICMP Citation Size Calculation:** The kernel does not correctly determine the required size for the ICMP citation, causing it to read beyond the intended buffer.
- **Memory Leak:** The miscalculation results in the disclosure of potentially sensitive data from kernel memory in the ICMP response.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Leak:** An attacker can gain access to sensitive information stored in the server's memory, which could include passwords, configuration data, or other confidential data.
- **Further Exploitation:** Leaked information could be used to aid further attacks on the target system or network.
- **Wide Exposure:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the internet as long as IP packets can be sent to the target, with the exception of special firewalling.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **ICMP Error Trigger:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending packets to the target system that will cause an ICMP error to be generated (e.g., IP reassembly time exceeded, destination unreachable).
- **Manipulating IP options:** The size of the data leaked can be increased by manipulating IP options, potentially exposing even more memory content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send IP packets to the vulnerable host. This can be from the internet.
- **No Special Privileges:** No special privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Linux kernel versions 2.0 up to and including 2.0.39.
- The leaked data is not always consistent and depends on the content of the memory at the time of the error generation.
-  The vulnerability affects devices and appliances using vulnerable versions of Linux, such as firewalls or proxies.
- A proof of concept python script is available to test for this issue.
- Patches are available to address the issue.
- Watchguard Firebox II was known to be vulnerable.
