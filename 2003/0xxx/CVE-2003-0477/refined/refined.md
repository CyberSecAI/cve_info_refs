- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The wzdftpd server crashes when it receives a "PORT" command without any arguments.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The server does not properly handle a "PORT" command with missing arguments, leading to a crash. This indicates a lack of input validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The server crashes, leading to a denial of service (DoS). The server becomes unavailable, preventing legitimate users from accessing its services.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can send a "PORT" command without arguments to the server over an FTP connection.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker only needs to be able to establish an FTP connection to the vulnerable server. No special privileges or internal access is required.
