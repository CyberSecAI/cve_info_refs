Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2003-0720:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in PINE (Program for Internet News & Email) when parsing the `message/external-body` type attribute name/value pairs. Specifically, the `display_parameters()` routine in `mailview.c` is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The code does not properly check the length of the attribute names, leading to a buffer overflow when an attribute name exceeds the available space (20KB buffer `tmp_20k_buf`).
-  The `sprintf` function writes the attribute name, value and padding into the buffer, potentially overflowing the buffer if the attribute name is too long.
- The size of the buffer is defined as `SIZEOF_20KBUF (20480)`
- The code snippet vulnerable is:
```c
d = tmp_20k_buf;
if(parmlist = rfc2231_newparmlist(params)){
    while(rfc2231_list_params(parmlist) && d < tmp_20k_buf + 10000){
        sprintf(d, "%-*s: %s\n", longest, parmlist->attrib,
                parmlist->value ? strsquish(tmp_20k_buf + 11000,
                parmlist->value, 100)
                : "");
        d += strlen(d);
    }
```

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  By carefully crafting a malicious email with an oversized attribute name within the `message/external-body`, an attacker can overwrite control structures in memory, leading to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running PINE.
- This vulnerability can be used to create a worm by targeting email addresses found in readable text files.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Email:** The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted email that contains a malformed `message/external-body` type with an oversized attribute name.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely by sending a malicious email to a PINE user.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to socially engineer the victim into opening the malicious email.
- **Knowledge of Target:** Exploitation requires knowledge of the specific version of PINE being used, due to memory layout differences and code changes.

**Additional Details**
- The `tmp_20k_buf` is a 20KB char array residing in the .bss section.
- The overflow happens when the `sprintf` writes the formatted string into `d` pointer which points to the `tmp_20k_buf`
- `rfc2231_newparmlist` and `rfc2231_list_params` are used to parse the parameters of message/external-body
