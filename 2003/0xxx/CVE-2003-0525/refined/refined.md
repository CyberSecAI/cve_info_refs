- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A flaw exists in a Windows NT 4.0 file management function that can cause memory that it does not own to be freed when a specially crafted request is passed to it.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper memory management where the affected function can free memory that it does not own. This is triggered by a specially crafted request.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A denial of service. An attacker can cause an application using the vulnerable function to fail. The operating system itself does not fail.
- **Attack vectors:** By sending a specially crafted request to the affected file management function through another application. This requires an application on the system to make use of the vulnerable function and not perform any input validation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted request to an application that uses the vulnerable file management function. This could potentially be done remotely if the application is network accessible.
