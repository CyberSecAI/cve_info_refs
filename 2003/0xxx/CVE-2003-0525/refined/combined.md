# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS03-029 - Moderate

## Flaw in Windows Function Could Allow Denial of Service (823803)

Published: July 23, 2003 | Updated: May 12, 2004

**Version:** 2.1

**Originally posted:** July 23, 2003

**Updated:** May 12, 2004

**Version:** 2.1

### General Information

## Technical details

**Technical description:**

Subsequent to the original release of this bulletin Microsoft extended the support of Windows NT Workstation 4.0. A security update is now available from [Microsoft Product Support Services](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;en-us;cntactms) for customers running this operating system. Contact Microsoft Product Support Services to obtain this additional security update.

Subsequent to issuing this security bulletin, Microsoft identified a problem with the security patch which specifically affects systems which have the Remote Access Service (RAS) enabled on them. This causes RAS to fail when the system is rebooted after applying the patch. It does not affect other non-RAS functions, nor is there a problem with the actual fix for the security vulnerability itself. Microsoft has developed a fix for this issue and is re-releasing this bulletin to reflect the new updated patch.

A flaw exists in a Windows NT 4.0 file management function that can cause a denial of service vulnerability. The flaw results because the affected function can cause memory that it does not own to be freed when a specially crafted request is passed to it. If the application making the request to the function does not carry out any user input validation and allows the specially crafted request to be passed to the function, the function may free memory that it does not own. As a result, the application passing the request could fail.

By default, the affected function is not accessible remotely, however applications installed on the operating system that are available remotely may make use of the affected function. Application servers or Web servers are two such applications that may access the function. Note that Internet Information Server 4.0 (IIS 4.0) does not, by default, make use of the affected function.

**Mitigating factors:**

* The default installation of Windows NT 4.0 is not vulnerable to a remote denial of service. Additional software that makes use of the affected file management function must be installed on the system to expose the vulnerability remotely.
* If the application calling the affected file management function carries out input validation, the specially crafted request may not be passed to the vulnerable function.
* The vulnerability cannot be used to cause Windows NT 4.0 itself to fail. Only the application that makes the request may fail.

**Severity Rating:**

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Windows NT 4.0 Workstation** | Moderate |
| **Windows NT 4.0 Server** | Moderate |
| **Windows NT 4.0 Terminal Server Edition** | Moderate |

The above [assessment](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21140) is based on the types of systems affected by the vulnerability, their typical deployment patterns, and the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would have on them.

**Vulnerability identifier:** [CAN-2003-0525](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=can-2003-0525)

**Tested Versions:**

Microsoft tested Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Workstation, Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Server, Windows 2000, Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 to assess whether they are affected by these vulnerabilities. Previous versions are no longer [supported](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742), and may or may not be affected by these vulnerabilities.

## Frequently asked questions

**Why has Microsoft issued new security updates for Windows NT Workstation 4.0?**

Subsequent to the original release of this bulletin Microsoft extended the support of Windows NT Workstation 4.0. A security update is now available from Microsoft Product Support Services for customers running this operating system. Contact [Microsoft Product Support Services](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;en-us;cntactms) to obtain these additional security updates.

**Why has Microsoft reissued this bulletin?**

Subsequent to issuing this security bulletin, Microsoft identified a problem with the security patch which specifically affects systems which have the Remote Access Service (RAS) enabled on them. This causes RAS to fail when the system is rebooted after applying the patch. It does not affect other non-RAS functions, nor is there a problem with the actual fix for the security vulnerability itself. Microsoft has developed a fix for this issue and is re-releasing this bulletin to reflect the new updated patch that corrects the RAS problem.

**What's the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a [denial of service](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/glossary) vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could cause an application running on a Windows NT 4.0 system to fail. By default the vulnerable function cannot be accessed remotely, however, additional software that may have been in installed on the server may make the function accessible remotely.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability results because of a flaw in the way certain memory operations relating to a Windows function are carried out by Windows NT 4.0.

**Which Windows function is vulnerable?**

The file management function is vulnerable. Therefore the vulnerability is only exposed by applications that make use of this function.

**What's wrong with the way the Windows NT 4.0 file management function carries out memory operations?**

There is a flaw in the way a Windows function handles memory operations. If a specially crafted request is made to the affected function, the server may incorrectly free some memory that is not actually owned by the function. This could cause the application making the overly long request to fail.

**What could this vulnerability enable an attacker to do?**

This vulnerability could enable an attacker to cause an application running on Windows NT 4.0 to fail. The application that could fail would be the application that was making use of the affected function and that was allowing the specially crafted request to be passed to the API.

**What types of applications might make a request to the vulnerable function?**

Typically applications that require information about the file system might make requests to the function. Such applications might include Web servers or application servers. Note that Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 (IIS 4.0) does not make use of the function and cannot therefore be used to exploit the vulnerability.

**How could an attacker exploit this vulnerability?**

An attacker could seek to exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted request to the affected function by using another application. If the application making the request does not carry out any user input validation, the affected function may then free memory that it does not own, causing the calling application to fail.

**What does the patch do?**

The patch eliminates the vulnerability by ensuring that the affected component does not free memory that it does not own.
