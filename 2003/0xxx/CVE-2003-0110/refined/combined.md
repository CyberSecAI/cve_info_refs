## Flaw In Winsock Proxy Service And ISA Firewall Service Can Cause Denial Of Service (331066)

Published: April 09, 2003

**Version:** 1.0

**Originally posted:** April 9, 2003

#### Summary

**Who should read this bulletin:**
System administrators running MicrosoftÂ® Proxy Server 2.0 or Microsoft Internet Security and Acceleration (ISA) Server 2000.

**Impact of vulnerability:**
Denial of Service.

**Maximum Severity Rating:**
Important

**Recommendation:**
System administrators should install the patch at the earliest available opportunity.

**Affected Software:**

* Microsoft Proxy Server 2.0
* Microsoft ISA Server

### General Information

## Technical details

**Technical description:**

There is a flaw in the Winsock Proxy service in Microsoft Proxy Server 2.0, and the Microsoft Firewall service in ISA Server 2000, that would allow an attacker on the internal network to send a specially crafted packet that would cause the server to stop responding to internal and external requests. Receipt of such a packet would cause CPU utilization on the server to reach 100%, and thus make the server unresponsive. The Winsock Proxy service and Microsoft Firewall service work with FTP, telnet, mail, news, Internet Relay Chat (IRC), or other client applications that are compatible with Windows Sockets (Winsock). These services allow these applications to perform as if they were directly connected to the Internet. These services redirect the necessary communications functions to a Proxy Server 2.0 or ISA Server computer, thus establishing a communication path from the internal application to the Internet through it.

**Mitigating factors:**

* The vulnerability would not enable an attacker to gain any privileges on an affected Proxy Server 2.0 or ISA Server computer or compromise any cached content. It is strictly a denial of service.
* ISA Server computers running in cache mode are not affected because the Microsoft Firewall service is disabled by default.

**Severity Rating:**

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Proxy Server 2.0** | Important |
| **ISA Server** | Important |

The above [assessment](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21140) is based on the types of systems affected by the vulnerability, their typical deployment patterns, and the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would have on them.

**Vulnerability identifier:** [CAN-2003-0110](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=can-2003-0110)

**Tested Versions:**

Microsoft tested Proxy Server 2.0 and ISA Server to assess whether these versions are affected by this vulnerability. Previous versions are no longer [supported](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742), and may or may not be affected by these vulnerabilities.

## Frequently asked questions

**What's the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a [denial of service](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/glossary) vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause a Proxy Server 2.0 or ISA Server computer to stop responding to requests. Restarting the Winsock Proxy service in Proxy Server 2.0 or the Microsoft Firewall service in ISA Server will allow the computer to function correctly again, however it would remain vulnerable to another denial of service attack.

**How could an attacker exploit this vulnerability?**

An attacker could create a specially formed request and send it to the computer running Proxy Server 2.0 or ISA Server.

**Could an attack that attempted to exploit this vulnerability be launched from the Internet?**

An attack from the Internet would only be possible in a very specific configuration. A potential problem would only exist when a packet filter was configured to allow incoming traffic to the external interface of the Proxy Server 2.0 or ISA Server computer on port 1745. This is not a default setting and the server would need to be specifically configured in this manner, so the likelihood of an Internet attack is low.

**What could this allow an attacker to do?**

The vulnerability if exploited could allow an attacker to cause the ISA Server to stop responding to all requests.

**Could an attacker use the vulnerability to take control of a Proxy Server 2.0 or ISA Server computer?**

No. This is a denial of service attack only. There is no capability to usurp any administrative privileges on the ISA Server.

**Could an attacker use the vulnerability to breach the security of the firewall?**

No. There is no capability to use this vulnerability to lower the security the firewall provides.

**What is Proxy Server 2.0?**

Proxy Server 2.0 acts as a gateway to the Internet for client computers. A proxy server in general acts as an intermediary between a private network and the Internet. Proxy Server 2.0 also caches Internet content for internal users to increase performance, and reduce outgoing network bandwidth.

**What is ISA Server?**

ISA Server provides both an enterprise firewall and a high-performance web cache. The firewall protects the network by regulating which resources can be accessed through the firewall, and under what conditions. The web cache helps improve network performance by storing local copies of frequently-requested web content. ISA Server can be installed in three modes: firewall mode, cache mode, or integrated mode.
Firewall mode allows an administrator to secure network communication by configuring rules that control communication between the corporate network and the Internet. Cache mode improves network performance by storing frequently accessed web pages on the server itself. In integrated mode, all cache and firewall features are available.

**What is Winsock?**

Winsock is short for [Windows Socket](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/wcewinsk/htm/ceconwinsock22.asp), and is an Application Programming Interface (API) that allows Windows Programs to communicate with other computers using the TCP/IP network protocol.

**What are the Winsock Proxy service and the Microsoft Firewall service?**

Proxy Server 2.0's Winsock Proxy service and ISA Server's Microsoft Firewall service both allow Internet applications to perform as if they were directly connected to the Internet. These services redirect the necessary communications functions to a Proxy Server 2.0 or ISA Server computer, thus establishing a communication path from the internal application to the Internet through the server computer.
The services eliminate the need for a specific gateway for each protocol, such as Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP), Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), Telnet, or File Transfer Protocol (FTP).

**Is the Winsock Proxy Service or Microsoft Firewall service enabled by default?**

The Winsock Proxy service is enabled by default in Proxy Server 2.0. The Microsoft Firewall server is enabled by default in ISA Server firewall mode and ISA Server integrated mode installations. It is disabled in ISA Server cache mode installations.

**How do I know if either service is running on my server?**

To detect if the affected service is running on your server, please follow the steps for the software version you have installed:

* Proxy Server 2.0:
  + Click Start, Programs, Microsoft Proxy Server, Microsoft Management Console.
  + Inside the MMC window, expand Console Root, Internet Information Server, .
  + If Winsock Proxy appears, the Winsock Proxy service is running. If Winsock Proxy (Stopped) appears, then the Winsock Proxy service is stopped.
* ISA Server:
  + Click Start, Settings, Control Panel.
  + Double-click Administrative Tools.
  + Double-click Services. If Microsoft Firewall is listed and its status is Started, the Microsoft Firewall service is running.

**What is wrong with Proxy Server 2.0's Winsock Proxy service and ISA Server's Microsoft Firewall service?**

The services incorrectly handle a response from remote clients. Sending a specifically formed request can cause the server to stop responding to future requests.

**How great a threat does this vulnerability pose?**

In Proxy Server 2.0 the Winsock Proxy service is enabled by default. In ISA Server firewall mode and ISA Server integrated mode installations, the Microsoft Firewall service is enabled by default. This means that any internal user could potentially exploit this vulnerability to cause the Proxy Server 2.0 or ISA Server computer to stop responding to requests. The Microsoft Firewall service is disabled by default on ISA Server computers running in cache mode.

**What does the Patch do?**

The fix eliminates the potential for a denial of service attack by ensuring that the Winsock Proxy service or the Microsoft Firewall Service correctly responds to requests.

iDEFENSE Security Advisory 04.09.03:
<http://www.idefense.com/advisory/04.09.03.txt>
Denial of Service in Microsoft Proxy Server 2.0 and Internet Security and
Acceleration Server 2000
April 9, 2003

I. BACKGROUND

Microsoft Corp.'s Internet Security and Acceleration Server (ISA) Server
integrates an extensible, multi-layer enterprise firewall and a scalable
high-performance web cache. It builds on Microsoft Windows 2000 security
and directory for policy-based security, acceleration and management of
internetworking. More information is available at
<http://www.microsoft.com/isaserver/> .  MS Proxy 2.0 is the predecessor to
ISA Server, more information is available at
<http://www.microsoft.com/isaserver/evaluation/previousversions/default.asp>
.

II. DESCRIPTION

A vulnerability exists in ISA Server and MS Proxy 2.0 that allows
attackers to cause a denial-of-service condition by spoofing a specially
crafted packet to the target system.  Another impact of this vulnerability
is the capability of a remote attacker to generate an infinite packet
storm between two unpatched systems implementing ISA Server or MS Proxy
2.0 over the Internet.

Both ISA Server and MS Proxy 2.0, by default, install a WinSock Proxy
(WSP) service wspsrv.exe, designed for testing and diagnostic purposes.
The WSP service creates a User Datagram Protocol socket bound to port
1745. A specially crafted packet can cause WSP to generate a continuous
flood of requests and reply requirements.

III. ANALYSIS

In the case of the attack scenario for an internal LAN attacker causing a
denial of service, this malformed packet must meet the following criteria:

*  The source and destination IP are the same as the ISA Server.
*  The source and destination port is 1745.
*  The data field is specially crafted and resembles the request format.

An attacker with access to the LAN can anonymously generate a specially
crafted UDP packet that will cause the target ISA Server to fall into a
continuous loop of processing request and reply packets. This will cause
the ISA Server to consume 100 percent of the underlying system's CPU
usage. It will continue to do so until the system reboots or the WinSock
Proxy (WSP) service restarts.

In the case of the attack scenario of a remote attacker causing a packet
storm between two systems running ISA Server or MS Proxy 2.0, the
malformed packet must meet the following criteria:

*  The source IP is one of the targets
*  The destination IP is the other target
*  The source and destination port is 1745.
*  The data field is specially crafted and resembles the request format.

IV. DETECTION

iDEFENSE has verified that Microsoft ISA Server 2000 and MS Proxy 2.0 are
both vulnerable to the same malformed packet characteristics described
above.

Wspsrv.exe is enabled by default in Proxy Server 2.0. The Microsoft
Firewall server is enabled by default in ISA Server firewall mode and ISA
Server integrated mode installations. It is disabled in ISA Server cache
mode installations.

V. WORKAROUND

To prevent the second attack scenario, apply ingress filtering on the
Internet router on UDP port 1745 to prevent a malformed packet from
reaching the ISA Server and causing a packet storm.

VI. RECOVERY

Restart either the WinSock Proxy Service or the affected system to resume
normal operation.

VII. VENDOR FIX/RESPONSE

Microsoft has provided fixes for Proxy Server 2.0 and ISA Server at
<http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS03-012.asp> .

VIII. CVE INFORMATION

The Mitre Corp.'s Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) Project has
assigned the identification number CAN-2003-0110 to this issue.
