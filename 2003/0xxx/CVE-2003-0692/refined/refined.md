{
  "CVE-2003-0692": {
    "Root cause": "The session cookie generation algorithm used by KDM (KDE Display Manager) was considered too weak to supply full 128 bits of entropy.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insecure session cookie generation"
    ],
    "Impact": "Non-authorized users could potentially brute-force the session cookie, and, if hostname/IP restrictions can be bypassed, gain full access to the running session.",
    "Attack vectors": "Brute-force attack on session cookies.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be able to access the network where KDM is used and attempt to brute-force session cookies."
  }
