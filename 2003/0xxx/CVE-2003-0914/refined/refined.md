      "Cache poisoning vulnerability via negative responses."

    "impact": "Attackers may conduct denial-of-service attacks on specific target domains by enticing users to query a malicious name server. This can render the target domain unreachable until the cached TTL expires.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "An attacker configures a name server to return authoritative negative responses for a target domain.",

    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control a DNS server and be able to entice a victim server to query it.  The malicious server must be able to provide a negative response with a high TTL."
