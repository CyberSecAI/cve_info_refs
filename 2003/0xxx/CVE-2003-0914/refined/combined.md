## ISC BIND 8 vulnerable to cache poisoning via negative responses

#### Vulnerability Note VU#734644

Original Release Date: 2003-12-01 | Last Revised: 2004-01-05

---

### Overview

The BIND 8 name server contains a cache poisoning vulnerability that allows attackers to conduct denial-of-service attacks on specific target domains.

### Description

| Several versions of the BIND 8 name server are vulnerable to cache poisoning via negative responses. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must configure a name server to return authoritative negative responses for a given target domain. Then, the attacker must convince a victim user to query the attacker's maliciously configured name server. When the attacker's name server receives the query, it will reply with an authoritative negative response containing a large TTL (time-to-live) value. If the victim's site runs a vulnerable version of BIND 8, it will cache the negative response and render the target domain unreachable until the TTL expires. |
| --- |

### Impact

| Attackers may conduct denial-of-service attacks on specific target domains by enticing users to query a malicious name server. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade BIND**  The ISC has prepared BIND 8.3.7 and BIND 8.4.3 to address this vulnerability. Name servers running BIND 4 are not affected. To obtain the latest versions of BIND, please visit<http://www.isc.org/products/BIND/>**Apply a patch or updated version from your vendor**Many operating system vendors include BIND with their products and will be preparing new versions to address this vulnerability. For a list of vendors that the CERT/CC has received information from regarding this vulnerability, please see the Systems Affected section of this document. |

### [Apple Computer Inc.](#JPLA-5SJTAE) Affected

Notified:  October 21, 2003  Updated: December 11, 2003

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

Mac OS X 10.3 and later: Not Vulnerable. Mac OS X 10.3 uses a later version of BIND that does not have this vulnerability.

Mac OS X 10.2.x: Recommend upgrading to Mac OS X 10.2.8, then installing BIND 8.4.3 as follows:

First install the Developer Tools if they are not already present, then perform the following steps from the command-line in an application such as Terminal:

1. Download BIND version 8.4.3 by executing the following command:
curl -O ftp://ftp.isc.org/isc/bind/src/8.4.3/bind-src.tar.gz

2. Verify the integrity of this file by typing:
cksum bind-src.tar.gz
which should indicate "3224691664 1438439 bind-src.tar.gz"

3. Unpack the distribution as follows:
tar xvzf bind-src.tar.gz

4. Now you're ready to start building the distribution.
cd to the src/ directory and type "make"

5. The next step will install the new named daemon:
sudo cp bin/named/named /usr/sbin/

6. Reboot

For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit
<URL:<http://www.freebsd.org/security/>>.

I.   Background

BIND 8 is an implementation of the Domain Name System (DNS) protocols.
The named(8) daemon is the Internet domain name server.

II.  Problem Description

A programming error in BIND 8 named can result in a DNS message being
incorrectly cached as a negative response.

III. Impact

An attacker may arrange for malicious DNS messages to be delivered
to a target name server, and cause that name server to cache a
negative response for some target domain name.  The name server would
thereafter respond negatively to legitimate queries for that domain
name, resulting in a denial-of-service for applications that require
DNS.  Almost all Internet applications require DNS, such as the Web,
email, and chat networks.

IV.  Workaround

No workaround is known.

V.   Solution

Do one of the following:

1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to 4.9-STABLE; or to the RELENG\_5\_1,

Immunix Secured OS Security Advisory

Packages updated:bind
Affected products:Immunix OS 7+
Bugs fixed:VU#734644 CAN-2003-0914
Date:Mon Oct 27 2003
Advisory ID:IMNX-2003-7+-024-01
Author:Seth Arnold <sarnold@immunix.com>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Description:
A vulnerability has been found in BIND that ".. allows an attacker to
conduct cache poisoning attacks on vulnerable name servers by
convincing the servers to retain invalid negative responses."

Our bind-8.2.3-3.3\_imnx\_5 packages fix this problem using a patch
derived from the BIND 8.3.7 release. This vulnerability has been named
CAN-2003-0914 by the CVE project.

We'd like to apologize to our US subscribers for the incredibly poor
timing, to release this notice a day before the Thanksgiving holiday.
Our options were limited by ISC, the package maintainer.

1)  problem description, brief discussion, solution, upgrade information

To resolve IP addresses to host and domain names and vice versa the
DNS service needs to be consulted. The most popular DNS software is
the BIND8 and BIND9 suite. The BIND8 code is vulnerable to a remote
denial-of-service attack by poisoning the cache with authoritative
negative responses that should not be accepted otherwise.
To execute this attack a name-server needs to be under malicious
control and the victim's bind8 has to query this name-server.
The attacker can set a high TTL value to keep his negative record as
long as possible in the cache of the victim. For this time the clients
of the attacked site that rely on the bind8 service will not be able
to reach the domain specified in the negative record.
These records should disappear after the time-interval (TTL) elapsed.

There is no temporary workaround for this bug.

To make this update effective run "rcnamed restart" as root please.

Please download the update package for your distribution and verify its
integrity by the methods listed in section 3) of this announcement.
Then, install the package using the command "rpm -Fhv file.rpm" to apply
the update.
Our maintenance customers are being notified individually. The packages
are being offered to install from the maintenance web.

2)  Pending vulnerabilities in SUSE Distributions and Workarounds:

- ethereal
A new official version of ethereal, a network traffic analyzer, was
released to fix various security-related problems.
An update package is currently being tested and will be released
as soon as possible.

- KDE
New KDE packages are currently being tested. These packages fixes
several vulnerabilities:
+ remote root compromise (CAN-2003-0690)
+ weak cookies (CAN-2003-0692)
+ SSL man-in-the-middle attack
+ information leak through HTML-referrer (CAN-2003-0459)
+ wrong file permissions of config files
The packages will be release as soon as testing is finished.

- mc
By using a special combination of links in archive-files it is possible
to execute arbitrary commands while mc tries to open it in its VFS.
The packages are currently tested and will be release as soon as
possible.

- apache1/2
The widely used HTTP server apache has several security vulnerabilities:
- locally exploitable buffer overflow in the regular expression code.
The attacker must be able to modify .htaccess or httpd.conf.
(affects: mod\_alias and mod\_rewrite)
- under some circumstances mod\_cgid will output its data to the
wrong client (affects: apache2)
The new packages are available on our FTP servers.

- gpg
In GnuPG version 1.0.2 a new code for ElGamal was introduced.
This code leads to an attack on users who use ElGamal keys for
signing. It is possible to reconstruct the private ElGamal key
by analyzing a public ElGamal signature.
Please note that the ElGamal algorithm is seldomly used and GnuPG
displays several warnings when generating ElGamal signature keys.
The default key generation process in GnuPG will create a DSA signature
key and an ElGamal subkey for \_encryption only\_. These keys are not
affected by this vulnerability.
Anyone using ElGamal signature keys (type 20, check fourth field of
"gpg --list-keys --with-colon" output) should revoke them.

- freeradius
Two vulnerabilities were found in the FreeRADIUS package.
The remote denial-of-service attack bug was fixed and new packages
will be released as soon as testing was successfully finished.
The other bug is a remote buffer overflow in the module rlm\_smb.
We do not ship this module and will fix it for future releases.

- xscreensaver
The well known screen-saver for X is vulnerable to several local
tmp file attacks as well as a crash when verifying a password.
Only SuSE Linux 9.0 products are affected.
The new packages are available on our FTP servers.

- screen
A buffer overflow in screen was reported. Since SuSE Linux 8.0
we do not ship screen with the s-bit anymore. An update package
will be released for 7.3 as soon as possible.

- mod\_gzip
The apache module mod\_gzip is vulnerable to remote code execution
while running in debug-mode. We do not ship this module in debug-mode
but future versions will include the fix.

- gnpan
A remote denial-of-service attack can be run against the GNOME
news-reader program gnpan. This bug affects SuSE Linux 8.0, 8.1, 8.2.
Update packages are available on our FTP servers.

3)  standard appendix: authenticity verification, additional information

- Package authenticity verification:

SUSE update packages are available on many mirror ftp servers all over
the world. While this service is being considered valuable and important
to the free and open source software community, many users wish to be
sure about the origin of the package and its content before installing
the package. There are two verification methods that can be used
independently from each other to prove the authenticity of a downloaded
file or rpm package:
1) md5sums as provided in the (cryptographically signed) announcement.
2) using the internal gpg signatures of the rpm package.

1) execute the command
md5sum <name-of-the-file.rpm>
after you downloaded the file from a SUSE ftp server or its mirrors.
Then, compare the resulting md5sum with the one that is listed in the
announcement. Since the announcement containing the checksums is
cryptographically signed (usually using the key security@suse.de),
the checksums show proof of the authenticity of the package.
We disrecommend to subscribe to security lists which cause the
email message containing the announcement to be modified so that
the signature does not match after transport through the mailing
list software.
Downsides: You must be able to verify the authenticity of the
announcement in the first place. If RPM packages are being rebuilt
and a new version of a package is published on the ftp server, all
md5 sums for the files are useless.

2) rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the authenticity
of an rpm package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, where <file.rpm> is the
filename of the rpm package that you have downloaded. Of course,
package authenticity verification can only target an un-installed rpm
package file.
Prerequisites:
a) gpg is installed
b) The package is signed using a certain key. The public part of this
key must be installed by the gpg program in the directory
~/.gnupg/ under the user's home directory who performs the
signature verification (usually root). You can import the key
that is used by SUSE in rpm packages for SUSE Linux by saving
this announcement to a file ("announcement.txt") and
running the command (do "su -" to be root):
gpg --batch; gpg < announcement.txt | gpg --import
SUSE Linux distributions version 7.1 and thereafter install the
key "build@suse.de" upon installation or upgrade, provided that
the package gpg is installed. The file containing the public key
is placed at the top-level directory of the first CD (pubring.gpg)
and at ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/suse/pubring.gpg-build.suse.de .

- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may

Trustix Secure Linux Security Advisory #2003-0044

Package name:      bind
Summary:           negative cache sec. fix
Date:              2003-11-27
Affected versions: TSL 1.2, 1.5

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
Package description:
BIND (Berkeley Internet Name Domain) is an implementation of the DNS (Domain
Name System) protocols. BIND includes a DNS server (named), which resolves
host names to IP addresses, and a resolver library (routines for applications
to use when interfacing with DNS). A DNS server allows clients to name
resources or objects and share the information with other network machines.
The named DNS server can be used on workstations as a caching name server,
but is generally only needed on one machine for an entire network. Note that
the configuration files for making BIND act as a simple caching nameserver
are included in the caching-nameserver package.Install the bind package if
you need a DNS server for your network. If you want bind to act a caching
name server, you will also need to install the caching-nameserver package.

Problem description:
According the the bind announcment dated Thu, 27 Nov 2003, the new upstream
bind 8.3.7 fixes a security problem:

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
