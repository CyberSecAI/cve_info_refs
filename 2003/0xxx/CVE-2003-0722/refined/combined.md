How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Sun Solstice AdminSuite ships with insecure default configuration

#### Vulnerability Note VU#41870

Original Release Date: 2003-09-19 | Last Revised: 2003-09-19

---

### Overview

The sadmind service provided on many Solaris and SunOS systems ships with an insecure default configuration that allows remote users to execute arbitrary commands with superuser (root) privileges.

### Description

| The Sun Microsystems Solstice AdminSuite is a graphical tool that allows Solaris and SunOS hosts to be administered by a remote host. The daemon portion of the program (sadmind) is a setuid root application that listens for requests from a remote administration client. In its default configuration, sadmind accepts requests using "AUTH\_SYS" authentication, which uses plaintext authentication in a format that can be easily manipulated by an attacker. Since sadmind is designed to allow the remote execution of arbitrary commands, an attacker who is able to spoof the authentication portion of a packet can execute commands with little difficulty.  The daemon can be configured to operate securely by specifying a security level of 2, which causes sadmind to require "AUTH\_DES" authentication. This capability has existed since at least April 1999, when the [sadmind man page](http://docs.sun.com/db/doc/816-0211/6m6nc676b?a=view) was updated for SunOS 5.9. The recommendation to use security level 2 was provided in [Sun Security Bulletin #00191](http://sunsolve.sun.com/pub-cgi/retrieve.pl?type=0&doc=secbull%2F191&display=plain) and [CERT Advisory CA-1999-16](http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-1999-16.html), so it is likely that many Solaris systems have been configured to disable this service. However, the insecure default configuration is still shipped with modern releases of Solaris, so system administrators are encouraged to review their configurations. |
| --- |

### Impact

| Affected systems allow remote users to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the sadmind daemon, typically superuser (root). |
| --- |

### Solution

| The CERT/CC is not aware of a permanent solution that addresses this vulnerability. |
| --- |

| **Configure sadmind to use AUTH\_DES authentication**As recommended by [Sun Alert 56740](http://sunsolve.sun.com/pub-cgi/retrieve.pl?type=0&doc=fsalert%2F56740&display=plain), users can take the following steps to enable AUTH\_DES authentication:1. Edit the "/etc/inetd.conf" file and append "-S 2" to the end of the sadmind line as follows:100232/10 tli rpc/udp wait root /usr/sbin/sadmind sadmind -S 2 2. Tell the inetd(1M) process to reread the newly modified "/etc/inetd.conf" file by sending it a hangup signal, SIGHUP:# /usr/bin/pkill -HUP inetd **Disable the sadmind daemon**As recommended by [Sun Alert 56740](http://sunsolve.sun.com/pub-cgi/retrieve.pl?type=0&doc=fsalert%2F56740&display=plain), users can take the following steps to disable sadmind:1. Edit the "/etc/inetd.conf" file and comment out the following line by adding the "#" symbol to the beginning of the line as follows:#100232/10 tli rpc/udp wait root /usr/sbin/sadmind sadmind 2. Tell the inetd(1M) process to reread the newly modified "/etc/inetd.conf" file by sending it a hangup signal, SIGHUP:# /usr/bin/pkill -HUP inetd |
