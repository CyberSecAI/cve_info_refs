- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the FTGate Pro Mail Server v. 1.22 (1328) due to insufficient bounds checking when processing the "MAIL FROM" and "RCPT TO" commands in the SMTP protocol.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Buffer overflow in the SMTP protocol. Specifically in the handling of the "MAIL FROM" and "RCPT TO" commands.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Denial of Service (DoS): The service stops responding for a short period, and all current connections are closed.
    - Potential for arbitrary code execution: By overwriting the exception handler on the stack, an attacker could potentially achieve system compromise with code execution running as SYSTEM.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a large amount of data (approximately 2000 bytes followed by "@" and another 2000 bytes ending with ".com") in the "MAIL FROM" or "RCPT TO" commands via an SMTP connection.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to establish a TCP connection to the vulnerable server's SMTP port (port 25).
    - The attacker does not appear to need prior authentication.
