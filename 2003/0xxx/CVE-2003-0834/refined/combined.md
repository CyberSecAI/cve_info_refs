## CDE libDtHelp vulnerable to buffer overflow via DTHELPUSERSEARCHPATH or DTHELPSEARCHPATH

#### Vulnerability Note VU#575804

Original Release Date: 2003-11-04 | Last Revised: 2004-08-26

---

### Overview

There is a vulnerability in the Common Desktop Environment (CDE) for UNIX systems which can allow a local user to gain root privileges.

### Description

| The Common Desktop Environment (CDE) is a standard desktop environment for UNIX based systems. CDE libDtHelp contains a buffer overflow that can be exploited by a local user. By modifying the DTHELPUSERSEARCHPATH or DTHELPSEARCHPATH environment variables and invoking Help an attacker can gain elevated privileges. For example, since dtprintinfo is commonly setuid root, it may be exploited by a local user to gain root privileges. Other programs that run with elevated privileges and link libDtHelp are also potential attack vectors. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An authenticated local user may be able to execute arbitrary code with root privileges. The attacker may also be able to crash vulnerable programs causing a denial of service. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply Patch or Upgrade**  Apply a patch or upgrade as advised by your vendor. See the Systems Affected section for more information. |
