The provided document discusses two vulnerabilities, one in Microsoft Word (CVE-2003-0820) and one in Microsoft Excel (CVE-2003-0821), both addressed by Microsoft Security Bulletin MS03-050. The document provides detailed information about the Word vulnerability, which is relevant to CVE-2003-0820.

**Root cause of the vulnerability (Word):**
- The vulnerability exists due to the way Word validates the length of a data value (specifically, macro names) embedded in a document.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present (Word):**
- Buffer overflow: By crafting a document with an overly long macro name, an attacker can overflow a data value in Word.

**Impact of exploitation (Word):**
- Arbitrary code execution: Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the same privileges as the user.
- Ability to add, change or delete data or files.
- Ability to communicate with a web site.
- Ability to format the hard drive.

**Attack vectors (Word):**
- The attacker needs to create a specially crafted Word document containing a malicious macro with an overly long name.
- The attacker then needs to persuade a user to open the malicious document (e.g., via email, network share, or a website).

**Required attacker capabilities/position (Word):**
- The attacker needs the ability to create malicious Word documents.
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver the malicious document to the victim and convince the victim to open it.
