{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "MySQL server reads configuration options from world-writable files, allowing a user with FILE privileges to create a malicious configuration file that will be read at startup. This can cause the server to run under an arbitrary user id including root.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure file permissions",
      "Improper input validation of configuration files"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote user can gain elevated privileges, including root, and potentially take control of the MySQL database.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote user with 'FILE' privileges on the MySQL server"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to have a valid MySQL account with 'FILE' privileges and the ability to connect to the server.",
     "additional_info": "The vulnerability is present in MySQL versions prior to 3.23.56. The fix involves preventing MySQL from reading world-writable configuration files and prioritizing the --user option in the /etc/my.cnf file over other configuration files. It's also noted that SELECT ... OUTFILE always creates world-writable files, which could be a contributing factor."
