    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root Cause": "Integer overflow in the `xdrmem_getbytes()` function within the XDR (External Data Representation) library, which is derived from SunRPC. This library is used for platform-independent data representation during inter-process communication, including RPC calls. The function incorrectly handles the length of data to be read, leading to an integer overflow and subsequent memory allocation issues.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Integer overflow",
        "Improper memory allocation",
        "Potential buffer overflow"
      ],
      "Impact": "This vulnerability can lead to a denial of service (DoS) due to crashes or memory corruption. It could also enable arbitrary code execution or disclosure of sensitive information, including remote root access in some cases, due to the nature of RPC services often running as root on affected systems.",
      "Attack Vectors": [
        "Network connections using RPC services",
        "Exploitation via crafted length values"
      ],
      "Required Capabilities": [
        "Ability to interact with vulnerable services using RPC"
      ],
	  "Affected_Systems":[
        "Multiple vendors and their implementations using SunRPC-derived XDR libraries",
        "Compaq Computer Corporation",
        "Conectiva",
		"Debian",
        "FreeBSD",
		"GNU glibc",
		"Gentoo Linux",

         "Trustix",
         "TurboLinux",
         "Wirex",
		  "Xerox Corporation"
	 ],
	"Mitigations":[
		"Disable access to vulnerable services or applications until patches can be applied",
        "Apply patches provided by the vendor for relevant or derived implementations"
		]
    },
	"Additional Information": {
		"Description": "The vulnerable function `xdrmem_getbytes()` decrements a signed integer using an unsigned integer for the length. This can lead to an integer overflow where a large value can wrap around to a positive value, allowing the size check to pass and potentially cause a heap buffer overflow.",
		"Specific_Vulnerable_Function": "`xdrmem_getbytes()` and related functions from the Sun XDR library"
	}
  }
