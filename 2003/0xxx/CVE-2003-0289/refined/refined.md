Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2003-0289:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A format string vulnerability exists in `libscg/scsiopen.c` specifically in the `js_snprintf` function at line 273. The `scgp->errstr`, which is a user-controlled string, is passed directly to `js_snprintf` as the format string without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Format string vulnerability**:  The `js_snprintf` function is used incorrectly, allowing an attacker to inject format specifiers (e.g., `%x`, `%n`) into the `errs` buffer via `scgp->errstr`. This allows for arbitrary memory reads and writes.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Local root privilege escalation**: If `cdrecord` is setuid root, a local user can exploit this vulnerability to overwrite the return address on the stack or other memory locations. This can allow for the execution of arbitrary code with root privileges, granting the attacker full control of the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by providing a malicious string as the `dev` parameter to the `cdrecord` command. This string is then used within `scsiopen.c` and passed to `js_snprintf`, triggering the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to execute the `cdrecord` binary. If the binary has the setuid bit set, the attacker will be able to execute code with the permissions of the owner of the file, which is usually root.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided exploit code demonstrates how the attacker can overwrite the `.dtors` section or the GOT (Global Offset Table) to gain control of the program execution. The exploit includes shellcode to escalate the privileges.
- The vulnerability exists in `cdrtools` version 2.0, while version 1.11.x is also affected in some distributions.
- The fix is either to sanitize the format string by using `%s` or to upgrade to version `2.01a14`.
- Several distributions, like Mandrake, had `cdrecord` setuid root by default, making systems vulnerable to privilege escalation.
- Some Linux distributions, like Gentoo, do not install `cdrecord` setuid root by default.
