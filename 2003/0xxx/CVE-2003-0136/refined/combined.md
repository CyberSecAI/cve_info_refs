Subject: psbanner: insecure file creation (/tmp/before)
Date: Wed, 09 Apr 2003 18:48:14 +0200
```
Package: lprng
Version: 3.8.10-1
Severity: grave
Tags: patch security
Justification: user security hole

A LPRng component -- `psbanner' (program for creating postscript banner
pages), insecurely creates file `/tmp/before'.  A file is created
every time filter is run, it is owned by user `daemon' and group `lp'.

An attacker might create symbolic link from `/tmp/before' to file
which is owned by user `daemon', eg. `/var/spool/lpd/lp/acct',
allowing him to overwrite its contents (with enviroment
variables). When any user will try to print something, the file which
`/tmp/before' points to will be overwriten.

NOTE: This will work only if printer is configured to print banner
pages by `psbanner' program.

Example of `/etc/printcap', which can be used for attack:

lp:
	:lp=/dev/lp0
	:mx=0
	:bp=/usr/lib/lprng/filters/psbanner
	:sd=/var/spool/lpd/lp

This error was reported before, and should be fixed since LPRng-3.8.7
(seen in changelog.gz).

A simple patch is included:

This seems to affect lprng in woody (but not potato).  I will prepare a
security update.

I've uploaded lprng 3.8.20-4 that fixes this problem in sid/sarge

I've also uploaded lprng 3.8.10-2 that fixes this problem in woody,
this was of course after I read the bit on the security site that
I shouldn't do that, sigh.

Anyhow it's fixed, the fix is simple and the diff and dsc are there for
the security team to fix.  i have also sent an email to the lprng
list as this is the quickest way to get the upstreams attention.

Here's what I wrote to the list, you might want to use some of it or
Karol's email for the DSA.

--------------

LPRng - Insecure file creation

Karol Lewandowski discovered that psbanner, a printer filter that creates
a PostScript format banner and is part of LPRng, insecurely creates a file
/tmp/before.  The program does no checks of this file but writes its current
environment and called arguments to the file unconditionally.

The filter is run by the lpd process, which runs as the uid daemon.  By
using symlinks and enviornmental manipulation, an attacker can create a
file owned by uid daemon.

This attack can only occur if the printer is configured to print
PostScript banner pages using the psbanner program, usually with the
bp=i/usr/lib/lprng/filters/psbanner printcap clause.

Debian users should upgrade to lprng 3.8.20-4 (sid, sarge) or lprng
3.8.10-2 (woody).

It looks like you accidentally uploaded it to unstable and it was rejected;
in this case this is fortunate as it means that we don't have to clean up
any messes. :-)

The packages that I prepared for stable yesterday are at:

<http://people.debian.org/~mdz/security/lprng/>

Your review is appreciated, though the problem is very trivial and you
probably made the same change.
