You know things are bad when you start to sympathize with hellspawn. At first I acknowledged my in-game avatar, demon lord of the depths Baal-Abaddon, only with the intended smirks and half-laughs warranted by his dialog. But in time I came to feel a kinship with him as we braved Impire's clumsy micromanagement in search of hard-won glory. "Tedious," he'd exclaim, and I'd find myself mouthing the words along with him. "Life: what's the point, anyway?" he'd ask, and I found myself asking the same question about our progress. By the sixth hour, I was sure we were both in a place where we didn't want to be, but no matter how repetitive or boring the circumstances became, I could take comfort in the knowledge that my new scaly friend and I were in this mess together.

So, we didn't like Aliens: Colonial Marines. Nor did most other people. But what if there had been another Aliens game entirely? What if Obsidian had made an RPG in the Aliens universe? Well, thanks to this leaked footage of a very early prototype of Aliens: Crucible, we're lucky enough to see more or less what that would have looked like.

R. Kelly would be proud of Firefall. Rather than just accept that the shooter's players would be stuck to the ground, they believed they could fly. With jetpacks. Those tend to help.

According to 20th Century Fox and Gearbox, Aliens: Colonial Marines is part of the official Alien series canon. That means the disastrously bad shooter, which takes place shortly after the end of 1986's Aliens, has ramifications on 1992's Alien 3 and 1997's Alien Resurrection (which didn't do the lore any favors either). Major ones. Aliens: Colonial Marines' storyline features some lore-breaking elements that directly contradict major events from the films and makes me wonder if Fox and Gearbox (or TimeGate, or whoever actually developed the campaign) even understand what "canon" means. Here are my three biggest problems with this incredibly damaging new version of the Alien lore. **Note: We're about to delve into MAJOR SPOILER territory.** [**Read More »**](http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/sega-alien-shooter/1227452p1.html)

Oh, hello there, new game from Square Enix. Didn't see you lurking in the shadows back there. Love the name of your website, "www.murdered.com," but based on your quick CGI teaser trailer, I have no clue what you are, exactly.

Despite the popularity of '90s classics like Wing Commander, X-Wing vs Tie Fighter, and Freespace, the combat space sim genre has been as dormant as a white dwarf for more than a decade.

Like any red-blooded American, I am genetically required to hate anyone who takes the label of "King" for themselves. We like to call those folks "tyrants" around these parts.

Here's one thing I won't be doing in March of the Eagles, which launches today: invading Russia. I remember my history classes, and that never ends well.

Let's get this clear up front: Crysis 3 is a better first-person shooter than Crysis 2 in almost every way. Gameplay is more robust and varied, the storytelling is more mature, and it's often visually stunning. Unfortunately, it's also not very ambitious: it leans heavily on ideas already established by better games, and as such isn't an especially remarkable experience. Its reach might exceed its grasp in a few key areas, but Crysis 3 is still a largely enjoyable excuse to take a trip to post-apocalyptic New York.

Gamers have learned not to expect much from co-op AI companions. Keep up, don't block doorways, and throw out the occasional one-liner is about the best we can hope for. Irrational Games will attempt to raise the co-op AI bar with its time-and-space-tearing partner, Elizabeth, in BioShock Infinite, and as the latest trailer demonstrates, she will, at the very least, pack a powerful punch.

One of my biggest problems with Far Cry 3 is the complete disappearance of enemies in areas where I've cleared outposts. I really like the sense of constant danger their presence provides.

It's a good time to be a fan of sword fighting in games. We've got Chivalry: Medieval Warfare, War of the Roses, and now Blade Symphony, as spotted by Rock Paper Shotgun. While the former two are first-person "shooters," Blade Symphony seems to take the Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast route to sword fighting goodness. That means flips, dives, and flying slashes. Soon, all that goodness will be on Steam. [**Read More »**](http://pc.gamespy.com/articles/122/1227437p1.html)

When I was but a young child, my father tried to make me understand the value of a dollar. I'll cut out the middle of the story, but the result of the lesson is my ability to wait until games are on sale before I buy them. This week, GOG.com makes that waiting really pay off, because they're dropping the prices on a ton of classic games like Myst: Masterpiece Edition, The Incredible Machine, and Outcast.

Look, Dean "Rocket" Hall. We love DayZ. We appreciate the mod, and think it's pretty great. You really didn't have to go through all this trouble of making the standalone product so darn awesome. The fact that you've been completely remaking the zombie survival shooter from the ground up is completely unnecessary. Oh, you went ahead and did it anyway? Well, you're just the best.

Gosh -- the cars in the upcoming GRID 2 are so exquisitely curved and shiny that I kind of want to stick my weathered old Honda Civic in there for "character."

I like how this faction-by-faction reveal of Total War: Rome 2 gets a little more barbaric each time. We've seen plush feathered headdresses devolve into ankle-tattoos-on-shields and now? People are totally wearing *dogs* on their heads. Say hello to the Suebi, a tribe so barbaric that they seem a-okay with sauntering into battle shirtless.

Huggable-looking 16-bit critters? Yeah, that's not what I'd have expected to find on the front page of a certain famed torrent website either. Yes, it's a videogame promo for Zelda-esque indie adventure Anodyne, but it's also sort of an interesting remark on the state of videogame piracy.

Poor, poor Ace of Spades. The Minecraft-meets-TF2 concept had such promise, but only managed to scrape up a poor-at-best rating in [GameSpy's review](http://au.pc.gamespy.com/pc/ace-of-spades/1226967p1.html).

Advisory:        GameSpy Arcade Arbitrary File Writing

Discovered:      July 26, 2003
Released:        July 31, 2003

Risk:            Critical; Allows writing of a file to any
                 location on the victim's system.

Author:          Mike Kristovich, Security Researcher

Table of contents:

1)    Introduction
2)    The Bug
3)    Details
4)    Fix
5)    Philosophy
6)    Closing comments

_______________________________________________________________

1) Introduction

The problem exists within GSAPAK.EXE, a game update agent which
is included by default with the installation of GameSpy Arcade.

GameSpy automatically adds three mime types to the list of
accepted documents in Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator,
which are:

"application/x-gsarcade-usersvc"
"application/x-gsarcade-skinpak"
"application/x-gsarcade-launch"

By default, when a file with the extension of .APK, .arcade or
.asn is received, it will be launched by GSAPAK.exe.

_______________________________________________________________

2) The Bug

When a user receives a file with the .APK extension, it is
actually a simple ZIP file.  An attacker could simply construct
a ZIP file, and change the path so that it would by extracted
into the root directory of the drive, or even the startup
directory of Windows.

Using this method, it would be quite easy to insert a virus,
trojan horse, or pretty much anything one desires, into the
victim's system.

i.e.:   ../../../calc.exe - Would put it in the root directory

Because the file is considered an accepted type by browsers,
there will be no dialog asking the user to accept or deny
receiving it.

_______________________________________________________________

3) Risk

If a user were to have JavaScript enabled, the attacker could
even add "onLoad=" to an IMG tag on a web page, which would run
the file upon the image being loaded.  This could have serious
consequences on Gaming Forums.

This bug does not require GameSpy Arcade to run, or ever have
run.  It's possible that it has been installed along with a
game, and hasn't been touched.  This does not make the user
safe.  GSAPAK.exe is a separate entity in the GameSpy package,
and is useful for the purpose they've created it.

_______________________________________________________________

4) Fix

GameSpy was notified on July 28, 2003.

GameSpy responded very quickly, and they were on their way to
fixing the bug within 12 hours of the initial contact.

Directory of GameSpy Technology, David Wright, has told TZT
that this vulnerability will be fixed in a patch this week.
We'd like to thank GameSpy for their extremely fast response
and professionalism in handling this matter.

Current GameSpy Arcade users should see the patch, and be
given the option (possibly required) to update.  We suggest
the latter.

If you have concerns about waiting for the patch, it can be
temporarily fixed by removing the above specified accepted
documents from the registry. You could also remove GSAPAK.exe,
or you could even choose to uninstall GameSpy Arcade until the
patch becomes available later this week.

_______________________________________________________________

5) Philosophy

GameSpy has hundreds of thousands of users, most of which are
using GameSpy Arcade and are vulnerable to this bug.

This bug has now been disclosed, and all users should patch
their system as soon as the patch is available.

Keep in mind, your system will still be vulnerable even if
you've installed GameSpy Arcade, but never ran it.

_______________________________________________________________

6) Closing comments

We would like to thank GameSpy and David Wright for their
prompt handling of the bug report, again.
