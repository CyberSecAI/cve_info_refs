{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `secldapclntd` daemon in IBM AIX accepts requests from the LDAP load module and forwards them to the LDAP server without proper validation. This allows a remote attacker to craft malicious messages to communicate with the daemon.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Inadequate input validation",
      "Lack of proper authentication or authorization checks for remote requests"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can gain unauthorized access to data or modify user accounts on the LDAP server.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote network access",
      "Crafted messages to the `secldapclntd` daemon via internet socket"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send crafted messages over the network to the affected system and have knowledge of the communication protocol used by the `secldapclntd` daemon."
