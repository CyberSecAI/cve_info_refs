author:       methodic <methodic@libpcap.net>
release date: 05/21/2003
homepage:     <http://sec.angrypacket.com>
advisory id:  0x0005

+-------------------- -- -
+ product information
+----------------- -- -
software:     Owl Intranet Engine
vendor:       Chris Vincent
homepage:     <http://owl.sourceforge.net>
description:
     "Owl is a multi user document repository (knowledgebase) system written
      in PHP4 for publishing of files/documents onto the web for a corporation,
      small buisness, group of people, or just for yourself."

+---------------------- -- -
+ vulnerability details
+------------------- -- -
problem:      Cross-Site Scripting
affected:     Owl 0.71 and previous versions
explaination: Owl doesn't properly filter metacharacters, allowing injection
              of JavaScript code. Since Owl doesn't assign cookies, and since
              the JavaScript code is placed before the form tag, you need to
              reference the first link in order to steal someone's session id.
risk:         Medium
status:       Vendor was notified 05/18/03, fix is available.
exploit:      Type the following into the 'Search' field:
              <script>alert(document.links[[0]](#0).href);</script>
fix:          Upgrade to a newer version of Owl
