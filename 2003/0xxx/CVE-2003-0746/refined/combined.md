How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Multiple Open Software Foundation Distributed Computing Environment (DCE) implementations vulnerable to DoS

#### Vulnerability Note VU#377804

Original Release Date: 2003-08-08 | Last Revised: 2003-08-18

---

### Overview

A denial-of-service vulnerability exists in multiple vendor implementations of the Distributed Computing Environment. This vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to cause the service to fail. *Note that this vulnerability may be triggered by attackers attempting to exploit* [*VU#568148*](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/568148) *and* [*VU#326746*](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/326746)*.*

### Description

| The Open Group describes the Distributed Computing Environment (DCE) as an "industry-standard, vendor-neutral set of distributed computing technologies." They go on to describe DCE as follows:  DCE provides a complete Distributed Computing Environment infrastructure. It provides security services to protect and control access to data, name services that make it easy to find distributed resources, and a highly scalable model for organizing widely scattered users, services, and data. DCE runs on all major computing platforms and is designed to support distributed applications in heterogeneous hardware and software environments.A vulnerability has been discovered in DCE which may allow a remote attacker to cause the DCE service to either hang or terminate, which will effectively make it impossible for DCE clients to communicate with the DCE server. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker may be able to cause the DCE service to either hang or terminate, which will effectively make it impossible for DCE clients to communicate with the DCE server. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Apply a patch. |
