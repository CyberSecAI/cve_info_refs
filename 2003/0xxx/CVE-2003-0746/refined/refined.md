Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2003-0746:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in multiple implementations of the Open Software Foundation Distributed Computing Environment (DCE).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- The core weakness is a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability. This means the vulnerability doesn't allow for arbitrary code execution or data access, but instead causes the service to become unavailable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Successful exploitation results in the DCE service either hanging or terminating. This renders it impossible for DCE clients to communicate with the DCE server, effectively disrupting any application relying on DCE for distributed computing.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is remote, meaning an attacker does not need physical access to the vulnerable system.
- The vulnerability can be triggered remotely by a specially crafted request, causing the DCE service to crash or hang.
- It's noted that this vulnerability might be triggered by attackers attempting to exploit other specific vulnerabilities ([*VU#568148*](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/568148) and [*VU#326746*](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/326746)).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker must be able to send network requests to the vulnerable DCE service.
- No specific authentication or local access is required, making it possible to exploit remotely over a network.

**Additional Notes:**

- The CERT/CC vulnerability note lists several vendors and their responses. Some are affected (e.g., Cray, Entegrity Solutions, HP, IBM), some are not affected (e.g., Apple, F5 Networks, Microsoft) and some have an unknown status.
- Patches are available from the vendors for affected products.
- The vulnerability can impact different versions of products as shown in HP's statement.
