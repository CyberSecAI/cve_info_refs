- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A flaw exists in how Outlook 2002 handles V1 Exchange Server Security certificates when encrypting emails. This flaw causes Outlook to fail to encrypt the email correctly, resulting in the message being sent in plain text.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper handling of V1 Exchange Server Security certificates during email encryption.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Information Disclosure. An attacker who intercepts the email can read it in plain text, despite the sender believing it was encrypted.
- **Attack vectors**: Interception of emails between parties using V1 Exchange Server Security certificates for encryption, or gaining access to the infrastructure where those emails are stored (e.g., mail servers).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Ability to intercept emails, or access to the email infrastructure.
