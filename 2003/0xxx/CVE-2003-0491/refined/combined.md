Directory traversal vulnerability on Xoops/E-xoops CMS module "tutorials"

Short description:

An attacker can use this flaw to execute arbitrary code of his choice on the
remote system, run with the privileges of httpd. The code can be written in
any scripting language whose parser is run in the remote system in cooporation
with httpd, whether as module or executable.

Details:

This vulnerability affects systems where Xoops or E-Xoops PHP CMS is
installed, along with it's "Tutorials 2.0" module. Tutorials module normally
allows users to submit HTML/BBcode formatted content to a site. Uploading of
local image files is supported through php embedded uploader. It is however
possible for a user to use this uploader to upload files of no image MIME type
(e.x. PHP scripts), and then execute them by sending a simple http request.
Retrieval or even deletion of sensitive System files on the remote machine may
be possible this way, depending on the privileges under which the httpd is
running and the configuration of PHP parser!

Best solution: Update to version 2.1 in which the PHP uploader has included a
MIME filetype check, prior to uploading.

Other Possible Solutions: change the permissions to the /images/ directory to
555

Vendor Notified: Yes

Update available: Yes, at <http://www.mytutorials.info/modules/mydownloads>
