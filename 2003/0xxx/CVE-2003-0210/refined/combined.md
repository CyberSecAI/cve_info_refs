## Cisco Secure ACS for Windows CSAdmin vulnerable to buffer overflow via login requests

#### Vulnerability Note VU#697049

Original Release Date: 2003-06-05 | Last Revised: 2003-06-05

---

### Overview

Cisco Secure ACS for Windows contains a buffer overflow vulnerability that could permit a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service.

### Description

| Cisco Secure ACS for Windows is an authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) server. From [*Cisco Security Advisory: Cisco Secure Access Control Server for Windows Admin Buffer Overflow Vulnerability*](http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20030423-ACS.shtml):  *Cisco Secure ACS for Windows provides a Web-based management interface, termed CSAdmin, which listens on TCP port 2002. A buffer overflow vulnerability occurs during CSAdmin process servicing login requests. Once a sufficiently long user parameter is received by the server, this can cause the buffer overflow, which would typically result in the service hanging until it can be restarted. It is possible that a buffer overflow could be performed that would result in the compromise of the system and permit remote control of the system.*This issue has been assigned Cisco Bug ID CSCea51366. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the CSAdmin process or cause a denial of service. CSAdmin typically runs with Local System privileges, therefore an attacker could gain complete control of a vulnerable system. The compromise of a Secure ACS system could lead to the disclosure of other user credentials. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply Patch or Upgrade**Apply the appropriate patch as referenced in [*Cisco Security Advisory: Cisco Secure Access Control Server for Windows Admin Buffer Overflow Vulnerability*](http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20030423-ACS.shtml). As noted in this document, future versions of CSAdmin will include this fix. |
| --- |

| **Restrict Access to Secure ACS Systems**Restrict access to Secure ACS systems to trusted hosts and networks.     + Use firewall/router ACLs to limit access to Secure ACS to trusted hosts and networks. Secure ACS provides the ability to restrict access based on IP addresses (see page 10-12 of the [*User Guide for Cisco Secure ACS for Windows Server*](http://www.cisco.com/application/pdf/en/us/guest/products/ps407/c1629/ccmigration_09186a00801085d0.pdf)). + Bind the CSAdmin HTML server to the loopback interface (127.0.0.1) and connect to the Secure ACS host with another secure remote access protocol (Terminal Services/RDP, IPsec, L2TP, SSH).  Note also that SSL can be used to encrypt the HTTP connection to CSAdmin (see page 10-13 of the [*User Guide for Cisco Secure ACS for Windows Server*](http://www.cisco.com/application/pdf/en/us/guest/products/ps407/c1629/ccmigration_09186a00801085d0.pdf)). |

Topic: Remote Buffer Overflow Vulnerability in Web Management Interface of
       Cisco Secure ACS

Release Date: 2003-04-24

CVE CAN ID: CAN-2003-0210

Affected system:
===================

Cisco Secure ACS 2.6.4 for Windows and earlier
Cisco Secure ACS 3.0.3 for Windows and earlier
Cisco Secure ACS 3.1.1 for Windows and earlier

Summary:
=========

NSFOCUS Security Team has found a security vulnerability during the WEB
management interface of Cisco Secure ACS handling certain parameters. Exploiting
the vulnerability attackers could cause the service to hang or run arbitrary
code.

Description:
============

Cisco Secure Access Control Server(ACS) is a high-performance, highly scalable,
centralized user access control framework. It supports centralized access and
audit for dial access server, VPN and firewall, and IP voice(VoIP) solutions,
as well as user  based on standard IEEE 802.1x for wireless users of Cisco
Aironet 350 wireless integration solution.

The management of Cisco Secure ACS is implemented via WEB interface. Cisco
Secure ACS will install a service known as "CSAdmin"( the corresponding program
of which is CSAdmin.exe) on the system. Once the service is enabled it listens
on TCP/2002 port and accepts HTTP request.

A buffer overflow vulnerability occurs during CSAdmin.exe handling login.exe
request. Receiving the login request CSAdmin.exe will call wsprintfA to handle
the user parameter without any length check on the parameter. If attackers
send an extremely long user parameter to the server, they might cause a buffer
overflow, resulting in service hanging or restarting. With carefully
crafted data attacker could run arbitrary code with CSAdmin process
privilege(typically LocalSystem) on the server.

Workaround:
===========

Block access to the port TCP/2002 of the host running Cisco Secure ACS from
untrusted IPs on the firewall.

Vendor Status:
==============

2003-03-16  Informed the vendor.
2003-03-23  The vendor confirmed the vulnerability.

Cisco ACS 3.0(3) - CSAdmin-Patch-3.0-3-6.zip
Cisco ACS 2.6   -  CSAdmin-patch-2.6-4-4.zip

Fixes to the CSAdmin  will be included in ACS for windows versions 2.6.5,
3.0.4 and 3.1.2, and later.

NSFOCUS Security Advisory(SA2003-04)

Topic: Remote Buffer Overflow Vulnerability in Web Management Interface of
       Cisco Secure ACS

Release Date: 2003-04-24

CVE CAN ID: CAN-2003-0210

Affected system:
===================

Cisco Secure ACS 2.6.4 for Windows and earlier
Cisco Secure ACS 3.0.3 for Windows and earlier
Cisco Secure ACS 3.1.1 for Windows and earlier

Summary:

privilege(typically LocalSystem) on the server.

Cisco ACS 3.0(3) - CSAdmin-Patch-3.0-3-6.zip
Cisco ACS 2.6   -  CSAdmin-patch-2.6-4-4.zip

Fixes to the CSAdmin  will be included in ACS for windows versions 2.6.5,
3.0.4 and 3.1.2, and later.
