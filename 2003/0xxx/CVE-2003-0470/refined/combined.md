Hash: SHA1

Title:    Symantec Security Check ActiveX Buffer Overflow

Date:     Monday, June 23, 2003 09:15:19 PM
Threat:   Moderate
Impact:   System Access
Product:  Symantec Security Check

Situation Overview:
Symantec Security Check is a free web-based tool that enables users
to test their computer's exposure to a wide range of on-line threats.
As part of running the check, users may install an ActiveX Control
which remains on the user's system even after the check has
completed.

The current ActiveX Control - which can be named Symantec RuFSI
Utility Class or Symantec RuFSI Registry Information Class - contains
a buffer overflow exploit. The buffer overflow can be exploited when
the user with this ActiveX Control visits a malicious website intent
on exploiting this vulnerability. The exploit can cause Internet
Explorer to crash and/or the execution of arbitrary code on the
user's computer.

Symantec has replaced the current ActiveX Control on the Symantec
Security Check website so that new visitors will not be affected by
the exploit.

Recent visitors to Symantec Security Check should revisit the site
and run a new Security Scan. By running a new scan, the previous
ActiveX Control will be replaced by an updated ActiveX Control that
fixes the buffer overflow condition.

Advanced users can attempt to delete the ActiveX Control by rebooting
and then going into the system folder: %SystemRoot%\Downloaded
Program Files\ and delete "rufsi.dll". This must be done by using the
command prompt and the user must not be on the Symantec Security
Check site at the time.

Statement:
Symantec was made aware of Symantec Security Check's ActiveX buffer
overflow vulnerability today through a public posting on the
Internet. Since hearing of the exploit Symantec has worked diligently
to replace the ActiveX Control on Symantec Security Check. Through
Symantec's customer support, we are working with users who may have
downloaded the exploited ActiveX Control to remove it from their
systems. Although Symantec Security Check is available to both PC and
Mac users, this issue only affects PCs.

Symantec Vulnerability Response Process:
Symantec is a strong supporter of responsible disclosure. It is our
goal to establish a working relationship with researchers who
discover vulnerabilities in Symantec products and to develop, test
and make available updates prior to there being publicly disclosed.
It is ours as well as much of the security communities belief that
premature disclosure can pose a serious threat to the internet. Such
disclosure should be discouraged.

## Symantec ActiveX control vulnerable to buffer overflow

#### Vulnerability Note VU#527228

Original Release Date: 2003-07-21 | Last Revised: 2003-09-30

---

### Overview

There is a buffer overflow in a component of Symantec's web-based Security Check.

### Description

| Symantec [describes](http://www.sarc.com/avcenter/security/Content/2003.06.25.html) Security Check as "a free web-based tool that enables users to test their computer's exposure to a wide range of on-line threats. As part of running the check, users may install an ActiveX Control, which remains on the user's system even after the check has completed." A buffer overflow has been discovered in the ActiveX control that is distributed from Symantec's web-based Security Check web site. For further technical details, please see the following documents:     + [Cesar Cerrudo's advisory](http://lists.netsys.com/pipermail/full-disclosure/2003-June/010692.html) + [Symantec's advisory](http://www.sarc.com/avcenter/security/Content/2003.06.25.html) |
| --- |

### Impact

| Any user that visited Symantec's Security Check web site before June 25, 2003, when Symantec replaced the vulnerable ActiveX control, is likely to have the vulnerable control on their system. The only way to get rid of the control is to either visit Symantec's Security Check web site and run another Security Scan, or manually remove the vulnerable control. Users not following, or unaware of, either of these courses of action may be subject to an attacker installing and/or invoking a vulnerable version of the control on their system.This type of behavior could be averted by making use of Microsoft's [SiteLock Template](http://msdn.microsoft.com/downloads/samples/internet/default.asp?url=/downloads/samples/internet/components/SiteLock/default.asp). This template "enables an ActiveX developer to restrict access so that the control is only deemed safe in a predetermined list of domains. This limits the ability of Web page authors to reuse the control for malicious purposes." Unfortunately, this Symantec ActiveX control does not make use of the SiteLock Template. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Symantec has replaced the vulnerable ActiveX control on their web site, and they [recommend](http://www.sarc.com/avcenter/security/Content/2003.06.25.html) the following:Recent visitors to Symantec Security Check should revisit the site and run a new Security Scan. By running a new scan, the previous ActiveX Control will be replaced by an updated ActiveX Control that fixes the buffer overflow condition. Advanced users can attempt to delete the ActiveX Control by rebooting and then going into the system folder: %SystemRoot%\Downloaded Program Files\ and delete "rufsi.dll". This must be done by using the command prompt and the user must not be on the Symantec Security Check site at the time. A removal tool has been developed and can be found [here](http://www.sarc.com/avcenter/security/Content/2003.06.25a.html). |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
