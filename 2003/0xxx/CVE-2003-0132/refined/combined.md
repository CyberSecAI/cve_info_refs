## Apache vulnerable to DoS

#### Vulnerability Note VU#206537

Original Release Date: 2003-04-08 | Last Revised: 2003-09-18

---

### Overview

A remotely exploitable denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the Apache HTTP Server. Exploitation of this vulnerability may allow an attacker to consume all available system resources, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.

### Description

| The [Apache HTTP Server](http://httpd.apache.org/) is a very popular freely available web server that runs on a variety of operating systems, including UNIX, Linux, and Microsoft Windows (Win32).  A vulnerability exists in the way the Apache HTTP Server handles excessively large chunks of consecutive linefeed characters. Apache 2.0.44 (both the Windows & UNIX implementations) contains this vulnerability. Prior 2.x versions of Apache may contain the vulnerability. For more information, please see the [iDEFENSE Advisory](http://www.idefense.com/advisory/04.08.03.txt). |
| --- |

### Impact

| Exploitation of this vulnerability may allow an attacker to consume all available system resources, resulting in a denial-of-service condition. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Apply a patch from your vendor. If a patch is not available, you may wish to [upgrade](http://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi) to Apache HTTP Server 2.0.45. The Apache Software Foundation has provided a [patch](http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/patches/apply_to_2.0.44/denial_of_service_fix.patch) as well. |

PACKAGE   : apache
SUMMARY   : Denial of service vulnerability
DATE      : 2003-04-30 14:48:00
ID        : CLA-2003:632
RELEVANT
RELEASES  : 9

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

DESCRIPTION
Apache[1] is the most popular webserver in use today.

This update fixes two security vulnerabilities:

1. Denial of service (CAN-2003-0132)[3]
David Endler from iDefense reported[2] a denial of service condition
that affects the apache 2.0 branch which affects all unpatched
servers up to and including version 2.0.44.

There is a memory leak in these apache versions which can be remotely
triggered by sending large chunks of consecutive linefeed characters.
Each linefeed will cause the server to allocate 80 bytes of memory.

A remote attacker can keep sending these simple requests until the
server's memory is exhausted.

2. File descriptor leak[5]
Christian Kratzer and Bjoern A. Zeeb identified several file
descriptor leaks to child processes, such as CGI scripts, which could
consitute a security threat on servers that run untrusted CGI
scripts.

The Apache HTTP Server Project released[4] Apache version 2.0.45 to
address these issues, and this is the version provided via this
update.

SOLUTION
It is recommended that all Apache users upgrade their packages.

IMPORTANT: it is necessary to manually restart the httpd server after
upgrading the packages. In order to do this, execute the following as
root:

service apache stop

(wait a few seconds and check with "ps ax|grep httpd" if there are
any httpd processes running. On a busy webserver this could take a
little longer)

service apache start

--->> v.1.0.07.01 for ipv6 powered by apache, tomcat, webmin.

Check for Apache Installation
-----------------------------
To determine if the Apache web server from HP is installed on
your system, use Software Distributor's swlist command.  All
three versions products may co-exist on a single system.

For example, the results of the command
swlist -l product | grep -i apache

HPApache      2.0.39.01.02  HP Apache-based Web Server
hpuxwsAPACHE  A.1.0.01.01   HP-UX Apache-based Web Server

Stop Apache
-----------------------------
Before updating, make sure to stop any previous Apache binary.
Otherwise, the previous binary will continue running,
preventing the new one from starting, although the
installation would be successful.

After determining which Apache is installed, stop Apache with
the following commands:

for HPApache:        /opt/hpapache2/bin/apachectl stop
for hpuxwsAPACHE:    /opt/hpws/apache/bin/apachectl stop

Download and Install Apache
-----------------------------
- Download Apache from Software Depot using the previously
mentioned links.
- Verify successful download by comparing the cksum with the
value specified on the installation web page.
- Use SD to swinstall the depot.
- For customers with HPApache/B9416AA or HPApache/B9416BA
installed, migrate to hpuxwsAPACHE/hpuxwsApache and
remove the affected products from the system.

Installation of this new version of HP Apache over an existing
HP Apache installation is supported, while installation over
a non-HP Apache is NOT supported.

Removing Apache Installation
----------------------------
If you rather remove Apache from your system than install a
newer version to resolve the security problem, use both
Software Distributor's "swremove" command and also "rm -rf"
the home location as specified in the rc.config.d file "HOME"
variables.

To find the files containing HOME variables in the
/etc/rc.config.d directory:

%ls /etc/rc.config.d | grep apache
hpapache2conf
hpws\_apacheconf

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Problem Description:

A memory leak was discovered in Apache 2.0 through 2.0.44 that can
allow a remote attacker to cause a significant denial of service
(DoS) by sending requests containing a lot of linefeed characters to
the server.

As well, Apache does not filter terminal escape sequences from its
log files, which could make it easy for an attacker to insert those
sequences into the error and access logs, which could possibly be
viewed by certain terminal emulators with vulnerabilities related to
escape sequences.

After upgrading these packages, be sure to restart the httpd server
by executing:

service httpd restart

SGI Security Advisory

Title    : Security Vulnerabilities in MediaBase Apache and PHP
Number   : 20030502-01-I
Date     : May 19, 2003
Reference: Kasenna Support Issue # 1095 and # 1330
Fixed in : Patches from Kasenna Support Website
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

- -----------------------
- --- Issue Specifics ---
- -----------------------

It's been reported that Kasenna Mediabase has insecure versions of
Apache and PHP.

SGI has investigated the issue and recommends the following steps for
neutralizing the exposure.  It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that these measures
be implemented on ALL vulnerable SGI systems.

These issues have been corrected with patches and in future releases of
MediaBase.

- --------------
- --- Impact ---
- --------------

MediaBase is an optional product from Kasenna, and is not installed by
default on IRIX 6.5 systems.

To determine the version of IRIX you are running, execute the following
command:

# /bin/uname -R

That will return a result similar to the following:

# 6.5 6.5.16f

The first number ("6.5") is the release name, the second ("6.5.16f" in this
case) is the extended release name.  The extended release name is the
"version" we refer to throughout this document.

To see if mediabase is installed, execute the following command:

% versions -b | grep mbase
I  mbase\_client         06/01/2000  WebFORCE MediaBase 2.1 - Client
I  mbase\_players        10/06/2000  SGI MediaBase 4.0.1 - Players packaged
for installation on server
I  mbase\_root           12/24/2000  SGI MediaBase 4.0.1 - Development ROOT
Files
I  mbase\_server         10/06/2000  SGI MediaBase 4.0.1 - MediaBase Server
Execution Environment
I  mbase\_server\_spk1    12/24/2000  SGI MediaBase 4.0.1 - MediaBase Server
Service Pack 1

To determine if the version of Apache installed as part of MediaBase is
vulnerable, execute the following command:

% /usr/kasenna/apache/bin/httpd -v
Server version: Apache/1.3.14 (Unix)
Server built:   Dec 20 2000 15:52:52

If the version shown (in this case 1.3.14) is lower than 1.3.27, then the
system is vulnerable.

To determine if the version of PHP installed as part of MediaBase is
vulnerable, execute the following commands:

%/usr/bin/elfdump -L /usr/mbase/asset\_gateway/php\_apache.so | grep TIMSTAMP
[46]    TIMSTAMP    Jan 13 14:50:39 2003

%/usr/bin/elfdump -L /usr/mbase/asset\_gateway/php\_mediabase.so | grep TIMSTAMP
[45]    TIMSTAMP    Jan 10 14:02:48 2003

If the value shown for "TIMSTAMP" is earlier than the ones shown, then the
system is vulnerable.

- ----------------------------
- --- Temporary Workaround ---
- ----------------------------

There is no effective workaround available for these problems if MediaBase
is needed.  SGI and Kasenna recommend installing the patches shown below
from the Kasenna website.

- ----------------
- --- Solution ---
- ----------------

Kasenna MediaBase is an optional product, the system is vulnerable if
a vulnerable version of MediaBase and its associated Apache and PHP
components are installed.  Please run the commands shown in the "Impact"
section above and install the patches if those commands show
the system to be vulnerable.

Kasenna has provided patches for these vulnerabilities. Our recommendation
is to install the patches provided by Kasenna.

To obtain the Kasenna MediaBase patches, go to <http://support.kasenna.com/>
and install the patches shown in support issue 1095 (apache) and 1033 (PHP).

In additional response to the iDEFENSE Security Advisory 04.08.03 cited
below, the Apache HTTP Server Project has published a specific patch
to address this Denial of Service vulnerability for the 2.0.44 server version.

The patch may or may not apply to earlier versions of Apache 2.0, and
if applied to earlier versions, may or may not fully address the vulnerability.
Review was limited to correcting the but in the 2.0.44 release only.

The patch can be obtained from;

<http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/patches/apply_to_2.0.44/denial_of_service_fix.patch>

The Apache HTTP Server project continues to caution users to obtain the
latest release (2.0.45 at this time) from

<http://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi>

to improve stability and obtain the most current bug fixes.  As noted in the
prior announcement;

OS/2 Users of both 2.0.44 and 2.0.45 have an additional Denial of Service
vulnerability identified and reported by Robert Howard <rihoward@rawbw.com>
that be addressed with the next release.  Until that time, OS2 users must obtain
an additional patch before building Apache release 2.0.45 or prior:

<http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/patches/apply_to_2.0.45/os2_filestat_security_fix.patch>

That is all.

This is partially correct.  Rather than "many requests containing these
characters", the more effective strategy is "many instances of this
character (these characters)".

Isn't that the truth?  In a few minutes, my Apache used some 390 MB of
memory when tested.  The statement that only 80 bytes is lost per newline
understates the issue in my opinion.  If we multiply:

2 newlines: 160 bytes
4 newlines: 320 bytes
8 newlines: 640 bytes
16 newlines: 1280 bytes
32 newlines: 2560 bytes
64 newlines: 5120 bytes
128 newlines: 10240 bytes
256 newlines: 20480 bytes
512 newlines: 40960 bytes
1024 newlines: 81920 bytes

Worse, Apache doesn't require any form to the request what-so-ever, so 1 KB
of 0x0A's is just as good as a well-formed request.  Let's continue:

2 KB: 163840 bytes
4 KB: 655360 bytes
8 KB: 1310720 bytes
16 KB: 2621440 bytes

That's nearly 2 MB leaked in response to 16 KB.  And, this is just baseline
figures of the actual leak itself, and doesn't take into account various
other factors, including:

* Other use of memory by Apache
* The resources associated with the web session

>iDEFENSE has performed research using proof of concept exploit code to
>demonstrate the impact of this vulnerability.

I'm not seeing any example code, so let's try the attached.
"apache-massacre.c" allows the user to target a host/port of choice.  It
uses a single-connection method, and is stopped with a simple CTRL+C
interrupt.

It sends the data (which is patterns of "\r\n") in "chunks".  It sends a
pre-specified number of character sequences, and then checks the interrupt
flag for a request to terminate.  Deployed on a high-bandwidth connection
(or a low-bandwidth connection with a lot of time to spare), Apache is
disabled within seconds.

The attached code compiles cleanly on Win32, and *should* compile on any
system that is POSIX-compliant, and offers a BSD socket interface.

>A successful exploitation scenario requires between two and
>seven megabytes of traffic exchange.

I hate to say, but I wonder where these figures come from.  Obviously, a
machine with a 16 MB RAM and a 512 MB hard drive is going to run out of
resources incredibly faster than a machine with 512 MB RAM and a 100 GB
hard drive is.  Also, "between two and seven megabytes of traffic exchange"
is very possible with a DDoSnet of some kind.  With 10 connections at 1
mbps each (for a combined speed of 10 mbps), approximately 1,750,000 bytes
(1.25 MB) is exchanged each second.  This same speed is reached by the full
upload rates of many LAN-based providers (schools, for instance).  Further,
a single cable modem has a link rate of 10 mbps, held down only by ISP
capping.

In the situation of such a network (or, a single uncapped cable modem), the
entire traffic exchange rate is hit within one second.

/* apache-massacre.c
 * Test code for Apache 2.x Memory Leak
 * By Matthew Murphy
 *
 * DISCLAIMER: This exploit tool is provided only to test networks for a
 * known vulnerability.  Do not use this tool on systems you do not control,
 * and do not use this tool on networks you do not own without appropriate
 * consent from the network owner.  You are responsible for any damage your
 * use of the tool causes.  In no event may the author of this tool be held
 * responsible for damages relating to its use.
 *
 * Apache 2.x (2.0.44 and prior) has a memory leak in its request handling
 * that causes it to handle newlines in an akward manner -- it allocates
 * 80 bytes for each.  This quickly turns into a nightmare for server stats.
 * On Windows XP, I was able to cause Apache to consume 390 MB in a matter
 * of a few minutes.
 *
 * The idea is to fire off millions of newlines, depriving Apache of valuable
 * memory, causing a huge performance degredation.  The worst part about this
 * flaw is that leaked memory isn't recovered until the Apache child process
 * terminates.
 *
 * The high consumption drops some when the session ends, but there is still
 * a substantial increase in memory use that doesn't end until Apache exits.
 * I got memory use up to a peak of about 69,000 KB, and it dropped down to
 * about 37,000 KB.  The attacking code was the only traffic on the server --
 * the idle memory use of the server is about 7,132 KB.  Although the leak is
 * cut in half when the connection terminates, the leak is still a mighty
 * 29,878 KB (21.3 MB).  All this occurred in a matter of 15 seconds on my
 * 2.51 GHz P4.
 *
 * As with most Apache exposures, the impacts vary between ports of the server:
 *
 * Non-Unix (Win32, Netware, OS/2): These ports are most adversely affected
 * by this, as Apache's child process doesn't terminate normally unless the
 * parent process stops.  This means that leaks (and any performance loss) hang
 * around until Apache is restarted.
 *
 * Unix/mpm_prefork: This MPM offers the most protection against successful
 * exploitation, as its processes exit at the end of the request.
 *
 * Unix/other MPMs: These other MPMs utilize multiple Apache processes for
 * multiple Apache requests.  Depending on the MPM in use and the traffic rates
 * of the server, this may be used to the advantage of a potential attacker.
 * If multiple different Apache processes are utilized, an attacker can spread
 * the substantial leak between processes to dodge resource limits imposed on
 * httpd's UID (usually nobody, www, or apache)
 *
 * Credit: iDEFENSE reported this issue to several security lists on April 8,
 * 2003 following the Apache release announcement.  Apache fixed the flaw about
 * a month after the initial disclosure of this vulnerability.  iDEFENSE credits
 * the discovery of this vulnerability to an anonymous researcher.
 *
 * Happy Hunting!

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

GENTOO LINUX SECURITY ANNOUNCEMENT 200304-01
- - ---------------------------------------------------------------------

          PACKAGE : apache
          SUMMARY : Denial of service in Apache 2.x
             DATE : 2003-04-09 08:06 UTC
          EXPLOIT : remote
VERSIONS AFFECTED : 2.0.0-2.0.44
    FIXED VERSION : >=2.0.45
              CVE : CAN-2003-0132

- - ---------------------------------------------------------------------

- From advisory:

"Remote exploitation of a memory leak in the Apache HTTP Server causes the
daemon to over utilize system resources on an affected system. The problem
is HTTP Server's handling of large chunks of consecutive linefeed
characters. The web server allocates an eighty-byte buffer for each
linefeed character without specifying an upper limit for allocation.
Consequently, an attacker can remotely exhaust system resources by
generating many requests containing these characters."

Read the full advisory at:
<http://www.idefense.com/advisory/04.08.03.txt>

SOLUTION

It is recommended that all Gentoo Linux users who are running
net-www/apache version 2  upgrade to apache-2.0.45 as follows:

emerge sync
emerge \=net-www/apache-2.0.45
emerge clean

                    Apache 2.0.45 Released

The Apache Software Foundation and The Apache HTTP Server Project are
pleased to announce the eighth public release of the Apache 2.0
HTTP Server.  This Announcement notes the significant changes in
2.0.45 as compared to 2.0.44.

OS2 users; note that Apache 2.0 versions *including* 2.0.45 still
have a Denial of Service vulnerability that was identified and reported
by Robert Howard <rihoward@rawbw.com> that will fixed with the release
of 2.0.46, but is too important to delay announcement today.  The patch
<http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs/apr/file_io/os2/filestat.c.diff?r1=1.34&r2=1.35>
must be applied before building on OS2.  This patch will already
be applied to all OS2 binaries released for Apache 2.0.45.
[<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0134>]

This version of Apache is principally a security and bug fix release.
A summary of the bug fixes is given at the end of this document.
Of particular note is that 2.0.45 addresses two security
vulnerabilities, both affecting all platforms.

Prior Apache 2.0 versions through 2.0.44 had a significant Denial of
Service vulnerability that was identified and reported by David Endler
<DEndler@iDefense.com>, and fixed with this release.  The specific
details of this issue will be published by David Endler one week from
this release, on April 7th.  No more specific information is disclosed
at this time, but all Apache 2.0 users are encouraged to upgrade now.
[<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0132>]

This release eliminated leaks of several file descriptors to child
processes, such as CGI scripts, which could consitute a security threat
on servers that run untrusted CGI scripts.  This issue was identified,
reported and addressed by Christian Kratzer <ck@cksoft.de> and
Bjoern A. Zeeb <bz@zabbadoz.net>.

The Apache Software Foundation would like to thank David Endler,
Christian Kratzer, Bjoern Zeeb and Robert Howard for the responsible
reporting of these issues.

Apache 2.0.42 and later releases mark a change in the Apache release
process, and a new level of stability in the 2.0 series.  With the
release of Apache 2.0.42, we will make every effort to retain
forward compatibility so that upgrading along the 2.0 series should
be much easier.  This compatibility extends from Apache release 2.0.42,
so users of that version or later should be able to upgrade without
changing configurations or updating DSO modules.  (Users of earlier
releases will need to recompile all modules in order to upgrade
to 2.0.42 or later versions.)

We consider this release to be the best version of Apache available
and encourage users of all prior versions to upgrade.

Apache 2.0.45 source code is available for download from

  <http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/>

Apache 2.0.45 binary releases will become available for download from

  <http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/binaries/>

Please see the CHANGES_2.0 file, linked from the above page, for
a full list of changes.

Apache 2.0 offers numerous enhancements, improvements, and performance
boosts over the 1.3 codebase.  For an overview of new features introduced
after 1.3 please see

  <http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/new_features_2_0.html>

When upgrading or installing this version of Apache, please keep
in mind the following:

If you intend to use Apache with one of the threaded MPMs, you must
ensure that the modules (and the libraries they depend on) that you
will be using are thread-safe.  Please contact the vendors of these
modules to obtain this information.

                    Apache 2.0.45 Major changes

Security vulnerabilities closed since Apache 2.0.44

 *) SECURITY [CAN-2003-0132]: Close a Denial of Service vulnerability
    identified by David Endler <DEndler@iDefense.com> on all platforms.
    Details embargoed until their announcement on 7 April 2003.

 *) SECURITY:  Eliminated leaks of several file descriptors to child
    processes, such as CGI scripts.  This fix depends on the latest
    APR library release 0.9.2, which is distributed with the httpd
    source tarball for Apache 2.0.45.  PR 17206

Bugs fixed and features added since Apache 2.0.44

 *) Prevent endless loops of internal redirects in mod_rewrite by
    aborting after exceeding a limit of internal redirects. The
    limit defaults to 10 and can be changed using the RewriteOptions
    directive. PR 17462.

 *) Configurable compression level for mod_deflate.

 *) Allow SSLMutex to select/use the full range of APR locking
    mechanisms available to it (e.g. same choices as AcceptMutex.)

 *) mod_cgi, mod_cgid, mod_ext_filter: Log errors when scripts cannot
    be started on Unix because of such problems as bad permissions,
    bad shebang line, etc.

 *) Try to log an error if a piped log program fails and try to
    restart a piped log program in more failure situations.

 *) Added support for mod_auth_LDAP, with a new AuthLDAPCharsetConfig
    directive, to convert extended characters in the user ID to UTF-8,
    before authenticating against the LDAP directory.

 *) No longer removes the Content-Length from responses via mod_proxy.

 *) Enhance mod_isapi's WriteClient() callback to provide better emulation
    for isapi extensions that use the first WriteClient() to send status
    and headers, such as the foxisapi module.

 *) Win32: Avoid busy wait (consuming all the CPU idle cycles) when
    all worker threads are busy.

 *) Introduced .pdb debugging symbols for Win32 release builds.

 *) Fixed piped access logs on Win32.

 *) Fix path handling of mod_rewrite, especially on non-unix systems.
    There was some confusion between local paths and URL paths.

 *) Added an rpm build script.
