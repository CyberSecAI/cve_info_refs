| [Description](#c0)  Toni DiBoulda    2004-02-11 07:59:05 UTC  ``` Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. cd /tmp 2. ln -sf ~/.bashrc analogtv.size 3. start /usr/lib/xscreensaver/xanalogtv 4. log out 5. log in   Actual Results:   bogus .bashrc  Expected Results:   corrupting files should not be made that easy ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  plasmagunman    2004-02-13 14:26:28 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 25561](attachment.cgi?id=25561 "removes the part where \"/tmp/analogtv.size\" is written") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=25561&action=edit "removes the part where \"/tmp/analogtv.size\" is written"), [diff](attachment.cgi?id=25561&action=diff "removes the part where \"/tmp/analogtv.size\" is written")] removes the part where "/tmp/analogtv.size" is written  grepping through the code i found only one place where this file is touched. that's when something is written into. the program doesn't seem to open this file another time and the data is never read. so this patch removes the file-writing part and it seems to work.  i only tested this patch on the standalone-hacks, not with the xscreensaver-configuration window. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  solar (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-02-15 10:21:53 UTC  ``` This surely seems to be your standard symlink . I'm a little  nervous about adding this patch without any type of testing being done. I would prefer if somebody could touch base with the people that coded analogtv portion of xscreensaver and confirm that said section of code was only used for their own DEBUGGING or whatever.  Till then how do the rest of us feel? package.mask xscreensaver all together or #ifdef WANT_BUGGY_LINK_CODE our way around the code in question or simply use the patch as provided by plasmagunman? ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  plasmagunman    2004-02-15 15:39:03 UTC  ``` i already sent this patch to the xscreensaver-coder. actually i don't know if he did the xanalogtv-part. anyway, i didn't receive any answer yet, but will inform you when i get some. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Alastair Tse (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-02-16 07:33:55 UTC  ``` i don't think this is serious enough to warrant a hard mask right now. we could disable the analogtv hack until we get a suitable patch from the maintainers. i'm just not qualified or have the time to audit the creation of files and symlink type attacks.  if that is sufficient, then i'll prepare a -r1 that has the analogtv hack disabled. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Toni DiBoulda    2004-02-18 20:08:44 UTC  ``` <rant>  Okay, since nobody really seems to know what /tmp symlink attack means, here's a clue: it means that any user with write access to /tmp can corrupt arbritary files owned by any other user. And no, hardmasking won't do anything because it will not change already installed base. I don't want to sound impolite, but this still an issue after one week seems very weak.  Hello, gentoo enterprise!  </rant>  ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  solar (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-02-18 22:50:42 UTC  ``` thanks for the useless rant. ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Alastair Tse (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-02-19 03:38:15 UTC  ``` i find it ridiculous that the reporter has just ranted about nothing being done, yet did not help us with providing a patch or analysing the problem. a clear flamebait in my book.  thanks to plasmagunman, who provided us with a patch and also contacted the author, i've committed xscreensaver-4.14-r2 that removes the creation of the symlink. and masked all the older xscreensaver versions.  security team, what else do we need to do?   plasmagunman, did jwz respond to the patch you submitted to him? ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  plasmagunman    2004-02-19 03:52:13 UTC  ``` no response yet. it's strange, once i had a problem with opengl and my graphics-card and i got an answer after 10 minutes. perhaps he's on vacation..? ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Alastair Tse (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-02-19 04:18:29 UTC  ``` before i get shafted for my mistake, i meant i removed the creation of the temporary file that could possibly be used in a symlink attack. ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Toni DiBoulda    2004-02-19 07:13:11 UTC  ``` Sorry sorry sorry! And a thank you to plasmagunman from me too. But I thought  since patch was already provided and it is clear offending file is only used for debugging, no further analysis is required. Issue here is, no action after problem is public for one week can cause massive data loss and I'm feeling very uncomfortable for this report already. I'll be quiet now.  ```  [Comment 11](#c11)  plasmagunman    2004-02-23 14:18:37 UTC  ``` anybody wants to close this bug? i don't think i can do that, must be the reporter or a developer, no? ```  [Comment 12](#c12)  Jon Portnoy (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-04-03 19:52:17 UTC  ``` Old bug, apparently still needs to be closed ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=182286#c0)  Mark J. Cox    2006-02-21 17:03:19 UTC  ``` Stan Bubrouski contacted jwz the maintainer of xscreensaver         and cc'd Red Hat security folks on 20031031 to report an         insecure temporary file flaw introduced in xscreensaver         version 4.14.  This was due to a bit of debugging code that         got left in by mistake, it was removed in 4.15, and therefore         didn't affect any RHEL releases.  This was [CVE-2003-0885](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2003-0885).  However SUSE then found some other suspect temporary file issues which also got silently fixed in 4.15 release.  I've applied for a CVE name for these.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=182286#c1)  Mark J. Cox    2006-02-21 17:03:19 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 124968](attachment.cgi?id=124968&action=diff "Proposed patch as used by SUSE") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=124968&action=edit "Proposed patch as used by SUSE") Proposed patch as used by SUSE   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=182286#c4)  Jiri Pallich    2012-06-20 13:24:42 UTC  ``` Thank you for submitting this issue for consideration in Red Hat Enterprise Linux. The release for which you requested us to review is now End of Life.  Please See <https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/>  If you would like Red Hat to re-consider your feature request for an active release, please re-open the request via appropriate support channels and provide additional supporting details about the importance of this issue.   ``` |  |
