  "related": true,
  "summary": "A vulnerability in Webmin and Usermin allows for session ID spoofing, leading to unauthorized access and potential root command execution.",
  "details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the miniserv.pl webserver program used by both Webmin and Usermin. It does not properly validate metacharacters (like line feed or carriage return) within BASE64 encoded strings during the BASIC authentication process.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Session ID spoofing"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass authentication, spoof a session ID, and potentially execute arbitrary commands as root.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote exploitation via crafted HTTP requests"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to know a valid Webmin username and send a crafted HTTP request with metacharacters in the BASE64 encoded string during the authentication process."
