The provided content relates to CVE-2003-0017.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way Apache HTTP Server on Windows platforms handles illegal characters in the request URL. Specifically, appending characters like '<' to a request URL could cause the server to serve unexpected files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper input validation/sanitization: The server does not correctly sanitize or reject request URLs containing illegal characters.
- File serving logic vulnerability: The vulnerability exposes a flaw in how the server determines and serves files based on the provided URL path.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Serving of unexpected files: An attacker could potentially cause the server to serve files they should not have access to, potentially including sensitive files if the server's file access control is not properly configured.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending a crafted HTTP request: The attacker sends a crafted request to the Apache server on a Windows platform.
- Malicious URL: The crafted request contains a URL with appended illegal characters, like '<'.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to send HTTP requests to the target Apache server.
- The target Apache server must be running on a Windows platform.
