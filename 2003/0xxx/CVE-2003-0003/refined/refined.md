Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2003-0003:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an unchecked buffer within the Microsoft Locator service.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- A buffer overflow vulnerability is present in the Microsoft Locator service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to:
  - Cause the Locator service to fail (denial of service).
  - Execute arbitrary code with system privileges on the vulnerable system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A remote attacker sends a specially crafted, oversized request to the Locator service. This request overruns a buffer, leading to the vulnerability.
- The attack is typically launched over the network via RPC calls.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send RPC requests to the vulnerable machine running the Locator service.
- While the service is typically not exposed to the internet, an internal network position is sufficient for exploitation, unless the firewall is improperly configured.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.

**Additional Details:**
- The Locator service maps logical names to network-specific names.
- By default, the Locator service is enabled on Windows 2000 domain controllers and Windows NT 4.0 domain controllers.
- This vulnerability affects Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000, and Windows XP.
- The vulnerability was discovered by David Litchfield of Next Generation Security Software Ltd.
- Microsoft released patches to address this vulnerability.
