- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Input validation error in ICQ's GIF parsing/rendering library ('icqateimg32.dll'). The library fails to properly handle GIF89a files that are missing color tables (GCT or LCT) after an image descriptor.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper input validation in GIF parsing logic. Specifically, the library expects a color table (either GCT or LCT) to be present after an Image Descriptor in a GIF89a file. If neither of these tables is found, the library malfunctions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Denial of service. The ICQ client will crash or become unresponsive when parsing a malformed GIF file lacking a color table, resulting in the user being unable to use ICQ services.
- **Attack vectors:** By sending a specially crafted GIF file to an ICQ user. This could be done through file transfer, or possibly through other means within the ICQ communication protocols that allow for the sending and parsing of images.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send a malicious GIF file to the victim through ICQ. This could involve having the victim accept a file transfer, or any other method through which ICQ processes and renders GIF images.
