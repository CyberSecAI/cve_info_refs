Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the way Microsoft Outlook Web Access (OWA) in Exchange Server 5.5 performs HTML encoding within the "Compose New Message" form. Specifically, the Active Server Page (ASP) used for composing new messages does not properly encode the requested URL when rendering HTML, leading to a cross-site scripting vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Cross-site scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is a cross-site scripting issue, where untrusted input (a specially crafted URL) can be injected into a web page and executed by the user's browser as if it originated from the legitimate site.
- **Improper HTML encoding:** OWA fails to correctly encode the URL when displaying it in HTML, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote code execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary script code in the security context of the victim user.
- **Data access:** If the attacker successfully executes malicious script in the user's context, the attacker could gain access to any data that the user has access to on the OWA website (or any other site hosted on the same server), including potentially sensitive information like emails.
- **Session manipulation:** Attackers can potentially monitor user web sessions, forward information to third parties, read or write cookies, or execute other code on the user's system.
- **Persistent attacks:** Malicious code can be designed to persist, executing each time the user revisits the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Email with malicious link:** The most direct attack vector involves sending a specially crafted email message to the victim, which includes a link containing malicious script. The user must click this link for the exploit to work.
- **External webpage with malicious link:** An attacker can also exploit the vulnerability if they know the target's Exchange server name. They can entice a logged-in user to click a specially crafted link from another source, while the user is also logged into OWA.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to craft malicious URLs:** The attacker needs to craft a URL that contains malicious JavaScript code, designed to exploit the missing HTML encoding in OWA.
- **Ability to send emails or host a malicious website:**  The attacker must be able to send emails or host web pages with malicious links that will be clicked by the victim.
- **User interaction required:** The attack requires the user to click a link provided by the attacker.
