Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in the comment submission fields (Name, Email Address, URL, and Comments) of Movable Type versions 2.63 and prior. This allows users to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. Movable Type fails to sanitize user-supplied input in comment fields, allowing attackers to inject malicious JavaScript.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** By injecting malicious JavaScript code, attackers can perform actions within the context of the victim's browser, such as:
    *   Stealing cookies (`alert(document.cookie)`)
    *   Modifying page content and behavior
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites
    *   Potentially performing other browser-based attacks

*   **Denial of Service (Partial):** One of the provided examples shows that specific javascript code can cause the disappearance of the comments textboxes and buttons on the page, creating a partial denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the comment submission forms on a Movable Type powered website.
*   An attacker can insert malicious javascript code into the Name, Email, URL, or Comment fields.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to post a comment to a vulnerable Movable Type blog. This could be either a public comment or a comment on a private post where the attacker has access.
*   Basic knowledge of JavaScript is required to craft malicious scripts.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was patched in Movable Type version 2.6. Later versions (e.g. 2.63) include the fix by default.
*   The suggested solution is to either strip malicious characters or escape them.
*   It appears that if HTML is allowed, Movable Type's default sanitization settings will prevent the exploit. However, if the user has not enabled sanitization, they will be vulnerable to XSS.
