- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The PeopleSoft Gateway Administration servlet discloses the server-side configuration file path in the error response when an invalid value is entered through the HTML form.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Path disclosure vulnerability. The application leaks sensitive information (the path of server-side configuration files) when handling invalid input.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can obtain the full path of the server-side configuration files. This information can be leveraged in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to compromise the system.
- **Attack vectors:**  The vulnerability is exploited by sending an invalid value to the PeopleSoft Gateway Administration servlet via an HTML form.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the PeopleSoft Gateway Administration servlet, typically through a web browser.

**Note:** The advisory incorrectly states the CVE is CAN-2003-0628. The CVE ID is actually CVE-2003-0629.
