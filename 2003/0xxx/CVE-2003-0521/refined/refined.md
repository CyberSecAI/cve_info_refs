- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The cPanel interface does not sanitize the URL part of HTTP requests before displaying them in the 'Error Log' and 'Latest Visitors' screens.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious HTML tags into HTTP requests, which are later parsed and executed by the administrator's browser. This can lead to the theft of cookies associated with the domain, or the execution of client-side scripts, potentially allowing the attacker to perform actions on behalf of the administrator.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves sending crafted HTTP requests containing malicious HTML tags to a cPanel-managed server. These requests are then logged by the server and displayed in the cPanel interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the targeted web server. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the cPanel interface itself, the vulnerability is exploited by crafting an HTTP request that will be logged and viewed by the administrator in cPanel.
