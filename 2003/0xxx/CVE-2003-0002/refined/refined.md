- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A web page in Microsoft Content Management Server (MCMS) 2001 does not properly validate user input, leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious script into a web page generated by the MCMS server. This script could:
    - Alter the content of web pages.
    - Monitor the user's session.
    - Copy personal data to a site controlled by the attacker.
    - Access the legitimate site's cookies.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the script and tricks a user into clicking it, typically through email or a malicious website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to convince a user to click on a crafted URL that contains the malicious script. This can be achieved via email, malicious websites, or other forms of social engineering.
