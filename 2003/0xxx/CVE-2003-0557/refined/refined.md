- **Root cause of vulnerability:** SQL injection vulnerability in the `/login.asp` page of StoreFront.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application does not properly sanitize user input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can bypass authentication and retrieve sensitive user information from the database, potentially gaining access to the first user's account or other user information.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered through the `login.asp` page by injecting SQL code into the email and password fields.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to access the login page of the affected StoreFront application and inject SQL code into the email and password fields. The attacker does not need to know a valid username/email address, but knowing one will allow the attacker to retrieve that specific user's data instead of the first user in the database.
