- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A design flaw in Kerio Personal Firewall allows an attacker to replay captured administration session packets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of proper session management or protection against replay attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can replay a captured administration session, potentially gaining unauthorized access or control.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to sniff network traffic to capture administration session packets.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to eavesdrop on network traffic between the administrator and the Kerio Personal Firewall. This could be on the same network or through other network interception methods.
