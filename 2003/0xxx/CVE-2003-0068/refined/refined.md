  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2003-0068",
    "description": "The content provided describes a vulnerability in Eterm where it is possible to inject commands into the command line via a window title reporting escape sequence.",
    "details": [
      {
        "component": "Eterm Terminal Emulator",
        "vulnerability_details": "The Eterm terminal emulator is vulnerable to a command injection attack via the window title reporting escape sequence. When this sequence is processed, the current window title is placed directly on the command line. An attacker can set a malicious window title containing a command, then trigger the window title reporting sequence, and convince the user to press enter to execute the injected command.",
         "root_cause": "Improper handling of escape sequences in the window title functionality. Specifically, the window title reporting sequence allows the current title to be inserted into the command line without proper sanitization or validation.",
         "weaknesses": [
           "Improper input validation",
           "Lack of sanitization of window title data",
            "Unsafe use of escape sequences"
         ],
        "impact": "Remote code execution. An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the user's system with the user's privileges.",
        "attack_vector": "An attacker needs to send a specific escape sequence to the user's terminal emulator. This can be done via various methods such as a compromised syslog daemon, vulnerable web server logs, a malicious service response, or even a system-wide message in multi-user environments.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to display arbitrary data on the victim's terminal emulator and convince the user to press enter."
