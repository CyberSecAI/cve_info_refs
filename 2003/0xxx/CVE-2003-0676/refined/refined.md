Root cause of vulnerability:
The iPlanet Administration Server 5.1's log viewer allows directory traversal.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Directory Traversal: The log viewer does not properly sanitize the "file" parameter, allowing an attacker to use ".." sequences to navigate outside of the intended log directory.
- Improper privilege management: The application runs with root privileges, which means that access to any file on the system can be obtained through the directory traversal vulnerability.

Impact of exploitation:
An attacker can read any file on the host server, including security-critical files like /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, hosts, hosts.allow, and hosts.deny.

Attack vectors:
An attacker can craft a URL with a modified "file" and "directories" parameter that contains directory traversal sequences to access arbitrary files on the server. For example:
`http://192.168.192.168:5000/admin-serv/tasks/configuration/ViewLog?file=passwd&num=5000&str=&directories=admin-serv%2Flogs%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2fetc&id=admin-serv`

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker needs to be able to access the iPlanet Administration Server's web interface.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to access the log viewer.
