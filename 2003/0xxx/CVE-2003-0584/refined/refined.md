The provided content describes vulnerabilities in the Backup and Restore Utility for Unix (BRU) versions <= 17.0, specifically buffer overflow and format string vulnerabilities.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerabilities stem from improper usage of `vsprintf()` within the BRU program.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Buffer overflow:** Passing an overly long string (e.g., 3050 'A' characters) to BRU causes a segmentation fault.
- **Format string vulnerability:** Passing format string specifiers (e.g., `%n%n%n%n`) to BRU also results in a segmentation fault.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Both vulnerabilities can be exploited to gain root access on the local system.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerabilities are triggered by executing the `bru` binary with crafted command-line arguments, either a long string for the buffer overflow or format string specifiers for the format string vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs local access to the system where `bru` is installed and the ability to execute commands as a regular user. The attacker also needs the ability to execute the `bru` binary.
- The vulnerability is triggered if the user sets the suid bit on the bru binary which is not the default configuration.

**Additional details:**
- The advisory mentions that the original vendor (EST) sold BRU to The Tolisgroup. While The Tolisgroup version does not ship with the suid bit set, users might set it manually.
- The advisory includes proof-of-concept exploit code demonstrating how to achieve root access by exploiting the format string vulnerability, referencing a `0x82-BRU_overformat.c` exploit.
- The exploit leverages the format string vulnerability to overwrite return addresses and execute shellcode.
- The advisory suggests upgrading to the Tolisgroup BRU or removing the suid bit from the bru binary as a patch or workaround.
