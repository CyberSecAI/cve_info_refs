Denial of Service Vulnerability in DB2 Discovery Service

To determine if you should apply this patch, download AppDetective for
DB2 from <http://www.appsecinc.com/products/appdetective/db2/>

Risk level: Low

Summary:

IBM DB2 provides a UDP service used as a discovery service for locating
DB2 databases on the network. This UDP service shuts down when sent more
than 20 bytes.

Details:
IBM DB2 is a database that provides many services. One of these services
is a discovery service. This is used to locate a service when
configuring a connection. This service listens on UDP port 523.

This service typically receives a packet such as "DB2GETADDR SQL07020".
If a packet larger than 20 bytes is received by the server, the service
will shutdown.

Once the discovery service crashes, the service "DB2 - DB2DAS00" must be
restarted.

This issue is cover under the fix "IY47686: Search Discovery Listener
Denial of Service Vulnerability".

Fix:
Apply FixPak 10a from IBM. This can be downloaded from the following
location:
