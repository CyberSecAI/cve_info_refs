- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The PeopleSoft Gateway Administration servlet, when provided with an invalid input, discloses the server-side configuration file paths in the error response.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Path disclosure vulnerability. The application reveals the full path of server-side configuration files when invalid input is provided to the gateway administration servlet.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can gain knowledge of the server's file system structure by obtaining the full path of configuration files. This information can potentially be used for further attacks to exploit OS or application configuration file vulnerabilities.
- **Attack vectors:** By providing invalid input to the HTML form of the `gateway.administration` servlet.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have the ability to access the PeopleSoft Gateway Administration servlet and be able to submit data to it. No specific capabilities or privileges are mentioned other than this requirement.
