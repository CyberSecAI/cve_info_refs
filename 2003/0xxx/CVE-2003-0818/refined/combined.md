### General Information

## Technical Details

A security vulnerability exists in the Microsoft ASN.1 Library that could allow code execution on an affected system. The vulnerability is caused by an unchecked buffer in the Microsoft ASN.1 Library, which could result in a buffer overflow.

An attacker who successfully exploited this buffer overflow vulnerability could execute code with system privileges on an affected system. The attacker could then take any action on the system, including installing programs, viewing data, changing data, deleting data, or creating new accounts with full privileges.

Abstract Syntax Notation 1 (ASN.1) is a data standard that is used by many applications and devices in the technology industry for allowing the normalization and understanding of data across various platforms. More information about ASN.1 can be found in Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [252648](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;252648).

**Mitigating factors:**

In the most likely exploitable scenario, an attacker would have to have direct access to the user's network.

**Severity Rating:**

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Microsoft Windows NT 4.0** | Critical |
| **Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0 Terminal Server Edition** | Critical |
| **Microsoft Windows 2000** | Critical |
| **Microsoft Windows XP** | Critical |
| **Microsoft Windows Server 2003** | Critical |

The above [assessment](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21140) is based on the types of systems that are affected by the vulnerability, their typical deployment patterns, and the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would have on them.

**Vulnerability identifier:** [CAN-2003-0818](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=can-2003-0818)

## Workarounds

None

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a [buffer overrun](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21141) vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain complete control over an affected system. An attacker could take any action on the system, including installing programs, viewing data, changing data, deleting data, or creating new accounts with full privileges.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused by an unchecked buffer in the Microsoft ASN.1 Library. If exploited, an attacker could gain system privileges on an affected system.

**What is ASN.1?**

Abstract Syntax Notation 1 (ASN.1) is a data standard that is used by many applications and devices in the technology industry for allowing the normalization and understanding of data across various platforms. ASN.1 has no direct relationship to any specific standard, encoding method, programming language, or hardware platform. It is simply a language for defining standards. Or in other words, standards are written in ASN.1.
A vulnerability exists in Microsoft's ASN.1 implementation that, if exploited, could allow an attacker to cause code to execute remotely with system privileges on an affected system. More information about ASN.1 can be found in Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [252648](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;252648).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

If successfully exploited, the attacker could be able to take any action on the system, including installing programs, viewing data, changing data, deleting data, or creating new accounts with full privileges.

**How could an attacker exploit this vulnerability?**

Because ASN.1 is a standard for many applications and devices, there are many potential attack vectors. To successfully exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must force a computer to decode malformed ASN.1 data. For example, when using authentication protocols based on ASN.1 it could be possible to construct a malformed authentication request that could expose this vulnerability.

**What systems are primarily at risk from this vulnerability?**

Server systems are at greater risk than client computers because they are more likely to have a server process running that decodes ASN.1 data.

**I'm using Windows NT 4.0. How do I know if I need this update?**

Windows NT 4.0 (Workstation, Server, and Terminal Server Edition) does not install the affected file by default. This file is installed as part of the [MS03-041](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/ms03-041) Windows NT 4.0 security update and other possible non-security-related hotfixes. If the Windows NT 4.0 security update for [MS03-041](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/ms03-041) is not installed, this may not be a required update. To verify if the affected file is installed, search for the file named Msasn1.dll. If this file is present, this security update is required. Windows Update, Software Update Services, and the Microsoft Security Baseline Analyzer will also correctly detect if this update is required.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the handling of malformed data by the ASN.1 Library.

**Verifying Update Installation**

To verify that a security update is installed on an affected system you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. The Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates as well as common security misconfigurations. For additional information about MBSA, please visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134) Web site.

You may also be able to verify the files that this security update installed by reviewing the following registry key:

HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows Server 2003\SP1\KB828028\Filelist

**Note:** This registry key may not be not created properly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 828028 security update into the Windows installation source files.
