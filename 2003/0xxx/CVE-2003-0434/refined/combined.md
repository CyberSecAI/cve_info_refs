How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

From:       [Andries.Brouwer () cwi ! nl](?a=90366101500012&r=1&w=2)
Date:       [2003-07-09 16:54:28](?l=bugtraq&r=1&w=2&b=200307)

[I sent this letter on 2003-06-28, but no letters arrived that day,
it seems. A second attempt.]

I see RedHat and Mandrake reactions to the vulnerability
in xpdf reported by Martyn Gilmore. But their updates do
not fix the problem.

They change xpdf, and make it filter out backquotes before
invoking urlCommand. I think that was unnecessary.

On the other hand, urlCommand must be very careful what it
does with the URL since it was remote-user-supplied.
A urlCommand like the default "netscape -remote 'openURL(%s)'"
is OK since the %s is protected by single quotes.

A urlCommand like the RedHat "/usr/bin/xpdf-handle-url %s"
is bad since %s is not protected and funny games are possible.
In other words, not xpdf but /etc/xpdfrc must be fixed.

Next, RedHat /usr/bin/xpdf-handle-url is bad as well, since
it does
  xterm -e sh -c "echo Edit $0 to include your URL handler; echo $1; read"
exposing the unquoted URL to sh -c.

For example, on a RedHat 8.0 system that I have here, clicking the URL
like "nailto:me; rm /tmp/abc" will remove the indicated file, also
after the fix is applied.

A testexample for playing with pdflatex:

\documentclass[11pt]{minimal}
\usepackage{color}
\usepackage[urlcolor=blue,colorlinks=true,pdfpagemode=none]{hyperref}
\begin{document}
\href{prot:hyperlink with stuff, say, `rm -rf /tmp/abc`; touch /tmp/pqr}{\textt\
t{Click me}}
\end{document}

All shell metacharacters are dangerous. Not only backquote.

## Various UNIX and Linux PDF readers/viewers execute commands embedded within hyperlinks

#### Vulnerability Note VU#200132

Original Release Date: 2003-06-18 | Last Revised: 2003-09-26

---

### Overview

A vulnerability in various UNIX and Linux PDF viewers/readers may allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands on your system.

### Description

| Adobe Systems Incorporated [describes](http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/adobepdf.html) PDF (Portable Document Format) as "a universal file format that preserves the fonts, images, graphics, and layout of any source document, regardless of the application and platform used to create it." A viewer such as [Adobe Reader](http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readermain.html) or [Xpdf](http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/about.html) is needed to view a document encoded in PDF. Various PDF viewers are widely deployed on the Internet. Quoting from the Adobe Systems Incorporated [web site](http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/adobepdf.html):  Governments and enterprises around the world have adopted PDF to streamline document management, increase productivity, and reduce reliance on paper....An open file format specification, PDF is available to anyone who wants to develop tools to create, view, or manipulate PDF documents. Indeed, more than 1,800 vendors offer PDF-based solutions, ensuring that organizations that adopt the PDF standard have a variety of tools to leverage the Portable Document Format and to customize document processes.When a victim clicks on a hyperlink contained within a malicious PDF file, an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the victim. This is possible because some UNIX and Linux PDF readers/viewers spawn external programs to handle hyperlinks by invoking the shell command interpreter. |

### Impact

| A remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the victim. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Apply a patch when available. |

### [Debian](#IAFY-5MLJXU) Affected

Notified:  May 15, 2003  Updated: May 19, 2003

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

In Debian 2.2 (potato) and Debian 3.0 (woody), the URL loading feature of xpdf is disabled per default, but the bug is present if the user explicitly changes the configuration.

In Debian 3.0 (woody), an example urlCommand is supplied (which is commented out). This example quotes the argument against interpretation of shell metacharacters:

#urlCommand "netscape -remote 'openURL(%s)'"

(though execution of other netscape -remote commands may be possible if this command is uncommented and used)

In Debian 'testing' and 'unstable' (xpdf 2.02-2), xpdf is configured to quote the argument in urlCommand:

urlCommand "sensible-browser '%s'"

### Vendor Information

The vendor has not provided us with any further information regarding this vulnerability.

### Addendum

The CERT/CC has no additional comments at this time.

### [Xpdf](#IAFY-5MQRU8) Affected

Notified:  May 20, 2003  Updated: June 17, 2003

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

A new version of Xpdf (2.02pl1) is now available on the Xpdf web site:

<http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/>

This version includes a small patch that fixes a security hole in version 2.02. It was possible to construct a malicious URL link in a PDF file which would cause an arbitrary command to be run. The patch changes things to that the various characters which can cause trouble are escaped (%xx) before calling system(). This patch also changes the "launch" link verification dialog to provide a scrolling view of the command about to be run when the command string is excessively long.

This security hole (and the patch) only affect the Unix viewer -- they do not affect the command tools on Unix, Windows, or other operating systems.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
