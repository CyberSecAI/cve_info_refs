{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the way some PDF viewers/readers handle hyperlinks, specifically the execution of external programs to handle them. These programs are invoked by a shell command interpreter, which can lead to arbitrary command execution if the URL contains shell metacharacters.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unsanitized user-supplied input (URL) being passed to a shell interpreter.",
      "Lack of proper input validation/escaping of shell metacharacters within hyperlinks.",
      "Use of a vulnerable default urlCommand in xpdfrc file",
       "Vulnerable urlCommand configuration in RedHat which executes the URL via `sh -c` without proper quoting"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the victim's system with the privileges of the user running the PDF viewer. This could lead to complete system compromise.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A malicious actor crafts a PDF document with a hyperlink containing shell metacharacters.",
      "The user opens the malicious PDF and clicks on the crafted hyperlink.",
        "The PDF viewer uses a vulnerable configuration to open the URL by passing it to a shell interpreter without proper escaping or quoting."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a PDF document with a maliciously crafted hyperlink. The victim needs to be using a vulnerable PDF viewer/reader and click the hyperlink.",
    "additional_info": "The vulnerability is present in various UNIX and Linux PDF viewers/readers. Patches and configuration changes are needed to resolve this issue. Some vendors, like Apple, claim to not be affected. The vulnerability is not present in Windows or Macintosh versions of Adobe Reader. The vulnerability affects the xpdf viewer and some distributions where the xpdf is configured to use the urlCommand without proper quoting. Some distributions may be using a safe default, or have disabled the feature by default, but the vulnerability may be present if the user modifies the configuration."
