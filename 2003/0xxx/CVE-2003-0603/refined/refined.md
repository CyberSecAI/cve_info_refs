Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**1. Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities in Default Templates**

*   **Root Cause:**  Untrusted user-submitted data was not properly filtered for HTML metacharacters before being output in HTML templates.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Lack of proper input sanitization/output encoding in HTML templates.
*   **Impact:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the web page, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities on a user's browser.
*   **Attack Vector:** Submitting specially crafted data via Bugzilla forms that is then displayed in the output templates.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to submit data to Bugzilla (e.g., create/modify bug reports).

**2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability in Local Dependency Graphs**

*   **Root Cause:** Bug summaries were not properly escaped before being placed in the ALT and NAME attributes of AREA tags within the generated client-side image map for dependency graphs.
*  **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Lack of proper output encoding when generating the image map for the local dependency graphs feature.
*   **Impact:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts by including a script in a specifically formatted manner as part of a bug summary.
*   **Attack Vector:** Submitting a bug summary with malicious script and generating the graph.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to submit bug reports with specific content and that the "webdotbase" configuration parameter contains a local pathname to an installation of "dot".

**3. Insecure Handling of Temporary Filenames**

*   **Root Cause:** Bugzilla created temporary files in world- or group-writable directories without verifying if the filename was unused.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Race condition vulnerability where temporary file names are not checked to ensure uniqueness prior to use.
*   **Impact:** A local user could create a symlink with the same name as the temporary file, pointing to another file the web server has access to and thus cause Bugzilla to overwrite that file.
*   **Attack Vector:** Local access to the server with write permissions to the directory where temporary files are created.
*    **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Local server access, the ability to create symlinks, and knowledge of the temporary file names generated by Bugzilla.
