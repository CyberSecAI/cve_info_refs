## Apple QuickTime Player for Windows contains buffer overflow in processing of overly long QuickTime URLs

#### Vulnerability Note VU#112553

Original Release Date: 2003-04-01 | Last Revised: 2003-04-01

---

### Overview

Apple's [QuickTime Player](http://www.apple.com/quicktime/) is a player for files and streaming media in the QuickTime format. Versions of the player are available for both the Microsoft Windows and Apple MacOS platforms. A flaw in the version for Windows could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| A buffer overflow exists in the QuickTime Player for Windows' handling of overly long URL of the type quicktime://... A specially crafted URL consisting of a long string of characters can cause the QuickTime Player to crash or allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code of their choosing with the privileges of the user running the QuickTime Player.  The URL containing the exploit code may be hosted on a webpage, introduced via HTML email, or presented to the user in another fashion that encourages them to browse to it. |
| --- |

### Impact

| If the QuickTime player software is instructed to load a URL that is specially crafted by an attacker, arbitrary code can be executed under the privileges of the QuickTime user. This crafted URL may be supplied on a webpage or in email for the victim to select, or some other means designed to encourage them to invoke the QuickTime Player using the exploit URL. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply a patch from the vendor**Apple has released a patch to address this vulnerability; please see the vendor section of this document for further details. |
| --- |

| Removing the QuickTime handler from the web browser or removing the HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT/quicktime registry key may prevent automatic exploitation through HTML pages. |
