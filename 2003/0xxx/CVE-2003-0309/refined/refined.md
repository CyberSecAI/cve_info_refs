Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2003-0309:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Internet Explorer handles multiple file download dialogs. Specifically, when a user clicks a link to a file, a download confirmation dialog is presented. However, by flooding Internet Explorer with a large number of file download requests, the browser fails to handle them correctly, eventually bypassing the dialog and executing the file without user intervention.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper handling of multiple file download dialogs leading to a bypass of user confirmation.
- A resource exhaustion issue caused by excessive download requests.
- Lack of sufficient checks to prevent multiple simultaneous file download dialogs from overwhelming the browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary code execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on a user's system with the privileges of the user by tricking the user into visiting a malicious webpage.
- **Denial of Service:** Resource exhaustion due to the large number of download requests could cause a denial of service, potentially crashing the browser.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious web page:** An attacker can host a specially crafted webpage that triggers the vulnerability by generating a large number of file download requests. When a user visits this webpage, the exploit is triggered.
- **HTML email:** An attacker can craft an HTML email that attempts to exploit the vulnerability, leading to code execution if the email is opened by the user in a vulnerable environment.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to create and host a malicious web page or craft a malicious HTML email.
- Capability to lure or trick a user into visiting the malicious web page or opening the crafted email, without any further user interaction, to trigger the exploit.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects Internet Explorer versions 5.01, 5.5, and 6.0, including the version for Windows Server 2003.
- Microsoft addressed this vulnerability with a cumulative patch described in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS03-020.
- By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 runs in Enhanced Security Configuration, which mitigates this vulnerability. However, if this configuration is disabled, the system becomes vulnerable.
- The vulnerability is identified as CAN-2003-0309 (now CVE-2003-0309).
- The CERT vulnerability note (VU#251788) and Microsoft Security Bulletin MS03-020 provide further information on this vulnerability and its fix.
- The vulnerability can be mitigated by disabling file downloads via Internet Explorer settings.
