How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS03-020 - Critical

## Cumulative Patch for Internet Explorer (818529)

Published: June 04, 2003 | Updated: June 04, 2003

**Version:** 1.1

**Originally posted:** June 4, 2003

#### Summary

**Who should read this bulletin:**
Customers using MicrosoftÂ® Internet Explorer

**Impact of vulnerability:**
Allow an attacker to execute code on a user's system

**Maximum Severity Rating:**
Critical

**Recommendation:**
System administrators should install the patch immediately

**End User Bulletin:**
An end user version of this bulletin is available at:

[https:](https://).

**Affected Software:**

* Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.01
* Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.5
* Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0
* Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0 for Windows Server 2003

### General Information

## Technical details

**Technical description:**

This is a cumulative patch that includes the functionality of all previously released patches for Internet Explorer 5.01, 5.5 and 6.0. In addition, it eliminates two newly discovered vulnerabilities:

* A buffer overrun vulnerability that occurs because Internet Explorer does not properly determine an object type returned from a web server. It could be possible for an attacker who exploited this vulnerability to run arbitrary code on a user's system. If a user visited an attacker's website, it would be possible for the attacker to exploit this vulnerability without any other user action. An attacker could also craft an HTML email that attempted to exploit this vulnerability.
* A flaw that results because Internet Explorer does not implement an appropriate block on a file download dialog box. It could be possible for an attacker to exploit this vulnerability to run arbitrary code on a user's system. If a user simply visited an attacker's website, it would be possible for the attacker to exploit this vulnerability without any other user action. An attacker could also craft an HTML email that attempted to exploit this vulnerability.

In order to exploit these flaws, the attacker would have to create a specially formed HTML email and send it to the user. Alternatively an attacker would have to host a malicious web site that contained a web page designed to exploit these vulnerabilities. The attacker would then have to persuade a user to visit that site.

As with the previous Internet Explorer cumulative patches released with bulletins [MS03-004](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/ms03-004) and [MS03-015](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/ms03-015), this cumulative patch will cause window.showHelp( ) to cease to function if you have not applied the HTML Help update. If you have installed the updated HTML Help control from Knowledge Base article [811630](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;811630), you will still be able to use HTML Help functionality after applying this patch.

**Mitigating factors:** The following mitigating factors apply to both vulnerabilities discussed in this bulletin:

* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 runs in [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=d41b036c-e2e1-4960-99bb-9757f7e9e31b&displaylang;=en). This default configuration of Internet Explorer blocks these attacks. If Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration has been disabled, the protections put in place that prevent these vulnerabilities from being exploited would be removed.
* In the Web based attack scenario, the attacker would have to host a web site that contained a web page used to exploit these vulnerabilities. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious web site outside of the HTML email vector. Instead, the attacker would need to lure them there, typically by getting them to click on a link that would take them to the attacker's site.
* Code that executed on the system would only run under the privileges of the logged in user.

**Severity Rating:**

|  | Internet Explorer 5.01 SP3 | Internet Explorer 5.5 SP2 | Internet Explorer 6.0 Gold | Internet Explorer 6.0 SP1 | Internet Explorer 6.0 for Windows Server 2003 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Object Tag Vulnerability** | Critical | Critical | Critical | Critical | Moderate |
| **File Download Dialog Vulnerability** | Critical | Critical | Critical | Critical | Moderate |

The above [assessment](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21140) is based on the types of systems affected by the vulnerability, their typical deployment patterns, and the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would have on them. The moderate severity rating on Windows Server 2003 is based on Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.

**Vulnerability identifier:**

* Object Tag Vulnerability: [CAN-2003-0344](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=can-2003-0344)
* File Download Dialog Vulnerability: [CAN-2003-0309](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=can-2003-0309)

**Tested Versions:**

Internet Explorer versions 5.01 Service Pack 3, Internet Explorer 5.5 SP2, Internet Explorer 6.0, Internet Explorer 6.0 SP1, and Internet Explorer 6.0 for Windows Server 2003 were tested for these vulnerabilities. Previous versions are no longer [supported](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742), and may or may not be affected by these vulnerabilities. More information is available from the [Windows Operating System Components Lifecycles Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21136)

## Frequently asked questions

**What vulnerabilities are eliminated by this patch?**

This is a cumulative patch that incorporates the functionality of all previously released patches for Internet Explorer. In addition, the patch eliminates two newly reported vulnerabilities that could allow an attacker to cause arbitrary code to run on the user's system.

**CAN-2003-0344: Object Tag Vulnerability**

**What's the scope of the first vulnerability?**

This is a [buffer overrun](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/glossary) vulnerability. If an attacker were to successfully exploit this vulnerability, then Internet Explorer could allow arbitrary code to execute in the context of the logged on user, should the user visit a site under the attacker's control.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability results because of an unchecked buffer that can be encountered when Internet Explorer handles an Object tag in a web page.

**What's wrong with the way Internet Explorer handles object tags?**

There is a flaw in the way Internet Explorer determines an object type. Internet Explorer does not conduct a proper parameter check while determining an object's type, and it is therefore possible to cause a buffer overrun. The resulting buffer overrun could cause Internet Explorer to fail or could allow an attacker to run arbitrary code on a user's machine.

**What could this vulnerability enable an attacker to do?**

This vulnerability could enable an attacker to cause Internet Explorer to fail in such a way that it would execute code of the attacker's choice. This would allow an attacker to take any action on a user's system in the security context of the currently logged in user.

**How could an attacker exploit this vulnerability?**

An attacker could seek to exploit this vulnerability by hosting a specially constructed web page. If the user visited this web page, Internet Explorer could fail and could allow arbitrary code to execute in the context of the user. Alternatively, an attacker could also craft an HTML email that attempted to exploit this vulnerability.

**What does the patch do?**

The patch addresses the vulnerabilities by ensuring that Internet Explorer performs proper checks when determining object types in a web page.

**CAN-2003-0309: File Download Dialog Vulnerability**

**What's the scope of the second vulnerability?**

This is a flooding vulnerability. This vulnerability results from Internet Explorer being flooded with a large number of requests at once. If an attacker were to successfully exploit this vulnerability then Internet Explorer could execute arbitrary code under the context of the logged on user.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability results because of a flaw in the way Internet Explorer handles multiple file download dialogs.

**What's wrong with the way Internet Explorer handles multiple file download dialogs?**

When a user clicks on a link to a file in Internet Explorer, a file download confirmation dialog is presented to the user to allow the user to save the file locally, open the file, or cancel the request. There is a flaw in Internet Explorer that can cause it to open the file when a web page opens multiple file download dialogs. Opening a downloaded file could allow an attacker to cause arbitrary code to run on a user's machine.

**What could this vulnerability enable an attacker to do?**

This vulnerability could enable an attacker to cause Internet Explorer to fail in such a way that it would execute code of the attacker's choice. This would allow an attacker to take any action on a user's system in the security context of the currently logged in user.

**How could an attacker exploit this vulnerability?**

An attacker could seek to exploit this vulnerability by hosting a specially constructed web page. If the user visited this web page, Internet Explorer could fail and could allow arbitrary code to execute in the context of the user. An attacker could also craft an HTML email that attempted to exploit this vulnerability.

**What does the patch do?**

The patch addresses the vulnerability by ensuring that Internet Explorer properly handles multiple file download dialogs.

**I am running Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003. Does this mitigate these vulnerabilities?**

Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 runs in a restricted mode known as Enhanced Security Configuration. Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured Internet Explorer settings that reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running malicious Web content on a server. Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration reduces this risk by modifying numerous security-related settings, including Security and Advanced tab settings in Internet Options. Some of the key modifications include:

* Security level for the Internet zone is set to High. This setting disables scripts, ActiveX controls, Microsoft virtual machine (Microsoft VM), HTML content, and file downloads.
* Automatic detection of intranet sites is disabled. This setting assigns all intranet Web sites and all Universal Naming Convention (UNC) paths that are not explicitly listed in the Local intranet zone to the Internet zone.
* Install on Demand and non-Microsoft browser extensions are disabled. This setting prevents Web pages from automatically installing components and prevents non-Microsoft extensions from running.
* Multimedia content is disabled. This setting prevents music, animations, and video clips from running.

Disabling Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration would remove the protections put in place that prevent these vulnerabilities from being exploited. For more information regarding Internet Explorer Enhanced security Configuration, please consult the Managing Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration guide, which can be found at the following location:

**Is there any configuration of Windows Server 2003 that is likely to have Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration Disabled?**

Yes. Systems Administrators who have deployed Windows Server 2003 as a Terminal Servers would likely disable Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration to allow users of the Terminal Server to utilize Internet Explorer in an unrestricted mode.

**Why does this patch affect HTML Help Functionality?**

Because this is a cumulative patch, it includes a fix from a previous patch for Internet Explorer that addressed a vulnerability by ensuring that the correct cross domain security checks take place whenever [showHelp()](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms536758.aspx) functionality is used. This fix caused the HTML Help functionality to fail unless a subsequent update was applied as described in Knowledge Base article [811630](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;811630). In order to restore HTML Help functionality, users who apply this patch are encouraged to download and install the update to HTML Help after applying this cumulative patch if they have not already done so.

**I installed the update from Knowledge Base article** [**811630**](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;811630)**. After installing this patch will HTML Help function properly?**

Yes - If you previously installed the HTML Help patch from Knowledge Base article [811630](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;811630) when you applied the IE cumulative update from [MS03-004](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/ms03-004) or [MS03-015](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/ms03-015) (which supercedes MS03-004), you do not need to reinstall the HTML Help update.

**What is HTML Help shortcut functionality?**

When a user browses help files, it is possible for HTML Help to create a shortcut when a user clicks a specific word, phrase, or graphic in a help topic. While this functionality is not a vulnerability in itself, when combined with cross domain security vulnerabilities such as those addressed by Microsoft Security Bulletin MS03-004, this functionality could allow an attacker to run code of the attacker's choice on a user's system. HTML Help has been updated to reduce the risk from this attack vector and to provide defense in depth against this type of attack. To learn more about this functionality, please see </https:>[https:](https://).

**If I only apply this patch, will I be protected from the HTML Help shortcut vulnerability?**

Yes, you will be protected from the vulnerability affecting the use of showHelp in Internet Explorer. However, it's important to note this patch disables showHelp in order to block the attack vector that might allow a malicious web site operator to launch an executable file already on a user's local system. In order to restore the full functionality of showHelp, users must install the latest version of HTML Help that is discussed in Microsoft Knowledge Base article [811630](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;811630).

**Will HTML Help functionality change when I download the new version of HTML Help?**

When the latest version of HTML Help is installed, the following limitations will be encountered when a help file is opened with the showHelp method:

* Only supported protocols can be used with showHelp to open a web page or help (chm) file.
* The shortcut function supported by HTML Help will be disabled when the help file is opened with showHelp This change will not affect the shortcut function if the user opens the same CHM file manually by double-clicking on it, or by invoking an application on the local system that uses the HTMLHELP( ) API.

**Where is the updated HTML Help located?**

Users can find the updated HTML Help on Windows Update or by following the link included in Microsoft Knowledge Base article [811630](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;811630).

**Does the patch for this vulnerability include the updated HTML Help?**

No - Users should download and install the HTML Help update ([811630](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;811630)) separately from one of the locations discussed above.

## Microsoft Internet Explorer does not safely handle multiple file download requests

#### Vulnerability Note VU#251788

Original Release Date: 2003-05-16 | Last Revised: 2006-12-08

---

### Overview

A problem in the way Microsoft Internet Explorer handles a large number of file download requests could result in the execution of arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| When Internet Explorer (IE) follows a link to an executable file (.exe), a dialog window is displayed that prompts the user to open the file, save the file, or cancel the operation. When handling a sufficiently large number of file download requests, IE eventually fails to display the dialog window and executes the specified file without user intervention. A dialog is displayed for each download request, and it may be possible to terminate the IE process before the file is executed. Publicly available examples use large numbers of frames (FRAME or IFRAME elements) to generate download requests.  Other software that uses the WebBrowser ActiveX control may be affected.Microsoft has addressed this vulnerability in Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS03-020](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS03-020.asp). |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker who is able to convince a user to access a specially crafted HTML document, such as an Internet web page or HTML email message, could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user. Resource exhaustion caused by the large number of download requests could also cause a denial of service. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply Patch**Apply [Q818529](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/downloads/critical/818529/default.asp) or a more recent cumulative patch. See Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS03-020](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS03-020.asp) for more information. |
| --- |

| **Disable File Downloads**To manually disable file downloads for the current user:Tools --> Internet Options --> Security tab --> (select zone) --> Custom Level --> Downloads --> File download --> DisableThe file download option is set on a per-user, per-zone basis. The following registry value controls the file download setting for the current user in the Internet Zone:HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\Zones\3\1803Setting this value to 3 disables file downloads in the Internet Zone for the currently logged on user. Details about security zone registry settings can be found in Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [182569](http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=182569). More information about IE security zones is available in [*Introduction to URL Security Zones*](http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/security/szone/overview/overview.asp).Configure Outlook and Outlook Express to open email messages in the Restricted Sites Zone, where file downloads are disabled by default. This change can be made manually or as part of the Outlook Email Security Update for [Outlook 98](http://office.microsoft.com/downloads/9798/Out98sec.aspx) and [Outlook 2000](http://office.microsoft.com/downloads/2000/Out2ksec.aspx). Outlook 2002 and Outlook Express 6 use the Restricted Sites Zone and by default.Note that a different vulnerability could allow the file download restriction in Outlook and Outlook Express to be bypassed. If file downloads are disabled in the zone used by Outlook and Outlook Express but enabled in the zone containing the attacker's executable file, a specially crafted email message could generate enough download requests to execute the attacker's file. It is important to disable file downloads in both the zone used by Outlook and Outlook Express and the zone(s) used by IE to browse untrusted sites. |
