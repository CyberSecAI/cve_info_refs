### Overview

KDE Personal Information Management suite "kdepim" contains a buffer overflow vulnerability. Exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to the arbitrary execution of commands.

### Description

| KDE Personal Information Management suite shipped with KDE versions 3.1.0 through 3.1.4 contains a buffer overflow vulnerability in the processing of VCF files.  If an attacker can trick a victim into opening a specially crafted .VCF file, the attacker may be able to gain information about a victim's data or execute arbitrary commands with the victim's privileges. This vulnerability may also be remotely exploited if the victim has previews for remote files enabled, however this feature is disabled by default. |

### Impact

| An attacker may be able to gain information about a victim's data or execute arbitrary commands with the victim's privileges. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Upgrade to KDE version [3.1.5](http://download.kde.org/download.php?url=stable/3.1.5/) or apply the patch to version 3.1.4. |

has assigned the name CAN-2003-0988 to this issue.
3. Impact:
A carefully crafted .VCF file potentially enables local attackers
to compromise the privacy of a victim's data or execute
arbitrary commands with the victim's privileges.
By default, file information reading is disabled for remote files.
However, if previews are enabled for remote files, remote
attackers may be able to compromise the victim's account.
4. Solution:
As a workaround, remove the kfile\_vcf.desktop file.
Users of KDE 3.1.x are advised to upgrade to KDE 3.1.5. A patch for
KDE 3.1.4 is available for users who are unable to upgrade to
KDE 3.1.5.
5. Patch:
A patch for KDE 3.1.4 is available from
ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/security\_patches :
