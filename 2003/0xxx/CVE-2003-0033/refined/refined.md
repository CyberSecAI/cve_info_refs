{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The RPC decoder in Snort incorrectly checks the lengths of what is being normalized against the current packet size when processing fragmented RPC records.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can execute arbitrary code as the user running the Snort process (typically root).",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending crafted network packets to any host monitored by Snort."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to a network segment monitored by a vulnerable Snort instance."
  },
  "affected_versions": [
    "Snort versions 1.8 through 1.9.0 and 2.0 beta"
  ],
  "fixes": [
    "Upgrade to Snort version 1.9.1",
    "Disable the rpc_decode preprocessor in the snort.conf configuration file.",
     "Block outbound traffic from the Snort sensor to limit the attacker's capabilities after successful exploitation."
  ],
  "additional_information": "The RPC preprocessor is enabled by default. The vulnerability can be exploited by sending packets to any host on the network monitored by Snort, not necessarily the Snort sensor itself."
