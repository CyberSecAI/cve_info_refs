## Buffer overflow in Snort RPC preprocessor

#### Vulnerability Note VU#916785

Original Release Date: 2003-03-03 | Last Revised: 2003-05-20

---

### Overview

There is a buffer overflow vulnerability in the RPC preprocessing feature of Snort versions 1.8 through 1.9.0 and 2.0 beta.

### Description

| Martin Roesch, the primary Snort developer, described the vulnerability by saying:  When the RPC decoder normalizes fragmented RPC records, it incorrectly checks the lengths of what is being normalized against the current packet size, leading to an overflow condition. The RPC preprocessor is enabled by default.The ISS X-Force team has published an advisory with additional information on this issue:<http://www.iss.net/issEn/delivery/xforce/alertdetail.jsp?oid=21951>Information about this vulnerability can also be found on the Snort web site at:<http://www.snort.org/> |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker can execute arbitrary code as the user running the Snort process, usually root. The attacker does not need to send packets directly to the Snort sensor. It is sufficient to send packets to any of the hosts on the network monitored by Snort. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade to Snort version 1.9.1**  Upgrade to Snort version 1.9.1 to correct this vulnerability. This version of snort is available at:   <http://www.snort.org/dl/snort-1.9.1.tar.gz> |
| --- |

| **Disable the rpc\_decode preprocessor**You can prevent exploitation of this vulnerability by commenting out the rpc\_decode preprocessor in the "snort.conf" configuration file. Note that this change may affect your ability to correctly process RPC record fragments.**Block outbound packets from Snort IDS systems**You may be able limit an attacker's capabilities if the system is compromised by blocking all outbound traffic from the Snort sensor. While this workaround will not prevent exploitation of the vulnerability, it may make it more difficult for the attacker to create a useful exploit. |

Package        : snort
Vulnerability  : integer overflow, buffer overflow
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Ids        : CAN-2003-0033 CAN-2003-0209
CERT advisories: VU#139129 VU#916785
Bugtraq Ids    : 7178 6963

Two vulnerabilities have been discoverd in Snort, a popular network
intrusion detection system.  Snort comes with modules and plugins that
perform a variety of functions such as protocol analysis.  The
following issues have been identified:

Heap overflow in Snort "stream4" preprocessor
(VU#139129, CAN-2003-0209, Bugtraq Id 7178)

Researchers at CORE Security Technologies have discovered a
remotely exploitable inteter overflow that results in overwriting
the heap in the "stream4" preprocessor module.  This module allows
Snort to reassemble TCP packet fragments for further analysis.  An
attacker could insert arbitrary code that would be executed as
the user running Snort, probably root.

Buffer overflow in Snort RPC preprocessor
(VU#916785, CAN-2003-0033, Bugtraq Id 6963)

Researchers at Internet Security Systems X-Force have discovered a
remotely exploitable buffer overflow in the Snort RPC preprocessor
module.  Snort incorrectly checks the lengths of what is being
normalized against the current packet size.  An attacker could
exploit this to execute arbitrary code under the privileges of the
Snort process, probably root.

For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.8.4beta1-3.1.

The old stable distribution (potato) is not affected by these problems
since it doesn't contain the problematic code.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.0-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your snort package immediately.

You are also advised to upgrade to the most recent version of Snort,
since Snort, as any intrusion detection system, is rather useless if
it is based on old and out-dated data and not kept up to date.  Such
installations would be unable to detect intrusions using modern
methods.  The current version of Snort is 2.0.0, while the version in
the stable distribution (1.8) is quite old and the one in the old
stable distribution is beyond hope.

Since Debian does not update arbitrary packages in stable releases,
even Snort is not going to see updates other than to fix security
problems, you are advised to upgrade to the most recent version from
third party sources.

The Debian maintainer for Snort provides backported up-to-date
packages for woody (stable) and potato (oldstable) for cases where you
cannot upgrade your entire system.  These packages are untested,
though and only exist for the i386 architecture:

deb     <http://people.debian.org/~ssmeenk/snort-stable-i386/> ./
deb-src <http://people.debian.org/~ssmeenk/snort-stable-i386/> ./

deb     <http://people.debian.org/~ssmeenk/snort-oldstable-i386/> ./
deb-src <http://people.debian.org/~ssmeenk/snort-oldstable-i386/> ./

- - - ---------------------------------------------------------------------

PACKAGE : snort
SUMMARY : Multiple Vulnerabilities in Snort Preprocessors
DATE : 2003-04-28 07:07 UTC
EXPLOIT : remote
VERSIONS AFFECTED : <snort-2.0.0
FIXED VERSION : >=snort-2.0.0
CVE : CAN-2003-0209 CAN-2003-0033

- - - ---------------------------------------------------------------------

New (and correct) ID and updated CVE link.

- - From advisories:

"The Sourcefire Vulnerability Research Team has learned of an integer overflow
in the Snort stream4 preprocessor used by the Sourcefire Network Sensor
product line. The Snort stream4 preprocessor (spp\_stream4) incorrectly
calculates segment size parameters during stream reassembly for certain
sequence number ranges which can lead to an integer overflow that can be
expanded to a heap overflow.

The Snort stream4 flaw may lead to a denial of service (DoS) attack or
remote command execution on a host running Snort. This attack can be launched
by crafting TCP stream packets and transmitting them over a network segment
that is being monitored by a vulnerable Snort implementation. In its
default configuration, certain versions of snort are vulnerable to this
attack, as is the default configuration of the Snort IDS."

"Remote attackers may exploit the buffer overflow condition to run
arbitrary code on a Snort sensor with the privileges of the Snort IDS
process, which typically runs as the superuser. The vulnerable
preprocessor is enabled by default. It is not necessary to establish an
actual connection to a RPC portmapper service to exploit this
vulnerability."

Snort Vulnerability Advisory [SNORT-2003-001]

Date: 2003-03-03

Affected Snort Versions:

Any version starting with version 1.8 to those before 2003-03-03 1PM/
US/Eastern including 1.9.0 and CVS HEAD (Snort 2.0beta)

Synopsis:

A buffer overflow has been found in the snort RPC normalization
routines by ISS X-Force.  This can cause snort to execute arbitrary
code embedded within sniffed network packets. This preprocessor is
enabled by default.

Snort 1.9.1 has been released to resolve this issue. For users using
CVS HEAD, a fix has been committed to the source tree.

Mitigation:

If you are in an environment that can not upgrade snort immediately,
comment out the line in your snort.conf that begins:

preprocessor rpc\_decode

and replace it with

# preprocessor rpc\_decode

Details:

When the rpc decoder normalizes fragmented RPC records, it incorrectly
checks the lengths of what is being normalized against the current
packet size.

The rpc decoder in Snort 1.9.1 and above contains new alert options
that can be used to help detect this attack

Option                    Default State

alert\_fragments           INACTIVE
alert\_large\_fragments     ACTIVE
alert\_incomplete          ACTIVE
alert\_multiple\_requests   ACTIVE

The first option will alert on any rpc fragmented record it finds.
Large fragments will alert when the reassembled fragment record will
exceed the current packet length.  The incomplete record will alert
when there is a partial record found.  The alert\_multiple\_requests will
alert when we find more than one RPC request per packet ( or
reassembled packet ).

Download Locations:

Sourcefire has acquired additional bandwidth and hosting to aid users
wishing to upgrade their Snort implementation.  Binaries are currently
not available, this is a source release only at this time.  As new
binaries become available they will be added to the site.

Source code: <http://www.snort.org/dl/snort-1.9.1.tar.gz>
GPG Signatures: <http://www.snort.org/dl/snort-1.9.1.tar.gz.asc>

CVS HEAD (Snort 2.0beta)  has been fixed as well.

GENTOO LINUX SECURITY ANNOUNCEMENT 200304-06
- - - ---------------------------------------------------------------------

          PACKAGE : snort
          SUMMARY : Multiple Vulnerabilities in Snort Preprocessors
             DATE : 2003-04-28 07:07 UTC
          EXPLOIT : remote
VERSIONS AFFECTED : <snort-2.0.0
    FIXED VERSION : >=snort-2.0.0
              CVE : CAN-2003-0209 CAN-2003-0033

- - - ---------------------------------------------------------------------

New (and correct) ID and updated CVE link.

- - From advisories:

"The Sourcefire Vulnerability Research Team has learned of an integer overflow
in the Snort stream4 preprocessor used by the Sourcefire Network Sensor
product line. The Snort stream4 preprocessor (spp_stream4) incorrectly
calculates segment size parameters during stream reassembly for certain
sequence number ranges which can lead to an integer overflow that can be
expanded to a heap overflow.

The Snort stream4 flaw may lead to a denial of service (DoS) attack or
remote command execution on a host running Snort. This attack can be launched
by crafting TCP stream packets and transmitting them over a network segment
that is being monitored by a vulnerable Snort implementation. In its
default configuration, certain versions of snort are vulnerable to this
attack, as is the default configuration of the Snort IDS."

"Remote attackers may exploit the buffer overflow condition to run
arbitrary code on a Snort sensor with the privileges of the Snort IDS
process, which typically runs as the superuser. The vulnerable
preprocessor is enabled by default. It is not necessary to establish an
actual connection to a RPC portmapper service to exploit this
vulnerability."

Read the full advisories at:
<http://www.coresecurity.com/common/showdoc.php?idx=313&idxseccion=10>
<http://www.iss.net/issEn/delivery/xforce/alertdetail.jsp?oid=21951>
<http://www.snort.org/advisories/snort-2003-04-16-1.txt>

SOLUTION

It is recommended that all Gentoo Linux users who are running
net-analyzer/snort upgrade to snort-2.0.0 as follows:

emerge sync
emerge snort
emerge clean

## History

The CERT Division is the birthplace of cybersecurity. For nearly 30 years, the CERT Division of the SEI has partnered with government, industry, law enforcement, and academia to advance cybersecurity and improve the security and resilience of computer systems and networks.

Originally focused on incident response, we have expanded into cybersecurity areas such as network situational awareness, malicious code analysis, secure coding, resilience management, insider threats, digital investigations and intelligence, workforce development, DevOps, forensics, software assurance, vulnerability discovery and analysis, and risk management.

## Former Director Richard Pethia

[Richard Pethia](/about/leadership/display.cfm?customel_datapageid_2623=3545) was founding director of the SEI's CERT Division. Pethia, who served as director of CERT from 1988 to 2016, guided the organization through tremendous growth and change. Under Pethia's leadership, the unit expanded and evolved from the CERT Coordination Center—a small group focused on computer incident response—to a research organization of more than 200 professionals dedicated to solving problems with widespread cybersecurity implications.

Anyone using Snort might want to have a look at the latest ISS Advisory. There
is a vulnerability in Snort 1.8.0 - 1.9.0 in the RPC preprocessor, which may
ultimately allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable
host.

GENTOO LINUX SECURITY ANNOUNCEMENT 200303-6.1
- - - ---------------------------------------------------------------------

          PACKAGE : snort
          SUMMARY : buffer overflow
             DATE : 2003-03-06 10:59 UTC
          EXPLOIT : remote
VERSIONS AFFECTED : <1.9.1
    FIXED VERSION : =>1.9.1
              CVE : CAN-2003-0033

- - - ---------------------------------------------------------------------

- - From advisory:

"Remote attackers may exploit the buffer overflow condition to run
arbitrary code on a Snort sensor with the privileges of the Snort IDS
process, which typically runs as the superuser. The vulnerable
preprocessor is enabled by default. It is not necessary to establish
an actual connection to a RPC portmapper service to exploit this
vulnerability."

Read the full advisory at:
<http://www.iss.net/issEn/delivery/xforce/alertdetail.jsp?oid=21951>

SOLUTION

It is recommended that all Gentoo Linux users who are running
net-analyzer/snort upgrade to snort-1.9.1 as follows:

emerge sync
emerge -u snort
emerge clean
