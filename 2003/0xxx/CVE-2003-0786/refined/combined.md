Subject: Portable OpenSSH Security Advisory: sshpam.adv
This document can be found at: http://www.openssh.com/txt/sshpam.adv
1. Versions affected:
Portable OpenSSH versions 3.7p1 and 3.7.1p1 contain multiple
vulnerabilities in the new PAM code. At least one of these bugs
is remotely exploitable (under a non-standard configuration,
with privsep disabled).
The OpenBSD releases of OpenSSH do not contain this code and
are not vulnerable. Older versions of portable OpenSSH are not
vulnerable.
2. Solution:
Upgrade to Portable OpenSSH 3.7.1p2 or disable PAM
support ("UsePam no" in sshd\_config).
Due to complexity, inconsistencies in the specification and
differences between vendors' PAM implementations we recommend
that PAM be left disabled in sshd\_config unless there is a need
for its use. Sites only using public key or simple password
authentication usually have little need to enable PAM support.

## OpenSSH PAM challenge authentication failure

#### Vulnerability Note VU#602204

Original Release Date: 2003-09-23 | Last Revised: 2003-09-24

---

### Overview

There is a vulnerability in the challenge authentication code of the Portable OpenSSH server when using the SSHv1 protocol and Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM). This vulnerability could permit a remote attacker to log in to the system as any user, including potentially root, without using a password.

### Description

| There is a vulnerability in the challenge authentication code of the Portable OpenSSH server when using the SSHv1 protocol and Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM). Versions 3.7p1 and 3.7.1p1 are affected. Note that the OpenBSD-specific releases are not affected by this issue.  Remote attackers could exploit servers configured with the following parameters:     + OpenSSH 3.7.1p1 (portable) + Any platform + compiled with --with-pam + PrivilegeSeparation disabled + Protocol version 1 enabled (default) + ChallengeResponse enabled (default)  Note that this affects systems with password authentication disabled but challenge-response authentication still enabled. This does not to affect systems using SSHv2, but many systems are configured to fall back to SSHv1 if SSHv2 is not supported by the client. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker could potentially log in to the system as any user, including root, using a null password. The root user can only be logged into if "PermitRootLogin" is enabled. |
| --- |

### Solution

| OpenSSH has [announced](http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=openbsd-misc&m=106432248311634&w=2) version 3.7.1p2 to resolve this issue. |
| --- |

| This issue can be mitigated by not using PAM. Set "UsePAM no" in sshd\_config. To prevent root logins, Set "PermitRootLogin no". |
