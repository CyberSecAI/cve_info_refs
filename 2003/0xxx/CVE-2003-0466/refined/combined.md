## realpath(3) function contains off-by-one buffer overflow

#### Vulnerability Note VU#743092

Original Release Date: 2003-07-31 | Last Revised: 2003-08-15

---

### Overview

A function originally derived from 4.4BSD, realpath(3), contains a vulnerability that may permit a malicious user to gain root access to the server. This function was derived from the FreeBSD 3.x tree. Other applications and operating systems that use or were derived from this code base may be affected. This problem was originally reported to affect WU-FTPd. It has been discoved to affect various BSD implementations as well.

### Description

| Several BSD operating systems and WU-FTPd are vulnerable to an off-by-one buffer overflow vulnerability. The vulnerable code is in the realpath(3) function and exploitation may be made through the use of several commands. Details of the vulnerability related to WU-FTPd can be found in the [security advisory](http://isec.pl/vulnerabilities/isec-0011-wu-ftpd.txt) released by isec.pl. According to their advisory:  Linux 2.2.x and some early 2.4.x kernel versions defines PATH\_MAX to be 4095 characters, thus only wu-ftpd binaries compiled on 2.0.x or later 2.4.xkernels are affected.Upon further investigation, it has been determined that the vulnerable WU-FTPd function was derived from code in the FreeBSD 3.x tree. This code appears to have come from 4.4BSD. Therefore, other applications and operating systems that use or were derived from this code base may be affected. This problem was originally reported to affect WU-FTPd. It has been discoved to affect various BSD implementations as well. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A malicious user may be able to exploit this vulnerability to gain elevated privileges on the vulnerable server. Malicious users may be authenticated to the server, or may be an anonymous user with write access to the server. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Please check the Systems Affected section for patches and upgrades to resolve this issue. |
| --- |

| To help mitigate a remote attacker from exploiting this issue, and as a general practice, do not permit anonymous user to have write access to the server. |

Mandrake Linux Security Update Advisory
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Package name:           wu-ftpd
Advisory ID:            MDKSA-2003:080
Date:                   July 31st, 2003

Affected versions:8.2
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Problem Description:

A vulnerability was discovered by Janusz Niewiadomski and Wojciech
Purczynski in the wu-ftpd FTP server package.  They found an off-by-
one bug in the fb\_realpath() function which could be used by a
remote attacker to obtain root privileges on the server.  This bug
can only be successfully accomplished by using wu-ftpd binaries
compiled on Linux 2.0.x and later 2.4.x kernels because the 2.2.x
and earlier 2.4.x kernels define PATH\_MAX to be 4095 characters.

wu-ftpd is no longer shipped with Mandrake Linux, however Mandrake
Linux 8.2 did come with wu-ftpd.  If you use wu-ftpd, you are
encouraged to upgrade to these patched packages.

1)  problem description, brief discussion, solution, upgrade information

    Janusz Niewiadomski and Wojciech Purczynski of iSEC Security Research
    have found a single byte buffer overflow in the Washington University
    ftp daemon (wuftpd), a widely used ftp server for Linux-like systems.
    It is yet unclear if this bug is (remotely) exploitable. Positive
    exploitability may result in a remote root compromise of a system
    running the wuftpd ftp daemon.

    Notes:
    \* SuSE Linux products do not contain wuftpd any more starting with SuSE
      Linux 8.0 and SuSE Linux Enterprise Server 8. The wuftpd package has
      been substituted by a different server implementation of the file
      transfer protocol server.
    \* The affected wuftpd packages in products as stated in the header of
      this announcement actually ship two different wuftpd ftp daemon
      versions: The older version 2.4.x that is installed as
      /usr/sbin/wu.ftpd, the newer version 2.6 is installed as
      /usr/sbin/wu.ftpd-2.6 . The 2.4.x version does not contain the
      defective parts of the code and is therefore not vulnerable to the
      weakness found.
    \* If you are using the wuftpd ftp daemon in version 2.4.x, you might
      want to update the package anyway in order not to risk an insecure
      configuration once you switch to the newer version.

    There exists no workaround that can fix this vulnerability on a temporary
    basis other than just using the 2.4.x version as mentioned above.
    The proper fix for the weakness is to update the package using the
    provided update packages.

    Please download the update package for your distribution and verify its
    integrity by the methods listed in section 3) of this announcement.
    Then, install the package using the command "rpm -Fhv file.rpm" to apply
    the update.
    Our maintenance customers are being notified individually. The packages
    are being offered to install from the maintenance web.

2)  Pending vulnerabilities in SuSE Distributions and Workarounds:

    - gnats
    Several security bugs were reported in gnats. The version of gnats
    that comes with SuSE Linux is not vulnerable to these problems.

    - kopete
    Kopete is the KDE instant messenger. A bug in kopete's gpg plugin can
    be abused to execute commands remotely. A fix will be available as
    soon as possible.

    - wget
    When handling long URLs, a buffer underrun may occur in the wget
    program. This underrun may be exploitable remotely. The update
    packages are available now on our ftp servers.

    - emacs
    Due to insecure temporary file handling in the semi and wemi library
    of GNU Emacs it is possible for a local attacker to overwrite
    arbitrary files of the user running emacs. The fix is currently being
    worked on.

    - ethereal
    Several remote exploitable bugs were found in the network analyzing
    tool ethereal. The update packages are available on our ftp servers.

    - tomcat
    Wrong file permission and clear passwords in the tomcat default
    installation allows local users to gain security relevant data by
    reading the file /opt/jakarta/tomcat/conf/tomcat-users.xml.
    Please enable password encryption and revoke the read permissions
    for 'group' and 'others' by adding the following line to
    /etc/permissions.local:
      /opt/jakarta/tomcat/conf/tomcat-users.xml wwwrun.root 0700
    and run the following command as root:
      "chkstat -set /etc/permissions.local"

    - heartbeat
    A format string bug in heartbeat's debug code can be exploited
    by a remote attacker if the debug level is high and the heartbeat
    daemon in configuered in an unsecure manner. The update packages are
    being tested right now.

    - freeradius
    A buffer overflow in the CHAP implementation of freeradius leads to a
    remotely exploitable security hole which can be abused to execute
    arbitrary code on the RADIUS server. The update packages are being
    tested right now.

    - traceroute(-nanog)
    An integer overflow in traceroute-nanog can be abused to gain
    access to the raw ip socket.
    We are working on the fix.

    - kdelibs
    Due to the fact of verifying the IP address instead of the Common
    Name (CN) field of the X.509 certificate the SSL implementation of
    KDE 2.2 and earlier is vulnerable to a MiM attack.
    Only SuSE Linux 7.3 is affected by this problem. Update packages
    are available on our FTP servers.

    - man
    The mandb program which is part of the man package contains a
    buffer overflow which allows local attackers to execute arbitrary
    code as man user. New packages are already availabale on our ftp
    servers.

    - several minor bug fixes
    There are alot more minor security updates in the queue. YOU (Yast
    Online Update) will inform you when they appear. Alternatively you
    may want to monitor the following website:
      <http://www.suse.de/de/private/download/updates/index.html>
    or:
      <http://www.suse.de/en/private/download/updates/index.html>

3)  standard appendix: authenticity verification, additional information

  - Package authenticity verification:

    SuSE update packages are available on many mirror ftp servers all over
    the world. While this service is being considered valuable and important
    to the free and open source software community, many users wish to be
    sure about the origin of the package and its content before installing
    the package. There are two verification methods that can be used
    independently from each other to prove the authenticity of a downloaded
    file or rpm package:
    1) md5sums as provided in the (cryptographically signed) announcement.
    2) using the internal gpg signatures of the rpm package.

    1) execute the command
        md5sum <name-of-the-file.rpm>
       after you downloaded the file from a SuSE ftp server or its mirrors.
       Then, compare the resulting md5sum with the one that is listed in the
       announcement. Since the announcement containing the checksums is
       cryptographically signed (usually using the key security@suse.de),
       the checksums show proof of the authenticity of the package.
       We disrecommend to subscribe to security lists which cause the
       email message containing the announcement to be modified so that
       the signature does not match after transport through the mailing
       list software.
       Downsides: You must be able to verify the authenticity of the
       announcement in the first place. If RPM packages are being rebuilt
       and a new version of a package is published on the ftp server, all
       md5 sums for the files are useless.

    2) rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the authenticity
       of an rpm package. Use the command
        rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
       to verify the signature of the package, where <file.rpm> is the
       filename of the rpm package that you have downloaded. Of course,
       package authenticity verification can only target an un-installed rpm
       package file.
       Prerequisites:
        a) gpg is installed
        b) The package is signed using a certain key. The public part of this
           key must be installed by the gpg program in the directory
           ~/.gnupg/ under the user's home directory who performs the
           signature verification (usually root). You can import the key
           that is used by SuSE in rpm packages for SuSE Linux by saving
           this announcement to a file ("announcement.txt") and
           running the command (do "su -" to be root):
            gpg --batch; gpg < announcement.txt | gpg --import
           SuSE Linux distributions version 7.1 and thereafter install the
           key "build@suse.de" upon installation or upgrade, provided that
           the package gpg is installed. The file containing the public key
           is placed at the top-level directory of the first CD (pubring.gpg)
           and at ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/suse/pubring.gpg-build.suse.de .

  - SuSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
    subscribe:

    suse-security@suse.com

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

I succeeded in RedHat Linux (x86) wu-2.6.2(1), 2.6.2(2), 2.6.1, 2.6.0. (Most version).
This is never fake.

Excellent Advisory was already announced (2003/07/31):
<http://isec.pl/vulnerabilities/isec-0011-wu-ftpd.txt>

This information was very useful to me.
I'm thankful to them.

This works well in my server.
If don't work in your server ?

Reason that don't work in other server is various kinds.
(For example, compiler version, operating system kind,
or, shellcode's position mistake, environment variable etc ...)

I don't think about those. Exert your force. :-)
INetCop Security is poor now. They have a few server.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Synopsis: wu-ftpd fb\_realpath() off-by-one bug
Product: wu-ftpd
Version: 2.5.0 <= 2.6.2
Vendor: http://www.wuftpd.org/
URL: http://isec.pl/vulnerabilities/isec-0011-wu-ftpd.txt
CVE: http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0466
Author: Wojciech Purczynski
Janusz Niewiadomski
Date: July 31, 2003
Issue:
======
Wu-ftpd FTP server contains remotely exploitable off-by-one bug. A local
or remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain root
privileges on a vulnerable system.
Details:
========
An off-by-one bug exists in fb\_realpath() function. An overflow occurs
when the length of a constructed path is equal to the MAXPATHLEN+1
characters while the size of the buffer is MAXPATHLEN characters only.
The overflowed buffer lies on the stack.
The bug results from misuse of rootd variable in the calculation of
length of a concatenated string:
------8<------cut-here------8<------
/\*
\* Join the two strings together, ensuring that the right thing
\* happens if the last component is empty, or the dirname is root.
\*/
if (resolved[0] == '/' && resolved[1] == '\0')
rootd = 1;
else
rootd = 0;
if (\*wbuf) {
if (strlen(resolved) + strlen(wbuf) + rootd + 1 > MAXPATHLEN) {
errno = ENAMETOOLONG;
goto err1;
}
if (rootd == 0)
(void) strcat(resolved, "/");
(void) strcat(resolved, wbuf);
}
------8<------cut-here------8<------
Since the path is constructed from current working directory and a file
name specified as an parameter to various FTP commands attacker needs to
create deep directory structure.
Following FTP commands may be used to cause buffer overflow:
STOR
RETR
APPE
DELE
MKD
RMD
STOU
RNTO
This bug may be non-exploitable if size of the buffer is greater than
MAXPATHLEN characters. This may occur for example if wu-ftpd is compiled
with some versions of Linux kernel where PATH\_MAX (and MAXPATHLEN
accordingly) is defined to be exactly 4095 characters. In such cases,
the buffer is padded with an extra byte because of variable alignment
which is a result of code optimization.
Linux 2.2.x and some early 2.4.x kernel versions defines PATH\_MAX to be
4095 characters, thus only wu-ftpd binaries compiled on 2.0.x or later 2.4.x
kernels are affected.
Exploit:
========
We investigated and successfully exploited this vulnerability on x86 based
Linux system running 2.4.19 kernel. We believe that exploitation of other
little-endian systems is also possible.
Impact:
=======
Authenticated local user or anonymous FTP user with write-access could
execute arbitrary code with root privileges.
Vendor Status:
==============
June 1, 2003 security@wu-ftpd.org has been notified
June 9, 2003 Request for confirmation of receipt sent to security@wu-ftpd.org
June 11, 2003 Response received from Kent Landfield
July 3, 2003 Request for status update sent
July 19, 2003 vendor-sec list notified
July 31, 2003 Coordinated public disclosure
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name CAN-2003-0466 to this issue.

Synopsis:	wu-ftpd fb_realpath() off-by-one bug
Product:	wu-ftpd
Version: 	2.5.0 <= 2.6.2
Vendor:		<http://www.wuftpd.org/>

URL:		<http://isec.pl/vulnerabilities/isec-0011-wu-ftpd.txt>
CVE:            <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0466>
Author:		Wojciech Purczynski <cliph@isec.pl>

Date:		July 31, 2003

Issue:
======

Wu-ftpd FTP server contains remotely exploitable off-by-one bug. A local
or remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain root
privileges on a vulnerable system.

Details:
========

An off-by-one bug exists in fb_realpath() function. An overflow occurs
when the length of a constructed path is equal to the MAXPATHLEN+1
characters while the size of the buffer is MAXPATHLEN characters only.
The overflowed buffer lies on the stack.

The bug results from misuse of rootd variable in the calculation of
length of a concatenated string:

------8<------cut-here------8<------
    /*
     * Join the two strings together, ensuring that the right thing
     * happens if the last component is empty, or the dirname is root.
     */
    if (resolved[[0]](#0) == '/' && resolved[[1]](#1) == '\0')
        rootd = 1;
    else
        rootd = 0;

    if (*wbuf) {
        if (strlen(resolved) + strlen(wbuf) + rootd + 1 > MAXPATHLEN) {
            errno = ENAMETOOLONG;
            goto err1;
        }
        if (rootd == 0)
            (void) strcat(resolved, "/");
        (void) strcat(resolved, wbuf);
    }
------8<------cut-here------8<------

Since the path is constructed from current working directory and a file
name specified as an parameter to various FTP commands attacker needs to
create deep directory structure.

Following FTP commands may be used to cause buffer overflow:

	STOR
	RETR
	APPE
	DELE
	MKD
	RMD
	STOU
	RNTO

This bug may be non-exploitable if size of the buffer is greater than
MAXPATHLEN characters. This may occur for example if wu-ftpd is compiled
with some versions of Linux kernel where PATH_MAX (and MAXPATHLEN
accordingly) is defined to be exactly 4095 characters. In such cases,
the buffer is padded with an extra byte because of variable alignment
which is a result of code optimization.

Linux 2.2.x and some early 2.4.x kernel versions defines PATH_MAX to be
4095 characters, thus only wu-ftpd binaries compiled on 2.0.x or later 2.4.x
kernels are affected.

Exploit:
========

We investigated and successfully exploited this vulnerability on x86 based
Linux system running 2.4.19 kernel. We believe that exploitation of other
little-endian systems is also possible.

Impact:
=======

Authenticated local user or anonymous FTP user with write-access could
execute arbitrary code with root privileges.

FreeBSD only:   NO

I.   Background

The realpath(3) function is used to determine the canonical,
absolute pathname from a given pathname which may contain extra
``/'' characters, references to ``/./'' or ``/../'', or references
to symbolic links.  The realpath(3) function is part of the FreeBSD
Standard C Library.

II.  Problem Description

An off-by-one error exists in a portion of realpath(3) that computes
the length of the resolved pathname.  As a result, if the resolved
path name is exactly 1024 characters long and contains at least
two directory separators, the buffer passed to realpath(3) will be
overwritten by a single NUL byte.

III. Impact

Applications using realpath(3) MAY be vulnerable to denial of service
attacks, remote code execution, and/or privilege escalation.  The
impact on an individual application is highly dependent upon the
source of the pathname passed to realpath, the position of the output
buffer on the stack, the architecture on which the application is
running, and other factors.

Within the FreeBSD base system, several applications use realpath(3).
Two applications which are negatively impacted are:

(1) lukemftpd(8), an alternative FTP server: realpath(3) is used to
    process the MLST and MLSD commands.  [lukemftpd(8) is not built or
    installed by default.]

(2) sftp-server(8), part of OpenSSH: realpath(3) is used to process
    chdir commands.

In both of the cases above, the realpath(3) vulnerability may be
exploitable, leading to arbitrary code execution with the privileges
of the authenticated user.  This is probably only of concern on
otherwise `closed' servers, e.g. servers without shell access.

At the time of 4.8-RELEASE, the FreeBSD Ports Collection contained
the following applications which appear to use realpath(3).  These
applications have not been audited, and may or may not be vulnerable.
There may be additional applications in the FreeBSD Ports Collection
that use realpath(3), particularly statically-linked applications and
applications added since 4.8-RELEASE.

IV.  Workaround

There is no generally applicable workaround.

OpenSSH's sftp-server(8) may be disabled by editing
/etc/ssh/sshd_config and commenting out the following line by
inserting a `#' as the first character:

  Subsystem       sftp    /usr/libexec/sftp-server

lukemftpd(8) may be replaced by the default ftpd(8).

V.   Solution

1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to 4.8-STABLE
or to any of the RELENG_5_1 (5.1-RELEASE), RELENG_4_8
(4.8-RELEASE-p1), or RELENG_4_7 (4.7-RELEASE-p11) security branches
dated after the respective correction dates.

2) To patch your present system:

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.  The following patch
has been tested to apply to all FreeBSD 4.x releases and to FreeBSD
5.0-RELEASE.

# fetch ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/patches/SA-03:08/realpath.patch
# fetch ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/patches/SA-03:08/realpath.patch.asc

b) Apply the patch.

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch

c) Recompile your operating system as described in
<URL:<http://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/makeworld.html>>.

NOTE WELL:  Any statically linked applications that are not part of
the base system (i.e. from the Ports Collection or other 3rd-party
sources) must be recompiled.

All affected applications must be restarted for them to use the
corrected library.  Though not required, rebooting may be the easiest
way to accomplish this.

VI.  Correction details

The following list contains the revision numbers of each file that was
corrected in FreeBSD.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

[ this version has some typos fixed ]

An off-by-one error exists in the C library function realpath(3).
This is the same bug that was recently found in the wu-ftpd ftpd
server by Janusz Niewiadomski and Janusz Niewiadomski.

The OpenBSD ftp daemon does not use realpath(3) in a way that could
be exploited, however a number of other system binaries also use
the function.  It is not currently known whether or not this bug
results in an exploitable security hole on OpenBSD.  Since the bug
led to an exploitable hole in wu-ftpd, it is entirely possible that
some program using realpath(3) under OpenBSD may be vulnerable to
attack.  For OpenBSD 3.3 and higher, the ProPolice stack protector
should provide some protection from this bug, but this cannot be
guaranteed.

This bug has been fixed in OpenBSD-current as well as the 3.2 and
3.3 stable branches.  Patches are available for OpenBSD 3.2 and 3.3.

Patch for OpenBSD 3.2:
ftp://ftp.OpenBSD.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.2/common/015_realpath.patch

Patch for OpenBSD 3.3:
ftp://ftp.OpenBSD.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.3/common/001_realpath.patch

For versions of OpenBSD prior to 3.2, users may simply fetch
the current revision of realpath.c from:
    ftp://ftp.OpenBSD.org/pub/OpenBSD/src/lib/libc/stdlib/realpath.c
then rebuild and install libc with the new realpath.c.

For more details, see the description of the wu-ftpd fp_realpath bug:

FreeBSD only:   NO

I.   Background

The realpath(3) function is used to determine the canonical,
absolute pathname from a given pathname which may contain extra
``/'' characters, references to ``/./'' or ``/../'', or references
to symbolic links.  The realpath(3) function is part of the FreeBSD
Standard C Library.

II.  Problem Description

An off-by-one error exists in a portion of realpath(3) that computes
the length of the resolved pathname.  As a result, if the resolved
path name is exactly 1024 characters long and contains at least
two directory separators, the buffer passed to realpath(3) will be
overwritten by a single NUL byte.

III. Impact

Applications using realpath(3) MAY be vulnerable to denial of service
attacks, remote code execution, and/or privilege escalation.  The
impact on an individual application is highly dependent upon the
source of the pathname passed to realpath, the position of the output
buffer on the stack, the architecture on which the application is
running, and other factors.

Within the FreeBSD base system, several applications use realpath(3).
Two applications which are negatively impacted are:

(1) lukemftpd(8), an alternative FTP server: realpath(3) is used to
    process the MLST and MLSD commands.  [lukemftpd(8) is not built or
    installed by default.]

(2) sftp-server(8), part of OpenSSH: realpath(3) is used to process
    chdir commands.

In both of the cases above, the realpath(3) vulnerability may be
exploitable, leading to arbitrary code execution with the privileges
of the authenticated user.  This is probably only of concern on
otherwise `closed' servers, e.g. servers without shell access.

At the time of 4.8-RELEASE, the FreeBSD Ports Collection contained
the following applications which appear to use realpath(3).  These
applications have not been audited, and may or may not be vulnerable.
There may be additional applications in the FreeBSD Ports Collection
that use realpath(3), particularly statically-linked applications and
applications added since 4.8-RELEASE.

IV.  Workaround

There is no generally applicable workaround.

OpenSSH's sftp-server(8) may be disabled by editing
/etc/ssh/sshd_config and commenting out the following line by
inserting a `#' as the first character:

  Subsystem       sftp    /usr/libexec/sftp-server

lukemftpd(8) may be replaced by the default ftpd(8).

V.   Solution

1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to 4.8-STABLE
or to any of the RELENG_5_1 (5.1-RELEASE), RELENG_4_8
(4.8-RELEASE-p1), or RELENG_4_7 (4.7-RELEASE-p11) security branches
dated after the respective correction dates.

2) To patch your present system:

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.  The following patch
has been tested to apply to all FreeBSD 4.x releases and to FreeBSD
5.0-RELEASE.

# fetch ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/patches/SA-03:08/realpath.patch
# fetch ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/patches/SA-03:08/realpath.patch.asc

b) Apply the patch.

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch

c) Recompile your operating system as described in
<URL:<http://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/makeworld.html>>.

NOTE WELL:  Any statically linked applications that are not part of
the base system (i.e. from the Ports Collection or other 3rd-party
sources) must be recompiled.

All affected applications must be restarted for them to use the
corrected library.  Though not required, rebooting may be the easiest
way to accomplish this.

		 NetBSD Security Advisory 2003-011
		 =================================

Topic:		off-by-one error in realpath(3)

Version:	NetBSD-current:	source prior to August 4, 2003
		NetBSD 1.6.1:	affected
		NetBSD 1.6:	affected
		NetBSD-1.5.3:	affected
		NetBSD-1.5.2:	affected
		NetBSD-1.5.1:	affected
		NetBSD-1.5:	affected

Severity:	Possible remote buffer overrun/root compromise

Fixed:		NetBSD-current:		August 4, 2003
		NetBSD-1.6 branch:	August 5, 2003 (1.6.2 will include the fix)
		NetBSD-1.5 branch:	Awaiting pullups

Abstract
========

In the library function realpath(3), there was a string manipulation
mistake which could lead to 1-byte buffer overrun.  realpath(3) is
being used by important network daemons such as ftpd(8),
therefore the vulnerability could be remotely exploitable.

Note: The same error remained in a derived function in the distribution
of the wu-ftpd server (Not part of NetBSD's base system). This
information has been available to the general public for a matter of
days now. Exploits have been released against wu-ftpd. They are probably
being written against other affected services as well. If you offer any
of the affected services, you are advised to patch your system
immediately.

Technical Details
=================

<http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/743092>

Binaries in the NetBSD base system which use realpath(3) include:

/bin/systrace
/usr/libexec/ftpd (*)
/sbin/mount
/sbin/umount
/usr/sbin/mountd (*)
/usr/bin/ssh
/usr/sbin/sshd (*)
/usr/libexec/sftp-server (*)
/usr/sbin/bootpd (*)

Binaries marked (*) listen on network interfaces, and could be remotely
exploitable.

Solutions and Workarounds
=========================

To fix this vulnerability you will need to upgrade your libc.

The following instructions describe how to upgrade your libc
binaries by updating your source tree and rebuilding and
installing a new version of libc.

Note that all statically-linked binaries, such as the following, must be
rebuilt:
- - binaries under /sbin and /bin for 1.5 and 1.6-based systems
- - binaries under /rescue for NetBSD-current systems
- - statically-linked binaries built by pkgsrc

Also, running instances of daemons must be restarted, if you do not plan
to reboot the machine after the update of libc.

* NetBSD-current:

	Systems running NetBSD-current dated from before 2003-08-03
	should be upgraded to NetBSD-current dated 2003-08-04 or later.

	The following directories need to be updated from the
	netbsd-current CVS branch (aka HEAD):
		lib/libc

	To update from CVS, re-build, and re-install libc and rescue:
		# cd src
		# cvs update -d -P lib/libc

		# cd lib/libc
		# make USETOOLS=no cleandir dependall
		# make USETOOLS=no install

		# cd ../../rescue
		# make USETOOLS=no cleandir dependall
		# make USETOOLS=no install

		(then, reboot, or restart affected daemons)

* NetBSD 1.6, 1.6.1:

	The binary distributions of NetBSD 1.6 and 1.6.1 are vulnerable.

	Systems running NetBSD 1.6 sources dated from before
	2003-08-04 should be upgraded from NetBSD 1.6 sources dated
	2003-08-05 or later.

	NetBSD 1.6.2 will include the fix.

	The following directories need to be updated from the
	netbsd-1-6 CVS branch:
		lib/libc

	To update from CVS, re-build, and re-install libc and static
	binaries:

		# cd src
		# cvs update -d -P -r netbsd-1-6 lib/libc

		# cd lib/libc
		# make USETOOLS=no cleandir dependall
		# make USETOOLS=no install

		# cd ../../sbin
		# make USETOOLS=no cleandir dependall
		# make USETOOLS=no install

		# cd ../bin
		# make USETOOLS=no cleandir dependall
		# make USETOOLS=no install

		(then, reboot, or restart affected daemons)

        Alternatively, apply the following patch (with potential offset
        differences):
                ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/security/patches/SA2003-011-realpath.patch

        To patch, re-build and re-install libc, and static binaries:

                # cd src
                # patch < /path/to/SA2003-011-realpath.patch

		# cd lib/libc
		# make USETOOLS=no cleandir dependall
		# make USETOOLS=no install

		# cd ../../sbin
		# make USETOOLS=no cleandir dependall
		# make USETOOLS=no install

		# cd ../bin
		# make USETOOLS=no cleandir dependall
		# make USETOOLS=no install

		(then, reboot, or restart affected daemons)

* NetBSD 1.5, 1.5.1, 1.5.2, 1.5.3:

	The binary distributions of NetBSD 1.5, 1.5.1, 1.5.2, and 1.5.3
	are vulnerable.

	Changes have not yet been pulled up to the 1.5 source branch.

	Apply the following patch (with potential offset differences):
		ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/security/patches/SA2003-011-realpath.patch

        To patch, re-build and re-install libc, and static binaries:

                # cd src
                # patch < /path/to/SA2003-011-realpath.patch

		# cd lib/libc
		# make USETOOLS=no cleandir dependall
		# make USETOOLS=no install

		# cd ../../sbin
		# make USETOOLS=no cleandir dependall
		# make USETOOLS=no install

		# cd ../bin
		# make USETOOLS=no cleandir dependall
		# make USETOOLS=no install

		(then, reboot, or restart affected daemons)
