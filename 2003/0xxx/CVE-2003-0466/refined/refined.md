    "content": "The content relates to CVE-2003-0466. The vulnerability is an off-by-one buffer overflow in the realpath(3) function, originating from 4.4BSD. This vulnerability affects various BSD operating systems and applications that use or are derived from this codebase, such as WU-FTPD.\n\nRoot cause of vulnerability:\nThe root cause of the vulnerability is a logic error within the `fb_realpath()` function where the length of a concatenated string is incorrectly calculated. This leads to an off-by-one buffer overflow, specifically when the constructed path length equals `MAXPATHLEN + 1`, while the buffer size is only `MAXPATHLEN`.\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present:\n- Off-by-one buffer overflow in the `realpath()` function, specifically in `fb_realpath()` function.\n- The overflow occurs on the stack.\n-  The code does not correctly account for the root directory (`/`) when concatenating paths.\n\nImpact of exploitation:\n- A malicious user can exploit this to gain elevated privileges (root access) on the vulnerable server or system.\n- The vulnerability can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.\n- The overflow occurs on the stack, which can lead to overwriting return addresses or other critical data on the stack.\n\nAttack vectors:\n- Exploitation can be achieved through various FTP commands (e.g., STOR, RETR, APPE, DELE, MKD, RMD, STOU, RNTO) that manipulate file paths.\n- A deep directory structure needs to be created to reach the vulnerable state.\n- Remote attackers (including anonymous users with write access) and local users can exploit it.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position:\n- The attacker needs to be able to send FTP commands and create directories. If an anonymous user has write access to the server they can exploit the vulnerability.\n- The attacker can also be a local, authenticated user.\n- Knowledge of the target system architecture is required for successful exploitation.\n",
