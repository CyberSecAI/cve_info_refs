Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the Microsoft Office WordPerfect converter, which improperly validates parameters when opening a WordPerfect document. Specifically, the converter fails to check the size of data within the document, leading to an unchecked buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The core issue is a buffer overflow vulnerability. When processing a WordPerfect file, the converter copies data from the file into a local buffer. Because the size of the data is not validated, an attacker can provide more data than the buffer can hold, leading to a buffer overflow.
*   **Unchecked Buffer:** The buffer is not checked for size during the copy operation, which causes the overflow and allows for overwriting of stack memory, including the return address (EIP).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By overflowing the buffer and overwriting the return address, an attacker can gain control of the execution flow. This allows them to execute arbitrary code with the same privileges as the user who opened the malicious document.
*   **System Compromise:**  The attacker's code could perform any action the user is permitted to perform, such as modifying, deleting or adding data/configuration, which can lead to system compromise.
*   **Malware Installation:** The attacker could install malware, lower security settings, or perform other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Document:** The primary attack vector is a crafted, malicious WordPerfect document.
*   **User Interaction:** The user must be tricked into opening this malicious document using one of the vulnerable applications such as Word, PowerPoint, FrontPage, Publisher, or Microsoft Works Suite.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Craft Malicious Document:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious WordPerfect document that triggers the buffer overflow.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker must persuade the victim to open the malicious document.
*   **No Network Exploitation:** The vulnerability is not automatically exploitable through email or network attacks.

**Additional details:**
*   The vulnerability can also be triggered in Internet Explorer, as Word can be a helper application when opening a .doc file.
*   The vulnerability was reported by eEye Digital Security.
*   A proof-of-concept exploit has been made available.
