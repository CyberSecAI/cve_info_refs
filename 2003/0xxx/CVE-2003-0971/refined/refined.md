  "CVE-2003-0971": {
    "description": "GnuPG creates ElGamal keys for signing using insufficient entropy.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "A vulnerability in the algorithm to generate ElGamal sign+encrypt keys. The same small k used for encryption was also used for signing, which allowed for a cryptographic attack to reveal the private key.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insufficient entropy in ElGamal key generation for signing.",
        "Reusing the same small 'k' value for encryption and signing."
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker could generate a valid signature without access to the private key, effectively compromising the ElGamal signing keys.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Cryptographic attack leveraging reused 'k' value.",
           "Requires access to a signature made with a vulnerable key."
      ],
        "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs access to a valid signature created with the vulnerable ElGamal sign+encrypt key."
    },
      "affected_versions": "GnuPG versions 1.0.2 and later for ElGamal sign+encrypt keys (type 20)",
    "solution": "Revoke affected ElGamal signing keys. Upgrade to GnuPG version 1.2.4 or later, or apply the provided patch for version 1.2.3.",
    "additional_notes": "The vulnerability does not affect encrypt-only (type 16) ElGamal keys, nor DSA or RSA keys. ElGamal signing keys were not generated by default, requiring special flags and overriding a warning message.",
