Based on the provided content, the vulnerability described is related to the way Windows Media Player (WMP) handles certain media files, specifically ASF files, when opened through Internet Explorer (IE). This allows for the execution of arbitrary code on a target computer.

Here's a breakdown:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in how Windows Media Player processes ASF files, specifically when triggered through IE. It appears that a crafted ASF file can be used to cause a "Zero second URL flip to local machine" which gives an attacker access to the local machine.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Automatic execution:** The ASF file can be automatically opened through an IFRAME embedded in a webpage or HTML email.
*   **Bypassing Security Zones:**  The exploit works even when scripting is disabled in the Restricted Zone, which is intended to prevent such attacks.
*   **Local file system access:** The vulnerability allows for access to the local file system.
*   **Media handler vulnerability:** The core issue resides in the Windows Media Player component.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Silent Execution:** The vulnerability can lead to the silent delivery and installation of an executable on a target computer without requiring client input beyond viewing a webpage or opening an HTML email. This could lead to the complete compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Websites:** A malicious website can embed a crafted ASF file within an IFRAME.
*   **HTML Emails:** An attacker can send a malicious HTML email containing an IFRAME with a malicious ASF file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious ASF file.
*   The attacker needs to host a webpage or send an email containing the malicious ASF file.

**Additional Information:**
* The exploit was tested and confirmed to work on WMP versions 7 and 8 across various Windows operating systems (98, ME, 2000, XP, and 2003).
* WMP 9 is not vulnerable.
* The vulnerability bypasses the default Enhanced Security Configuration of IE on Windows 2003.

This information suggests a serious security flaw in how WMP handles media files when triggered by IE, allowing for arbitrary code execution through a crafted ASF file.
