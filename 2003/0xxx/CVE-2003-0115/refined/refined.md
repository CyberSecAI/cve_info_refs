The provided document is a Microsoft Security Bulletin (MS03-015) describing a cumulative patch for Internet Explorer that addresses multiple vulnerabilities. This document does contain information about CVE-2003-0115.

**CVE-2003-0115 Information:**

*   **Vulnerability Name:** Third Party Plug-in Rendering
*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability exists due to how Internet Explorer handles parameters when rendering third-party file types within the browser window. Specifically, during the loading operation for a new window, the parameters of the URL referencing a third-party file type are not properly checked. This allows an attacker to inject script during the rendering process.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Improper parameter checking when rendering third-party plugins.
    *   The vulnerability affects plugins using the `EnableFullPage` feature.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary script code within the security context of the local computer zone on the user's machine.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attacker must host a website containing a specially crafted web page.
    *   The user must be enticed to visit this malicious website and click on a specially formed link referencing a third-party file type.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to host a website.
    *   The attacker needs to craft a specific URL targeting a third-party plugin using the `EnableFullPage` feature that is present on the user's system.
    *   The attacker must rely on social engineering to lure the user to visit the malicious website.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is in the way Internet Explorer renders the file types, not the third-party plugin itself.
*   The document notes that Microsoft recommends that all Internet Explorer users install the patch to ensure that they are protected if any third party plugins are present on their systems or are installed in the future.
* Internet Explorer installs support for Macromedia Flash files by default.
