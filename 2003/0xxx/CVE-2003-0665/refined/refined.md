Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2003-0665:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by an unchecked buffer in the ActiveX control used by the Microsoft Access Snapshot Viewer. This occurs because the Snapshot Viewer does not properly validate parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Buffer Overflow: A buffer overflow occurs when the Snapshot Viewer receives improperly formatted parameters, allowing an attacker to overwrite memory beyond the intended buffer.
- Lack of Input Validation: The root cause is the lack of proper validation of parameters passed to the ActiveX control.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Code Execution: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system.
- Privilege Escalation: The attacker's code would run with the same permissions as the logged-on user. This means the attacker could perform actions that the user can such as deleting, creating and modifying data and configurations, and potentially lower security settings or communicate with other websites.
- System Compromise: The vulnerability could allow an attacker to take complete control of a user's system if the user has sufficient privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious Web Pages: An attacker could host a malicious webpage designed to exploit the vulnerability if a user browses to the page.
- Phishing Emails: Attackers can send emails containing links to malicious web pages that are setup to invoke the ActiveX control.
- Exploitation via other Applications: Applications that load and use ActiveX controls can be used to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to entice a user to visit a malicious webpage or open a malicious email.
- The attacker needs to have a webpage or other means to load a malicious ActiveX control and supply it with the parameters to cause the overflow.
- The attacker can exploit this remotely.

**Additional Details:**
- The Microsoft Access Snapshot Viewer is not installed by default with Microsoft Office, but it is available as a standalone download.
- The vulnerability exists in an ActiveX control that is used by the Snapshot Viewer.
- Microsoft provided patches for affected versions of Access (97, 2000, and 2002) and a standalone patch for the Snapshot Viewer.
- A "kill bit" was also issued for the vulnerable ActiveX control in a subsequent Internet Explorer security patch to prevent it from being re-introduced to systems.
