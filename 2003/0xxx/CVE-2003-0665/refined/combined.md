How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS03-038 - Moderate

## Unchecked buffer in Microsoft Access Snapshot Viewer Could Allow Code Execution (827104)

Published: September 03, 2003 | Updated: September 04, 2003

**Version:** 1.1

**Originally posted:** September 3, 2003

**Updated:** September 4, 2003

#### Summary

**Who should read this bulletin:**
Customers who use MicrosoftÂ® Access or who use the [downloadable](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?&displaylang;=en&familyid;=b73df33f-6d74-423d-8274-8b7e6313edfb&displaylang;=en) Microsoft Access Snapshot Viewer

**Impact of vulnerability:**
Allow an attacker to execute code of their choice

**Maximum Severity Rating:**
Moderate

**Recommendation:**
Customers who use Microsoft Access or who use the [downloadable](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?&displaylang;=en&familyid;=b73df33f-6d74-423d-8274-8b7e6313edfb&displaylang;=en) Microsoft Access Snapshot Viewer should install the security patch at their earliest opportunity.

**End User Bulletin:**
An end user version of this bulletin is available at:

[https:](https://).

**Affected Software:**

* Microsoft Access 97
* Microsoft Access 2000
* Microsoft Access 2002

### General Information

## Technical details

**Technical description:**

With [Microsoft Access Snapshot Viewer](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?&displaylang;=en&familyid;=b73df33f-6d74-423d-8274-8b7e6313edfb&displaylang;=en), you can distribute a snapshot of a Microsoft Access database that allows the snapshot to be viewed without having Access installed. For example, a customer may want to send a supplier an invoice that is generated by using an Access database. With Microsoft Access Snapshot Viewer, the customer can package the database so that the supplier can view it and print it without having Access installed. The Microsoft Access Snapshot Viewer is available with all versions of Access - though it is not installed by default - and is also available as a separate stand-alone [download](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?&displaylang;=en&familyid;=b73df33f-6d74-423d-8274-8b7e6313edfb&displaylang;=en). The Snapshot Viewer is implemented by using an ActiveX control.

A vulnerability exists because of a flaw in the way that Snapshot Viewer validates parameters. Because the parameters are not correctly checked, a buffer overrun can occur, which could allow an attacker to execute the code of their choice in the security context of the logged-on user.

For an attack to be successful, an attacker would have to persuade a user to visit a malicious Web site that is under the attacker's control.

**Mitigating factors:**

* The Microsoft Access Snapshot Viewer is not installed with Microsoft Office by default.
* An attacker would need to persuade a user to visit a website under the attacker's control for an attack to be successful.
* An attacker's code would run with the same permissions as the user. If a user's permissions were restricted the attacker would be similarly restricted.

**Severity Rating:**

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Microsoft Access (all versions)** | Moderate |

The above [assessment](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21140) is based on the types of systems affected by the vulnerability, their typical deployment patterns, and the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would have on them.

**Vulnerability identifier:** [CAN-2003-0665](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=can-2003-0665)

**Tested Versions:**

Microsoft tested Access 2002, Access 2000, and Access 97 to assess whether they are affected by this vulnerability. Previous versions are no longer supported and may or may not be affected by this vulnerability.

## Frequently asked questions

**What's the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a [buffer overrun](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/glossary) vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run programs on another user's system. Such a program could take any action that the user could take, such as adding, changing, or deleting any data or configuration information. For example, the code could lower the security settings in the browser or write a file to the hard disk. Because the code would run as the user and not as the operating system, any security limitations on the user's account would also be applicable to any code that is run by successfully exploiting this vulnerability. In environments where user accounts are restricted, such as enterprise environments, the actions that an attacker's code could take would be limited by these restrictions.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability results because of an unchecked buffer in the ActiveX control that Microsoft Access Snapshot Viewer uses. By invoking a specific function in a particular manner, an attacker could overflow the buffer and gain the ability to run code in the user's security context.

**What is the Microsoft Access Snapshot Viewer?**

The [Microsoft Access Snapshot Viewer](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?&displaylang;=en&familyid;=b73df33f-6d74-423d-8274-8b7e6313edfb&displaylang;=en), you can distribute a snapshot of a Microsoft Access database that allows the snapshot to be viewed without having Access installed. For example, a customer may want to send a supplier an invoice that is generated by using an Access database-the Snapshot viewer would allow the customer to package the database. With Microsoft Access Snapshot Viewer, the supplier can view it and print it without having Access installed.
The Microsoft Access Snapshot Viewer is available with all versions of Microsoft Office - though it is not installed by default - and is also available as a separate stand-alone [download](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?&displaylang;=en&familyid;=b73df33f-6d74-423d-8274-8b7e6313edfb&displaylang;=en). The Snapshot Viewer is implemented by using an ActiveX control.

**What is an ActiveX control?**

ActiveX is a technology that allows developers to deploy programs in a small, self-contained way. These programs are called controls and can be used by Web pages, Visual Basic programs, or other applications.
ActiveX controls can be distributed in several ways, including installing with software products or being offered for download from a Web site. Regardless of how a user installs an ActiveX control, after it is installed and registered on the user's system it is fully functional and available to the user.

**How could I get the ActiveX control that Microsoft Access Snapshot Viewer uses?**

There are several ways to get the Microsoft Access Snapshot Viewer:

* It is included with all supported versions of Access - however it is not installed by default.
* It is available as a separate stand-alone [download](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?&displaylang;=en&familyid;=b73df33f-6d74-423d-8274-8b7e6313edfb&displaylang;=en) so that customers who do not have Access installed can view Access database snapshots.

**What is wrong with the ActiveX control that Microsoft Access Snapshot Viewer uses?**

There is an unchecked buffer in one of the functions that handles the input of certain parameters to the control.

**What could this vulnerability enable an attacker to do?**

This vulnerability could enable an attacker to run the code of their choice on a user's system with the same level of permissions as the user. This could allow the attacker to carry out any action that the user can carry out, such as adding, changing, or deleting data, communicating with a Web site, or formatting the hard disk.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

There are several ways that an attacker could exploit the vulnerability:

* The attacker could host a page on a Web site that that they control. If a user visited the site and opened the Web page, the page would try to invoke the control.
* The attacker could send a link to a malicious Web page in an e-mail message. If the recipient clicked the link, the Web page would try to invoke a control on the malicious Web site.

**Could the old control still be downloaded?**

If an attacker has cached the old vulnerable control and is hosting it on a site that is under their control, the control could be reintroduced to a user's system. However, an attacker would have to persuade a user to visit a malicious Web site that is under their control for the user to download the old control.
To remove the ability for the old control to be reintroduced on a user's system, a kill bit will be issued for the old control in a forthcoming Internet Explorer security patch.

**What is a kill bit?**

There is a security feature in Microsoft Internet Explorer that makes it possible to prevent an ActiveX control from ever being loaded by the Internet Explorer HTML-rendering engine. This is done by a making a registry setting and is referred to as setting the kill bit. After the kill bit is set, the control can never be loaded, even when it is fully installed. Setting the kill bit makes sure that even if a vulnerable component is introduced or is re-introduced to a system, it remains inert and harmless. For more information about this feature, see the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article: [240797](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;q240797&id;=kb;en-us;q240797&).

**What does the patch do?**

The patch eliminates the vulnerability by making sure that the Microsoft Access Snapshot Viewer ActiveX control correctly validates the parameters that are sent to the affected function. Additionally, the stand-alone download for Microsoft Access Snapshot Viewer has been updated with the same revised version of the ActiveX control.

### Overview

A remotely exploitable vulnerability exists in the Microsoft Access Snapshot Viewer ActiveX control. Exploitation of this vulnerability could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the local system with the privileges of the current user.

### Description

| According to [Microsoft's Security Bulletin MS03-038](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS03-038.asp), a buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the ActiveX control that is used to view Microsoft Access databases without having Microsoft Access installed. The buffer overflow occurs in the code that validates parameters for the Snapshot Viewer control. This vulnerability can be exploited via a malicious webpage, HTML-parsed email or any application that recognizes and launches ActiveX controls. A victim must visit a malicious site, or open a malicious message to be exploited. This control is not installed by default, but can be installed with Access, or as a stand-alone control. |
