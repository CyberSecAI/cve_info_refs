## History

The CERT Division is the birthplace of cybersecurity. For nearly 30 years, the CERT Division of the SEI has partnered with government, industry, law enforcement, and academia to advance cybersecurity and improve the security and resilience of computer systems and networks.

Originally focused on incident response, we have expanded into cybersecurity areas such as network situational awareness, malicious code analysis, secure coding, resilience management, insider threats, digital investigations and intelligence, workforce development, DevOps, forensics, software assurance, vulnerability discovery and analysis, and risk management.

## Former Director Richard Pethia

[Richard Pethia](/about/leadership/display.cfm?customel_datapageid_2623=3545) was founding director of the SEI's CERT Division. Pethia, who served as director of CERT from 1988 to 2016, guided the organization through tremendous growth and change. Under Pethia's leadership, the unit expanded and evolved from the CERT Coordination Center—a small group focused on computer incident response—to a research organization of more than 200 professionals dedicated to solving problems with widespread cybersecurity implications.

## ISC DHCPD minires library contains multiple buffer overflows

#### Vulnerability Note VU#284857

Original Release Date: 2003-01-15 | Last Revised: 2003-03-26

---

### Overview

The [Internet Software Consortium](http://www.isc.org) (ISC) has discovered several buffer overflow vulnerabilities in their implementation of DHCP (ISC DHCPD). These vulnerabilities may allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected systems. At this time, we are not aware of any exploits.

### Description

| There are multiple remote buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the ISC implementation of DHCP. As described in [RFC 2131](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2131.txt), "the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) provides a framework for passing configuration information to hosts on a TCP/IP network." In addition to supplying hosts with network configuration data, ISC DHCPD allows the DHCP server to dynamically update a DNS server, obviating the need for manual updates to the name server configuration. Support for dynamic DNS updates is provided by the NSUPDATE feature.During an internal source code audit, developers from the ISC discovered several vulnerabilities in the error handling routines of the minires library, which is used by NSUPDATE to resolve hostnames. These vulnerabilities are stack-based buffer overflows that may be exploitable by sending a DHCP message containing a large hostname value. *Note: Although the minires library is derived from the BIND 8 resolver library, these vulnerabilities do not affect any current versions of BIND.* |
| --- |

### Impact

| Remote attackers may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running ISC DHCPD. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade or apply a patch**The ISC has addressed these vulnerabilities in versions 3.0pl2 and 3.0.1RC11 of ISC DHCPD. If your software vendor supplies ISC DHCPD as part of an operating system distribution, please see the [vendor section](#systems) of this document. |
| --- |

| **Disable dynamic DNS updates (NSUPDATE)**As an interim measure, the ISC recommends disabling the NSUPDATE feature on affected DHCP servers.  **Block external access to DHCP server ports**As an interim measure, it is possible to limit exposure to these vulnerabilities by restricting external access to affected DHCP servers on the following ports:bootps      67/tcp      # Bootstrap Protocol Serverbootps      67/udp      # Bootstrap Protocol Serverbootpc      68/tcp      # Bootstrap Protocol Clientbootpc      68/udp      # Bootstrap Protocol Client**Disable the DHCP service**As a general rule, the CERT/CC recommends disabling any service or capability that is not explicitly required. Depending on your network configuration, you may not need to use DHCP. |

### Vendor Statement

Currently supported versions of NetBSD do not contain the error handling routine vulnerabilities. Such vulnerabilities were fixed prior to the release of NetBSD 1.5.

Therefore, NetBSD is not vulnerable.

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.
