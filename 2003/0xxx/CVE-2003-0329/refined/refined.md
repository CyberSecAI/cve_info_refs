**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The CesarFTP server stores the FTP password in plaintext in the `settings.ini` file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Plaintext storage of sensitive information (FTP password).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker who gains access to the `settings.ini` file can obtain the plaintext FTP password, potentially allowing them to gain unauthorized access to the FTP server.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local file system access: An attacker who gains access to the file system where CesarFTP is installed can read the `settings.ini` file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Access to the file system where CesarFTP is installed.
