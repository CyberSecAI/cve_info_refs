Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the insecure use of a temporary file, `/tmp/route.check`, within the `slpd.all_init` init script of OpenSLP. The script uses a hardcoded path for the temporary file and creates it in the `/tmp` directory without verifying it is not a symlink.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Symlink vulnerability:** The script doesn't check if `/tmp/route.check` is a symbolic link before writing to it. This allows an attacker to create a symlink with that name pointing to an arbitrary file on the system.
- **Insecure temporary file handling:** The use of a predictable and fixed path for the temporary file in a shared directory like `/tmp` makes it exploitable.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** An attacker can overwrite the content of any file on the system that the user running the `slpd.all_init` script (usually root) has write access to. This occurs when the script redirects the output of the `ping` command into the targeted file (symlink). While the script attempts to use `rm -f` command after using this temporary file, this doesn't prevent the overwrite as it takes place before this command is executed. This can potentially lead to a denial of service or privilege escalation.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attack requires local access to the system to create the malicious symlink in `/tmp`.
- **Timing:**  The attacker must create the symlink before the `slpd.all_init` script is executed, which usually happens when the OpenSLP service starts or restarts.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to create files and symlinks in the `/tmp` directory.
- The attacker must be able to trigger the execution of the `slpd.all_init` script by, for instance, starting or restarting the OpenSLP service.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability affects OpenSLP 1.0.11 and likely earlier versions.
- The issue was fixed in the project's CVS repository.
- The vulnerable initscript was not used by all vendors, reportedly only by Conectiva. Debian, for example, uses a different script.
