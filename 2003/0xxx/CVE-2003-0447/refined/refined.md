The provided content describes a vulnerability related to how Internet Explorer handles custom HTTP error messages, which aligns with the general description of CVE-2003-0447.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in a flaw within the parsing procedure of a function used by Internet Explorer to extract the real URL from the resource URL hash. This function is used when displaying custom HTTP error messages.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the insufficient validation of the URL extracted from the hash. Specifically, the function does not properly sanitize the URL string before embedding it into an HTML link. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary script commands within the URL.

- **Impact of exploitation:** By crafting a malicious URL with injected Javascript, an attacker can cause arbitrary script code to be executed within the "Local Zone" context of the user's browser when the user clicks on the specially crafted link. This could potentially lead to arbitrary command execution, local file access, and other severe consequences.

- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves crafting a URL that contains a malicious JavaScript payload. This URL is then triggered when a custom HTTP error message is displayed by Internet Explorer. The malicious part is placed after the # in the URL. For example: `res://shdoclc.dll/HTTP_501.htm#javascript:%2f*://*%2falert(location.href)/`

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL. User interaction is required since the user needs to click the generated link for the Javascript code to execute. This vulnerability is exploitable in the Local Zone.
