Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2003-0857:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Netlink applications do not properly check the source address of incoming packets, assuming they originate from the kernel.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of source address validation in netlink message handling.
- Vulnerable routines used in `ipq_read` (for userspace interaction with netfilter) and `ipulog_read` (for userspace logging of packets) within `iptables`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Local Denial of Service (DoS) attack.
- Potential for other unspecified local attacks due to the ability to send crafted netlink messages.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local users can send unicast netlink messages to any process on the system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a local user on the affected system.

**Additional Notes:**

- The bug report indicates that while `iptables` in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 and 3 are affected by this vulnerability, the vulnerable routines are not exposed in the shipped packages. Therefore, the issue was classified as `NOTABUG` and no errata was required.
- The initial report was from Herbert Xu.
- The vulnerability was considered embargoed at the time of reporting.
