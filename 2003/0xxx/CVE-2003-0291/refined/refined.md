The provided content describes a vulnerability in 3COM OfficeConnect Remote 812 ADSL routers.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a memory leak in the router's firmware. Specifically, buffers used to store HTTP requests are not properly initialized before being reused. This leads to previous HTTP request data being included in subsequent DHCP responses.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Memory Leak:** The core issue is the failure to clear memory buffers between uses.
- **Information Disclosure:** This leads to the exposure of sensitive information, specifically HTTP requests including headers and form data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker who is able to sniff DHCP traffic can view previous HTTP requests made by users of the affected router. This may reveal sensitive data such as:
- HTTP identification values
- Form values
- Potentially cookies, session IDs, and other authentication tokens or sensitive user data

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network Sniffing:** The attacker needs to be able to sniff DHCP traffic on the network where the affected router is used.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be positioned to passively eavesdrop on network traffic, specifically DHCP traffic. This could be achieved by:
  - Being on the same local network segment as the router and affected clients.
  - Compromising a device on the same network to perform the sniffing.
- No authentication or other direct interaction with the router is needed.

**Additional notes:**
- The initial report claimed that firmware version 1.1.7 was vulnerable and 1.1.9 was immune, but a later update indicates that version 1.1.9 is also affected.
- The vulnerability is similar to the "etherleak" vulnerability, but is a separate issue.
