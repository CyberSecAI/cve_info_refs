  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insecure handling of procfs descriptors in UnixWare.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The `/proc/$PID/as` file, which contains the address space image of process $PID, can be opened and accessed by the process owner. This file can be used to manipulate the process. Although setuid/setgid processes are protected, this protection can be bypassed. A process can obtain a descriptor to its own `/proc/$PID/as` file, then `execve()` a setuid binary. The descriptor remains open after the `execve()`, allowing manipulation of the new setuid process's memory.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Local privilege escalation. By manipulating the memory of a setuid binary, an attacker can gain elevated privileges.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local access to a vulnerable UnixWare/Open UNIX system.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be a local user capable of executing processes and opening files within the `/proc` filesystem. They also need to be able to execute a setuid binary."
