- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from improper handling of the "TypingUser" message by the Trillian application's msn.dll component. Specifically, when the "TypingUser" string is altered or corrupted, it leads to an uninitialized memory access.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The core weakness is the lack of input validation for the "TypingUser" message. By modifying the string "TypingUser" (e.g., replacing any character or shortening it to less than 10 chars), it causes the application to crash due to accessing an uninitialized memory location.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The impact is a remote Denial of Service (DoS). The vulnerability causes the Trillian application to crash, rendering it unusable for the affected user.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based. An attacker can send a specially crafted "TypingUser" message to the vulnerable Trillian client via the MSN protocol.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs the ability to send messages to a Trillian user. This could be achieved by having the user on the attacker's contact list or by using a modified messenger client to send the malformed message. The attacker needs to have the capability to manipulate the message content being sent over the MSN protocol.
