  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve": "CVE-2003-0059",
      "root_cause": "Multiple vulnerabilities exist in MIT Kerberos 5 releases prior to 1.2.5.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "KDC null pointer dereferences: Certain protocol requests can crash a KDC with a null pointer dereference.",
        "Realm transit checks: Realms with shared keys can impersonate users in other non-local realms.",
         "Format string vulnerability: The KDC uses strings containing Kerberos principal names as format strings in logging routines.",
        "Insufficient bounds checking: Code does not perform bounds checking on lengths before allocating storage, potentially causing crashes."
      ],
      "impact": "A remote user can crash the KDC. A user authenticated in a remote realm may be able to claim to be other non-local users to an application server. It may be possible for a user to gain access to the KDC system and database.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Crafting specific protocol requests to trigger a null pointer dereference in the KDC.",
        "Exploiting inter-realm trust relationships with shared keys to impersonate users in other realms.",
         "Providing malicious format strings via Kerberos principal names in logging routines.",
        "Sending malformed packets with large negative lengths to trigger allocation failures."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a remote user, potentially authenticated in a remote Kerberos realm, and capable of crafting specific network packets to trigger the vulnerabilities. For the format string vulnerability, successful authentication is not always required.",
      "additional_information": "The advisory notes that the null pointer dereference is unlikely to be exploitable to gain access to the KDC on systems without storage mapped at address zero. It also specifies that the inter-realm impersonation was fixed in version 1.2.3. The advisory mentions that while the format string vulnerability can easily crash the KDC, it is unknown if it can be used for host access. It is also noted that the bounds checking vulnerability can crash the KDC or application server but is not believed to allow host access."

     {
      "cve": "CVE-2003-0059",
      "root_cause": "A flaw in the chk_trans.c file of the libkrb5 library allows users from one realm to impersonate users from other non-local realms that use the same (shared) keys.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper validation of realm transit paths"
      ],
       "impact": "Users may gain unauthorized access to other realms, with various impacts possible depending on the Kerberos access control list (ACL) for each realm.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Malicious realm controllers with shared keys impersonating users in other realms."
      ],
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control a Kerberos realm with shared keys and the capability to manipulate authentication paths.",
         "additional_information": "This vulnerability affects both the Key Distribution Center (KDC) and other Kerberos application servers. It was addressed in MIT Kerberos V5 1.2.3."
