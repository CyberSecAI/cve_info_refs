Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The `pam_wheel` module in Linux-PAM uses the `getlogin()` function to determine the currently logged-in user.
- This user name is then compared against a list of trusted group members (usually "wheel") for access control.
- The vulnerability arises because the `getlogin()` function can be spoofed by a local user. If the "trust" option is enabled in the pam_wheel configuration and the "use_uid" option is disabled, a local user can manipulate the login name returned by `getlogin()`, bypassing the intended access control checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Insecure use of `getlogin()`:** The `pam_wheel` module relies on `getlogin()`, which is not a reliable way to determine the actual logged-in user.
- **Configuration vulnerability:** The vulnerability requires specific configuration options to be set, namely the "trust" option enabled and the "use_uid" option disabled.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can gain superuser privileges (root access) without supplying a password if the vulnerability is present in the PAM configuration of applications such as `su(1)`. This happens because the attacker can manipulate the login name to appear as a member of the trusted group (e.g., wheel group), circumventing the PAM authentication.
- **Bypass access restrictions:** Even if not leading to root access, the ability to spoof the login name could allow a local user to bypass intended restrictions.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local access:** The attacker must have local access to the machine to exploit this vulnerability. They must be able to execute arbitrary commands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker must have a local user account on the target machine.
- The attacker needs to be able to execute commands on the machine.
- The vulnerable PAM configuration (trust option enabled and use_uid option disabled) must be present in a PAM configuration file being used to authenticate a user for a privileged action (such as using `su`).
- The attacker also needs to be able to create a symbolic link to /dev/tty and then execute a shell from the tty.

**More Details than CVE Description:**

- The provided content from iDEFENSE provides a specific exploitation scenario using `ln` and `bash` to spoof the logged in user name. It also provides the specific code snippet that is vulnerable, along with details on specific configuration options that must be present for exploitation.
- It provides a clear timeline of the vulnerability disclosure process, from its discovery to public disclosure, including the involvement of Andrew Morgan, the maintainer of Linux-PAM.
- The content also provides a specific workaround: enabling the `use_uid` option in `pam_wheel` configurations.
- It also mentions that the vulnerability was fixed in Linux-PAM 0.78 and is available in CVS.
