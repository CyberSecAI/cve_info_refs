## Microsoft Help and Support Center contains buffer overflow in code used to handle HCP protocol

#### Vulnerability Note VU#467036

Original Release Date: 2003-10-16 | Last Revised: 2003-10-16

---

### Overview

There is a buffer overflow in the Microsoft Help and Support Center that could permit an attacker to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.

### Description

| The Microsoft Help and Support Center is a facility within WIndows to provide product help and documentation. Among other things, the Help and Support Center handles *hcp* protocol requests. According to Microsoft, "there is an unchecked buffer in an associated file used by the HCP protocol. This file is used by the Help and Support Center feature and is invoked automatically when HSC is launched." By convincing a user to follow a link or visit or view a malicious web page, an attacker can use this buffer overflow to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges. For more information, see [Microsoft Security Bulletin MS03-044](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS03-044.asp). This vulnerability is distinct from those diclosed in [MS03-006](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS03-006.asp) and [MS02-060](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS02-060.asp). |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker can execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Apply a patch as described in [Microsoft Security Bulletin MS03-044](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS03-044.asp). |
| --- |

| Until a patch can be applied, you can limit your exposure to this vulnerability through the following steps:   1. Deregister the HCP protocol. See Microsoft Security Bulletin MS03-044 for instructions. 2. Install the [Outlook Email Security Upgrade](http://www.microsoft.com/office/outlook/evaluation/security.asp). 3. View messages in plain text. Many email programs have facilities for setting preferences to view messages as plain text or to render them as HTML documents. 4. Disable scripting when viewing untrusted web pages.  These measures do not eliminate the vulnerability, but significantly reduce your exposure to it. |

NGSSoftware Insight Security Research Advisory

Name: Microsoft PCHealth Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
Systems Affected: Windows 2003 and XP
Severity: Critical Risk
Vendor URL: <http://www.microsoft.com/>
Author: David Litchfield [ david@ngssoftware.com ]

Date Vendor Notified:    23rd July 2003
Date of Public Advisory: 15th October 2003
Advisory number: #NISR15102003
Advisory URL: <http://www.ngssoftware.com/advisories/ms-pchealth.txt>

Description
***********
Microsoft Windows 2003 Server and Windows XP provide a support and
troubleshooting facility called PCHealth. PCHealth provides users
with information on how to deal with any problems they may
experience. PCHealth contains search functionality allowing users
to search using keywords. The Search engine runs as a system service
and is vulnerable to an exploitable stack based buffer overflow
condition.

Details
*******
The PCHealth system can be launched in several different ways. It can be
launched via an HTML document rendered in Internet Explorer or Outlook using
the HCP protocol or via DCOM. This presents remote attackers with several
vectors to launch an attack; however the latter requires administrative
privileges already so is not a likely attack vector. It is listed for the
sake of completeness. Local attackers can, of course, also exploit this
vulnerability to gain control of the system. The vulnerability is a stack
based buffer overflow triggered by an overly long query and exists in the
Help Service (helpsvc.exe) which is started by svchost.exe. As the instance
of svchost that runs the Help and Support service is also responsible for
running other services that require SYSTEM privileges it is not possible
to help mitigate the risk by setting a low privileged account to run
this service. In the absence of a patch it is suggested that the Help and
Support service be disabled until the patch can be applied.

Notes on Windows 2003
*********************
Despite the stack protection built into Windows 2003 (through Visual C++
.NET) this overflow can still be exploited. (Please read the following paper
for more details -
<http://www.nextgenss.com/papers/defeating-w2k3-stack-protection.pdf> )

That said, by default, the security settings of Internet Explorer and
Outlook Express on Windows 2003 mitigate the risk these systems are exposed
to via the HTML vector. Local low privileged attackers can still exploit
this to gain control but best practices dictate that only administrators
should be allowed to log on to servers. Provided these precautions have been
followed (or left in place) then the risk posed to Windows 2003 Servers is
reduced somewhat. That said NGSS advises that the patch still be applied
once proper testing of the patch has been done.

Fix Information
***************

Microsoft have supplied a patch for this problem that can be downloaded

## History

The CERT Division is the birthplace of cybersecurity. For nearly 30 years, the CERT Division of the SEI has partnered with government, industry, law enforcement, and academia to advance cybersecurity and improve the security and resilience of computer systems and networks.

Originally focused on incident response, we have expanded into cybersecurity areas such as network situational awareness, malicious code analysis, secure coding, resilience management, insider threats, digital investigations and intelligence, workforce development, DevOps, forensics, software assurance, vulnerability discovery and analysis, and risk management.

## Former Director Richard Pethia

[Richard Pethia](/about/leadership/display.cfm?customel_datapageid_2623=3545) was founding director of the SEI's CERT Division. Pethia, who served as director of CERT from 1988 to 2016, guided the organization through tremendous growth and change. Under Pethia's leadership, the unit expanded and evolved from the CERT Coordination Center—a small group focused on computer incident response—to a research organization of more than 200 professionals dedicated to solving problems with widespread cybersecurity implications.

### General Information

## Technical Details

**Technical Description:**

A security vulnerability exists in the Help and Support Center function which ships with Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. The affected code is also included in all other supported Windows operating systems, although no known attack vector has been identified at this time because the HCP protocol is not supported on those platforms. The vulnerability results because a file associated with the HCP protocol contains an unchecked buffer.

An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a URL that, when clicked on by the user, could execute code of the attacker's choice in the Local Computer security context. The URL could be hosted on a web page, or sent directly to the user in email. In the web based scenario, where a user then clicked on the URL hosted on a website, an attacker could have the ability to read or launch files already present on the local machine.

The risk of attack from the HTML email vector can be significantly reduced if the following conditions are met:

* You have applied the patch included with Microsoft Security bulletin [MS03-040](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/ms03-040)
* You are using Internet Explorer 6 or later
* You are using the Microsoft Outlook Email Security Update or Microsoft Outlook Express 6.0 and higher, or Microsoft Outlook 2000 or higher in their default configuration.

**Mitigating factors:**

* The Help and Support Center function can not be started automatically in Outlook Express or Outlook if the user is running Internet Explorer 6.0 Service Pack 1.
* In the Web based attack scenario, the attacker would have to host a web site that contained a web page used to exploit these vulnerabilities. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious web site outside of the HTML email vector. Instead, the attacker would need to lure them there, typically by getting them to click on a link that would take them to the attacker's site.

**Severity Rating:**

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Windows Millennium Edition** | Low |
| **Windows NT Server 4.0** | Low |
| **Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition** | Low |
| **Windows 2000** | Low |
| **Windows XP** | Critical |
| **Windows Server 2003** | Critical |

The above [assessment](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21140) is based on the types of systems affected by the vulnerability, their typical deployment patterns, and the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would have on them.

**Vulnerability identifier:**[CAN-2003-0711](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=can-2003-0711)

## Workarounds

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. These workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability however they help block **known** attack vectors. Workarounds may cause a reduction in functionality in some cases - in such situations this is identified below.

* **Deregister the HCP Protocol.**

  Deregistering the HCP Protocol or changing the registration will prevent an attack from being successful. The protocol can be deregistered by deleting the following key from the registry: HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT\HCP.

  1. From the **Start** Menu, select **Run**
  2. Type **regedit** then click **OK** (The registry editor program launches)
  3. Expand **HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT** and highlight the **HCP** key
  4. Right mouse click on the HCP key, and select **Delete**

  **WARNING:** Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall Windows. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

  **Impact of Workaround:** Deregistering the HCP protocol will break all local, legitimate help links that use hcp://. For example links in the Control Panel may no longer function.
* **Install** **Outlook Email Security Update** **if you are using Outlook 2000 SP1 or Earlier.**

  The Outlook Email Security Update causes Outlook 98 and 2000 to open HTML mail in the Restricted Sites Zone by default. Outlook Express 6.0 and Outlook 2002 by default open HTML mail in the Restricted Sites Zone. Customers who use any of these products would be at a reduced risk from an e-mail borne attack that attempts to exploit this vulnerability unless the user clicks a malicious link in the email
* **If you are using Outlook 2002 or Outlook Express 6.0SP1 or higher, to help protect yourself from the HTML email attack vector, read email in plain text format.**

  Users of Microsoft Outlook 2002 and Outlook Express 6.0 who have applied Service Pack 1 and or higher can enable a feature to view all non-digitally-signed e-mail or non-encrypted e-mail messages in plain text only.

  Digitally signed e-mail or encrypted e-mail messages are not affected by the setting and may be read in their original formats. Information on enabling this setting in Outlook 2002 can be found in the following Knowledge Base article:

  [https:](https://)

  Information on enabling this setting in Outlook Express 6.0 can be found in the following Knowledge Base article:

  </https:>[https:](https://)

  **Impact of Workaround:**

  E-mail viewed in plain text format cannot contain pictures, specialized fonts, animations, or other rich content. In addition:

  + The changes are applied to the preview pane and open messages.
  + Pictures become attachments to avoid loss.
  + Since the message is still in Rich Text or HTML format in the store, the object model (custom code solutions) may behave unexpectedly because the message is still in Rich Text or HTML format in the mail store.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What's the scope of this vulnerability?**

This is a [buffer overrun](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/glossary) vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause code of their choice to be executed as though it originated on the local machine. Such code could provide the attacker with the ability to take any desired action on the machine, including adding, deleting or modifying data on the system or running any code of the attacker's choice.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability results because of an unchecked buffer in file associated with the HCP protocol which is owned by the Help and Support Center.

**What is the Help and** **SupportCenter?**

Help and Support Center (HSC) is a feature in Windows that provides help on a variety of topics. For instance, HSC enables users to learn about Windows features, download and install software updates, determine whether a particular hardware device is compatible with Windows, get assistance from Microsoft, and so forth.
Users and programs can execute URL links to Help and Support Center by using the "hcp://" prefix in a URL link instead of "https://".

**What is the HCP protocol?**

Similar to the HTTP protocol which is used to execute URL links to open a web browser, the HCP protocol can be used to execute URL links to open the Help and Support Center feature.

**What's wrong with the HCP protocol?**

There is an unchecked buffer in an associated file used by the HCP protocol. This file is used by the Help and Support Center feature and is invoked automatically when HSC is launched.

**What could this vulnerability enable an attacker to do?**

This vulnerability could enable an attacker to cause code of their choice to run with additional privileges on the system. This could allow the attacker to add, delete or modify data on the system, or take any other action of the attacker's choice.

**How could an attacker exploit this vulnerability?**

The attacker would need to construct a web page that launched a specially crafted URL. The attack could then proceed via either of two vectors. In the first, the attacker could host the web page on a web site; when a user visited the site, the web page would attempt to launch the URL and exploit the vulnerability. In the second, the attacker could send the web page as an HTML mail. Upon being opened by the recipient, the web page could attempt to invoke the function and exploit the vulnerability.

**Why is this vulnerability listed only as "Low" on all systems prior to Windows XP?**

The specific file which actually contains the vulnerable code is present on all versions of Microsoft Windows, but the Help and Support Center functionality, which is required to exploit the vulnerability, is not available or supported on platforms prior to Windows XP.

**Is there anything that helps mitigate the risk of an HTML email attack?**

The risk of attack from the HTML email vector can be significantly reduced if the following conditions are met:

* You have applied the patch included with Microsoft Security bulletin [MS03-040](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/ms03-040)
* You are using Internet Explorer 6 or later
* You are using the Microsoft Outlook Email Security Update or Microsoft Outlook Express 6.0 and higher, or Microsoft Outlook 2000 or higher in their default configuration.

**What does the patch do?**

The patch addresses the vulnerability by correcting the unchecked buffer in the file associated with the HCP protocol.

NGSSoftware Insight Security Research Advisory

Name: Microsoft PCHealth Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
Systems Affected: Windows 2003 and XP
Severity: Critical Risk
Vendor URL: <http://www.microsoft.com/>
Author: David Litchfield [ david@ngssoftware.com ]

Date Vendor Notified:    23rd July 2003
Date of Public Advisory: 15th October 2003
Advisory number: #NISR15102003
Advisory URL: <http://www.ngssoftware.com/advisories/ms-pchealth.txt>

Description
***********
Microsoft Windows 2003 Server and Windows XP provide a support and
troubleshooting facility called PCHealth. PCHealth provides users
with information on how to deal with any problems they may
experience. PCHealth contains search functionality allowing users
to search using keywords. The Search engine runs as a system service
and is vulnerable to an exploitable stack based buffer overflow
condition.

Details
*******
The PCHealth system can be launched in several different ways. It can be
launched via an HTML document rendered in Internet Explorer or Outlook using
the HCP protocol or via DCOM. This presents remote attackers with several
vectors to launch an attack; however the latter requires administrative
privileges already so is not a likely attack vector. It is listed for the
sake of completeness. Local attackers can, of course, also exploit this
vulnerability to gain control of the system. The vulnerability is a stack
based buffer overflow triggered by an overly long query and exists in the
Help Service (helpsvc.exe) which is started by svchost.exe. As the instance
of svchost that runs the Help and Support service is also responsible for
running other services that require SYSTEM privileges it is not possible
to help mitigate the risk by setting a low privileged account to run
this service. In the absence of a patch it is suggested that the Help and
Support service be disabled until the patch can be applied.

Notes on Windows 2003
*********************
Despite the stack protection built into Windows 2003 (through Visual C++
.NET) this overflow can still be exploited. (Please read the following paper
for more details -
<http://www.nextgenss.com/papers/defeating-w2k3-stack-protection.pdf> )

That said, by default, the security settings of Internet Explorer and
Outlook Express on Windows 2003 mitigate the risk these systems are exposed
to via the HTML vector. Local low privileged attackers can still exploit
this to gain control but best practices dictate that only administrators
should be allowed to log on to servers. Provided these precautions have been
followed (or left in place) then the risk posed to Windows 2003 Servers is
reduced somewhat. That said NGSS advises that the patch still be applied
once proper testing of the patch has been done.

Fix Information
***************

Microsoft have supplied a patch for this problem that can be downloaded
from:
