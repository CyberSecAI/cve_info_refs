The provided document is Microsoft Security Bulletin MS03-039, which describes multiple vulnerabilities in the RPCSS service.  This bulletin addresses three vulnerabilities: two buffer overruns and one denial of service. The bulletin refers to CAN-2003-0715, CAN-2003-0528, and CAN-2003-0605 for the specific vulnerabilities which are related to CVE-2003-0995.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerabilities stem from incorrect handling of malformed messages within the RPCSS service, specifically in the DCOM activation interface. The RPCSS service does not properly check message inputs in certain circumstances.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1. **Buffer Overrun:** Two buffer overrun vulnerabilities exist in the DCOM activation component of the RPCSS service. Sending specially crafted malformed RPC messages can trigger these overruns.
2. **Denial of Service:** A denial of service vulnerability exists where sending a malformed RPC message to the RPCSS service can cause it to hang and become unresponsive.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
1. **Buffer Overrun:** Successful exploitation of the buffer overruns can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with Local System privileges, granting them complete control over the affected system. This allows for actions like installing programs, viewing/changing/deleting data, and creating new accounts.
2. **Denial of Service:** Successful exploitation of the denial of service vulnerability results in the RPCSS service becoming unresponsive, effectively disrupting services relying on it.

**Attack Vectors:**
The vulnerabilities can be exploited by sending a malformed RPC message to a vulnerable system, targeting the RPCSS service. This can occur over network ports used by RPC or through other vectors that involve interaction with the vulnerable service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs the ability to send a malformed RPC message to the RPCSS service on a vulnerable system. This can be done by establishing a network connection to the system over the affected ports. The bulletin indicates that anyone who can establish a connection with the service may attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities.

**Additional Information:**
* The bulletin includes a tool to scan for unpatched systems (KB827363).
* It also provides workarounds such as blocking specific ports, disabling CIS/RPC over HTTP, using a personal firewall, applying IPSec filters, or disabling DCOM.
* The patch for this vulnerability supersedes previous RPC-related patches from MS03-026 and MS01-048.
