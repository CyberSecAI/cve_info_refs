The provided content describes a buffer overflow vulnerability in MailMax version 5.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A buffer overflow exists in the IMAP4 protocol when handling the `SELECT` command.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  Buffer overflow in the `SELECT` command when a large amount of data is sent.
- Overwriting the exception handler on the stack.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The IMAP service stops responding and has to be restarted manually.
- System compromise: Attackers can overwrite the exception handler on the stack, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution as SYSTEM.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a large amount of data to the `SELECT` command in the IMAP4 protocol.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to have a valid login on the system to exploit the vulnerability.
