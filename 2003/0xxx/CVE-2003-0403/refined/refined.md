- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Vignette software installs a license management template in the `/vgn/license` directory that is not protected by any authentication mechanism.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unauthenticated access to a sensitive administration template. This template allows viewing and modifying license information.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can access and modify the license information, potentially leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition on the server software.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is accessible through a web browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely without authentication. The attacker needs to be able to access the `/vgn/license` URL.
