- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Splatt forum software does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when creating post icons. Specifically, the `src` attribute of the `<img>` tag is vulnerable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** HTML injection vulnerability, specifically within the `<img>` tag's `src` attribute. The forum software fails to properly sanitize or escape user-provided data within the post icon.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML code, including JavaScript, which can lead to various attacks such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This can allow an attacker to steal session cookies, redirect users to malicious websites, or perform other malicious actions in the context of the victim's browser session.
- **Attack vectors:** By creating a new post with a maliciously crafted value for the post icon field, the attacker can insert arbitrary HTML code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker only needs the ability to create new posts on the forum. No special privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.
