  "guidelines_followed": "TRUE",
  "relevance": "HIGH",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A denial-of-service vulnerability exists in Postfix's address parsing code. A malformed email address can cause the Postfix queue manager or the smtpd listener process to lock up, leading to a denial of service.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Denial of Service vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "The impact is denial of service, where Postfix will be unable to deliver email. In some cases, manual intervention may be required to restore the service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote Attack",
       "Email Message with Malformed Address"
     ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "A remote attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted email message containing a malformed envelope address to a vulnerable Postfix server. No special privileges are needed."
  },
   "addendum": "The vulnerability is message-oriented, meaning it is triggered by the contents of a specially-crafted email message rather than by lower-level network traffic. This also means that a non-vulnerable MTA may pass the malicious message along to other MTAs that may be vulnerable."
