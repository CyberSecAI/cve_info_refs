## Postfix vulnerable to DoS by supplying a remote SMTP listener with a malformed envelope address

#### Vulnerability Note VU#895508

Original Release Date: 2003-08-11 | Last Revised: 2003-08-18

---

### Overview

A denial-of-service vulnerability exists in all versions of Postfix prior to 2.0. This vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to cause mail service interruption.

### Description

| [Postfix](http://www.postfix.org/) is a very popular mail transfer agent (MTA). Michal Zalewski has discovered a denial-of-service vulnerability in Postfix. According to Michal, the vulnerability exists in a portion of code responsible for address parsing. For further technical details, please see Michal's [announcement](http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=vulnwatch&m=106000570117585&w=2).  Note that this vulnerability is message-oriented as opposed to connection-oriented. That means that the vulnerability is triggered by the contents of a specially-crafted email message rather than by lower-level network traffic. This is important because an MTA that does not contain the vulnerability may pass the malicious message along to other MTAs that may be protected at the network level. In other words, vulnerable Postfix servers on the interior of a network are still at risk, even if the site's border MTA uses software other than Postfix. |
| --- |

### Impact

| Postfix will be unable to deliver email. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Apply a patch from your vendor. |
| --- |

| **Workarounds**Based on feedback from the author of Postfix, if recipient name checking is turned on (Recipient name checking is turned off by default in version 1.1.11), mail for <nonexistent@[127.0.0.1]> is rejected. |

CONECTIVA LINUX SECURITY ANNOUNCEMENT
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

PACKAGE   : postfix
SUMMARY   : Remote denial of service vulnerability
DATE      : 2003-08-04 17:30:00
ID        : CLA-2003:717
RELEVANT
RELEASES  : 7.0, 8

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

DESCRIPTION
Postfix[1] is a widely used MTA (Mail Transport Agent, sometimes
called just an email or SMTP server).

This update for Conectiva Linux 7.0 and 8 fixes two vulnerabilities
in Postfix reported[4] by Michal Zalewski:

1. Postfix used as a bounce scanner (CAN-2003-0468)[2]
By using specially created recipients, it is possible to make Postfix
attempt to establish SMTP sessions with arbitrary hosts on arbitrary
ports. This could be used to identify open TCP ports on remote
machines or to just generate traffic.

2. Remote denial of service (CAN-2003-0540)[3]
A malformed address can be used to cause a denial of service
condition in two ways:
- by locking up the queue manager: the offending message has to be
manually removed from the queue in order to restore the service;
- by locking up the smtpd listener: when supplied with the malformed
address, the listener process will stop responding. Multiple attacks
in parallel will hang many smtpd processes, leading to a denial of
service.
In order to be vulnerable to this issue, the "append\_dot\_mydomain"
paramater would have to be changed from the default value of "on" to
"off".

Conectiva Linux 9 is not vulnerable to any of these issues since it
ships with Postfix 2.0.x.

SOLUTION
All postfix users should upgrade their packages. The service will be
automatically restarted after the upgrade if it was already running.

2)  Pending vulnerabilities in SuSE Distributions and Workarounds:

- kernel
Various bugs inside the kernel have been reported recently. The most
important ones are
- NFSv3 remote DoS
- netfilter DoS
- /proc infoleak
- race condition in the ELF loader
These bugs are fixed. The new kernel packages will be approved as soon as
the testing is finished.

3)  standard appendix: authenticity verification, additional information

- Package authenticity verification:

SuSE update packages are available on many mirror ftp servers all over
the world. While this service is being considered valuable and important
to the free and open source software community, many users wish to be
sure about the origin of the package and its content before installing
the package. There are two verification methods that can be used
independently from each other to prove the authenticity of a downloaded
file or rpm package:
1) md5sums as provided in the (cryptographically signed) announcement.
2) using the internal gpg signatures of the rpm package.

1) execute the command
md5sum <name-of-the-file.rpm>
after you downloaded the file from a SuSE ftp server or its mirrors.
Then, compare the resulting md5sum with the one that is listed in the
announcement. Since the announcement containing the checksums is
cryptographically signed (usually using the key security@suse.de),
the checksums show proof of the authenticity of the package.
We disrecommend to subscribe to security lists which cause the
email message containing the announcement to be modified so that
the signature does not match after transport through the mailing
list software.
Downsides: You must be able to verify the authenticity of the
announcement in the first place. If RPM packages are being rebuilt
and a new version of a package is published on the ftp server, all
md5 sums for the files are useless.

2) rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the authenticity
of an rpm package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, where <file.rpm> is the
filename of the rpm package that you have downloaded. Of course,
package authenticity verification can only target an un-installed rpm
package file.
Prerequisites:
a) gpg is installed
b) The package is signed using a certain key. The public part of this
key must be installed by the gpg program in the directory
~/.gnupg/ under the user's home directory who performs the
signature verification (usually root). You can import the key
that is used by SuSE in rpm packages for SuSE Linux by saving
this announcement to a file ("announcement.txt") and
running the command (do "su -" to be root):
gpg --batch; gpg < announcement.txt | gpg --import
SuSE Linux distributions version 7.1 and thereafter install the
key "build@suse.de" upon installation or upgrade, provided that
the package gpg is installed. The file containing the public key
is placed at the top-level directory of the first CD (pubring.gpg)
and at ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/suse/pubring.gpg-build.suse.de .

Trustix Secure Linux Security Advisory #2003-0029

Package name:      postfix
Summary:           Denial of service
Date:              2003-08-04
Affected versions: TSL 1.2, 1.5

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
Package description:
Postfix is an alternative to the sendmail mailer daemon. Postfix attempts
to be fast, easy to administer, and secure, while at the same time being
sendmail compatible enough to not upset existing users.

Problem description:
From the Postfix 1.1.13 release notes:
This patch fixes a denial of service condition in the Postfix smtpd,
qmgr, and other programs that use the trivial-rewrite service.
The problem is triggered when an invalid address resolves to an
impossible result. This causes the affected programs to reject the
result and to retry the trivial-rewrite request indefinitely.

Action:
We recommend that all systems with this package installed be upgraded.

Location:
All TSL updates are available from
<URI:<http://www.trustix.net/pub/Trustix/updates/>>
<URI:ftp://ftp.trustix.net/pub/Trustix/updates/>

About Trustix Secure Linux:
Trustix Secure Linux is a small Linux distribution for servers. With focus
on security and stability, the system is painlessly kept safe and up to
date from day one using swup, the automated software updater.

Automatic updates:
Users of the SWUP tool can enjoy having updates automatically
installed using 'swup --upgrade'.

Users of TSL 1.2 can get SWUP from:
<URI:ftp://ftp.trustix.net/pub/Trustix/software/swup/>
(In later versions of TSL, SWUP is included in the default installation.)

Public testing:
These packages have been available for public testing for some time.
If you want to contribute by testing the various packages in the
testing tree, please feel free to share your findings on the
tsl-discuss mailinglist.
The testing tree is located at
<URI:<http://www.trustix.net/pub/Trustix/testing/>>
<URI:ftp://ftp.trustix.net/pub/Trustix/testing/>

This key is available from:
<URI:<http://www.trustix.net/TSL-GPG-KEY>>

The advisory itself is available from the errata pages at

## SUSE Security

# A Process That Never Ends

### SUSE is committed to delivering best effort security to its customers and to the Open Source community. We believe that trust in Open Source Software security in general, and the user's privacy in particular, are both indispensable and indefeasible.

We treat software security as a process that never ends. This means we:

* Promptly react to security incidents and deliver premium quality security updates
* Continuously improve the security-related functionality in SUSE products
* Continuously contribute to the rapidly growing maturity of Open Source Software
* Respect the Open Source Software security principles of openness, transparency and traceability

Software security is a complex challenge. Software can provide many of its own security features, such as authentication methods, encryption, intrusion prevention and detection, and backup.

At the same time, it can also contain errors (both deliberate and accidental) that can affect the system's security, including design flaws, programming errors, and backdoors.

The SUSE Security Team addresses all of these aspects of software security, on an ongoing basis. Software security cannot be thought of as a state you can achieve at a specific point in time. Instead, it is a process that must be executed with professional expertise and continuous development. This persistent focus is what has given Open Source Software, Linux and SUSE such an excellent reputation for security.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
