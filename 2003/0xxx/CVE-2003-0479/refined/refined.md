- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WebBBS Guestbook application does not sanitize user input when processing guestbook entries. Specifically, the 'Name', 'Email', and 'Message' fields allow arbitrary code injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application fails to sanitize user-supplied data, leading to client-side script execution.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into guestbook entries. When other users view the guestbook, this injected script executes in their browsers. This can result in various malicious actions including redirection to arbitrary sites, session hijacking, defacement and other client-side attacks. In the example given, all users will be redirected to www.toto.com, rendering the guestbook unusable.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the web interface of the WebBBS Guestbook. Specifically, the vulnerable fields 'Name', 'Email' or 'Message' during a guestbook submission.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to access the WebBBS guestbook interface to submit an entry containing malicious script. No special privileges are required to perform the injection.
