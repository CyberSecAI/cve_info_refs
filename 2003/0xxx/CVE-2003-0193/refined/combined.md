How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

```
Package: catdoc
Version: 0.91.5-1
Severity: normal
File: /usr/bin/xlsview
Tags: patch security

xlsview writes its output to a temporary file in /tmp. This file has a
predictable name and is opened without ensuring that it does not already
exist. This leaves xlsview open to possible symlink attacks.

The following patch uses tempfile(1) to choose a temporary filename and
create the file, ensuring that it is created safely.

thanks

Has team@security.debian.org been contacted regarding this bug?

I'm setting this bug to grave as this seems to be a real security issue.
I've set the woody tag so that this bug might get more attention. Sarge
and sid should also be effected as they are all the same version and so
the sarge and sid tags should likely be set later.

I don't see this package in potato, but I'm not sure if my methods of
looking are correct.

Debian Security Advisory DSA 575-1                     security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                             Martin Schulze
October 28th, 2004                      <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>

Package        : catdoc
Vulnerability  : insecure temporary file
Problem-Type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CAN-2003-0193
Debian Bug     : 183525

A temporary file problem has been discovered in xlsview from the
catdoc suite, convertors from Word to TeX and plain text, which could
lead to local users being able to overwrite arbitrary files via a
symlink attack on predictable temporary file names.

For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.91.5-1.woody3.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.91.5-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your catdoc package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.
