Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2003-0460:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in how Apache HTTP Server 1.3.27 (on Win32 systems) handles specific characters within the "Request-URI". Specifically, the presence of the character `0x1A` (SUB - Substitute) in the URI can cause the logging process to stop.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of special characters in the URI request by the logging mechanism of Apache httpd.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote attacker can disable logging on the web server by sending a specially crafted URI request containing the `0x1A` character. This could be used to mask malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A remote attacker sends a crafted HTTP request that includes the character `0x1A` within the URI.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Apache web server. No special privileges are required.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability specifically affects Apache HTTP Server 1.3.27 on Windows systems when the `rotatelogs` utility is used for logging.
- The vulnerability is fixed in Apache 1.3.28.
- Disabling the `rotatelogs` utility is also a workaround to mitigate the issue.
