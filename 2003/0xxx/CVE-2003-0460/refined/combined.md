## Apache stops writing access/error logs after processing "Request-URI" containing "0x1A" characters

#### Vulnerability Note VU#694428

Original Release Date: 2003-07-21 | Last Revised: 2003-07-21

---

### Overview

A vulnerability in the logging of URI requests may permit a remote attacker to disable logging on an Apache HTTP Server. Version 1.3.27 on Windows systems is reported vulnerable to this issue.

### Description

| Apache HTTP Server 1.3.27 running on Win32 systems contains a vulnerability that could enable an attacker to stop the logging process. If the server is configured to use rotatelogs then an attacker can stop logging on the server by sending a crafted URI Request. |
| --- |

### Impact

| Logging on the web server will be disabled. This can be used to mask future attacks against the server. |
| --- |

### Solution

| [Upgrade](http://httpd.apache.org) to Apache 1.3.28 to resolve this issue. |
| --- |

| Disable the rotatelogs utility on CustomLog or ErrorLog directives. |
