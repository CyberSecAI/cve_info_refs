============================ Description ============================

DoS caused by buffer overflow abend running special script against
login.

For security reasons, NCPIP.NLM and JSTCP.NLM were renamed to
NCPIP.OLD and JSTCP.OLD. NCPIP.NLM should never be loaded on a
PUBLIC interface unless port 524 is blocked by a firewall, even
if using the NCP exclude options. JSTCP.NLM posted a listener on
port 6901 that is not needed by iChain.

User could access a restricted/secure page without authenticating.

Numerous other updates are included in this field patch.  See the
Technical Information Document (TID) for further details.

============================== Impact ===============================

Denial of Service caused by buffer overflow abend running special
script against login.

Inappropriate access with incorrect configuration.

Document (TID) <http://support.novell.com/servlet/tidfinder/2966205>.
