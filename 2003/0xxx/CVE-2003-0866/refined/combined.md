How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: tomcat4: SECURITY: DoS attack by non-http request
Date: Mon, 13 Oct 2003 03:00:16 -0300
```
Package: tomcat4
Version: 4.0.3-3woody2
Severity: grave
Justification: user security hole
Tags: patch

Hi,

	Tomcat from stable has a vulnerability in the catalina's
HttProcessor.java. Sending an invalid request makes the HttpProcessor
unable to respond futher request. Because the number of HttpProcessor is
limited (75 by default), this is a very easy DoS attack.

	It can be reproduced sending a line which is not a HTTP request,
just any junk:

-----------------------------------------------------------
$ telnet 127.0.0.1 8180
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to 127.0.0.1.
Escape character is '^]'.
die
^]
telnet> c
Connection closed.
-----------------------------------------------------------

which follows ...

/var/log/tomcat4/catalina_log.2003-10-13.txt---------------
2003-10-13 02:17:54 HttpProcessor[8180][4] process.parse

        at org.apache.catalina.connector.http.HttpProcessor.run(HttpProcessor.java:1107)
        at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:484)
----------------------------------------------------------

	At this point, the HttProcesor #4 is dead and will not respond
more requests. Repeating the non-http request will hang all available
HttProcessors.

	It can also be reproduced using nessus scanner (from unstable)
with all attacks marked. After all HttpProcessors are exhausted, tomcat
cannot serve any more requests and must be restarted.

-----------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------

	We fixed locally this bug with the following patch based on
tomcat 4.1.27, it passed our test and nessus scanner. However, there are
many other possible flaws in the actual code in 4.0.3-woody2 that seems
fixed in the 4.1 series. We think it should be more sane to move
tomcat-4.1 to stable, now that 4.0 is marked obsolete by the Jakarta
Project.

Thanks in advance,

Thanks for this report. It seems like only the HTTP/1.1 connector in the
org.apache.catalina.connector.http package is affected, but not the
HTTP/1.0 connector in the org.apache.catalina.connector.http10 package
(which is not used in the default configuration).

To actually trigger the DoS you can simply use:

for i in `seq 75`; do echo die | netcat -q 1 <hostname> 8180; done

Thanks a lot for the patch. I'm currently preparing a security update.
This will then be the third update for tomcat4 since the release of
Debian 3.0.

I know :-(

The security team won't accept a new upstream release for stable.
Especially in this case, since tomcat 4.1 from unstable has a lot more
dependencies than version 4.0 and most of them can't be satisfied in stable.

### Apache Tomcat 4.x vulnerabilities

This page lists all security vulnerabilities fixed in released versions
of Apache Tomcat® 4.x. Each vulnerability is given a
[security impact rating](security-impact.html) by the Apache
Tomcat security team — please note that this rating may vary from
platform to platform. We also list the versions of Apache Tomcat the flaw
is known to affect, and where a flaw has not been verified list the
version with a question mark.

**Note:** Vulnerabilities that are not Tomcat vulnerabilities
but have either been incorrectly reported against Tomcat or where Tomcat
provides a workaround are listed at the end of this page.

**Please note that Tomcat 4.0.x and 4.1.x are no longer supported.
Further vulnerabilities in the 4.0.x and 4.1.x branches will not be
fixed. Users should upgrade to 8.5.x or later to obtain security fixes.**

Please send comments or corrections for these vulnerabilities to the

### Will not be fixed in Apache Tomcat 4.1.x

**Moderate: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2005-4836](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-4836)

The deprecated HTTP/1.1 connector does not reject request URIs containing
null bytes when used with contexts that are configured with
allowLinking="true". Failure to reject the null byte enables an attacker
to obtain the source for any JSP page in these contexts. Users of Tomcat
4.1.x are advised to use the default, supported Coyote HTTP/1.1 connector
which does not exhibit this issue. There are no plans to issue an update
to Tomcat 4.1.x for this issue.

Affects: 4.1.15-4.1.SVN

### Fixed in Apache Tomcat 4.1.40

**Important: Information Disclosure**
[CVE-2008-5515](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-5515)

When using a RequestDispatcher obtained from the Request, the target path
was normalised before the query string was removed. A request that
included a specially crafted request parameter could be used to access
content that would otherwise be protected by a security constraint or by
locating it in under the WEB-INF directory.

This was fixed in revisions [782763](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=782763) and
[783292](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=783292).

Affects: 4.1.0-4.1.39

**Important: Denial of Service**
[CVE-2009-0033](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0033)

If Tomcat receives a request with invalid headers via the Java AJP
connector, it does not return an error and instead closes the AJP
connection. In case this connector is member of a mod\_jk load balancing
worker, this member will be put into an error state and will be blocked
from use for approximately one minute. Thus the behaviour can be used for
a denial of service attack using a carefully crafted request.

This was fixed in [revision 781362](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=781362).

Affects: 4.1.0-4.1.39

**Low: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2009-0580](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0580)

Due to insufficient error checking in some authentication classes, Tomcat
allows for the enumeration (brute force testing) of user names by
supplying illegally URL encoded passwords. The attack is possible if FORM
based authentication (j\_security\_check) is used with the MemoryRealm.
Note that in early versions, the DataSourceRealm and JDBCRealm were also
affected.

This was fixed in [revision 781382](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=781382).

Affects: 4.1.0-4.1.39 (Memory Realm), 4.1.0-4.1.31 (JDBC Realm),
4.1.17-4.1.31 (DataSource Realm)

**Low: Cross-site scripting**
[CVE-2009-0781](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0781)

The calendar application in the examples web application contains an
XSS flaw due to invalid HTML which renders the XSS filtering protection
ineffective.

This was fixed in [revision 750927](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=750927).

Affects: 4.1.0-4.1.39

**Low: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2009-0783](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0783)

Bugs [29936](https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=29936) and [45933](https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=45933)
allowed a web application to replace the XML parser used by
Tomcat to process web.xml and tld files. In limited circumstances these
bugs may allow a rogue web application to view and/or alter the web.xml
and tld files of other web applications deployed on the Tomcat instance.

This was fixed in [revision 781708](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=781708).

Affects: 4.1.0-4.1.39

### Fixed in Apache Tomcat 4.1.39

**Moderate: Session hi-jacking**
[CVE-2008-0128](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-0128)

When using the SingleSignOn Valve via https the Cookie JSESSIONIDSSO is
transmitted without the "secure" attribute, resulting in it being
transmitted to any content that is - by purpose or error - requested via
http from the same server.

This was fixed in [revision 684900](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=684900).

Affects: 4.1.0-4.1.37

**Low: Cross-site scripting**
[CVE-2008-1232](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-1232)

The message argument of HttpServletResponse.sendError() call is not only
displayed on the error page, but is also used for the reason-phrase of
HTTP response. This may include characters that are illegal in HTTP
headers. It is possible for a specially crafted message to result in
arbitrary content being injected into the HTTP response. For a successful
XSS attack, unfiltered user supplied data must be included in the message
argument.

This was fixed in [revision 680947](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=680947).

Affects: 4.1.0-4.1.37

**Important: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2008-2370](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-2370)

When using a RequestDispatcher the target path was normalised before the
query string was removed. A request that included a specially crafted
request parameter could be used to access content that would otherwise be
protected by a security constraint or by locating it in under the WEB-INF
directory.

This was fixed in [revision 680950](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=680950).

Affects: 4.1.0-4.1.37

### Fixed in Apache Tomcat 4.1.37

**Important: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2005-3164](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-3164)

If a client specifies a Content-Length but disconnects before sending
any of the request body, the deprecated AJP connector processes the
request using the request body of the previous request. Users are advised
to use the default, supported Coyote AJP connector which does not exhibit
this issue.

Affects: 4.0.1-4.0.6, 4.1.0-4.1.36

**Moderate: Cross-site scripting**
[CVE-2007-1355](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-1355)

The JSP and Servlet included in the sample application within the Tomcat
documentation webapp did not escape user provided data before including
it in the output. This enabled a XSS attack. These pages have been
simplified not to use any user provided data in the output.

Affects: 4.0.1-4.0.6, 4.1.0-4.1.36

**Low: Cross-site scripting**
[CVE-2007-2449](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2449)

JSPs within the examples web application did not escape user provided
data before including it in the output. This enabled a XSS attack. These
JSPs now filter the data before use. This issue may be mitigated by
undeploying the examples web application. Note that it is recommended
that the examples web application is not installed on a production
system.

Affects: 4.0.0-4.0.6, 4.1.0-4.1.36

**Low: Cross-site scripting**
[CVE-2007-2450](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2450)

The Manager web application did not escape user provided data before
including it in the output. This enabled a XSS attack. This application
now filters the data before use. This issue may be mitigated by logging
out (closing the browser) of the application once the management tasks
have been completed.

Affects: 4.0.1-4.0.6, 4.1.0-4.1.36

**Low: Session hi-jacking**
[CVE-2007-3382](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-3382)

Tomcat incorrectly treated a single quote character (') in a cookie
value as a delimiter. In some circumstances this lead to the leaking of
information such as session ID to an attacker.

Affects: 4.1.0-4.1.36

**Low: Cross-site scripting**
[CVE-2007-3383](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-3383)

When reporting error messages, the SendMailServlet (part of the examples
web application) did not escape user provided data before including it in
the output. This enabled a XSS attack. This Servlet now filters the data
before use. This issue may be mitigated by undeploying the examples web
application. Note that it is recommended that the examples web
application is not installed on a production system.

Affects: 4.0.0-4.0.6, 4.1.0-4.1.36

**Low: Session hi-jacking**
[CVE-2007-3385](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-3385)

Tomcat incorrectly handled the character sequence \" in a cookie value.
In some circumstances this lead to the leaking of information such as
session ID to an attacker.

Affects: 4.1.0-4.1.36

**Low: Session hi-jacking**
[CVE-2007-5333](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-5333)

The previous fix for
[CVE-2007-3385](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-3385) was incomplete. It did not consider the
use of quotes or %5C within a cookie value.

Affects: 4.1.0-4.1.36

**Important: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2007-5461](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-5461)

When Tomcat's WebDAV servlet is configured for use with a context and
has been enabled for write, some WebDAV requests that specify an entity
with a SYSTEM tag can result in the contents of arbitary files being
returned to the client.

Affects: 4.0.0-4.0.6, 4.1.0-4.1.36

### Fixed in Apache Tomcat 4.1.36

**Important: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2005-2090](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-2090)

Requests with multiple content-length headers should be rejected as
invalid. When multiple components (firewalls, caches, proxies and Tomcat)
process a sequence of requests where one or more requests contain
multiple content-length headers and several components do not
reject the request and make different decisions as to which
content-length header to use an attacker can poison a web-cache, perform
an XSS attack and obtain sensitive information from requests other then
their own. Tomcat now returns 400 for requests with multiple
content-length headers.

Affects: 4.0.0-4.0.6, 4.1.0-4.1.34

**Important: Directory traversal**
[CVE-2007-0450](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-0450)

The fix for this issue was insufficient. A fix was also required in the
JK connector module for httpd. See
[CVE-2007-1860](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-1860) for further information.

Tomcat permits '\', '%2F' and '%5C' as path delimiters. When Tomcat is
used behind a proxy (including, but not limited to, Apache HTTP server
with mod\_proxy and mod\_jk) configured to only proxy some contexts, a HTTP
request containing strings like "/\../" may allow attackers to work
around the context restriction of the proxy, and access the non-proxied
contexts.

The following Java system properties have been added to Tomcat to provide
additional control of the handling of path delimiters in URLs (both
options default to false):

* `org.apache.tomcat.util.buf.UDecoder.ALLOW_ENCODED_SLASH`:
  `true|false`
* `org.apache.catalina.connector.CoyoteAdapter.ALLOW_BACKSLASH`:
  `true|false`

Due to the impossibility to guarantee that all URLs are handled by Tomcat
as they are in proxy servers, Tomcat should always be secured as if no
proxy restricting context access was used.

Affects: 4.0.0-4.0.6, 4.1.0-4.1.34

**Low: Cross-site scripting**
[CVE-2007-1358](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-1358)

Web pages that display the Accept-Language header value sent by the
client are susceptible to a cross-site scripting attack if they assume
the Accept-Language header value conforms to RFC 2616. Under normal
circumstances this would not be possible to exploit, however older
versions of Flash player were known to allow carefully crafted malicious
Flash files to make requests with such custom headers. When generating
the response for `getLocale()` and `getLocales()`,
Tomcat now ignores values for Accept-Language headers that do not conform
to RFC 2616. Applications that use the raw header values directly should
not assume that the headers conform to RFC 2616 and should filter the
values appropriately.

Affects: 4.0.0-4.0.6, 4.1.0-4.1.34

### Fixed in Apache Tomcat 4.1.35

**Low: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2008-4308](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-4308)

[Bug
40771](https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=40771) may result in the disclosure of POSTed content from a previous
request. For a vulnerability to exist, the content read from the input
stream must be disclosed, eg via writing it to the response and committing
the response, before the ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException occurs which will
halt processing of the request.

Affects: 4.1.32-4.1.34 (4.0.x unknown)

### Fixed in Apache Tomcat 4.1.32

**Low: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2008-3271](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-3271)

[Bug 25835](https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=25835) can, in rare circumstances - this has only been reproduced
using a debugger to force a particular processing sequence for two threads -
allow a user from a non-permitted IP address to gain access to a context
that is protected with a valve that extends RequestFilterValve. This includes
the standard RemoteAddrValve and RemoteHostValve implementations.

Affects: 4.1.0-4.1.31

**Important: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2007-1858](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-1858)

The default SSL configuration permitted the use of insecure cipher suites
including the anonymous cipher suite. The default configuration no
longer permits the use of insecure cipher suites.

Affects: 4.1.28-4.1.31

**Low: Cross-site scripting**
[CVE-2006-7196](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-7196)

The calendar application included as part of the JSP examples is
susceptible to a cross-site scripting attack as it does not escape
user provided data before including it in the returned page.

Affects: 4.0.0-4.0.6, 4.1.0-4.1.31

**Low: Directory listing**
[CVE-2006-3835](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-3835)

This is expected behaviour when directory listings are enabled. The
semicolon (;) is the separator for path parameters so inserting one
before a file name changes the request into a request for a directory
with a path parameter. If directory listings are enabled, a diretcory
listing will be shown. In response to this and other directory listing
issues, directory listings were changed to be disabled by default.

Affects: 4.0.0-4.0.6, 4.1.0-4.1.31

**Low: Cross-site scripting**
[CVE-2005-4838](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-4838)

Various JSPs included as part of the JSP examples and the Tomcat Manager
are susceptible to a cross-site scripting attack as they do not escape
user provided data before including it in the returned page.

Affects: 4.0.0-4.0.6, 4.1.0-4.1.31

**Important: Denial of service**
[CVE-2005-3510](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-3510)

The root cause is the relatively expensive calls required to generate
the content for the directory listings. If directory listings are
enabled, the number of files in each directory should be kepp to a
minimum. In response to this issue, directory listings were changed to
be disabled by default. Additionally, a
[patch](http://marc.info/?l=tomcat-dev&m=113356822719767&w=2) has been proposed that would improve performance, particularly
for large directories, by caching directory listings.

Affects: 4.0.0-4.0.6, 4.1.0-4.1.31

### Fixed in Apache Tomcat 4.1.29

**Moderate: Cross-site scripting**
[CVE-2002-1567](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2002-1567)

The unmodified requested URL is included in the 404 response header. The
new lines in this URL appear to the client to be the end of the header
section. The remaining part of the URL, including the script elements, is
treated as part of the response body and the client executes the script.
Tomcat now replaces potentially unsafe characters in the response
headers with spaces.

Affects: 4.1.0-4.1.28

### Fixed in Apache Tomcat 4.1.13, 4.0.6

**Important: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2002-1394](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2002-1394)

A specially crafted URL using the invoker servlet in conjunction with the
default servlet can enable an attacker to obtain the source of JSP pages
or, under special circumstances, a static resource that would otherwise
have been protected by a security constraint without the need to be
properly authenticated. This is a variation of
[CVE-2002-1148](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2002-1148)

Affects: 4.0.0-4.0.5, 4.1.0-4.1.12

**Moderate: Cross-site scripting**
[CVE-2002-0682](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2002-0682)

A specially crafted URL using the invoker servlet and various internal
classess causes Tomcat to throw an exception that includes unescaped
information from the malformed request. This allows the XSS attack.

Affects: 4.0.0-4.0.5, 4.1.0-4.1.12

### Fixed in Apache Tomcat 4.1.12, 4.0.5

**Important: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2002-1148](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2002-1148)

A specially crafted URL using the default servlet can enable an attacker
to obtain the source of JSP pages.

Affects: 4.0.0-4.0.4, 4.1.0-4.1.11

### Fixed in Apache Tomcat 4.1.3

**Important: Denial of service**
[CVE-2002-0935](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2002-0935)

A malformed HTTP request can cause the request processing thread to
become unresponsive. A sequence of such requests will cause all request
processing threads, and hence Tomcat as a whole, to become unresponsive.

Affects: 4.0.0-4.0.2?, 4.0.3, 4.0.4-4.0.6?, 4.1.0-4.1.2?

### Fixed in Apache Tomcat 4.1.0

**Important: Denial of service**
[CVE-2003-0866](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2003-0866)

A malformed HTTP request can cause the request processing thread to
become unresponsive. A sequence of such requests will cause all request

**Low: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2002-2006](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2002-2006)

The snoop and trouble shooting servlets installed as part of the examples
include output that identifies the Tomcat installation path.

Affects: 4.0.0-4.0.6

### Fixed in Apache Tomcat 4.0.2

**Low: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2002-2009](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2002-2009),
[CVE-2001-0917](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2001-0917)

Requests for JSP files where the file name is preceded by '+/', '>/',
'</' or '%20/' or a request for a JSP with a long file name would
result in in an error page that included the full file system path to
the JSP file.

Affects: 4.0.0-4.0.1

### Fixed in Apache Tomcat 4.0.0

**Moderate: Security manager bypass**
[CVE-2002-0493](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2002-0493)

If errors are encountered during the parsing of web.xml and Tomcat is
configured to use a security manager it is possible for Tomcat to start
without the security manager in place.

Affects: Pre-release builds of 4.0.0

### Unverified

**Low: Installation path disclosure**
[CVE-2005-4703](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-4703),
[CVE-2002-2008](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2002-2008)

This issue only affects Windows operating systems. It can not be
reproduced on Windows XP Home with JDKs 1.3.1, 1.4.2, 1.5.0 or 1.6.0.
Further investigation is required to determine the Windows operating
system and JDK combinations that do exhibit this issue. The
vulnerability reports for this issue state that it is fixed in 4.1.3
onwards.

Affects: 4.0.3?

**Important: Denial of service**
[CVE-2002-1895](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2002-1895)

This issue only affects configurations that use IIS in conjunction with
Tomcat and the AJP1.3 connector. It can not be reproduced using Windows
2000 SP4 with latest patches and Tomcat 4.0.4 with JDK 1.3.1. The
vulnerability reports for this issue state that it is fixed in 4.1.10
onwards.

Affects: 4.0.4?

### Not a vulnerability in Tomcat

**Important: Directory traversal**
[CVE-2008-2938](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-2938)

Originally reported as a Tomcat vulnerability the root cause of this
issue is that the JVM does not correctly decode UTF-8 encoded URLs to
UTF-8. This exposes a directory traversal vulnerability when the
connector uses `URIEncoding="UTF-8"`. This directory traversal
is limited to the docBase of the web application.

If a context is configured with `allowLinking="true"` then the
directory traversal vulnerability is extended to the entire file system
of the host server.

It should also be noted that setting
`useBodyEncodingForURI="true"` has the same effect as setting
`URIEncoding="UTF-8"` when processing requests with bodies
encoded with UTF-8.

Although the root cause was quickly identified as a JVM issue and that it
affected multiple JVMs from multiple vendors, it was decided to report
this as a Tomcat vulnerability until such time as the JVM vendors
provided updates to resolve this issue. For further information on the
status of this issue for your JVM, contact your JVM vendor.

A workaround was implemented in
[revision 681065](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=681065)
that protects against this and any similar character
encoding issues that may still exist in the JVM. This work around is
included in Tomcat 4.1.39 onwards.

**Denial of service vulnerability**
[CVE-2002-0936](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2002-0936)

The issue described requires an attacker to be able to plant a JSP page
on the Tomcat server. If an attacker can do this then the server is
already compromised. In this case an attacker could just as easily add a
page that called System.exit(1) rather than relying on a bug in an
internal Sun class.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
