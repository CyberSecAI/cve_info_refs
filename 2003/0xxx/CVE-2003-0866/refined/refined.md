      "source": "bugs.debian.org_2c63f2f2_20250125_141728.html",
      "root_cause": "A vulnerability exists in the `HttpProcessor.java` of Apache Tomcat. Sending an invalid (non-HTTP) request to the server makes the `HttpProcessor` unable to respond to further requests. Since the number of `HttpProcessor` instances is limited, this leads to a denial-of-service (DoS).",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The `HttpProcessor` does not properly handle invalid requests.",
        "The number of available `HttpProcessor` instances is limited."
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial-of-service by sending a series of malformed requests, making the server unresponsive. The server must be restarted to recover.",
      "attack_vector": "A remote attacker sends a malformed request, which is not a valid HTTP request, to the server.",
       "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server. No authentication is required."

     "root_cause": "A malformed HTTP request can cause the request processing thread to become unresponsive.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of malformed HTTP requests."

      "impact": "A sequence of malformed requests can cause all request processing threads to become unresponsive, leading to a denial of service.",
      "attack_vector": "Sending malformed HTTP requests.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to send requests to the server."
