Subject: potential buffer overflow in lprm
Date: Wed, 05 Mar 2003 15:26:22 -0700
From: "Todd C. Miller" <Todd.Miller@courtesan.com>
X-Loop: security-announce@openbsd.org

Sender: owner-security-announce@openbsd.org

A bounds check that was added to lprm in 1996 does its checking too
late to be effective.  Because of the insufficient check, it may
be possible for a local user to exploit lprm to gain elevated
privileges.  It is not know at this time whether or not the bug is
actually exploitable.

Starting with OpenBSD 3.2, lprm is setuid user daemon which limits
the impact of the bug.  OpenBSD 3.1 and below however, ship with
lprm setuid root so this is a potential localhost root hole on older
versions of OpenBSD.

The bug is fixed in OpenBSD-current as well as the 3.2 and 3.1
-stable branches.

Patch for OpenBSD 3.1:
ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.1/common/023_lprm.patch

Patch for OpenBSD 3.2:
ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.2/common/010_lprm.patch

Thanks go to Arne Woerner for noticing this bug.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
