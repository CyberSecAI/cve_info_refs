{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to flaws in the ISAKMP (Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol) decoding routines within tcpdump.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper parsing of ISAKMP packets",
      "Infinite loop vulnerability",
      "Potential for arbitrary code execution"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could cause tcpdump to enter an infinite loop, leading to a denial-of-service. There is also the possibility of arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the tcpdump process.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending specially crafted ISAKMP packets over the network",
       "Malformed ISAKMP packets"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to a system running a vulnerable version of tcpdump, and have the ability to craft malformed or specific ISAKMP packets."
  },
  "additional_information": {
        "affected_software": "tcpdump versions prior to 3.8.1, specifically in the ISAKMP decoding routines.",
         "discovery": "Discovered by George Bakos.",
       "related_cves": ["CAN-2003-0989", "CAN-2004-0055", "CAN-2004-0057"],
        "remediation": "Upgrade tcpdump to version 3.8.1 or later, or apply a vendor-supplied patch.",
         "vendor_statements": "Several vendors acknowledged the vulnerability and provided patches.  Some vendors stated they were not affected because they do not ship tcpdump, or are not vulnerable."
