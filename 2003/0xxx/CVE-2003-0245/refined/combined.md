Apache 2.0.46 Released

The Apache Software Foundation and the Apache HTTP Server Project are
pleased to announce the ninth public release of the Apache 2.0
HTTP Server.  This Announcement notes the significant changes in
2.0.46 as compared to 2.0.45.

This version of Apache is principally a security and bug fix release.
A summary of the bug fixes is given at the end of this document.
Of particular note is that 2.0.46 addresses two security
vulnerabilities:

Apache 2.0 versions 2.0.37 through 2.0.45 can be caused to crash in
certain circumstances.  This can be triggered remotely through mod\_dav
and possibly other mechanisms.  The crash was originally reported by
David Endler <DEndler@iDefense.com> and was researched and fixed by
Joe Orton <jorton@redhat.com>.  Specific details and an analysis of the
crash will be published Friday, May 30.  No more specific information
is disclosed at this time, but all Apache 2.0 users are encouraged to
upgrade now.
[<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0245>]

Apache 2.0 versions 2.0.40 through 2.0.45 on Unix platforms were
vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack on the basic authentication
module, which was reported by John Hughes <john.hughes@entegrity.com>.
A bug in the configuration scripts caused the apr\_password\_validate()
function to be thread-unsafe on platforms with crypt\_r(), including
AIX and Linux.  All versions of Apache 2.0 have this thread-safety
problem on platforms with no crypt\_r() and no thread-safe crypt(),
such as Mac OS X and possibly others.  When using a threaded MPM (which
is not the default on these platforms), this allows remote attackers
to create a denial of service which causes valid usernames and
passwords for Basic Authentication to fail until Apache is restarted.
We do not believe this bug could allow unauthorized users to gain
access to protected resources.
[<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0189>]

The Apache Software Foundation would like to thank David Endler
and John Hughes for the responsible reporting of these issues.

This release is compatible with modules compiled for 2.0.42 and later
versions.  We consider this release to be the best version of Apache
available and encourage users of all prior versions to upgrade.

Apache 2.0.46 is available for download from

<http://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi>

Please see the CHANGES\_2.0 file, linked from the above page, for
a full list of changes.

Apache 2.0 offers numerous enhancements, improvements, and performance
boosts over the 1.3 codebase.  For an overview of new features introduced
after 1.3 please see

<http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/new_features_2_0.html>

When upgrading or installing this version of Apache, please keep
in mind the following:

If you intend to use Apache with one of the threaded MPMs, you must
ensure that the modules (and the libraries they depend on) that you
will be using are thread-safe.  Please contact the vendors of these
modules to obtain this information.

Apache 2.0.46 Major changes

Security vulnerabilities closed since Apache 2.0.45

\*) SECURITY [CAN-2003-0245]: Fixed a bug that could be triggered
remotely through mod\_dav and possibly other mechanisms, causing
an Apache child process to crash.  The crash was first reported
by David Endler <DEndler@iDefense.com> and was researched and
fixed by Joe Orton <jorton@redhat.com>.  Details will be released
on 30 May 2003.

\*) SECURITY [CAN-2003-0189]: Fixed a denial-of-service vulnerability
affecting basic authentication on Unix platforms related to
thread-safety in apr\_password\_validate().  The problem was reported
by John Hughes <john.hughes@entegrity.com>

Bugs fixed and features added since Apache 2.0.45

\*) Fix for mod\_dav.  Call the 'can\_be\_activity' callback, if provided,
when a MKACTIVITY request comes in.
[Ben Collins-Sussman <sussman@collab.net>]

\*) Perform run-time query in apxs for apr and apr-util's includes.
[Justin Erenkrantz]

\*) run libtool from the apr install directory (in case that is different
from the apache install directory) [Jeff Trawick]

\*) configure.in: Play nice with libtool-1.5. [Wilfredo Sanchez]

\*) If mod\_mime\_magic does not know the content-type, do not attempt to
guess.  PR 16908.  [Andrew Gapon <agapon@telcordia.com>]

\*) ssl session caching(shmht) : Fix a SEGV problem with SHMHT session
caching. PR 17864.
[Andreas Leimbacher <andreasl67@yahoo.de>, Madhusudan Mathihalli]

\*) Add a delete flag to htpasswd.
[Thom May]

\*) Fix mod\_rewrite's handling of absolute URIs. The escaping routines
now work scheme dependent and the query string will only be
appended if supported by the particular scheme.  [André Malo]

\*) Add another check for already compressed content in mod\_deflate.
PR 19913. [Tsuyoshi SASAMOTO <nazonazo@super.win.ne.jp>]

\*) Fixes for VPATH builds; copying special.mk and any future .mk files
from the source tree as well as the build tree (now creates a usable
configuration for apxs), and eliminated redundant -I'nclude paths.
[William Rowe]

\*) Code fixes, constness corrections and ssl\_toolkit\_compat.h updates
for SSLC and OpenSSL toolkit compatibility.  Still work remains to
be done to cripple features based on the limitations of RSA's binary
distribution of their SSL-C toolkit.
[William Rowe, Madhusudan Mathihalli, Jeff Trawick]

\*) Linux 2.4+: If Apache is started as root and you code
CoreDumpDirectory, coredumps are enabled via the prctl() syscall.
[Greg Ames]

\*) ap\_get\_mime\_headers\_core: allocate space for the trailing null
when folding is in effect.
PR 18170 [Peter Mayne <PeterMayne@SPAM\_SUX.ap.spherion.com>]

\*) Fix --enable-mods-shared=most and other variants.  [Aaron Bannert]

\*) mod\_log\_config: Add the ability to log the id of the thread
processing the request via new %P formats.  [Jeff Trawick]

\*) Use appropriate language codes for Czech (cs) and Traditional Chinese
(zh-tw) in default config files. PR 9427.  [André Malo]

\*) mod\_auth\_ldap: Use generic whitespace character class when parsing
"require" directives, instead of literal spaces only. PR 17135.
[André Malo]

\*) Hook mod\_rewrite's type checker before mod\_mime's one. That way the
RewriteRule [T=...] Flag should work as expected now. PR 19626.
[André Malo]

\*) htpasswd: Check the processed file on validity. If a line is not empty
and not a comment, it must contain at least one colon. Otherwise exit
with error code 7. [Kris Verbeeck <Kris.Verbeeck@ubizen.com>, Thom May]

\*) Fix a problem that caused httpd to be linked with incorrect flags
on some platforms when mod\_so was enabled by default, breaking
DSOs on AIX.  PR 19012  [Jeff Trawick]

\*) By default, use the same CC and CPP with which APR was built.
The user can override with CC and CPP environment variables.
[Jeff Trawick]

\*) Fix ap\_construct\_url() so that it surrounds IPv6 literal address
strings with [].  This fixes certain types of redirection.
PR 19207.  [Jeff Trawick]

\*) forward port of buffer overflow fixes for htdigest. [Thom May]

\*) Added AllowEncodedSlashes directive to permit control of whether
the server will accept encoded slashes ('%2f') in the URI path.
Default condition is off (the historical behaviour).  This permits
environments in which the path-info needs to contain encoded
slashes.  PR 543, 2389, 3581, 3589, 5687, 7066, 7865, 14639.
[Ken Coar]

\*) When using Redirect in directory context, append requested query
string if there's no one supplied by configuration. PR 10961.
[André Malo]

\*) Unescape the supplied wildcard pattern in mod\_autoindex. Otherwise
the pattern will not always match as desired. PR 12596.
[André Malo]

\*) mod\_autoindex now emits and accepts modern query string parameter
delimiters (;). Thus column headers no longer contain unescaped
ampersands. PR 10880  [André Malo]

\*) Enable ap\_sock\_disable\_nagle for Windows. This along with the
addition of APR\_TCP\_NODELAY\_INHERITED to apr.hw will cause Nagle
to be disabled for Windows. [Allan Edwards]

\*) Correct a mis-correlation between mpm\_common.c and mpm\_common.h;
This patch reverts us to pre-2.0.46 behavior, using the
ap\_sock\_disable\_nagle noop macro, because ap\_sock\_disable\_nagle
was never compiled on Win32. [Allan Edwards, William Rowe]

\*) Fix a build problem with passing unsupported --enable-layout
args to apr and apr-util.  This broke binbuild.sh as well as
user-specified layout parameters.  PR 18649 [Justin Erenkrantz,
Jeff Trawick]

\*) If a Date response header was already set in the headers array,
this value was ignored in favour of the current time. This meant
that Date headers on proxied requests where rewritten when they
should not have been. PR: 14376 [Graham Leggett]

\*) Add code to buildconf that produces an httpd.spec file from
httpd.spec.in, using build/get-version.sh from APR.
[Graham Leggett]

\*) Fixed a segfault when multiple ProxyBlock directives were used.
PR: 19023 [Sami Tikka <sami.tikka@f-secure.com>]

\*) SECURITY [CAN-2003-0134] OS2: Fix a Denial of Service vulnerability
identified and reported by Robert Howard <rihoward@rawbw.com> that
where device names faulted the running OS2 worker process.
The fix is actually in APR 0.9.4.  [Brian Havard]

\*) Forward port: Escape special characters (especially control
characters) in mod\_log\_config to make a clear distinction between
client-supplied strings (with special characters) and server-side
strings. This was already introduced in version 1.3.25.
[André Malo]

\*) mod\_deflate: Check also err\_headers\_out for an already set
Content-Encoding: gzip header. This prevents gzip compressed content
from a CGI script from being compressed once more. PR 17797.
[André Malo]

PACKAGE   : apache
SUMMARY   : Apache 2 vulnerability
DATE      : 2003-06-16 18:27:00
ID        : CLA-2003:661
RELEVANT
RELEASES  : 9

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

DESCRIPTION
Apache[1] is the most popular webserver in use today.

This update addresses two security vulnerabilities which have been
fixed in the recently released[2] 2.0.46 version:

1) CAN-2003-0245[3]
iDefense published[5] an advisory about a vulnerability in the APR
library used by Apache 2. This library contains a vulnerability in
the apr\_psprintf() function which could be used to make apache
reference invalid memory.

The most immediate impact of this vulnerability is a Denial of
Service condition. Arbitrary command execution remains a possibility,
but is deemed to be difficult to achieve outside a controlled
environment.

The packages provided with this update contain a fix for this
vulnerability.

2) CAN-2003-0189[4]
A problem with the build configuration scripts caused the Apache
basic authentication module to not be thread-safe. Systems running a
threaded server would then be vulnerable to a Denial of Service
condition when authenticating users using this module. Apache in
Conectiva Linux 9 is \*not\* vulnerable to this issue because it is not
built with threads support. However, the packages available through
this update have been patched to fix this problem to allow users to
recompile Apache with threads support in the event they choose to do
so.

SOLUTION
It is recommended that all Apache users upgrade their packages.

IMPORTANT: it is necessary to manually restart the httpd server after
upgrading the packages. In order to do this, execute the following as
root:

service apache stop

(wait a few seconds and check with "ps ax|grep httpd" if there are
any httpd processes running. On a busy webserver this could take a
little longer)

CHANGE SUMMARY:  Rev. 01 Added IPv6 information

-----------------------------------------------------------------
A. Background
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
<<http://cve.mitre.org/>> has identified potential vulnerabilities
in the Apache HTTP Server (CAN-2003-0189, CAN-2003-0245). These
affect the following HP products on HP-UX releases B.11.00,
B.11.11 and B.11.22:

- HPApache/B9416AA and HPApache/B9416BA (all versions)

- hp-ux apache-based web server products hpuxwsAPACHE and
hpuxwsApache, v.1.0.05.01 or earlier.

Note: The following are not vulnerable:
HP OpenVMS
HP NonStop Servers
HP Tru64 UNIX
HP Tru64 OpenVMS

\*\*REVISED 01\*\*
B. Recommended solution
The Apache Software Foundation has released Apache 2.0.46 as
the best known version fixing the potential vulnerabilities
mentioned above.

HP has incorporated Apache 2.0.46 in the following product:

- hp-ux apache-based web server v.1.0.06.01 or later,
available from:
<http://www.software.hp.com/cgi-bin/swdepot_parser.cgi/cgi/>
displayProductInfo.pl?productNumber=HPUXWSSUITE

\*\*REVISED 01\*\*

--->> NOTE: The IPv6 solution is now available.  Please refer to
--->> documentation and depot's available from software.hp.com
--->> Click on "internet ready and networking"
--->> and look for "hp-ux apache-based web server
--->> v.1.0.07.01 for ipv6 powered by apache, tomcat, webmin.

Check for Apache Installation
-----------------------------
To determine if the Apache web server from HP is installed on
your system, use Software Distributor's swlist command.  More
than one version may be present on a single system.

For example, the results of the command
swlist -l product | grep -i apache

HPApache      2.0.39.01.02  HP Apache-based Web Server
hpuxwsAPACHE  A.1.0.05.01   HP-UX Apache-based Web Server

Stop Apache
-----------------------------
Before updating, make sure to stop any previous Apache binary.
Otherwise, the previous binary will continue running,
preventing the new one from starting, although the
installation would be successful.

After determining which Apache is installed, stop Apache with
the following commands:

for HPApache:        /opt/hpapache2/bin/apachectl stop
for hpuxwsAPACHE:    /opt/hpws/apache/bin/apachectl stop

Download and Install Apache
-----------------------------
- Download Apache from Software Depot using the previously
mentioned links.
- Verify successful download by comparing the cksum with the
value specified on the installation web page.
- Use SD to swinstall the depot.
- For customers with HPApache/B9416AA or HPApache/B9416BA
installed, migrate to hpuxwsAPACHE/hpuxwsApache and
remove the affected products from the system.

Installation of this new version of HP Apache over an existing
HP Apache installation is supported, whereas installation over
a non-HP Apache is NOT supported.

Removing Apache Installation
----------------------------
If you prefer to remove Apache from your system rather than
install a newer version to resolve the security problem, use
both Software Distributor's "swremove" command and also
"rm -rf" the home location as specified in the rc.config.d
file "HOME" variables.

To find the files containing HOME variables in the
/etc/rc.config.d directory:

%ls /etc/rc.config.d | grep apache
hpapache2conf
hpws\_apacheconf

Mandrake Linux Security Update Advisory
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Package name:           apache2
Advisory ID:            MDKSA-2003:063-1
Date:                   June 2nd, 2003
Original Advisory Date: May 30th, 2003
Affected versions:9.1
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Problem Description:

Two vulnerabilities were discovered in the Apache web server that
affect all 2.x versions prior to 2.0.46.  The first, discovered by John
Hughes, is a build system problem that allows remote attackers to
prevent access to authenticated content when a threaded server is used.
This only affects versions of Apache compiled with threaded server
"httpd.worker", which is not the default for Mandrake Linux.

The second vulnerability, discovered by iDefense, allows remote
attackers to cause a DoS (Denial of Service) condition and may also
allow the execution of arbitrary code.

The provided packages include back-ported fixes to correct these
vulnerabilities and MandrakeSoft encourages all users to upgrade
immediately.

Update:

The previous update mistakenly listed apache-conf packages which were
never included, nor intended to be included, as part of the update.

Red Hat Security Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated httpd packages fix Apache security vulnerabilities
Advisory ID:       RHSA-2003:186-01
Issue date:        2003-05-28
Updated on:        2003-05-28
Product:           Red Hat Linux
Keywords:          Apache httpd auth remote
Cross references:
Obsoletes:
CVE Names:         CAN-2003-0189 CAN-2003-0245
---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Topic:

Updated httpd packages that fix two security issues are now available for
Red Hat Linux 8.0 and 9.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 8.0 - i386
Red Hat Linux 9 - i386

3. Problem description:

The Apache HTTP server is a powerful, full-featured, efficient, and
freely-available Web server.

A bug in Apache 2.0 through 2.0.45 allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service, and may allow execution of arbitrary code.  This bug
affects both Red Hat Linux 8.0 and 9.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0245 to
this issue.

A build system problem in Apache 2.0 through 2.0.45 allows remote attackers
to cause a denial of access to authenticated content when a threaded
server is used.   This bug affects only Red Hat Linux 9 when the threaded
server "httpd.worker" has been configured, which is not the default.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name CAN-2003-0189 to this issue.

All users of the Apache HTTP Web Server are advised to upgrade to the
applicable errata packages, which contain back-ported fixes correcting
these issues, and applied to Apache version 2.0.40.

After the errata packages are installed, restart the Web service by running
the following command:

/sbin/service httpd restart

Red Hat would like to thank iDefense who initially discovered CAN-2003-0245
and John Hughes for CAN-2003-0189.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (\*.rpm) if your current directory \*only\* contains the
desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

5. Bug IDs fixed (<http://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla> for more info):

88575 - Byte Range implementation fix
89170 - fullstatus segfaults apachectl
89179 - mod\_proxy (forward proxy) inserts empty line before header

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

                       Apache 2.0.46 Released

   The Apache Software Foundation and the Apache HTTP Server Project are
   pleased to announce the ninth public release of the Apache 2.0
   HTTP Server.  This Announcement notes the significant changes in
   2.0.46 as compared to 2.0.45.

   This version of Apache is principally a security and bug fix release.
   A summary of the bug fixes is given at the end of this document.
   Of particular note is that 2.0.46 addresses two security
   vulnerabilities:

   Apache 2.0 versions 2.0.37 through 2.0.45 can be caused to crash in
   certain circumstances.  This can be triggered remotely through mod_dav
   and possibly other mechanisms.  The crash was originally reported by
   David Endler <DEndler@iDefense.com> and was researched and fixed by
   Joe Orton <jorton@redhat.com>.  Specific details and an analysis of the
   crash will be published Friday, May 30.  No more specific information
   is disclosed at this time, but all Apache 2.0 users are encouraged to
   upgrade now.
   [<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0245>]

   Apache 2.0 versions 2.0.40 through 2.0.45 on Unix platforms were
   vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack on the basic authentication
   module, which was reported by John Hughes <john.hughes@entegrity.com>.
   A bug in the configuration scripts caused the apr_password_validate()
   function to be thread-unsafe on platforms with crypt_r(), including
   AIX and Linux.  All versions of Apache 2.0 have this thread-safety
   problem on platforms with no crypt_r() and no thread-safe crypt(),
   such as Mac OS X and possibly others.  When using a threaded MPM (which
   is not the default on these platforms), this allows remote attackers
   to create a denial of service which causes valid usernames and
   passwords for Basic Authentication to fail until Apache is restarted.
   We do not believe this bug could allow unauthorized users to gain
   access to protected resources.
   [<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0189>]

   The Apache Software Foundation would like to thank David Endler
   and John Hughes for the responsible reporting of these issues.

   This release is compatible with modules compiled for 2.0.42 and later
   versions.  We consider this release to be the best version of Apache
   available and encourage users of all prior versions to upgrade.

   Apache 2.0.46 is available for download from

     <http://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi>

   Please see the CHANGES_2.0 file, linked from the above page, for
   a full list of changes.

   Apache 2.0 offers numerous enhancements, improvements, and performance
   boosts over the 1.3 codebase.  For an overview of new features introduced
   after 1.3 please see

     <http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/new_features_2_0.html>

   When upgrading or installing this version of Apache, please keep
   in mind the following:

   If you intend to use Apache with one of the threaded MPMs, you must
   ensure that the modules (and the libraries they depend on) that you
   will be using are thread-safe.  Please contact the vendors of these
   modules to obtain this information.

                       Apache 2.0.46 Major changes

   Security vulnerabilities closed since Apache 2.0.45

    *) SECURITY [CAN-2003-0245]: Fixed a bug that could be triggered
       remotely through mod_dav and possibly other mechanisms, causing
       an Apache child process to crash.  The crash was first reported
       by David Endler <DEndler@iDefense.com> and was researched and
       fixed by Joe Orton <jorton@redhat.com>.  Details will be released
       on 30 May 2003.

    *) SECURITY [CAN-2003-0189]: Fixed a denial-of-service vulnerability
       affecting basic authentication on Unix platforms related to
       thread-safety in apr_password_validate().  The problem was reported
       by John Hughes <john.hughes@entegrity.com>

   Bugs fixed and features added since Apache 2.0.45

    *) Fix for mod_dav.  Call the 'can_be_activity' callback, if provided,
       when a MKACTIVITY request comes in.
       [Ben Collins-Sussman <sussman@collab.net>]

    *) Perform run-time query in apxs for apr and apr-util's includes.
       [Justin Erenkrantz]

    *) run libtool from the apr install directory (in case that is different
       from the apache install directory) [Jeff Trawick]

    *) configure.in: Play nice with libtool-1.5. [Wilfredo Sanchez]

    *) If mod_mime_magic does not know the content-type, do not attempt to
       guess.  PR 16908.  [Andrew Gapon <agapon@telcordia.com>]

    *) ssl session caching(shmht) : Fix a SEGV problem with SHMHT session
       caching. PR 17864.
       [Andreas Leimbacher <andreasl67@yahoo.de>, Madhusudan Mathihalli]

    *) Add a delete flag to htpasswd.
       [Thom May]

    *) Fix mod_rewrite's handling of absolute URIs. The escaping routines
       now work scheme dependent and the query string will only be
       appended if supported by the particular scheme.  [André Malo]

    *) Add another check for already compressed content in mod_deflate.
       PR 19913. [Tsuyoshi SASAMOTO <nazonazo@super.win.ne.jp>]

    *) Fixes for VPATH builds; copying special.mk and any future .mk files
       from the source tree as well as the build tree (now creates a usable
       configuration for apxs), and eliminated redundant -I'nclude paths.
       [William Rowe]

    *) Code fixes, constness corrections and ssl_toolkit_compat.h updates
       for SSLC and OpenSSL toolkit compatibility.  Still work remains to
       be done to cripple features based on the limitations of RSA's binary
       distribution of their SSL-C toolkit.
       [William Rowe, Madhusudan Mathihalli, Jeff Trawick]

    *) Linux 2.4+: If Apache is started as root and you code
       CoreDumpDirectory, coredumps are enabled via the prctl() syscall.
       [Greg Ames]

    *) ap_get_mime_headers_core: allocate space for the trailing null
       when folding is in effect.
       PR 18170 [Peter Mayne <PeterMayne@SPAM_SUX.ap.spherion.com>]

    *) Fix --enable-mods-shared=most and other variants.  [Aaron Bannert]

    *) mod_log_config: Add the ability to log the id of the thread
       processing the request via new %P formats.  [Jeff Trawick]

    *) Use appropriate language codes for Czech (cs) and Traditional Chinese
       (zh-tw) in default config files. PR 9427.  [André Malo]

    *) mod_auth_ldap: Use generic whitespace character class when parsing
       "require" directives, instead of literal spaces only. PR 17135.
       [André Malo]

    *) Hook mod_rewrite's type checker before mod_mime's one. That way the
       RewriteRule [T=...] Flag should work as expected now. PR 19626.
       [André Malo]

    *) htpasswd: Check the processed file on validity. If a line is not empty
       and not a comment, it must contain at least one colon. Otherwise exit
       with error code 7. [Kris Verbeeck <Kris.Verbeeck@ubizen.com>, Thom May]

    *) Fix a problem that caused httpd to be linked with incorrect flags
       on some platforms when mod_so was enabled by default, breaking
       DSOs on AIX.  PR 19012  [Jeff Trawick]

    *) By default, use the same CC and CPP with which APR was built.
       The user can override with CC and CPP environment variables.
       [Jeff Trawick]

    *) Fix ap_construct_url() so that it surrounds IPv6 literal address
       strings with [].  This fixes certain types of redirection.
       PR 19207.  [Jeff Trawick]

    *) forward port of buffer overflow fixes for htdigest. [Thom May]

    *) Added AllowEncodedSlashes directive to permit control of whether
       the server will accept encoded slashes ('%2f') in the URI path.
       Default condition is off (the historical behaviour).  This permits
       environments in which the path-info needs to contain encoded
       slashes.  PR 543, 2389, 3581, 3589, 5687, 7066, 7865, 14639.
       [Ken Coar]

    *) When using Redirect in directory context, append requested query
       string if there's no one supplied by configuration. PR 10961.
       [André Malo]

    *) Unescape the supplied wildcard pattern in mod_autoindex. Otherwise
       the pattern will not always match as desired. PR 12596.
       [André Malo]

    *) mod_autoindex now emits and accepts modern query string parameter
       delimiters (;). Thus column headers no longer contain unescaped
       ampersands. PR 10880  [André Malo]

    *) Enable ap_sock_disable_nagle for Windows. This along with the
       addition of APR_TCP_NODELAY_INHERITED to apr.hw will cause Nagle
       to be disabled for Windows. [Allan Edwards]

    *) Correct a mis-correlation between mpm_common.c and mpm_common.h;
       This patch reverts us to pre-2.0.46 behavior, using the
       ap_sock_disable_nagle noop macro, because ap_sock_disable_nagle
       was never compiled on Win32. [Allan Edwards, William Rowe]

    *) Fix a build problem with passing unsupported --enable-layout
       args to apr and apr-util.  This broke binbuild.sh as well as
       user-specified layout parameters.  PR 18649 [Justin Erenkrantz,
       Jeff Trawick]

    *) If a Date response header was already set in the headers array,
       this value was ignored in favour of the current time. This meant
       that Date headers on proxied requests where rewritten when they
       should not have been. PR: 14376 [Graham Leggett]

    *) Add code to buildconf that produces an httpd.spec file from
       httpd.spec.in, using build/get-version.sh from APR.
       [Graham Leggett]

    *) Fixed a segfault when multiple ProxyBlock directives were used.
       PR: 19023 [Sami Tikka <sami.tikka@f-secure.com>]

    *) SECURITY [CAN-2003-0134] OS2: Fix a Denial of Service vulnerability
       identified and reported by Robert Howard <rihoward@rawbw.com> that
       where device names faulted the running OS2 worker process.
       The fix is actually in APR 0.9.4.  [Brian Havard]

    *) Forward port: Escape special characters (especially control
       characters) in mod_log_config to make a clear distinction between
       client-supplied strings (with special characters) and server-side
       strings. This was already introduced in version 1.3.25.
       [André Malo]

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.
