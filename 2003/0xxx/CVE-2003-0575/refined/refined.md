  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A heap overflow vulnerability exists in the RPC AUTH_UNIX method of the 'nsd' service in SGI IRIX systems. Specifically, during a copy routine, user input is not properly validated, leading to a memory overwrite after the allocated buffer.",

      "Heap overflow",
      "Insufficient input validation"
