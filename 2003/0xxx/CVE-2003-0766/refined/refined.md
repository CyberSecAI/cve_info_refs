- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Heap overflow in FTP Desktop due to insufficient bounds checking when processing data received from an FTP server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap overflow vulnerability, specifically triggered by long strings in the FTP banner, username, and password responses. This results in the EIP pointer being overwritten.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote arbitrary code execution. By controlling the overwritten EIP, an attacker can redirect execution to malicious code.
- **Attack vectors:**  An attacker can set up a malicious FTP server and send specially crafted responses with long strings for the FTP banner, username, and password that trigger the heap overflow when the vulnerable client connects to it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to control an FTP server that the victim connects to. They also need to craft specific long strings to trigger the overflow.
