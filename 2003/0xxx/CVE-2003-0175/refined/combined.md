## SGI IRIX vulnerable to DoS when user space program calls the PIOCSWATCH ioctl() function

#### Vulnerability Note VU#142228

Original Release Date: 2003-06-11 | Last Revised: 2003-06-11

---

### Overview

A vulnerability in the SGI IRIX PIOCSWATCH ioctl() function may allow local attackers to crash the operating system.

### Description

| SGI [states](http://techpubs.sgi.com/library/tpl/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?coll=0650&db=man&fname=/usr/share/catman/p_man/cat4/proc.z&srch=PIOCSWATCH) that PIOCSWATCH ioctl "establishes or clears a set of watched areas in the traced process." According to SGI Security Advisory 20030603-01-P, a local attacker could crash the operating system by exploiting this vulnerability:  It's been reported that non-root users can call the PIOCSWATCH ioctl() in its various invocations via a user space program and crash IRIX with a kernel panic. This could be used as a potential Denial of Service attack on the system. A local account on the system is required. |

### Impact

| A local attacker may be able to crash the operating system. |

### Solution

| The vendor encourages users to either upgrade to IRIX 6.5.21 (when it becomes available) or apply a patch as described in SGI Security Advisory 20030603-01-P. |
