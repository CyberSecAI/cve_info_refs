Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to the described vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the insecure inclusion of an external file via a user-controlled parameter (`admin_root`). The `header.php` script in ttCMS uses the `admin_root` parameter in conjunction with `include_once` to load the `header.inc.php` file. By manipulating the `admin_root` parameter, an attacker can force the application to include a malicious `header.inc.php` from a remote server under the attacker's control, leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is an RFI vulnerability in the `header.php` script. The application does not properly sanitize or validate the `admin_root` parameter before using it in an include statement.
*   **Insecure Cookie Handling:** The vulnerability is triggered based on a simple cookie check (`ttcms_user_admin`). This makes the authentication bypass very easy.
*   **Lack of Input Validation/Sanitization:** The application fails to validate or sanitize user-supplied input (`admin_root` parameter), allowing the inclusion of arbitrary URLs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the target server by hosting a malicious `header.inc.php` file on their server and forcing the ttCMS application to include it. This allows the attacker to gain complete control over the vulnerable system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker sends a modified HTTP request to `header.php` on the target server, providing the malicious URL as a value for the `admin_root` parameter.
*   **Cookie Manipulation:** The attacker also needs to send the cookie `ttcms_user_admin=1` to bypass the initial check. This can be done using tools that allow cookie manipulation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the target server.
*   **Web Server Control:** The attacker needs a web server to host the malicious `header.inc.php` file.
*   **Basic HTTP Request Manipulation Skills:** The attacker must be able to use tools to manipulate HTTP requests and cookies.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any credentials to exploit this vulnerability, only to manipulate the ttcms_user_admin cookie and admin_root parameter in the header.php URL.
