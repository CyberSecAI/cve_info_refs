### Overview

Lotus [iNotes](http://www.lotus.com/products/inotes.nsf) contains a buffer overflow that could permit a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service on a vulnerable server.

### Description

| Lotus iNotes [Web Access](http://www.lotus.com/products/inotes.nsf/allpublic/53380DDF183DC9A38525697C006E652E?opendocument) is a web-based database application that provides "access to corporate messaging services and personal information through a Web browser." NGSSoftware has researched and reported a buffer overflow vulnerability in iNotes that can be triggered via a specially crafted s\_ViewName value of the PresetFields parameter. For further information, see NGSSoftware Insight Security Research Advisory [#NISR17022003b](http://www.nextgenss.com/advisories/lotus-inotesoflow.txt).  Lotus is tracking this issue as SPR# [KSPR5HUPEK.](http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/r5fixlist.nsf/Search?SearchView&Query=KSPR5HUPEK) Further information is available in IBM Technote [1104542](http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21104542). |

## History

The CERT Division is the birthplace of cybersecurity. For nearly 30 years, the CERT Division of the SEI has partnered with government, industry, law enforcement, and academia to advance cybersecurity and improve the security and resilience of computer systems and networks.

Originally focused on incident response, we have expanded into cybersecurity areas such as network situational awareness, malicious code analysis, secure coding, resilience management, insider threats, digital investigations and intelligence, workforce development, DevOps, forensics, software assurance, vulnerability discovery and analysis, and risk management.

## Former Director Richard Pethia

[Richard Pethia](/about/leadership/display.cfm?customel_datapageid_2623=3545) was founding director of the SEI's CERT Division. Pethia, who served as director of CERT from 1988 to 2016, guided the organization through tremendous growth and change. Under Pethia's leadership, the unit expanded and evolved from the CERT Coordination Center—a small group focused on computer incident response—to a research organization of more than 200 professionals dedicated to solving problems with widespread cybersecurity implications.

NGSSoftware Insight Security Research Advisory

Name:    Lotus Domino Web Server iNotes Overflow
Systems Affected:  Release 6.0
Severity:  Critical Risk
Category:               Remote System Buffer Overrun
Vendor URL:   <http://www.lotus.com>
Author:   Mark Litchfield (mark@ngssoftware.com)
Date:   17th February 2003
Advisory number: #NISR17022003b

Description
***********
Lotus Domino and Notes together provide a featured enterprise collaboration
system with Domino providing application server services. iNotes provides
web based messaging facilities.

Details
*******
iNotes suffers from a remotley exploitable buffer overrun when an attacker
provides an overly long value for the s_ViewName/Foldername options of the
PresetFields parameter when requesting web based mail services. Any code
supplied would run in the security context of the account running the Domino
Web Services.

Fix Information
***************
NGSSoftware alerted IBM/Lotus to this issue on the 14th of January 2002. IBM
Lotus Notes and Domino Release 6.0.1 is now available and being marketed as
the first maintenance release.  IBM say if customers haven't already
upgraded or migrated to Notes and Domino 6, now is the time to move and
start reaping the benefits of this existing and highly praised release.
Release 6.0.1 includes fixes to enhance the quality and reliability of the
Notes and Domino 6 products.  It does not however mention any security
issues, and NGS would strongly advise to upgrade as soon as possible not to
just to "reap the benefits" but to secure the server and data against
possible attacks.

The upgrade / patch can be obtained from

<http://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/download/search.jsp?q=&cat=&pf=&k=&dt=&>
go=y&rs=ESD-NOTECLNTi&S_TACT=&S_CMP=&sb=r

A check for this issue has been added to DominoScan R2, a comprehensive
automated intelligent assessment tool for Lotus Domino Servers of which more
information is available from the NGSSite

Original Release Date: 2003-02-19 | Last Revised: 2003-03-26

---

### Overview

Lotus [iNotes](http://www.lotus.com/products/inotes.nsf) contains a buffer overflow that could permit a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service on a vulnerable server.

### Description

| Lotus iNotes [Web Access](http://www.lotus.com/products/inotes.nsf/allpublic/53380DDF183DC9A38525697C006E652E?opendocument) is a database application that provides "access to corporate messaging services and personal information through a Web browser." NGSSoftware has researched and reported a buffer overflow vulnerability in iNotes that can be triggered via a specially crafted FolderName value of the PresetFields parameter. For further information, see NGSSoftware Insight Security Research Advisory [#NISR17022003b](http://www.nextgenss.com/advisories/lotus-inotesoflow.txt).  Lotus is tracking this issue as SPR# [KSPR5HUQ59](http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/r5fixlist.nsf/a8f0ffda1fc76c8985256752006aba6c/fcd56eb247bf688085256cca0070f90c?OpenDocument). Further information is available in IBM Technote [1104527](http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21104527). |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Domino server process or cause a denial of service. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade**This issue is resolved in Notes/Domino [6.0.1](http://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/download/search.jsp?q=&cat=&pf=&k=&dt=&go=y&rs=ESD-DMNTSRVRi&S_TACT=&S_CMP=&sb=r) and [5.0.12](http://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/download/search.jsp?q=&cat=&pf=&k=&dt=&go=y&rs=ESD-DMNTSRVRi&S_TACT=&S_CMP=&sb=r). |
| --- |

| **Disable Vulnerable Service**Until upgrades can be performed, consider disabling iNotes. |

NGSSoftware Insight Security Research Advisory

Name:    Lotus Domino Web Server Host/Location Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
Systems Affected:  Release 6.0
Severity:  Critical Risk
Category: Remote System Buffer Overrun
Vendor URL:   <http://www.lotus.com>
Author:   Mark Litchfield (mark@ngssoftware.com)
Date:   17th February 2003
Advisory number: #NISR17022003a

Description
***********
Lotus Domino and Notes together provide a featured enterprise collaboration
system with Domino providing application server services.

Details
*******
Lotus Domino 6 suffers from a remotley exploitable buffer overrun
vulnerability when performing a redirect operation. When building the 302
Redirect response, the server takes the client provided "Host" header and
implants this value into the "Location" server header. By requesting certain
documents or views in certain databases the server can be forced to perform
a redirect operation and by supplying an overly long string for the
hostname, a buffer can be overflowed allowing an attacker to gain control of
the Domino Web Services process. By default these databases can be accessed
by anonymous users. Any arbitray code supplied will run in the context of
the account running Domino allowing an attacker to gain control of the
server.

Fix Information
***************
IBM Lotus Notes and Domino Release 6.0.1 is now available and being marketed
as the first maintenance release.  IBM say if customers haven't already
upgraded or migrated to Notes and Domino 6, now is the time to move and
start reaping the benefits of this existing and highly praised release.
Release 6.0.1 includes fixes to enhance the quality and reliability of the
Notes and Domino 6 products.  It does not however mention any security
issues, and NGS would strongly advise to upgrade as soon as possible not to
just tp "reap the benefits" but to secure the server and data against
possible attacks.

The upgrade / patch can be obtained from

<http://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/download/search.jsp?q=&cat=&pf=&k=&dt=&>
go=y&rs=ESD-NOTECLNTi&S_TACT=&S_CMP=&sb=r

A check for this issue has been added to DominoScan R2, a comprehensive
automated intelligent assessment tool for Lotus Domino Servers of which more
information is available from the NGSSite

## Lotus Domino Web Server vulnerable to buffer overflow via non-existent "h\_SetReturnURL" parameter with an overly long "Host Header" field

#### Vulnerability Note VU#772817

Original Release Date: 2003-02-19 | Last Revised: 2003-03-26

---

### Overview

Lotus Domino Web Server is an application that provides access to Lotus Notes databases via HTTP requests. A vulnerability exists that could permit a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.

### Description

| Lotus Domino Web Server contains a vulnerability in the nhttp.exe application that could permit a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server with SYSTEM privileges.  The problem occurs when the web server responds with a "302 Moved Temporarily" redirection error. The "Location:" header contained in this response is composed in part from the Host: header contained in the request. By carefully manipulating the length of the Host: header before and after URL encoding, the attacker can cause the resulting Location: header to contain information in adjacent memory on the web server. This vulnerability was reportedly discovered using a Windows 2000 (SP3) machine running Domino release 6.0.Further information is available in NGSSoftware advisory [NISR17022003a](http://www.nextgenss.com/advisories/lotus-hostlocbo.txt) and in IBM Technote [1104529](http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21104529) (SPR# KSPR5HTLW6). This vulnerability is addressed in Domino Release 6.0.1. Domino Release 5 is not affected. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker could execute arbitrary code on the server with SYSTEM privileges. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Upgrade to Domino Release [6.0.1](http://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/download/search.jsp?q=&cat=&pf=&k=&dt=&go=y&rs=ESD-DMNTSRVRi&S_TACT=&S_CMP=&sb=r). |
| --- |

| **Filter HTTP Requests with Large Headers**Sites that are able to deploy a monitoring system between the Internet and their web server may be able to detect and block packets with large amounts of header data. |

NGSSoftware Insight Security Research Advisory

Name:    Lotus Domino Web Server Host/Location Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
Systems Affected:  Release 6.0
Severity:  Critical Risk
Category: Remote System Buffer Overrun
Vendor URL:   <http://www.lotus.com>
Author:   Mark Litchfield (mark@ngssoftware.com)
Date:   17th February 2003
Advisory number: #NISR17022003a

Description
***********
Lotus Domino and Notes together provide a featured enterprise collaboration
system with Domino providing application server services.

Details
*******
Lotus Domino 6 suffers from a remotley exploitable buffer overrun
vulnerability when performing a redirect operation. When building the 302
Redirect response, the server takes the client provided "Host" header and
implants this value into the "Location" server header. By requesting certain
documents or views in certain databases the server can be forced to perform
a redirect operation and by supplying an overly long string for the
hostname, a buffer can be overflowed allowing an attacker to gain control of
the Domino Web Services process. By default these databases can be accessed
by anonymous users. Any arbitray code supplied will run in the context of
the account running Domino allowing an attacker to gain control of the
server.

Fix Information
***************
IBM Lotus Notes and Domino Release 6.0.1 is now available and being marketed
as the first maintenance release.  IBM say if customers haven't already
upgraded or migrated to Notes and Domino 6, now is the time to move and
start reaping the benefits of this existing and highly praised release.
Release 6.0.1 includes fixes to enhance the quality and reliability of the
Notes and Domino 6 products.  It does not however mention any security
issues, and NGS would strongly advise to upgrade as soon as possible not to
just tp "reap the benefits" but to secure the server and data against
possible attacks.

The upgrade / patch can be obtained from
