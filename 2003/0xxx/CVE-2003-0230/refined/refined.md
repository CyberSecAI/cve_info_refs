Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability details for CVE-2003-0230:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the method SQL Server uses to check named pipes during an authenticated logon by a client. This improper checking allows an attacker to take control of the named pipe.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper validation of named pipe connections, leading to a "named pipe hijacking" vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can gain control of the named pipe and assume the same permissions as the user attempting to connect through that pipe. If the connecting user has higher privileges, the attacker will also gain those higher level permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to be a user who is already authenticated and logged on to the system running SQL Server at the time of the named pipe connection attempt.
- **Named Pipe Hijacking:** The attacker hijacks an existing named pipe during a client's connection attempt.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Must be an authenticated user with the ability to log on to the system where SQL Server is running.
- Must be local to the system, i.e., not a remote exploit.
- Must be present at the time another user attempts to connect via a named pipe.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content includes information on two other vulnerabilities (CVE-2003-0231 and CVE-2003-0232) that are related to named pipes and buffer overruns in SQL server, but these are not relevant to this CVE.
- This vulnerability is related to Microsoft SQL Server 7.0, SQL Server 2000, Microsoft Data Engine (MSDE) 1.0, Microsoft SQL Server 2000 Desktop Engine (MSDE 2000), and SQL Server 2000 Desktop Engine (Windows).
- A patch was made available by Microsoft to address the vulnerability.
- The patch limits the creation of named pipes to the SQL Server process only.
