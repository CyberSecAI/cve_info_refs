# Security Contacts and Procedures

Red Hat takes security very seriously, and we aim to take immediate action to
address serious security-related problems that involve our products or
services.

Please report any suspected security vulnerability in a Red Hat product or service to Red Hat Product Security at secalert@redhat.com. You can use our [GPG key](#contact) to communicate with us securely.

To report an issue in any Red Hat branded website or online service, please contact Red Hat Information Security at site-security@redhat.com.

## When to contact Red Hat Product Security

You should contact Red Hat Product Security if:

* You think there might be a security vulnerability in a Red Hat product or service.
* You want to provide feedback about our standards of service and performance. If you feel your security concern is not dealt with in a satisfactory manner, please contact secalert@redhat.com.

In all other cases, you should contact [Red Hat Customer Experience & Engagement](/site/support/).

You should contact Red Hat Customer Experience & Engagement if:

* You are unsure about how a known vulnerability affects a Red Hat product or service.
* You wish to report an issue in a language other than English.
* You require technical assistance for a security function (for example, "How do I configure my firewall?").
* You need help upgrading packages due to security alerts. (Refer to "How do I apply package updates from the Red Hat Network?" for information on upgrading packages.)
* Your issue is not security related.

In any of these cases, please contact [Red Hat Customer Experience & Engagement](/site/support/) instead.

## Who reads email sent to secalert@redhat.com?

Only members of Red Hat Product Security, a restricted
and carefully chosen group of Red Hat employees, will have access to
material sent to the secalert@redhat.com address. No outside users can subscribe to this list.

## Reporting security vulnerabilities in Red Hat Offerings

Red Hat Product Security welcomes and encourages all potential vulnerability submissions. For us to provide the best customer service and address issues in a timely manner, please provide the following information, if known:

* The version number of the affected component, such as the rpm package, container image, and java component.
* The environment and corresponding version(s) where the issue was discovered, for example, the operating system's name, version, architecture, or container platform.
* The steps to reproduce, if available.
* The ways an attacker could exploit this vulnerability on a system.
* Is the vulnerability already known to the public? If not, when is the planned date for disclosure?
* The immediate impact if an attacker exploits the vulnerability, such as a denial of service, privilege escalation, or remote code execution.

## How to contact us securely

Red Hat Product Security uses an OpenPGP key to secure our email communications. Mail sent to secalert@redhat.com can be encrypted with this public key. We expect to change the key we use from time to time. Should we change the key, the previous keys will be revoked, and the [rhsa-announce](http://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/rhsa-announce) mailing list will be notified of the change.

## How we respond

Email sent to secalert@redhat.com is read and
acknowledged with a non-automated response within three working
days. For issues that are complicated and require significant attention, we will open an investigation and will provide you with a mechanism to check the status of our progress at any time.

Any information you share with us about security issues that are
not public knowledge is kept confidential within Red Hat. It is not
passed on to any third party without your permission.

## Notifications

Red Hat does not provide an advance notification service. Security
advisories are available from [Red Hat Product Security](/site/security/updates/) and via the [Red Hat Customer Portal](/site/security/updates/active/).

## Common Criteria Timely Updates

Refer to the [Life Cycle Security Update Policy](https://access.redhat.com/security/lifecycle-security-update-policy) for information on Red Hat's security update policy as well as information on embargoed (undisclosed) vulnerability handling.

### Resources include the following:

[Red Hat Security Updates (Advisories)](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/security-advisories)

[Red Hat CVE Database](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/cve)

[Red Hat Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure (CVE) Program](https://access.redhat.com/articles/red_hat_cve_program)

## Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD)

Red Hat engages with partners, vendors, researchers, and community coordinators to disclose newly discovered vulnerabilities in hardware, software, and services. Multi-party coordination is a complex process, and understanding the parties' vulnerability disclosure policies, vulnerability handling policies, and contractual agreements opens the way to trusted communication and collaboration. Increasing transparency between parties assures that vendors can understand and manage the risk imposed by the vulnerability and facilitate engagements with other parties. The aim of CVD is to provide timely and consistent guidance to parties and customers to help them protect themselves.

Please see the [Red Hat CNA Vulnerability Disclosure Policy](https://access.redhat.com/articles/red_hat_cna_vulnerability_disclosure_policy) for details on how Red Hat discloses security vulnerabilities under the Red Hat/Fedora scope.

[Red Hat Product Errata](/errata)
RHSA-2003:114 - Security Advisory

Issued:
2003-04-28
Updated:
2003-04-28
# RHSA-2003:114 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

mod\_auth\_any security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

Updated mod\_auth\_any packages are available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
These updated packages fix vulnerabilities associated with the manner in
which mod\_auth\_any escapes shell arguments when calling external programs.

## Description

The Web server module mod\_auth\_any allows the Apache httpd server to
call arbitrary external programs to verify user passwords.

Vulnerabilities have been found in versions of mod\_auth\_any included in Red
Hat Enterprise Linux concerning the method by which mod\_auth\_any escapes
shell arguments when calling external programs. These vulnerabilities
allow remote attackers to run arbitrary commands as the user under which
the Web server is running. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0084 to these issues.

All users are advised to upgrade to these errata packages, which change the
method by which external programs are invoked and, therefore, make these
programs invulnerable to these issues.

Red Hat would like to thank Daniel Jarboe and Maneesh Sahani for bringing
these issues to our attention.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade. Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated. Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated. Note that you
can also use wildcards (\*.rpm) if your current directory \*only\* contains the
desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network. Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates. To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

## Affected Products

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 2 ia64
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 2 i386
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux Workstation 2 ia64
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux Workstation 2 i386

## Fixes

* [BZ - 86508](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=86508)
  - CAN-2003-0084 mod\_auth\_any uses unsafe quoting

## CVEs

* [CVE-2003-0084](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2003-0084.html)
