Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2003-0084:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the way `mod_auth_any` escapes shell arguments when calling external programs. Specifically, the escaping mechanism was insufficient, allowing for command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The core issue is the inadequate handling of user-supplied input when passed as arguments to external programs called by `mod_auth_any`.
*   **Command Injection:** Due to the poor escaping of shell arguments, an attacker can inject arbitrary commands into the arguments passed to the external program.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** A successful exploit allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The commands are executed with the privileges of the user under which the web server is running, potentially leading to privilege escalation if the web server runs as a high-privilege user.
*   **System Compromise:** Arbitrary command execution can lead to a complete compromise of the affected server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
*   **Web Request Manipulation:** Attackers manipulate web requests, likely by crafting usernames or passwords containing malicious shell commands. These manipulated inputs are then passed as arguments to external programs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web server running the vulnerable `mod_auth_any` module.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs knowledge of the `mod_auth_any` module's vulnerability and how to exploit it.
*   **Ability to Craft Malicious Input:** The attacker must be able to craft web requests with malicious shell commands embedded in usernames or passwords, or other input passed to `mod_auth_any`.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content is more detailed than the basic CVE description, offering insight into the technical cause and exploitation process.
*   The affected products are primarily Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server and Workstation versions 2 for i386 and ia64 architectures.
*   The fix involves changing the method by which external programs are invoked by `mod_auth_any`, addressing the improper escaping and preventing command injection.
*   The advisory acknowledges Daniel Jarboe and Maneesh Sahani for reporting the vulnerability.
