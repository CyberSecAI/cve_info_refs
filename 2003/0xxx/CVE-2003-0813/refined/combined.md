Dear bugtraq@securityfocus.com,

There are few bad news on RPC DCOM vulnerability:

1.  Universal  exploit  for  MS03-039  exists in-the-wild, PINK FLOYD is
again actual.
2.  It  was  reported  by exploit author (and confirmed), Windows XP SP1
with  all  security  fixes  installed still vulnerable to variant of the
same bug. Windows 2000/2003 was not tested. For a while only DoS exploit
exists,  but  code execution is probably possible. Technical details are
sent to Microsoft, waiting for confirmation.

Dear  ISPs.  Please  instruct  you customers to use personal fireWALL in
Windows XP.

## Microsoft Windows DCOM/RPC vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#547820

Original Release Date: 2003-10-14 | Last Revised: 2003-10-15

---

### Overview

A vulnerability exists in Microsoft Windows DCOM/RPC that can be exploited to cause a denial of service. It may be possible for an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| Microsoft Windows Remote Procedure Call ([RPC](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/rpc/rpc/microsoft_rpc_model.asp)) "... is a powerful, robust, efficient, and secure interprocess communication (IPC) mechanism that enables data exchange and invocation of functionality residing in a different process. That different process can be on the same machine, on the local area network, or across the Internet." Distributed COM ([DCOM](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dndcom/html/msdn_dcomarch.asp)) "...extends the Component Object Model (COM) to support communication among objects on different computers -- on a LAN, a WAN, or even the Internet."  Based on publicly available exploit code, there is a vulnerability in the way the RPCSS service handles DCOM/RPC messages. This vulnerability is different than those described in [CA-2003-16](http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2003-16.html) ([VU#568148](https://www.kb.cert.org/vulcatalog/id/568148)/[MS03-026](http://microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS03-026.asp)) and [CA-2003-23](http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2003-23.html) ([VU#254236](https://www.kb.cert.org/vulcatalog/id/254236)/[VU#483492](https://www.kb.cert.org/vulcatalog/id/483492)/[MS03-039](http://microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS03-039.asp)). As in the previous vulnerabilities, this flaw appears to occur in functions related to DCOM object activation. A remote attacker could attempt to exploit this vulnerability using crafted RPC packets.Internet Security Systems (ISS) X-Force has published an [advisory](http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/alerts/id/155) stating that this vulnerability "...manifests as a result of a separate multi-threaded race condition when processing incoming RPC requests." Depending on variables such as network latency and CPU load, one RPCSS thread may free a memory buffer before another thread has finished processing the same buffer. This causes memory corruption that can lead to termination of the RPCSS process. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An unauthenticated, remote attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges. In tests, the public exploit code crashes the RPCSS service on Windows 2000 and Windows XP systems patched with MS03-039. The exploit executes code on Windows 2000 systems that do not have the MS03-039 patch. |
| --- |

### Solution

| The CERT/CC is currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem. |
| --- |

| Until patches are available, the following workarounds can be used to reduce possible attack vectors. These workarounds are not complete solutions and may affect network and application operation. Research and test before making changes to production systems.     + Using a network or host-based firewall, block RPC network traffic (ports 135/tcp, 139/tcp, 445/tcp, 593/tcp and 135/udp, 137/udp, 138/udp, 445/udp). + Disable COM Internet Services (CIS) and RPC over HTTP as described in Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [825819](http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=825819). + Disable DCOM as described Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [825750](http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=825750). |

## Vulnerability Details

#### RPC Runtime Library Vulnerability - CAN-2003-0813:

A remote code execution vulnerability exists that results from a [race condition](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21142) when the RPC Runtime Library processes specially crafted messages. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. However, in the most likely attack scenario, this issue is a [denial of service](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21142) vulnerability.

#### Mitigating factors for RPC Runtime Library Vulnerability - CAN-2003-0813:

* Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.
* Windows NT 4.0 is not affected by this vulnerability.

#### Workarounds for RPC Runtime Library Vulnerability - CAN-2003-0813:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified below.

* **Use a personal firewall such as the** [**Internet Connection Firewall**](https://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/networking/security/winfirewall.mspx)**, which is included with Windows XP and Windows Server 2003.**

  If you use the Internet Connection Firewall feature in Windows XP or in Windows Server 2003 to help protect your Internet connection, it blocks unsolicited inbound traffic by default. Microsoft recommends blocking all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet.

  To enable the Internet Connection Firewall feature by using the Network Setup Wizard, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel**.
  2. In the default Category View, click **Network and Internet Connections**, and then click **Setup or change your home or small office network**. The Internet Connection Firewall feature is enabled when you select a configuration in the Network Setup Wizard that indicates that your system is connected directly to the Internet.

  To configure Internet Connection Firewall manually for a connection, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel**.
  2. In the default Category View, click **Networking and Internet Connections**, and then click **Network Connections**.
  3. Right-click the connection on which you want to enable Internet Connection Firewall, and then click **Properties**.
  4. Click the **Advanced** tab.
  5. Click to select the **Protect my computer or network by limiting or preventing access to this computer from the Internet** check box, and then click **OK**.

  **Note** If you want to enable the use of some programs and services through the firewall, click **Settings** on the **Advanced** tab, and then select the programs, protocols, and services needed.
* **Block the following at the firewall:**

  + **UDP ports 135, 137, 138, and 445, and TCP ports 135, 139, 445, and 593**
  + **All unsolicited inbound traffic on ports greater than 1024**
  + **Any other specifically configured RPC port**
  + **If installed, COM Internet Services (CIS) or RPC over HTTP, which listen on ports 80 and 443**

  These ports are used to initiate a connection with RPC. Blocking them at the firewall will help prevent systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. Also, make sure that you block any other specifically configured RPC port on the remote system. Microsoft recommends that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports. For more information about the ports that RPC uses, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312). For more information about how to disable CIS, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [825819](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;825819).
* **Enable advanced TCP/IP filtering on systems that support this feature.**

  You can enable advanced TCP/IP filtering to block all unsolicited inbound traffic. For additional information about how to configure TCP/IP filtering, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [309798](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;309798).
* **Block the affected ports by using IPSec on the affected systems.**

  Use Internet Protocol Security (IPSec) to help protect network communications. Detailed information about IPSec and how to apply filters is available in Microsoft Knowledge Base Articles [313190](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;313190) and [813878.](https://support.microsoft.com/?id=813878)

#### FAQ for RPC Runtime Library Vulnerability - CAN-2003-0813:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a [race condition](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21142) vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system remotely, including installing programs; viewing, changing, or deleting data; or creating new accounts that have full privileges. However, race conditions are not predictable. Therefore, in the most likely attack scenario, this issue is a [denial of service](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21142) vulnerability.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

A [race condition](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21142) could exist when the RPC Runtime Library processes specially crafted messages.

**What is the RPC Runtime Library?**

By default, the RPC Runtime Library is installed on all affected systems. The RPC Runtime Library provides services such as communication services, directory services, and security services to application developers. For more information about the RPC Runtime Library, visit the following [MSDN Library Web site](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/aa373631).

**What is wrong with the RPC Runtime Library?**

The vulnerability in the RPC Runtime Library could occur if two separate operating system threads try to process certain specially crafted messages within a specified time. This event is considered to be a race condition because this event depends on the relative timing of the two threads. This race condition could cause the RPC Runtime Library to modify internal data structures incorrectly. Therefore, the affected system could experience unpredictable behavior.

**What is a race condition?**

[Race conditions](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21142) depend on the relative timing of events in multithreaded operating systems and software. They are frequently difficult to exploit as a way of repeatedly executing arbitrary code. For more information about race conditions, visit the following [MSDN Library Web site](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/1c9txz50%28vs.71%29.aspx). For a more general definition of race conditions, visit this .

**Why does this race condition cause a vulnerability?**

This race condition could create an environment where a series of specially timed requests could cause the RPC Runtime Library to perform an unpredictable action. However, because the circumstances that lead to this condition would change every time that the vulnerability was exploited, it may be difficult for an attacker to exploit this vulnerability.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

This vulnerability could allow remote code execution. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system, including installing programs; viewing, changing, or deleting data; or creating new accounts that have full privileges. However, race conditions are not predictable. Therefore, in the most likely attack scenario, this issue is a [denial of service](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21142) vulnerability.

**Who could exploit the vulnerability?**

Any anonymous user who can deliver a series of specially crafted messages to the affected system could attempt to exploit this vulnerability. By default, this ability is enabled on the affected systems. Therefore, any user who can establish a connection to an affected system could attempt to exploit this vulnerability.

**How could an attacker exploit this vulnerability?**

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating a series of specially crafted network messages and sending the messages to an affected system. These messages could then cause the affected system to execute code.

An attacker could also access the affected component through another vector. For example, an attacker could log on to the system interactively or by using another program that passes parameters to the vulnerable component (locally or remotely).

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way the RPC Runtime Library synchronizes the threads that are being used to process the specially crafted messages.

#### RPCSS Service Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0116:

A [denial of service](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21142) vulnerability exists in the RPCSS service. If a specially crafted message is sent to the RPCSS service, the service may not reclaim discarded memory. This behavior could result in a denial of service.

#### Mitigating factors for the RPCSS Service Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0116:

* Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.
* Windows NT 4.0 is not affected by this vulnerability.

#### Workaround for the RPCSS Service Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0116:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified below.

The workarounds that are listed for the **RPC Runtime Library Vulnerability- CAN-2003-0813** could also apply to this vulnerability. Additionally, the following workarounds apply:

* **Disable DCOM on all affected systems.**

  When a system is part of a network, the DCOM wire protocol enables COM objects on that system to communicate with COM objects on other systems. You can disable DCOM for a specific system to help protect against this vulnerability. However, by doing so, you will also disable all communication between objects on that system and objects on other systems.

  For more information about how to disable DCOM, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [825750](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;825750).

  If COM Internet Services (CIS) or RPC over HTTP is installed, Microsoft also recommends that you disable forwarding to DCOM. For more information, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [826382](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?kbid=826382).

  **Note** On Windows 2000, this method works only on systems that are running Service Pack 3 or later. Customers who are using Service Pack 2 or earlier should upgrade to a later Service Pack or use one of the other workarounds.

  **Impact of Workaround:** If you disable DCOM on a remote system, you cannot access that system remotely later to re-enable DCOM. To re-enable DCOM, you must have physical access to that system.

#### FAQ for the RPCSS Service Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0116:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a [denial of service](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21142) vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause the RPCSS Service to stop responding. The affected system would need to be manually restarted in order to restore normal operation.

Note that the denial of service vulnerability would not allow attackers to execute code or elevate their privileges, but it could cause the affected system to stop accepting requests.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The process used by the RPCSS service to check message inputs under certain circumstances.

**What is DCOM?**

The Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) is a protocol that enables software components to communicate directly over a network. Previously known as "Network OLE," DCOM is designed for use across multiple network transports, including Internet protocols such as HTTP.

**What is wrong with the RPCSS Service?**

A vulnerability in the RPCSS Service that is involved with DCOM activation could cause an affected system to fail because a specially crafted message is handled incorrectly. This particular failure affects the underlying RPCSS Service that is used for DCOM activation. The RPCSS Service listens on UDP ports 135, 137, 138, and 445, and on TCP ports 135, 139, 445, and 593. Additionally, DCOM can listen on ports 80 and 443 if CIS or RPC over HTTP is enabled.

By sending a specially crafted RPC message, an attacker could cause the RPCSS Service on a remote system to fail in such a way that a denial of service could result.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could cause the RPCSS Service to stop responding. However, this behavior would not cause the affected system to restart automatically. You would have to manually restart the affected system.

**Who could exploit the vulnerability?**

Any anonymous user who can deliver the specially crafted RPC message to an affected system could attempt to exploit this vulnerability.

**How could an attacker exploit this vulnerability?**

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must send a specially crafted RPC message to an affected system over an affected TCP/UDP port. If an affected system receives such a message, the RPCSS service could stop responding.

An attacker could also access the affected component through another vector. For example, an attacker could log on to the system interactively or by using another program that passes parameters to the vulnerable component (locally or remotely).

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that the RPCSS Service validates the information that is passed to it.

#### COM Internet Services (CIS) â RPC over HTTP Vulnerability - CAN-2003-0807:

A [denial of service](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21142) vulnerability exists in the CIS and in the RPC over HTTP Proxy components. When a forwarded request to a backend system passes through them, an attacker could reply to the request by using a specially crafted message that could cause the affected components to stop accepting later requests.

#### Mitigating factors for the COM Internet Services (CIS) and RPC over HTTP Vulnerability - CAN-2003-0807:

By default, none of the affected operating systems are vulnerable. All the affected operating systems would require that an administrator either enable the affected components or enable a vulnerable configuration. For more information about how a vulnerable configuration could occur, see the FAQ.

#### Workarounds for the COM Internet Services (CIS) and RPC over HTTP Vulnerability - CAN-2003-0807:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified below.

The workarounds that are listed for the **RPC Runtime Library Vulnerability- CAN-2003-0813** could also apply to this vulnerability. Additionally, the following workarounds apply:

* **Disable forwarding to untrusted sources for CIS and for RPC over HTTP if they have been enabled manually on the affected systems.**

  + If an administrator has installed and has enabled forwarding to untrusted servers through CIS for Windows NT 4.0 or for Windows 2000, verify that CIS and RPC over HTTP are configured to permit forwarding only to trusted servers.
  + If an administrator has configured RPC over HTTP on Windows Server 2003, verify that RPC over HTTP is not running in IIS 5 compatibility mode. The default mode, IIS 6.0, does not contain the vulnerability. Therefore, the default mode is the preferred configuration. For more information about deployment recommendations and configuration settings, visit the following [MSDN Library Web site](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/aa378641).

    **Note** Microsoft also recommends that administrators disable forwarding to DCOM. For more information, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [826382](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?kbid=826382).
* **If you do not need CIS or RPC over HTTP, disable this functionality on the affected systems.**

  + For information about how to disable CIS, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [825819](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;825819).
  + For information about RPC over HTTP, visit the following [MSDN Library Web site](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/aa378642).

#### FAQ for the COM Internet Services (CIS) and RPC Over HTTP Vulnerability - CAN-2003-0807:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a [denial of service](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21142) vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause the COM Internet Services or the RPC over HTTP component to stop accepting connections and could cause the affected system to stop responding. An administrator would need to restart Internet Information Services (IIS) manually to restore normal operation.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The process used by the affected components to validate message inputs under certain circumstances.

**What are COM Internet Services (CIS) and RPC over HTTP?**

RPC over HTTP version 1 (v1) (Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000) and v2 (Windows Server 2003) allow RPC to operate over TCP ports 80 and 443 (v2 only) so that a client and a server can communicate through most proxy servers and firewalls. COM Internet Services (CIS) allows DCOM to use RPC over HTTP to communicate between DCOM clients and DCOM servers. Windows Server 2003 can be configured to support RPC over HTTP v1 if Windows Server 2003 is set to IIS 5 compatibility mode. IIS 6.0 mode uses RPC over HTTP v2. IIS 6.0 mode does not contain the vulnerability. Therefore, IIS 6.0 mode is the preferred configuration. For more information about deployment recommendations and configuration settings, visit the following [MSDN Library Web site](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/aa378641).

For more information about RPC over HTTP for Windows Server 2003, visit the following [MSDN Library Web site](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/aa375384).
For more information about CIS, visit the following [MSDN Library Web site](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms809302).

**How do I know if I have CIS or RPC over HTTP installed?**

To determine whether a server has CIS or RPC over HTTP installed, use one of the following methods, depending on your operating system:

* On systems that are running Windows NT 4.0 that have the Windows NT Option Pack installed:

  Search on all partitions for "**rpcproxy.dll**." If the Rpcproxy.dll file is located on the server, CIS is probably installed.
* On systems that are running Windows 2000 or Windows Server 2003:

  In **Control Panel**, double-click **Add/Remove Programs**, and then double-click **Add/Remove Windows Components**.

  The Windows Components Wizard starts.

  Click **Networking Services**, and then click **Details**.

  If the **COM Internet Services Proxy** (for Windows 2000 Server) or the **RPC over HTTP Proxy** (for Windows Server 2003) check box is selected, CIS or RPC over HTTP support is enabled on the server.

  To search for a specific file on your system, click **Start**, click **Search**, click **For Files or Folders**, and then type the name of the file you want to search for. The search may take several minutes, depending on the size of your hard disk.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited the denial of service vulnerability could cause the affected components to stop responding.

**Who could exploit the vulnerability?**

On Windows NT 4.0 and on Windows 2000, when a forwarded request to a backend system passes through the affected components, an anonymous attacker could reply to the request by using a specially crafted message that could cause the affected components to stop accepting later requests.

On Windows Server 2003, an attacker must also provide valid logon credentials.

**How could an attacker exploit this vulnerability?**

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability in several ways:

* If an attacker controls a system that is configured to receive traffic through CIS or RPC over HTTP, the attacker could create a malicious response to a request from CIS or RPC over HTTP that could exploit this vulnerability.
* An attacker could also try to exploit this vulnerability by listening locally on the network for traffic from a system that has CIS or RPC over HTTP Proxy enabled. The attacker could then try to send a specially crafted malicious response to a forwarded request on behalf of the system that CIS or RPC over HTTP is trying to communicate with.

If a system receives either type of these specially crafted messages, the message could cause the affected components to stop responding.

An attacker could also access the affected component through another vector. For example, an attacker could log on to the system interactively or by using another program that passes parameters to the vulnerable component (locally or remotely).

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

By default, the affected components are not enabled on any affected operating system.

However, if the Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack has been installed, the affected components are installed on Windows NT 4.0 Server and Windows NT 4.0 Terminal Server Edition. This is the default behavior. The affected components are not enabled until an administrator performs the steps that are described in Microsoft Knowledge Base article [282261](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;282261).

By default, the affected components are not installed on Windows 2000 or on Windows Server 2003. An administrator must install the affected components manually for a system to be at risk from this vulnerability.

In both cases, an administrator must manually configure the affected components to forward requests to another system for the affected components to become vulnerable.

On Windows Server 2003, the impact is reduced more because the default configuration of Internet Information Service is not vulnerable, even with an affected component installed. Windows Server 2003 would only become vulnerable if you enabled IIS 5.0 compatibility mode. Microsoft does not recommend enabling IIS 5.0 compatibility mode for use with RPC over HTTP. For more information about deployment recommendations, visit the following [MSDN Library Web site](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/aa378641).

Windows NT 4.0 Workstation and Windows XP do not support the installation of the affected components. Therefore, these operating systems are not affected by this vulnerability.

**Does this update require any manual steps?**

Yes, if you are using CIS on Windows NT 4.0. Windows NT 4.0 requires administrators to manually perform the steps that are described in Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [282261](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;282261) to enable CIS, including specifying the physical location of Rpcproxy.dll file. To help protect against this vulnerability, administrators must manually copy the updated version of the Rpcproxy.dll file to the location that they first used to enable CIS because the update cannot determine this location programmatically.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way that the affected components validate the information that they receive.

#### Object Identity Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0124:

A information disclosure vulnerability exists in the way that object identities are created. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to enable applications to open network communication ports. Although this vulnerability does not directly enable an attacker to compromise a system, it could be used to enable network communication through unexpected communication ports.

**Note** When you install this security update on Windows Server 2003 or on Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003, the installer checks to see if any of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix. If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR files to your system. For more information, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [824994](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?kbid=824994).

**Verifying Update Installation**

To verify that a security update is installed on an affected system you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool, which allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).

You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry key:

HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows Server 2003\SP1\KB828741\Filelist

**Note** This registry key may not be created correctly if an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 828741 security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Windows XP (all versions)

**Note** For Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003, this security update is the same as the Windows Server 2003 64-Bit Edition security update.

**Prerequisites**
This security update requires the released version of Windows XP or Windows XP Service Pack 1 (SP1). For more information, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [322389](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;322389).

For more information about the supported installation switches, view Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [262841](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;262841).

**Verifying Update Installation**

To verify that a security update is installed on an affected system you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool, which allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).

You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry key:

HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Hotfix\KB828741\File 1

**Note** This registry key may not be created correctly if an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 828741 security update into the Windows installation source files.

Security Community,

The following information references a serious security threat to you or
your organization if the proper measures have not been taken to prevent
its destructive intent.

Description of Issue
--------------------
VigilantMinds has successfully validated the claims regarding the latest
Microsoft Remote Procedure Call (RPC) vulnerability.  Specifically,
VigilantMinds has validated that hosts running fully patched versions of
the following Microsoft operating systems REMAIN subject to denial of
service attacks and possible remote exploitation:

   * Microsoft Windows XP Professional
   * Microsoft Windows XP Home
   * Microsoft Windows 2000 Workstation

Although it has not been verified at this time, other versions of
Microsoft Windows are also suspected to be subject to this
vulnerability.

As with the prior RPC vulnerability (MS03-039), these attacks can occur
on TCP ports 135, 139, 445 and 593; and UDP ports 135, 137, 138 and 445.

Remediation Actions
-------------------
VigilantMinds has notified CERT/CC and informed the vendor of this
issue.  As of this posting, no vendor patch is yet available.

As a temporary solution, VigilantMinds suggests that firewall rules be
placed on all affected ports for any exposed systems.  All external
connectivity (including VPN) should be firewalled actively for
unnecessary incoming RPC activity.

A Snort signature that will detect traffic patterns associated with this
attack is below.  Note that current Snort signatures may also identify
this attack.

Subject: [Full-Disclosure] Bad news on RPC DCOM vulnerability

Dear bugtraq@securityfocus.com,

There are few bad news on RPC DCOM vulnerability:

1.  Universal  exploit  for  MS03-039  exists in-the-wild, PINK FLOYD is
again actual. 2.  It  was  reported  by exploit author (and confirmed),
Windows XP SP1 with  all  security  fixes  installed still vulnerable to
variant of the same bug. Windows 2000/2003 was not tested. For a while
only DoS exploit exists,  but  code execution is probably possible.
Technical details are sent to Microsoft, waiting for confirmation.

Dear  ISPs.  Please  instruct  you customers to use personal fireWALL in
Windows XP.
