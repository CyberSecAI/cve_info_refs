## History

The CERT Division is the birthplace of cybersecurity. For nearly 30 years, the CERT Division of the SEI has partnered with government, industry, law enforcement, and academia to advance cybersecurity and improve the security and resilience of computer systems and networks.

Originally focused on incident response, we have expanded into cybersecurity areas such as network situational awareness, malicious code analysis, secure coding, resilience management, insider threats, digital investigations and intelligence, workforce development, DevOps, forensics, software assurance, vulnerability discovery and analysis, and risk management.

## Former Director Richard Pethia

[Richard Pethia](/about/leadership/display.cfm?customel_datapageid_2623=3545) was founding director of the SEI's CERT Division. Pethia, who served as director of CERT from 1988 to 2016, guided the organization through tremendous growth and change. Under Pethia's leadership, the unit expanded and evolved from the CERT Coordination Center—a small group focused on computer incident response—to a research organization of more than 200 professionals dedicated to solving problems with widespread cybersecurity implications.

## Cisco IOS Interface Blocked by IPv4 Packet

#### Vulnerability Note VU#411332

Original Release Date: 2003-07-17 | Last Revised: 2003-07-17

---

### Overview

A denial-of-service vulnerability exists in Cisco's Internetwork Operating System (IOS). This vulnerability may allow remote attackers to conduct denial-of-service attacks on an affected device.

### Description

| Cisco IOS is a very widely deployed network operating system. A vulnerability in IOS could allow an intruder to execute a denial-of-service attack against an affected device. Cisco has published an advisory on this topic, available at <http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20030717-blocked.shtml>. We strongly encourage sites using IOS to read this document and take appropriate action. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By sending specially crafted IPv4 packets to an interface on a vulnerable device, an intruder can cause the device to stop processing packets destined to that interface. Quoting from Cisco's advisory:  *"A device receiving these specifically crafted IPv4 packets will force the inbound interface to stop processing traffic. The device may stop processing packets destined to the router, including routing protocol packets and ARP packets. No alarms will be triggered, nor will the router reload to correct itself. This issue can affect all Cisco devices running Cisco IOS software. This vulnerability may be exercised repeatedly resulting in loss of availability until a workaround has been applied or the device has been upgraded to a fixed version of code."* |
| --- |

### Solution

| Apply a patch as described in the Cisco Advisory. |
| --- |

| Until a patch can be applied, you can mitigate the risks presented by this vulnerability by judicious use of access control lists (ACLs). The correct use of ACLs depends of your network topology. Additionally, ACLs may degrade performace on some systems. We recommend reviewing the following before applying ACLs  <http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20030717-blocked.shtml#workarounds> <http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/racl.html> <http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/iacl.html> It is important to understand your network requirements before making changes. |
