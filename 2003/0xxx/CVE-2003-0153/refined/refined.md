Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the security vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the exposure of physical file paths in error messages generated by the Bonsai web-based tree control system. Specifically, the full or partial paths to files were being displayed in error messages generated by the `cvsview2.cgi` and `multidiff.cgi` scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is information disclosure. Exposing the physical file paths of the server's file system reveals potentially sensitive information about the server's structure and the location of critical files. This information could be used by attackers to gain a better understanding of the system and potentially identify further vulnerabilities.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization/Error Handling:** The CGI scripts were not properly sanitizing or handling errors in a way that prevents the output of full or partial file paths.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Gathering:** Attackers could learn the exact directory structure and location of files on the server, potentially revealing sensitive configuration or application code. This information can be used to plan further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Web Requests:** The vulnerability was accessible via web requests to the vulnerable CGI scripts (`cvsview2.cgi` and `multidiff.cgi`). By triggering errors in these scripts, an attacker could obtain the file path information.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable scripts.
- **Ability to Trigger Errors:** The attacker needs to be able to trigger errors in the vulnerable scripts, which can typically be achieved by providing malformed input.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided bug report mentions a patch that was created to remove the fully qualified path information from public display. This involved removing CVSROOT information from `cvsview2.cgi` error messages and stripping full path information from diffs returned by `rcs diff` in `multidiff.cgi`.
- The vulnerability was publicly disclosed, as noted in the bug report.
- The severity of the vulnerability was considered "blocker" implying its critical nature.
- The bug report references a SecurityFocus BID (5517), further solidifying the nature of this as a security vulnerability.
- The issue was fixed by modifying the CGI scripts to avoid directly exposing the full file paths.
