Heap Overflow in Windows Script Engine
March 19, 2003

I. BACKGROUND

Microsoft Corp.'s Windows Script Engine within the Windows operating
system (OS) interprets and executes script code written in scripting
languages such as VBscript and JScript. Such script code can be used to
add functionality to web pages, or to automate tasks within the OS or a
program. Script code can be written in several different scripting
languages, such as Visual Basic Script, JScript or JavaScript.

II. DESCRIPTION

By passing malicious JavaScript via Internet Explorer (IE), Outlook or
Outlook Express, remote attackers can exploit an integer overflow within
the Windows Script Engine causing a corruption of the heap thereby
allowing for arbitrary code execution. Specifically, the vulnerability
lies in the Windows Script Engine's implementation of JScript that is
provided by jscript.dll (located in %SystemRoot%\system32). The following
snippet of JavaScript code demonstrates the existence of the vulnerability
by crashing IE on a vulnerable Windows system:

<script>
    var trigger = [];
    i = 1;
    do {trigger[i] = 1;} while(i++ < 10000);
    trigger[0x3FFFFFFF] = 1;
    trigger.sort(new Function("return 1"));
</script>

The internal affected function, JsArrayFunctionHeapSort, creates two
arrays on the heap - one of size 4 * (MaxElementIndex + 1) and one of size
20 * (MaxElementIndex + 1). In the above example, MaxElementIndex is
0x3FFFFFFF. When it is incremented and multiplied by four, an integer
overflow occurs, thereby causing the application to allocate memory for an
array of size 0. Indexes within the trigger array can then be used to
overwrite segments of the second array that are filled with a structure
for each element being sorted. Arbitrary code execution is possible by
overwriting the heap control blocks to replace the stored address of
soon-to-be-called functions with the address of shellcode that is stored
in memory.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation requires an attacker first create a malicious JavaScript
snippet containing shellcode. Once accomplished, any of a number of attack
vectors are possible. Some include social engineering a user into browsing
to a malicious web page, sending a malicious HTML-enabled e-mail to the
target user, redirecting the user to the malicious script by leveraging
numerous cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities that are in existence,
or exploiting the browser directly using an XSS attack with embedded
JavaScript.  iDEFENSE has verified these issues with working exploit code.

This is a serious issue because, given working exploit code under the
above scenarios, an attacker can cause any command to execute under the
privileges of the targeted user. The problem is further magnified when
taking into consideration the countless number of applications that
utilize the IE browsing engine, such as Outlook and Outlook Express.

IV. DETECTION

iDEFENSE has confirmed the existence of the above-described vulnerability
in the following Windows environments:

    * Microsoft Windows 98
    * Microsoft Windows 98 Second Edition
    * Microsoft Windows Me
    * Microsoft Windows NT 4.0
    * Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Terminal Server Edition
    * Microsoft Windows 2000
    * Microsoft Windows XP

with Jscript.dll versions:

    * 5.1.0.4615
    * 5.5.0.6330
    * 5.6.0.6626

V. WORKAROUND

Disable active scripting if it is not necessary for day-to-day operations
using the following steps:

1. In IE, click on Tools and select Internet Options from the drop-down
menu.
2. Click the Security tab and the Custom Level button.
3. Under Scripting, then Active Scripting, click the Disable radio button.

In the HTML-enabled e-mail scenario, if the user were using Outlook
Express 6.0 or Outlook 2002 in their default configurations, or Outlook 98
or 2000 in conjunction with the Outlook Email Security Update, then an
attack could not be automated and the user would still need to click on a
URL sent in the e-mail. As such, Outlook 98 and 2000 users should install
the update, which is available at
<http://office.microsoft.com/Downloads/2000/Out2ksec.aspx> .

VI. VENDOR FIX

Microsoft has patched this vulnerability, upgrading jscript.dll to version
5.6.0.8513. Various incarnations of the fix are available from
<http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS03-008.asp> .

### General Information

## Technical details

**Technical description:**

The Windows Script Engine provides Windows operating systems with the ability to execute script code. Script code can be used to add functionality to web pages, or to automate tasks within the operating system or within a program. Script code can be written in several different scripting languages, such as [Visual Basic Script](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/1kw29xwf%28vs.71%29.aspx), or [JScript](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/hbxc2t98%28vs.71%29.aspx).

A flaw exists in the way by which the Windows Script Engine for [JScript](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/6974wx4d.aspx) processes information. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a web page that, when visited by the user, would execute code of the attacker's choice with the user's privileges. The web page could be hosted on a web site, or sent directly to the user in email.

Although Microsoft has supplied a patch for this vulnerability and recommends all affected customers install the patch immediately, additional preventive measures have been provided that customers can use to help block the exploitation of this vulnerability while they are assessing the impact and compatibility of the patch. These temporary workarounds are discussed in the "Workarounds" section in the FAQ below.

**Mitigating factors:**

* For an attack to be successful, the user would need to visit a website under the attacker's control or receive an HTML e-mail from the attacker.
* Computers configured to disable active scripting in Internet Explorer are not susceptible to this issue.
* Exploiting the vulnerability would allow the attacker only the same privileges as the user. Users whose accounts are configured to have few privileges on the system would be at less risk than ones who operate with administrative privileges.
* Automatic exploitation of the vulnerability by an HTML email would be blocked by Outlook Express 6.0 and Outlook 2002 in their default configurations, and by Outlook 98 and 2000 if used in conjunction with the [Outlook Email Security Update](https://office.microsoft.com/downloads/2000/out2ksec.aspx).

**Severity Rating:**

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Windows 98 | Critical |
| Windows 98 Second Edition | Critical |
| Windows Me | Critical |
| Windows NT 4.0 | Critical |
| Windows NT 4.0 Terminal Server Edition | Critical |
| Windows 2000 | Critical |
| Windows XP | Critical |

The above [assessment](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21140) is based on the types of systems affected by the vulnerability, their typical deployment patterns, and the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would have on them.

**Vulnerability identifier:** [CAN-2003-0010](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=can-2003-0010)

**Tested Versions:**

Microsoft tested Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition, Windows Me, Windows NT 4.0, Windows NT 4.0 Terminal Server Edition, Windows 2000, and Windows XP to assess whether they are affected by these vulnerabilities. Previous versions are no longer [supported](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742), and may or may not be affected by these vulnerabilities.

## Frequently asked questions

**What's the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a [buffer overrun](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/glossary) vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause code of his or her choice to be executed as though it originated on the local machine.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused by a heap overflow in the Windows Script Engine for the [JScript](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/6974wx4d.aspx) scripting language, JScript.dll.

**What is a scripting language?**

Scripting languages can be used to add additional functionality to HTML web pages or operating systems. They can enable a web author to set and store variables, and work with data in the HTML code. For instance, a script can be used to check the version of the web browser a user is running, validate input, work with applets or controls, and communicate to the user.
In addition, scripts can be used in Windows to automate operating system tasks such as changing settings or mapping a network drive.

**What is a scripting engine?**

The Windows Scripting Engine serves as the component within Windows that interprets and executes script code written in scripting languages such as JScript or VBscript.

**What is JScript?**

[JScript](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/6974wx4d.aspx) is the Microsoft implementation of the [ECMA](https://www.ecma-international.org/) 262 language specification (ECMAScript Edition 3).
It is an interpreted, object-based scripting language. In general, JScript has fewer capabilities than full-fledged object-oriented languages like C++. Stand-alone applications cannot be written in JScript, for example. [JScript](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/6974wx4d.aspx) scripts can run only in the presence of an interpreter or "host", such as Active Server Pages (ASP), Internet Explorer, or Windows Script Host.

**What's wrong with the Windows Script Engine for JScript?**

There is a flaw in the way the JScript scripting engine processes the script. It does not correctly size a buffer during a memory operation.

**What could this vulnerability enable an attacker to do?**

This vulnerability could enable an attacker to cause code of the attacker's choice to run with user privileges on the system.

**If I am not using Internet Explorer do I need the patch?**

Yes. The vulnerability exists in the Windows Script Engine. Microsoft recommends all customers install the patch immediately.

**How could an attacker exploit this vulnerability?**

The attacker would need to construct a web page that contained specially formed script code. The attack could then proceed via either of two vectors. In the first, the attacker could host the web page on a web site; when a user visited the site, the web page could launch the script and exploit the vulnerability. In the second, the attacker could send the web page as an HTML mail. Upon being opened by the recipient, the web page could attempt to invoke the function and exploit the vulnerability.
In the HTML mail scenario, if the user was using Outlook Express 6.0 or Outlook 2002 in their default configurations, or Outlook 98 or 2000 in conjunction with the [Outlook Email Security Update](https://office.microsoft.com/downloads/2000/out2ksec.aspx), then an attack could not be automated and the user would still need to click on a URL sent in e-mail. However if the user was not using Outlook Express 6.0 or Outlook 2002 in their default configurations, or Outlook 98 or 2000 in conjunction with the [Outlook Email Security Update](https://office.microsoft.com/downloads/2000/out2ksec.aspx), the attacker could cause an attack to trigger automatically without the user having to click on a URL contained in an e-mail.

**What does the patch do?**

The patch addresses the vulnerability by carrying out proper input validation on the affected JScript function.

**Workarounds**

**Are there any workarounds that can be used to block exploitation of this vulnerability while I am testing or evaluating the patch?**

Yes. Although Microsoft urges all customers to apply the patch at the earliest possible opportunity, there are a number of workarounds that can be applied to help prevent the vector used to exploit this vulnerability in the interim.
It should be noted that these workarounds should be considered temporary measures as they simply help block paths of attack rather than correcting the underlying vulnerability.
The following sections are intended to provide you with information to protect your computer from attack. Each section describes the workarounds that you may wish to use depending on your computer's configuration.

* Turn off Active Scripting support in Internet Explorer

  You can turn off support for active scripting by performing the steps in the following knowledge base article:
  </https:>[https:](https://)
  Note that disabling scripting support in Internet Explorer will affect the functionality of many websites on the Internet and should be considered a temporary workaround only.
* Install the Outlook Email Security Update if needed

  In the case of an e-mail borne attack, if the user was using Outlook Express 6.0 or Outlook 2002 in their default configurations, or Outlook 98 or 2000 in conjunction with the [Outlook Email Security Update](https://office.microsoft.com/downloads/2000/out2ksec.aspx), then an attack could not be automated and the user would still need to click on a URL sent in e-mail. However if the user was not using Outlook Express 6.0 or Outlook 2002 in their default configurations, or Outlook 98 or 2000 in conjunction with the [Outlook Email Security Update](https://office.microsoft.com/downloads/2000/out2ksec.aspx), the attacker could cause an attack to trigger automatically without the user having to click on a URL contained in an e-mail. In both the web based and e-mail based cases, any limitations on the user's privileges would also restrict the capabilities of the attacker's script.
* Restrict websites to only your trusted websites

  As another workaround for this issue, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted Zone, after disabling Active Scripting in the Internet Zone. This will allow you to continue using trusted web sites exactly as you do today, while tightening the restrictions on untrusted sites. When you are able to deploy the patch, you'll be able to re-enable Active Scripting in the Internet Zone.
  To do this, perform the following steps:

  + Select "Tools," then "Internet Options." Click the "Security" tab.
  + In the box labeled "Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings," click "Trusted Sites," then click "Sites."
  + If you want to add sites that don't require a secure connection, de-select the checkbox at the bottom that says "Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone."
  + In the box labeled "Add this Web Site to the zone:," type the URL of a site that you trust, then click the "Add" button. Repeat for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  + Click on OK twice to accept the changes and return to IE.

  Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your computer. One in particular that you may want to add is [https://windowsupdate.microsoft.com](https://windowsupdate.microsoft.com/). This is the site that hosts the patch, and it requires Active Scripting in order to install the patch. Note that there's generally a trade-off between ease-of-use and security; by selecting a high-security configuration, you could make it extremely unlikely that a malicious web site could take action against you, but at the cost of missing a lot of rich functionality. The appropriate balance between security and ease-of-use is different for everyone, and you should pick a configuration that fits your needs. The good news is that it's easy to change your configuration, and you can try different configurations until you find the right one for you until you can install the patch.
