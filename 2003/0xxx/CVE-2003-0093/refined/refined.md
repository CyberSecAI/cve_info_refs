{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The tcpdump program attempts to decode UDP packets on specific ports (e.g., 1646) as RADIUS packets. It does not handle cases where the packet is not a valid RADIUS packet, especially when the second byte of the payload is zero, which is interpreted as the length field in a RADIUS header.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation when decoding RADIUS packets.",
      "Lack of a check for zero-length RADIUS attribute, leading to infinite loop."
    ],
    "impact": "A specially crafted UDP packet can cause tcpdump to enter an infinite loop, causing high CPU usage and potentially filling up the hard drive if the output is redirected to a file, leading to denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": "Sending a UDP packet with a destination port that tcpdump interprets as a RADIUS port (e.g., 1646) with a crafted payload (e.g., two zero bytes).",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send UDP packets to a machine running tcpdump."
