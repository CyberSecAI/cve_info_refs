{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A crash occurs in GDM (GNOME Display Manager) when a chosen host expires during an XDMCP connection.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by triggering a crash in the GDM service. This can be achieved by exploiting the host expiration mechanism in XDMCP.",
     "attack_vectors": [
       "The attack vector is through XDMCP (X Display Manager Control Protocol). An attacker can trigger the vulnerability through XDMCP connections, specifically during the host expiration process."
        ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable GDM instance and the ability to initiate XDMCP connections.",
    "additional_notes": "This vulnerability affects all versions of GDM from 2.0beta2 onwards. XDMCP should be confined to trusted networks, as it is inherently prone to DoS attacks. The fix was included in GDM versions 2.4.1.6 and 2.4.2.100."
