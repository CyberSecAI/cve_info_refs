## Microsoft Windows Media Services fails to properly validate TCP requests

#### Vulnerability Note VU#982630

Original Release Date: 2004-03-10 | Last Revised: 2004-03-11

---

### Overview

Microsoft [Windows Media Services](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windows2000pro/maintain/w2kmngd/15_2kwms.mspx) fails to properly validate TCP requests which could allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to cause the services to refuse new TCP connections.

### Description

| Microsoft Windows Media Services is an optional component that provides the ability to deliver streaming content to Windows Media clients. It is comprised of the Windows Media Unicast Service, Windows Media Station Service, Windows Media Program Service, and Windows Media Monitor Service. There is a vulnerability in the way TCP/IP connections are handled by both the Windows Media Station Service and Windows Media Monitor Service. By sending a specially crafted sequence of TCP/IP packets to either of these services, a remote, unauthenticated attacker could cause the service to stop responding or refuse additional TCP connections. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker could cause the Windows Media Station Service or Windows Media Monitor Service to stop responding or refuse new TCP connections. In order to restore functionality, the service needs to be restarted. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply Patch**  Microsoft has provided a patch to address this vulnerability. For details on obtaining the patch, please refer to Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS04-008](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms04-008.mspx). |
| --- |

| **Workarounds**Microsoft recommends the following workarounds for users who are unable to apply the patch:     + **Block ports 7007 and 7778 at your firewall.**  If you do not stream media over TCP to the Internet, you can block TCP port 7007. Also, block port 7778, which is used to administer Windows Media Services through Windows Media Monitor Service. Windows Media Services uses these ports. By blocking these ports at the firewall, you can help prevent systems that are behind the firewall from being attacked by attempts to exploit this vulnerability. *Impact of Workaround:* If you block port 7007, you will prevent multicast streams and the enabling of playlists from functioning across the firewall. If you block port 7778, you will prevent administrative functions from functioning across the firewall.    + **Administer your Windows Media Services from the console or through a Terminal Services session.**  Administer your Windows Media Services servers directly from the console or through a Terminal Services session. If you do this, you will not be affected by any successful denial of service attempts against Windows Media Monitor Service. The reason for this is that the service can still be accessed and used from the desktop of the system that is hosting Windows Media Services even after a successful denial of service attack has been taken place. *Impact of Workaround:* None.    + **Stop, disable, or remove Windows Media Station Service.**  [Stop, disable, or remove](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/home/using/productdoc/en/sys_srv_start_service.asp) Windows Media Station Service.*Impact of Workaround:* Stopping, disabling, or removing Windows Media Station Service will cause multicast streams or the enabling of playlists to not function.    + **Disable or remove Windows Media Monitor Service.**  [Disable or remove](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/home/using/productdoc/en/sys_srv_start_service.asp) Windows Media Monitor Service.*Impact of Workaround:* Disabling or removing Windows Media Monitor Service will prevent the possibility of administering Windows Media Services. |

### General Information

## Technical Details

**Technical description:**

A vulnerability exists because of the way that Windows Media Station Service and Windows Media Monitor Service, components of [Windows Media Services](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windows2000pro/maintain/w2kmngd/15_2kwms.mspx), handle TCP/IP connections. If a remote user were to send a specially-crafted sequence of TCP/IP packets to the listening port of either of these services, the service could stop responding to requests and no additional connections could be made. The service must be restarted to regain its functionality.

Windows Media Services is made up of Windows Media Services Administrator and four Windows Media Services components running on a single computer:

By using Windows Media Unicast Service, Windows Media content can be streamed over unicast, using either TCP or UDP as a transport, to Microsoft Windows Media Player or to another Windows Media server.

Windows Media Station Service performs three key functions:

* It arranges one or more streams of content (also known as a "[playlist](https://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/mediacenter/using/productdoc/rmtview/htm/aboutplaylists.asp)" or "program") for subsequent streaming.
* It multicasts the playlist or program to Windows Media Player or to another Windows Media server.
* It distributes the playlist or program locally to Windows Media Unicast Service for subsequent unicasting to Windows Media Player or to another Windows Media server.

Windows Media Program Service is a dependent service of Windows Media Station Service. Windows Media Program Service helps the server administrator build playlists of Windows Media content using Windows Media Services Administrator and persist those playlists for future use.

Windows Media Monitor Service is the administrative console of Windows Media Services.

**Note**   Windows Media Unicast Service may also be affected by a successful attack against Windows Media Station Service if Windows Media Unicast Service is sourcing a playlist from Windows Media Station Service. In this case, Windows Media Unicast Service could stop functioning when it encounters the next item in the playlist. An administrator can stream media by using Windows Media Unicast Service without a playlist.

**Mitigating factors:**

* The Windows Media Services component is not installed by default.
* Windows Media Services can be configured to offer streaming media over unicast only and would then not be affected by this vulnerability. This configuration would mean that different media streams from the same server could not be added into a playlist.
* Microsoft [recommends](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/forpros/server/server.aspx) that customers enable Windows Media Unicast Service only on Internet-facing sockets and ports and not the other components of Windows Media Services. If this practice is followed, the attack surface would not be exposed to the Internet.
* Customers who administer their Windows Media Services servers directly from the console or through a Terminal Services session are not affected by any successful Denial of Service attempts against Windows Media Monitor Service. Windows Media Monitor Service would not be accessible remotely, only locally.
* If you have disabled Windows Media Station Service and Windows Media Monitor Service, you are not affected by this vulnerability.

**Severity Rating:**

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Microsoft Windows 2000 Server** | Moderate |

The above [assessment](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21140) is based on the types of systems that are affected by the vulnerability, their typical deployment patterns, and the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would have on them.

**Vulnerability identifier:** [CAN-2003-0905](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=can-2003-0905)

## Workarounds

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. These workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability. However, they help block known attack vectors. Workarounds may reduce functionality in some cases; in such cases, the reduction in functionality is identified below.

* **Block ports 7007 and 7778 at your firewall.**

  If you do not stream media over TCP to the Internet, you can block TCP port 7007. Also, block port 7778, which is used to administer Windows Media Services through Windows Media Monitor Service. Windows Media Services uses these ports. By blocking these ports at the firewall, you can help prevent systems that are behind the firewall from being attacked by attempts to exploit this vulnerability.

  **Impact of Workaround:** If you block port 7007, you will prevent multicast streams and the enabling of playlists from functioning across the firewall. If you block port 7778, you will prevent administrative functions from functioning across the firewall.
* **Administer your Windows Media Services from the console or through a Terminal Services session.**

  Administer your Windows Media Services servers directly from the console or through a Terminal Services session. If you do this, you will not be affected by any successful denial of service attempts against Windows Media Monitor Service. The reason for this is that the service can still be accessed and used from the desktop of the system that is hosting Windows Media Services even after a successful denial of service attack has been taken place.

  **Impact of Workaround**: None.
* **Stop, disable, or remove Windows Media Station Service.**

  [Stop, disable, or remove](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=48468) Windows Media Station Service.

  **Impact of Workaround**: Stopping, disabling, or removing Windows Media Station Service will cause multicast streams or the enabling of playlists to not function.
* **Disable or remove Windows Media Monitor Service.**

  [Disable or remove](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=48468) Windows Media Monitor Service.

  **Impact of Workaround:** Disabling or removing Windows Media Monitor Service will prevent the possibility of administering Windows Media Services.

## Frequently asked questions

**What's the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a [denial of service](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21142) vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could cause Windows Media Station Service or Windows Media Monitor Service running on a system that is running Windows 2000 Server to stop responding to new requests. For Windows Media Station Service, the result would be that the service would not accept any new TCP connections. New requests for media would not be serviced, nor would subsequent items in a playlist be serviced. For of Windows Media Monitor Service, the result would be that the service would not accept any new TCP connections; however, the server administrator could use Terminal Services to log on remotely and administer Windows Media Services.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability exists because the process by which Windows Media Station Service and Windows Media Monitor Service validate TCP requests could cause both services to stop accepting new connection requests.

**What is Windows Media Services?**

[Windows Media Services](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windows2000pro/maintain/w2kmngd/15_2kwms.mspx) is a Windows server component that enables content to be streamed from a Windows Media server to Windows Media clients over the Internet or over an intranet. Clients who receive the content can render, as in play or display, it as it is being received without first downloading the content.

**What components are installed on my system when I install Windows Media Services?**

Windows Media Services is made up of four Windows services:

* Windows Media Unicast Service. This service provides unicast streaming over the Internet or over an intranet.
* Windows Media Station Service. This service provides multicast streaming. To be able to use multicast streaming, all routers between the server and the client must have multicast enabled.
* Windows Media Program Service. This service provides a sequential program, or [playlist](https://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/mediacenter/using/productdoc/rmtview/htm/aboutplaylists.asp), to Windows Media Station Service. Playlists can also be used by Windows Media Unicast Service, which uses features in Windows Media Station Service and Windows Media Program Service to operate.
* Windows Media Monitor Service. This is a helper service to Windows Media Services; it monitors client and server connections and is the service through which Windows Media Services is administered.

**What are the unicast and multicast methods of media streaming?**

Unicast and multicast media streaming are methods of delivering media content to clients across a network.
Unicast is a file transfer process where a separate copy of the data is sent from the server to each client that requests it.
Multicast is a file transfer process where a single copy of the data is sent, but all clients access that single stream in progress. Multiple copies of data are not sent across the network. For more information about multicast media streaming, see the [Multicast Streaming with Windows Media Services 4.1](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/forpros/server/server.aspx) Web site.

**What might the vulnerability allow an attacker to do?**

An unauthenticated attacker could send a specially-crafted sequence of TCP/IP packets to the server, which could cause Windows Media Station Service to stop accepting new requests. Windows Media Station Service would still be able to stream media on TCP connections that have already been made, but it would not accept new requests. New requests for media would not be serviced. Requests for the next item in a playlist would also not be serviced because they are essentially new requests.
To recover from this state, an administrator would have to restart the service.

**Who could exploit the vulnerability?**

An unauthenticated attacker who could connect to Windows Media Station Service or to Windows Media Monitor Service could exploit this vulnerability by causing the services to stop responding to new requests.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Apply this update to systems that have [Windows Media Center Services](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windows2000pro/maintain/w2kmngd/15_2kwms.mspx) for Windows 2000 Server installed.

**I am running Windows Media Services 4.1 on Windows NT4 Server. Am I affected by this vulnerability?**

No. Windows Media Services 4.1 (available for [download](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/forpros/server/server.aspx) for Windows NT4 Server) is not affected by this vulnerability.

**What does the update do?**

The update makes sure that Windows Media Station Service and Windows Media Monitor Service correctly validate TCP requests.
