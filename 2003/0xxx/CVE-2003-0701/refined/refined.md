Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2003-0701:

**1. Object Tag Vulnerability (CAN-2003-0532)**

*   **Root Cause:** Internet Explorer does not properly check the object type returned from a web server when handling an `<object>` tag. Specifically, it fails to validate an HTTP response, which can lead to the execution of arbitrary code.
*   **Weakness:** Improper input validation of HTTP responses related to `<object>` tags.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on a user's system with the privileges of the logged-on user. This could allow the attacker to take any action on a user's system.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   A malicious web page containing a specially crafted `<object>` tag.
    *   A specially crafted HTML-based email.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   Ability to host a malicious website.
    *   Ability to send HTML emails.
    *   Needs to lure the user to visit the crafted web page or open the malicious email.

**2. Browser Cache Script Execution in My Computer Zone (CAN-2003-0531)**

*   **Root Cause:** Flaw in the way Internet Explorer handles the browser cache. The browser does not properly validate the file name request when checking for the existence of local files in the browser cache, allowing bypass of the cross-domain security model.
*   **Weakness:** Improper validation of file names when accessing the browser cache. Failure to enforce the cross-domain security model, allowing files from the internet zone to execute in the My Computer zone.
*  **Impact**:
      *  Allows an attacker to read local system files if the attacker knows the full path and filename.
      *  Allows an attacker to access data shared with other websites.
      *  Allows an attacker to run executable files present on the user's local system without parameters.
      *  Allows injection of malicious script code to run in the My Computer security zone, which has fewer restrictions.
*   **Attack Vector:** A malicious web page that exploits this vulnerability when the browser checks for files in the cache.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   Ability to host a malicious website.
    *   Needs to lure the user to visit the website.

**3. BR549.DLL Buffer Overrun (CAN-2003-0530)**

*   **Root Cause:** A buffer overflow in the BR549.DLL ActiveX control.
*   **Weakness:** Buffer overflow in an ActiveX control used for Windows Reporting Tool, which is no longer supported.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack Vector:** Not clearly detailed, but implied it could be triggered through a malicious web page or email due to it being an ActiveX control
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**  Likely the ability to host a malicious website or send malicious emails

**Additional Notes:**

*   The document mentions that the object tag vulnerability was a language-specific variant of a previously patched issue (CAN-2003-0344), affecting double-byte character set environments, like Japanese.
*   The document also mentions an issue with the patch causing problems for Windows XP systems configured as web servers running ASP.NET. This issue was addressed by a new bulletin (MS03-040), which supersedes MS03-032
*   The patch for this vulnerability sets the Kill Bit for the BR549.DLL ActiveX control and includes fixes for issues related to how Internet Explorer renders HTML, specifically related to input type tags.
