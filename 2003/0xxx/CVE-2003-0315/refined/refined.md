Root cause of vulnerability:
- The webserver does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the URL, allowing directory traversal using "..", and lacks proper bounds checking, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Directory traversal: Allows access to files and directories outside the webroot by using ".." sequences in the URL, including access to sensitive files such as system.ini and executable files like calc.exe and the web server's binary (sws.exe) itself.
- Insecure file download:  Arbitrary files can be downloaded from the server by appending their paths to /internal.sws?.
- Directory listing exposure: When directory listings are enabled, directories outside the webroot can be listed using "..." in the URL.
- Denial of service: The server crashes when receiving a GET request with a URL containing a single forward slash followed by a closing angle bracket or a URL string exceeding a certain length (219 characters).

Impact of exploitation:
- Unauthorized access to sensitive files and directories, potentially leading to information disclosure and system compromise.
- Download of arbitrary binary files, potentially including executable files, which could be exploited to further compromise the server.
- Server crashes, leading to denial of service and unavailability of the web server.

Attack vectors:
- Sending specially crafted HTTP GET requests containing ".." sequences or other malicious URLs through web browser.
- Sending GET requests with a large URL string.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Network access to the vulnerable server. No special privileges are needed.
