- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A flaw exists in the ISA Server DNS intrusion detection application filter. The filter does not properly handle a specific type of request when scanning incoming DNS requests.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper handling of a specific type of DNS request within the DNS intrusion detection filter.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Denial of service to the published DNS server. DNS requests arriving at the ISA Server would be stopped at the firewall and not passed through to the internal DNS server.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a specially formed DNS request to an ISA Server computer that is publishing a DNS server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the ISA server, which could be from the Internet. The attacker does not need any prior authentication. The target must have DNS server publishing enabled.
