CVE-2003-0161:
The content describes a buffer overflow vulnerability in Sendmail's address parsing code.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A "char to int" data type conversion within the `prescan()` function in `parseaddr.c` leads to insufficient bounds checking. Specifically, when a character with the value 0xFF (which is -1 when treated as a signed char) is encountered, it is interpreted as the control value -1 and can cause length checks to be bypassed.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Stack-based buffer overflow in the address parsing logic.
    - Insufficient bounds checking due to a faulty control value check.
    - Improper handling of signed char to int conversion.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Remote attackers can gain root access on vulnerable Sendmail servers.
    - Local attackers can cause a local root compromise. If privilege separation is in place, an attacker may still compromise the `smmsp` account and control the submission queue.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Sending a specially crafted email with an address containing 0xFF.
    - DNS could also be used as an attack vector.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Remote attacker needs to send a specially crafted email.
    - Local attacker requires local access.
    - Knowledge of the vulnerability and the ability to craft the malicious email or DNS data.
