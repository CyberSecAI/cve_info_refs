Dependent Packages:  none

Description:
  Michal Zalewski discovered [[1]](#1) a confirmed [[2]](#2) buffer overflow
  vulnerability in all version of the Sendmail [[0]](#0) MTA earlier than
  8.12.9. The mail address parser performs insufficient bounds checking
  in certain conditions due to a "char" to "int" data type conversion,
  making it possible for an attacker to take control of the application.
  Attackers may remotely exploit this vulnerability to gain "root"
  access of any vulnerable Sendmail server. The Common Vulnerabilities
  and Exposures (CVE) project assigned the id CAN-2003-0161 [[3]](#3) to the
  problem.

  Please check whether you are affected by running "<prefix>/bin/rpm
  -q sendmail". If you have the "sendmail" package installed and its
  version is affected (see above), we recommend that you immediately
  upgrade it (see Solution). [4][[5]](#5)

Solution:
  Select the updated source RPM appropriate for your OpenPKG release
  [[6]](#6), fetch it from the OpenPKG FTP service [[7]](#7) or a mirror location,
  verify its integrity [[8]](#8), build a corresponding binary RPM from it [[4]](#4)
  and update your OpenPKG installation by applying the binary RPM [[5]](#5).
  For the current release OpenPKG 1.2, perform the following operations
  to permanently fix the security problem (for other releases adjust
  accordingly).

  $ ftp ftp.openpkg.org
  ftp> bin
  ftp> cd release/1.2/UPD
  ftp> get sendmail-8.12.7-1.2.2.src.rpm
  ftp> bye
  $ <prefix>/bin/rpm -v --checksig sendmail-8.12.7-1.2.2.src.rpm

## Sendmail address parsing buffer overflow

#### Vulnerability Note VU#897604

Original Release Date: 2003-03-29 | Last Revised: 2003-09-25

---

### Overview

Sendmail contains a buffer overflow in code that parses email addresses. A remote attacker could execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| Sendmail is a widely used mail transfer agent (MTA). There is a stack overflow vulnerability in code that parses email addresses. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability with a message containing a specially crafted email address.  When processing email messages, sendmail creates tokens from address elements (user, host, domain). The code that performs this function (prescan() in parseaddr.c) contains logic to check that the tokens are not malformed or overly long. In certain cases, a variable in prescan() is set to the special control value -1, which may alter the program logic to skip the length checks. On little-endian platforms that treat the char type as signed int, the char value 0xFF sets the high-order bit, which in terms of a signed int indicates a negative value. When prescan() treats a char with the value 0xFF as an int, the value is interpreted as -1, which can cause the length checks to be skipped. Using an email message with a specially crafted address containing 0xFF, an attacker could cause the length checks to be skipped and overwrite the saved instruction pointer on the stack.Further information is available in a [message](http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/316773/2003-03-28/2003-04-03/0) posted by Michal Zalewski.In sendmail 8.9.12 and 8.11.7 (and possibly other versions), additional modifications have been made to protect other vulnerable sendmail MTAs. From the [release notes](http://www.sendmail.org/ftp/RELEASE_NOTES) for sendmail 8.9.12:  ``` 8.12.9/8.12.9   2003/03/29        SECURITY: Fix a buffer overflow in address parsing due to                a char to int conversion problem which is potentially                remotely exploitable.  Problem found by Michal Zalewski.                Note: an MTA that is not patched might be vulnerable to                data that it receives from untrusted sources, which                includes DNS.        To provide partial protection to internal, unpatched sendmail MTAs,                8.12.9 changes by default (char)0xff to (char)0x7f in                headers etc.  To turn off this conversion compile with                -DALLOW_255 or use the command line option -d82.101.        To provide partial protection for internal, unpatched MTAs that may be                performing 7->8 or 8->7 bit MIME conversions, the default                for MaxMimeHeaderLength has been changed to 2048/1024.                Note: this does have a performance impact, and it only                protects against frontal attacks from the outside.                To disable the checks and return to pre-8.12.9 defaults,                set MaxMimeHeaderLength to 0/0. ```  Note that DNS could also be used as an attack vector. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker could execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service on a vulnerable system. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade or Patch**Upgrade or apply a patch as specified by your vendor. In addition to addressing the vulnerability, upgraded versions of sendmail (8.9.12 and 8.11.7) include modifications to help protect other vulnerable sendmail MTAs. |
| --- |

| **Enable RunAsUser**Consider setting the RunAsUser option to reduce the impact of this vulnerability. The CERT/CC recommends limiting the privileges of applications and services whenever possible. |

+ VPS
+ CTX

All the above products deploy Sendmail; it should not be disabled on these products.

For all of the above products Nortel Networks recommends applying the latest Sun Microsystems patches in accordance with that vendor's recommendations. To avoid applying patches twice, please ensure that the Sun Microsystems patch applied also addresses the vulnerability identified in CERT Advisory CA-2003-07.

The following Nortel Networks Succession products are potentially affected by the vulnerability identified in CERT Advisory CA-2003-12:

+ SSPFS-based CS2000 Management Tools

Dependent Packages:  none

Description:
  Michal Zalewski discovered [1] a confirmed [2] buffer overflow
  vulnerability in all version of the Sendmail [0] MTA earlier than
  8.12.9. The mail address parser performs insufficient bounds checking
  in certain conditions due to a "char" to "int" data type conversion,
  making it possible for an attacker to take control of the application.
  Attackers may remotely exploit this vulnerability to gain "root"
  access of any vulnerable Sendmail server. The Common Vulnerabilities
  and Exposures (CVE) project assigned the id CAN-2003-0161 [3] to the
  problem.

  Please check whether you are affected by running "<prefix>/bin/rpm
  -q sendmail". If you have the "sendmail" package installed and its
  version is affected (see above), we recommend that you immediately
  upgrade it (see Solution). [4][5]

Solution:
  Select the updated source RPM appropriate for your OpenPKG release
  [6], fetch it from the OpenPKG FTP service [7] or a mirror location,
  verify its integrity [8], build a corresponding binary RPM from it [4]
  and update your OpenPKG installation by applying the binary RPM [5].
  For the current release OpenPKG 1.2, perform the following operations
  to permanently fix the security problem (for other releases adjust
  accordingly).

1)  problem description, brief discussion, solution, upgrade information

    sendmail is the most widely used mail transport agent (MTA) in the
    internet. A remotely exploitable buffer overflow has been found in all
    versions of sendmail that come with SuSE products. These versions include
    sendmail-8.11 and sendmail-8.12 releases. sendmail is the MTA subsystem
    that is installed by default on all SuSE products up to and including
    SuSE Linux 8.0 and the SuSE Linux Enterprise Server 7.

    The vulnerability was discovered by Michal Zalewski. It is not related
    to the vulnerability found by ISS in the first week of March as announced
    by SuSE Security in SuSE Security Announcement SuSE-SA:2003:013 (CERT
    Announcement ID CA-2003-07). The impact is believed to be a local root
    compromise with the possibility of a remote compromise. Even though
    the remote nature of the vulnerability is not confirmed, we believe that
    it is safe to assume that the vulnerability may be remotely exploitable.
    The nature of the flaw is a stack overflow in a function that is called
    frequently throughout the sendmail source code. The function is used for
    processing email addresses.

    There is no known workaround for this vulnerability other than using a
    different MTA. The vulnerability is triggered by an email message sent
    through the sendmail MTA subsystem. In that respect, it is different
    from commonly known bugs that occur in the context of an open TCP
    connection. By consequence, the vulnerability also exists if email
    messages get forwarded over a relay that itself does not run a vulnerable
    MTA. This specific detail and the wide distribution of sendmail in the
    internet causes this vulnerability to be considered a flaw of major
    severity. We recommend to install the update packages that are provided
    for download at the locations listed below.

    Please download the update package for your distribution and verify its
    integrity by the methods listed in section 3) of this announcement.
    Then, install the package using the command "rpm -Fhv file.rpm" to apply
    the update.
    Our maintenance customers are being notified individually. The packages
    are being offered to install from the maintenance web.

    SPECIAL INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS:
    ==============================
    After performing the update, it is necessary to restart all running
    instances of sendmail using the command "rcsendmail restart" as root.

2)  Pending vulnerabilities in SuSE Distributions and Workarounds:

    - glibc
      SuSE Security is working on glibc updates for the RPC XDR integer overflow
      security problem in glibc. The central function of the glibc package in a
      Linux system requires extensive testing of the update packages. The update
      packages will be provided for download at the usual location and
      publically announced as soon as the testing is completed successfully.

    - vnc
      VNC (Virtual Network Computing) uses a weak cookie generation process
      which can be exploited by an attacker to bypass authentication.
      New packages are currently being tested and will be available on our
      FTP servers soon.

    - openssl
      A paper regarding remote timing attacks against OpenSSL has been
      published by researchers of the Stanford University. It is possible
      to extract the private RSA key used by services using OpenSSL by
      observing their timing behavior. Fixed packages will be available
      on our FTP servers soon.

3)  standard appendix: authenticity verification, additional information

  - Package authenticity verification:

    SuSE update packages are available on many mirror ftp servers all over
    the world. While this service is being considered valuable and important
    to the free and open source software community, many users wish to be
    sure about the origin of the package and its content before installing
    the package. There are two verification methods that can be used
    independently from each other to prove the authenticity of a downloaded
    file or rpm package:
    1) md5sums as provided in the (cryptographically signed) announcement.
    2) using the internal gpg signatures of the rpm package.

    1) execute the command
        md5sum <name-of-the-file.rpm>
       after you downloaded the file from a SuSE ftp server or its mirrors.
       Then, compare the resulting md5sum with the one that is listed in the
       announcement. Since the announcement containing the checksums is
       cryptographically signed (usually using the key security@suse.de),
       the checksums show proof of the authenticity of the package.
       We disrecommend to subscribe to security lists which cause the
       email message containing the announcement to be modified so that
       the signature does not match after transport through the mailing
       list software.
       Downsides: You must be able to verify the authenticity of the
       announcement in the first place. If RPM packages are being rebuilt
       and a new version of a package is published on the ftp server, all
       md5 sums for the files are useless.

    2) rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the authenticity
       of an rpm package. Use the command
        rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
       to verify the signature of the package, where <file.rpm> is the
       filename of the rpm package that you have downloaded. Of course,
       package authenticity verification can only target an un-installed rpm
       package file.
       Prerequisites:
        a) gpg is installed
        b) The package is signed using a certain key. The public part of this
           key must be installed by the gpg program in the directory
           ~/.gnupg/ under the user's home directory who performs the
           signature verification (usually root). You can import the key
           that is used by SuSE in rpm packages for SuSE Linux by saving
           this announcement to a file ("announcement.txt") and
           running the command (do "su -" to be root):
            gpg --batch; gpg < announcement.txt | gpg --import
           SuSE Linux distributions version 7.1 and thereafter install the
           key "build@suse.de" upon installation or upgrade, provided that
           the package gpg is installed. The file containing the public key
           is placed at the top-level directory of the first CD (pubring.gpg)
           and at ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/suse/pubring.gpg-build.suse.de .

  - SuSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
    subscribe:

    suse-security@suse.com
        -   general/linux/SuSE security discussion.
            All SuSE security announcements are sent to this list.

            Only SuSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
            To subscribe, send an email to
                <suse-security-announce-subscribe@suse.com>.

## History

The CERT Division is the birthplace of cybersecurity. For nearly 30 years, the CERT Division of the SEI has partnered with government, industry, law enforcement, and academia to advance cybersecurity and improve the security and resilience of computer systems and networks.

Originally focused on incident response, we have expanded into cybersecurity areas such as network situational awareness, malicious code analysis, secure coding, resilience management, insider threats, digital investigations and intelligence, workforce development, DevOps, forensics, software assurance, vulnerability discovery and analysis, and risk management.

## Former Director Richard Pethia

[Richard Pethia](/about/leadership/display.cfm?customel_datapageid_2623=3545) was founding director of the SEI's CERT Division. Pethia, who served as director of CERT from 1988 to 2016, guided the organization through tremendous growth and change. Under Pethia's leadership, the unit expanded and evolved from the CERT Coordination Center—a small group focused on computer incident response—to a research organization of more than 200 professionals dedicated to solving problems with widespread cybersecurity implications.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

Sendmail, Inc., and the Sendmail Consortium announce the availability
of sendmail 8.12.9.  It contains a fix for a critical security
problem discovered by Michal Zalewski whom we thank for bringing
this problem to our attention.  Sendmail urges all users to either
upgrade to sendmail 8.12.9 or apply a patch for your sendmail version
that is part of this announcement.  Remember to check the PGP
signatures of patches or releases obtained via FTP or HTTP (to check
the correctness of the patches in this announcement please verify
the PGP signature of it).  For those not running the open source
version, check with your vendor for a patch.

We apologize for releasing this information today (2003-03-29) but
we were forced to do so by an e-mail on a public mailing list (that
has been sent by an irresponsible individual) which contains
information about the security flaw.

For a complete list of changes see the release notes down below.

Please send bug reports to sendmail-bugs@sendmail.org as usual.

Note: We have changed the way we digitally sign the source code
distributions to simplify verification: in contrast to earlier
versions two .sig files are provided, one each for the gzip'ed
version and the compressed version. That is, instead of signing the
tar file, we sign the compressed/gzip'ed files, so you do not need
to uncompress the file before checking the signature.

This version can be found at

ftp://ftp.sendmail.org/pub/sendmail/sendmail.8.12.9.tar.gz
ftp://ftp.sendmail.org/pub/sendmail/sendmail.8.12.9.tar.gz.sig
ftp://ftp.sendmail.org/pub/sendmail/sendmail.8.12.9.tar.Z
ftp://ftp.sendmail.org/pub/sendmail/sendmail.8.12.9.tar.Z.sig

and the usual mirror sites.

MD5 signatures:

3dba3b6d769b3681640d0a38b0eba48c sendmail.8.12.9.tar.gz
19e39c9e9bc8fae288245c546639e1f4 sendmail.8.12.9.tar.gz.sig
268fc4045ba3eac6dfd9dc95d889ba5f sendmail.8.12.9.tar.Z
19e39c9e9bc8fae288245c546639e1f4 sendmail.8.12.9.tar.Z.sig

You either need the first two files or the third and fourth, i.e.,
the gzip'ed version or the compressed version and the corresponding
.sig file.  The PGP signature was created using the Sendmail Signing
Key/2003, available on the web site (<http://www.sendmail.org/>) or
on the public key servers.

Since sendmail 8.11 and later includes hooks to cryptography, the
following information from OpenSSL applies to sendmail as well.

   PLEASE REMEMBER THAT EXPORT/IMPORT AND/OR USE OF STRONG CRYPTOGRAPHY
   SOFTWARE, PROVIDING CRYPTOGRAPHY HOOKS OR EVEN JUST COMMUNICATING
   TECHNICAL DETAILS ABOUT CRYPTOGRAPHY SOFTWARE IS ILLEGAL IN SOME
   PARTS OF THE WORLD.  SO, WHEN YOU IMPORT THIS PACKAGE TO YOUR
   COUNTRY, RE-DISTRIBUTE IT FROM THERE OR EVEN JUST EMAIL TECHNICAL
   SUGGESTIONS OR EVEN SOURCE PATCHES TO THE AUTHOR OR OTHER PEOPLE
   YOU ARE STRONGLY ADVISED TO PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO ANY EXPORT/IMPORT
   AND/OR USE LAWS WHICH APPLY TO YOU. THE AUTHORS ARE NOT LIABLE FOR
   ANY VIOLATIONS YOU MAKE HERE. SO BE CAREFUL, IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY.

			SENDMAIL RELEASE NOTES
      $Id: RELEASE_NOTES,v 8.1340.2.132 2003/03/29 14:02:26 ca Exp $

This listing shows the version of the sendmail binary, the version
of the sendmail configuration files, the date of release, and a
summary of the changes in that release.

8.12.9/8.12.9	2003/03/29
	SECURITY: Fix a buffer overflow in address parsing due to
		a char to int conversion problem which is potentially
		remotely exploitable.  Problem found by Michal Zalewski.
  		Note: an MTA that is not patched might be vulnerable to
		data that it receives from untrusted sources, which
		includes DNS.
	To provide partial protection to internal, unpatched sendmail MTAs,
		8.12.9 changes by default (char)0xff to (char)0x7f in
		headers etc.  To turn off this conversion compile with
		-DALLOW_255 or use the command line option -d82.101.
	To provide partial protection for internal, unpatched MTAs that may be
		performing 7->8 or 8->7 bit MIME conversions, the default
		for MaxMimeHeaderLength has been changed to 2048/1024.
		Note: this does have a performance impact, and it only
		protects against frontal attacks from the outside.
		To disable the checks and return to pre-8.12.9 defaults,
		set MaxMimeHeaderLength to 0/0.
	Do not complain about -ba when submitting mail.  Problem noted
		by Derek Wueppelmann.
	Fix compilation with Berkeley DB 1.85 on systems that do not
		have flock(2).  Problem noted by Andy Harper of Kings
		College London.
	Properly initialize data structure for dns maps to avoid various
		errors, e.g., looping processes.  Problem noted by
		Maurice Makaay.
	CONFIG: Prevent multiple application of rule to add smart host.
		Patch from Andrzej Filip.
	CONFIG: Fix queue group declaration in MAILER(`usenet').
	CONTRIB: buildvirtuser: New option -t builds the virtusertable
		text file instead of the database map.
	Portability:
		Revert wrong change made in 8.12.7 and actually use the
			builtin getopt() version in sendmail on Linux.
			This can be overridden by using -DSM_CONF_GETOPT=0
			in which case the OS supplied version will be used.

Instructions to extract and apply the patches for sendmail:

The data below is a uuencoded, gzip'ed tar file.  Store the data
between "========= begin patch ========" and "========= end patch
==========" into a file called "patch.sm" and apply the following
command:

uudecode -p < patch.sm | gunzip -c | tar -xf -

This will give you these files (explanation for each file is on
the left, only "prescan.VERSION.patch" are the files).

prescan.8.12.8.patch	only for 8.12.8, changes version string to 8.12.8p1
prescan.8.12.patch	for 8.12.0 - 8.12.7, does not change version string
prescan.8.11.6.patch	only for 8.11.6, changes version string to 8.11.6p2
prescan.8.11.patch	for 8.11.0 - 8.11.5, does not change version string
prescan.8.9.3.patch	only for 8.9.3, changes version string to 8.9.3p2
prescan.8.9.patch	for 8.9.0 - 8.9.2, does not change version string

Apply the appropriate patch to your version of the sendmail source
code (change the version number below to the right one!), e.g.,

cd sendmail-8.12.8/sendmail
patch < prescan.8.12.8.patch

recompile sendmail, and install the new binary.

CVE:  CAN-2003-0161
CERT: VU#897604

  ********************************************************
  *** FORCED RELEASE -- VENDOR NOTIFIED AS OF 03/18/03 ***
  ********************************************************

There is a vulnerability in Sendmail versions 8.12.8 and prior. The
address parser performs insufficient bounds checking in certain conditions
due to a char to int conversion, making it possible for an attacker to
take control of the application. This problem is not related to the recent
ISS vulnerability announcement.

The impact is believed to be a root compromise. I've confirmed this is a
local issue, and my initial impression is that a remote attack possibility
is not that unlikely. Only platforms with 'char' type signed by default
are vulnerable as-is, and little endian systems would be easier to
exploit. Systems that use Sendmail privilege separation are safer against
the _local_ attack, but even then it is still possible to compromise the
smmsp account and control the submission queue.

The bug lurks in parseaddr.c in prescan() function, which, in certain
conditions, will run past the buffer size limit and overwrite stack
variables, reaching to and past the stored instruction pointer itself.
This function is called quite generously accross the code for processing
e-mail addresses.

It is possible for the attacker to repeatedly skip the length check
location in this function because of an unfortunate construction of a
"special" control value check. A special value, NOCHAR, is defined as -1.
There is a variable 'c', also used to store last read character, declared
as int, and the variable will be sometimes assigned the value of NOCHAR to
indicate a special condition.

Unfortunately, the input character - type char - defaults to a signed type
on many modern platforms, and ASCII value 0xff ((char)-1) will be
converted to 0xffffffff ((int)-1) upon assignment. This makes character
0xff indistinguishable from NOCHAR after being stored in 'c', and makes it
possible for the attacker to spoof NOCHAR and skip the length check.

Since precise control of the overwrite process is possible (length, offset
and layout are up to the attacker), even though the values are mostly
fixed, it is reasonable to expect that this vulnerability will be easy to
exploit on little endian systems. Even on big endian systems, it might be
still possible to alter important control variables on the stack, and you
are generally advised to upgrade.

I've notified the vendor on March 18, and got a response on the next day.
Sendmail is releasing version 8.12.9, and the official notice is as
follows:

  Sendmail, Inc., and the Sendmail Consortium announce the availability
  of sendmail 8.12.9.  It contains a fix for a critical security
  problem discovered by Michal Zalewski whom we thank for bringing
  this problem to our attention.  Sendmail urges all users to either
  upgrade to sendmail 8.12.9 or apply a patch for your sendmail version.
  Remember to check the PGP signatures of patches or releases obtained via
  FTP or HTTP (to check the correctness of the patches in this
  announcement please verify the PGP signature of it).  For those not
  running the open source version, check with your vendor for a patch.

        SECURITY: Fix a buffer overflow in address parsing due to
                a char to int conversion problem which is potentially
                remotely exploitable.  Problem found by Michal Zalewski.

Please visit <http://www.sendmail.org> for more details and patches, and
check with your vendor for the availability of a new or patched package.

   That means that Mighty Mouse is on the way!
   Yes sir, when there is a wrong to right
   Mighty Mouse will join the fight
   On the sea or on the land
   He gets the situation well in hand
   So though we are in danger
   We never despair
