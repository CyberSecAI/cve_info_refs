```
Package: crafty
Version: 19.1-1
Severity: normal
Tags: security upstream patch

Intro
-----

  crafty is the strong chess program played on ICC.

  It installs a file 'crafty.bin' upon both Debian Stable, and Debian
 unstable as setgid games:

skx@hell:~$ ls -l /usr/games/crafty*
-rwxr-xr-x    1 root     root          384 Dec 17  2002 /usr/games/crafty
-rwxr-sr-x    1 root     games     1128712 Dec 17  2002 /usr/games/crafty.bin

Problems
--------

  The setgid file, crafty.bin, contains a pair of flaws in it's command
 line handling.

  Both flaws are essentially the same, and involve a lack of bounds checking
 on the arguments supplied by the user.
  Either of these flaws allow a malicious local user to gain group 'games'
 permissions.

  From main.c:2901
      else if (strstr(argv[i],"path")) {
        strcpy(buffer,argv[i]);
        result=Option(tree);
        if (result == 0)
          printf("ERROR \"%s\" is unknown command-line option\n",buffer);
        display=tree->pos;
      }

      main.c:2934
      if (argc > 1) {
      for (i=1;i<argc;i++) if (strcmp(argv[i],"c"))
	  if ((argv[i][0]<'0' || argv[i][0] > '9') &&
	     !strstr(argv[i],"path")) {
	    strcpy(buffer,argv[i]);
            result=Option(tree);
            if (result == 0)
             printf("ERROR \"%s\" is unknown command-line option\n",buffer);
          }
      }

Exploit
-------

  Sample exploit code for the first issue is available upon request,
 I've not included it here as it's not terribly interesting.

Fixes
-----

  The supplied diff, which has been compiled and tested, will close
 both these issues.

Thanks for informing.

At the moment this advisory is under review, I can't any detail from
CVE web page. My question is: How do I inform CVE that the bug has
been fixed in a new upload ?

CVE does not attempt to exhaustively catalogue which versions and packages
are affected, only to standardize a set of names for known vulnerabilities
so that they can be cross-referenced.

<http://cve.mitre.org/about/>

So, it is not necessary to send this kind of information to CVE.  Since I
forwarded them the original bug report, the entry for CAN-2003-0612 should
contain a reference this bug report once it is publicized.

Thanks for fixing the bug.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
