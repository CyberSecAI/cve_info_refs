```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The `crafty.bin` executable contains a pair of buffer overflow vulnerabilities in its command line argument handling due to a lack of bounds checking when using `strcpy`.

- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
    - Buffer overflow in `main.c:2901` when handling arguments containing "path".
    - Buffer overflow in `main.c:2934` when handling other non-numeric arguments.
    - Usage of `strcpy` without bounds checking.

- Impact of exploitation: Local users can gain group `games` permissions by exploiting the buffer overflow, potentially allowing unauthorized actions.

- Attack vectors: By supplying specially crafted command-line arguments to the setgid `crafty.bin` executable.

- Required attacker capabilities/position: A local user must be able to execute `/usr/games/crafty.bin`.
