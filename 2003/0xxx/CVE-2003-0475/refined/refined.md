Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The iWeb Server 2 software fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically within the file path handling, allowing directory traversal attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Directory Traversal:** The server is vulnerable to directory traversal attacks via the URL path. It does not properly filter or sanitize input, allowing attackers to use sequences like `\..\\` (or `%5c%2e%2e%5c`) to navigate outside the intended web root directory and access arbitrary files on the server's file system.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary File Access:** Remote attackers can read the content of any accessible file on the server's file system, including sensitive system files (as illustrated with the `windows\system.ini` example). This can lead to information disclosure, potentially exposing confidential data or configuration details.

**Attack vectors:**

- **HTTP Request:** Attackers send specially crafted HTTP requests to the iWeb Server 2, using URL encoded directory traversal sequences (`%5c%2e%2e%5c` or `\..\\`) within the requested file path.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Remote Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the server running iWeb Server 2.
- **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know how to construct HTTP requests and use URL encoding.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by "posidron".
*   The vendor was notified about the issue, claiming it was an old bug. However, the security researchers believe that the vulnerability is still present in the current version after testing.
*   The advisory highlights a previous fix was available from <http://ashleybrown.co.uk/downloads/iws2.exe>. However, this new report shows that the fix was insufficient, as the directory traversal vulnerability persists.
