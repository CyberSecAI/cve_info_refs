- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper handling of user-supplied text variables in Vignette software, allowing injection of Server Side Include (SSI) commands.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SSI Injection, potentially leading to remote command execution if SSI EXEC is enabled.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Remote command execution with the privileges of the Vignette process if SSI EXEC is enabled. Otherwise, unauthorized execution of SSI commands may occur.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending malicious text variables via a web client to a vulnerable Vignette application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Ability to send HTTP requests with crafted text variables to a vulnerable Vignette application.
