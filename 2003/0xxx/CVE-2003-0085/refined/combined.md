How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

GENTOO LINUX SECURITY ANNOUNCEMENT 200303-11
- - ---------------------------------------------------------------------

          PACKAGE : samba
          SUMMARY : buffer overrun
             DATE : 2003-03-17 09:22 UTC
          EXPLOIT : remote
VERSIONS AFFECTED : <2.2.8
    FIXED VERSION : >=2.2.8
              CVE : CAN-2003-0085 CAN-2003-0086

- - ---------------------------------------------------------------------

- From advisory:

"The SuSE security audit team, in particular Sebastian Krahmer
<krahmer at suse.de>, has found a flaw in the Samba main smbd code which
could allow an external attacker to remotely and anonymously gain
Super User (root) privileges on a server running a Samba server."

"A buffer overrun condition exists in the SMB/CIFS packet fragment
re-assembly code in smbd which would allow an attacker to cause smbd
to overwrite arbitrary areas of memory in its own process address
space. This could allow a skilled attacker to inject binary specific
exploit code into smbd."

Read the full advisory at:
<http://lists.samba.org/pipermail/samba-announce/2003-March/000063.html>

SOLUTION

It is recommended that all Gentoo Linux users who are running
net-fs/samba upgrade to samba-2.2.8 as follows:

emerge sync
emerge samba
emerge clean

________________________________________________________________________

Package:             samba
Vulnerability:       remote root exploit / chown race condition
OpenPKG Specific:    no

Affected Releases:   Affected Packages:          Corrected Packages:
OpenPKG CURRENT      <= samba-2.2.7a-20030207    >= samba-2.2.8-20030316
OpenPKG 1.2          <= samba-2.2.7a-1.2.0       >= samba-2.2.7a-1.2.1
OpenPKG 1.1          <= samba-2.2.5-1.1.1        >= samba-2.2.5-1.1.2

Dependent Packages:  none

Description:
  Sebastian Krahmer, SuSE Security Team, [[0]](#0) has alerted the Samba Team
  to two serious vulnerabilities in all versions of Samba [[1]](#1) up to and
  including version 2.2.7a. We have backported the security relevant
  pieces of the 2.2.8 vendor changes into releases used by OpenPKG.

  If exploited correctly, it could lead to an anonymous user gaining
  root access on a Samba serving system. All versions of Samba up to
  and including Samba 2.2.7a are vulnerable. The Common Vulnerabilities
  and Exposures (CVE) project assigned the id CAN-2003-0085 [[2]](#2) to the
  problem.

  In addition he pointed out a chown(2) race condition which could
  allow overwriting of critical system files if exploited. The
  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project assigned the id
  CAN-2003-0086 [[3]](#3) to the problem.

  Please check whether you are affected by running "<prefix>/bin/rpm -q
  samba". If you have the "samba" package installed and its version is
  affected (see above), we recommend that you immediately upgrade it
  (see Solution). [4][[5]](#5)

Solution:
  Select the updated source RPM appropriate for your OpenPKG release
  [6][[7]](#7), fetch it from the OpenPKG FTP service [8][[9]](#9) or a mirror
  location, verify its integrity [[10]](#10), build a corresponding binary
  RPM from it [[4]](#4) and update your OpenPKG installation by applying the
  binary RPM [[5]](#5). For the current release OpenPKG 1.2, perform the
  following operations to permanently fix the security problem (for
  other releases adjust accordingly).

  $ ftp ftp.openpkg.org
  ftp> bin
  ftp> cd release/1.2/UPD
  ftp> get samba-2.2.7a-1.2.1.src.rpm
  ftp> bye
  $ <prefix>/bin/rpm -v --checksig samba-2.2.7a-1.2.1.src.rpm
  $ <prefix>/bin/rpm --rebuild samba-2.2.7a-1.2.1.src.rpm
  $ su -

## Samba contains buffer overflow in SMB/CIFS packet fragment reassembly code

#### Vulnerability Note VU#298233

Original Release Date: 2003-03-17 | Last Revised: 2003-05-15

---

### Overview

A buffer overflow vulnerability has been discovered in Samba. An updated version has been released.

### Description

| A remotely exploitable buffer overflow vulnerability was discoved to affect Samba versions 2.0.x through 2.2.7a. From their [bulletin](http://www.samba.org/samba/whatsnew/samba-2.2.8.html):  *The SuSE security audit team, in particular Sebastian Krahmer, has found a flaw in the Samba main smbd code which could allow an external attacker to remotely and anonymously gain Super User (root) privileges on a server running a Samba server.**This flaw exists in previous versions of Samba from 2.0.x to 2.2.7a inclusive. This is a serious problem and all sites should either upgrade to Samba 2.2.8 immediately or prohibit access to TCP ports 139 and 445. Advice created by Andrew Tridgell, the leader of the Samba Team, on how to protect an unpatched Samba server is given at the end of this section.**The SMB/CIFS protocol implemented by Samba is vulnerable to many attacks, even without specific security holes. The TCP ports 139 and the new port 445 (used by Win2k and the Samba 3.0 alpha code in particular) should never be exposed to untrusted networks.* |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Super User, typically root. |
| --- |

### Solution

| [Upgrade](http://www.samba.org/samba/ftp/) to Samba version 2.2.8. |
| --- |

| The "Protecting an unpatched Samba server" section of the Samba bulletin discusses several work arounds for unpatched servers. |

Topic: security issue in samba ports
Announced: 2003-04-07

I. Introduction

Several ports in the FreeBSD Ports Collection are affected by security
issues. These are listed below with references and affected versions.
All versions given refer to the FreeBSD port/package version numbers.
The listed vulnerabilities are not specific to FreeBSD unless
otherwise noted.

These ports are not installed by default, nor are they ``part of
FreeBSD'' as such. The FreeBSD Ports Collection contains thousands of
third-party applications in a ready-to-install format. FreeBSD makes
no claim about the security of these third-party applications. See
<URL:<http://www.freebsd.org/ports/>> for more information about the
FreeBSD Ports Collection.

II. Ports

+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
Port name: net/samba
Affected: versions < samba-2.2.8\_2, samba-2.2.8a
Status: Fixed

Two vulnerabilities recently:

(1) Sebastian Krahmer of the SuSE Security Team identified
vulnerabilities that could lead to arbitrary code execution as root,
as well as a race condition that could allow overwriting of system
files. (This vulnerability was previously fixed in Samba 2.2.8.)

(2) Digital Defense, Inc. reports: ``This vulnerability, if exploited
correctly, leads to an anonymous user gaining root access on a Samba
serving system. All versions of Samba up to and including Samba 2.2.8
are vulnerable. Alpha versions of Samba 3.0 and above are \*NOT\*
vulnerable.''

Port name: net/samba-tng
Affected: all versions
Status: Not fixed

Some or all of the vulnerabilities affecting Samba may also affect
Samba-TNG. No confirmation or official patches are available at the
time of this security notice.
+------------------------------------------------------------------------+

III. Upgrading Ports/Packages

To upgrade a fixed port/package, perform one of the following:

1) Upgrade your Ports Collection and rebuild and reinstall the port.
Several tools are available in the Ports Collection to make this
easier. See:
 /usr/ports/devel/portcheckout
 /usr/ports/misc/porteasy
 /usr/ports/sysutils/portupgrade

2) Deinstall the old package and install a new package obtained from

[FreeBSD 4.x, i386]
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-4-stable/All/

[FreeBSD 5.x, i386]
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-5-current/All/

Packages are not automatically generated for other architectures at
this time.

Note that new, official packages may not be available on all mirrors
immediately. In the interim, Security Officer-generated packages (and
detached digital signatures) are available for the i386 architecture
at:

[FreeBSD 4.x, i386]
ftp://ftp2.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/security-officer/ports/i386/packages-4-stable/samba-2.2.8\_2.tgz

GENTOO LINUX SECURITY ANNOUNCEMENT 200303-11
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

 PACKAGE : samba
 SUMMARY : buffer overrun
 DATE : 2003-03-17 09:22 UTC
 EXPLOIT : remote
VERSIONS AFFECTED : <2.2.8
 FIXED VERSION : >=2.2.8
 CVE : CAN-2003-0085 CAN-2003-0086

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

From advisory:

"The SuSE security audit team, in particular Sebastian Krahmer
<krahmer at suse.de>, has found a flaw in the Samba main smbd code which
could allow an external attacker to remotely and anonymously gain
Super User (root) privileges on a server running a Samba server."

"A buffer overrun condition exists in the SMB/CIFS packet fragment
re-assembly code in smbd which would allow an attacker to cause smbd
to overwrite arbitrary areas of memory in its own process address
space. This could allow a skilled attacker to inject binary specific
exploit code into smbd."

Read the full advisory at:
<http://lists.samba.org/pipermail/samba-announce/2003-March/000063.html>

SOLUTION

It is recommended that all Gentoo Linux users who are running
net-fs/samba upgrade to samba-2.2.8 as follows:

emerge sync
emerge samba
emerge clean

Package:             samba
Vulnerability:       remote root exploit / chown race condition
OpenPKG Specific:    no

Affected Releases:   Affected Packages:          Corrected Packages:
OpenPKG CURRENT      <= samba-2.2.7a-20030207    >= samba-2.2.8-20030316
OpenPKG 1.2          <= samba-2.2.7a-1.2.0       >= samba-2.2.7a-1.2.1
OpenPKG 1.1          <= samba-2.2.5-1.1.1        >= samba-2.2.5-1.1.2

Dependent Packages:  none

Description:
  Sebastian Krahmer, SuSE Security Team, [0] has alerted the Samba Team
  to two serious vulnerabilities in all versions of Samba [1] up to and
  including version 2.2.7a. We have backported the security relevant
  pieces of the 2.2.8 vendor changes into releases used by OpenPKG.

  If exploited correctly, it could lead to an anonymous user gaining
  root access on a Samba serving system. All versions of Samba up to
  and including Samba 2.2.7a are vulnerable. The Common Vulnerabilities
  and Exposures (CVE) project assigned the id CAN-2003-0085 [2] to the
  problem.

  In addition he pointed out a chown(2) race condition which could
  allow overwriting of critical system files if exploited. The
  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project assigned the id
  CAN-2003-0086 [3] to the problem.

  Please check whether you are affected by running "<prefix>/bin/rpm -q
  samba". If you have the "samba" package installed and its version is
  affected (see above), we recommend that you immediately upgrade it
  (see Solution). [4][5]

Solution:
  Select the updated source RPM appropriate for your OpenPKG release
  [6][7], fetch it from the OpenPKG FTP service [8][9] or a mirror
  location, verify its integrity [10], build a corresponding binary
  RPM from it [4] and update your OpenPKG installation by applying the
  binary RPM [5]. For the current release OpenPKG 1.2, perform the
  following operations to permanently fix the security problem (for
  other releases adjust accordingly).

  $ ftp ftp.openpkg.org
  ftp> bin
  ftp> cd release/1.2/UPD
  ftp> get samba-2.2.7a-1.2.1.src.rpm
  ftp> bye
  $ <prefix>/bin/rpm -v --checksig samba-2.2.7a-1.2.1.src.rpm

 SGI Security Advisory

Title : SMB/CIFS Security Vulnerability in Samba
Number : 20030302-01-I
Date : March 19, 2003
Reference: CVE CAN-2003-0085
Reference: CVE CAN-2003-0086
Reference: SGI BUGS 883509 884044
Fixed in : Samba version 2.2.8

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

- -----------------------
- --- Issue Specifics ---
- -----------------------

It's been reported that there is a SMB/CIFS packet fragment re-assembly code
vulnerability in versions of Samba prior to version 2.2.8. A successful
exploit of this vulnerability could allow an external attacker to remotely
and anonymously gain root privilege on a system running the Samba server.

See <http://us1.samba.org/samba/whatsnew/samba-2.2.8.html>
<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0085>
<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0086>
for more details.

SGI has investigated the issues and recommends the following steps for
neutralizing the exposure. It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that these measures be
implemented on ALL vulnerable SGI systems.

These issues have been corrected in Samba version 2.2.8.

- --------------
- --- Impact ---
- --------------

Samba is an optional product and is not installed by default on IRIX 6.5
systems.

To determine the version of IRIX you are running, execute the following
command:

 # /bin/uname -R

That will return a result similar to the following:

 # 6.5 6.5.16f

The first number ("6.5") is the release name, the second ("6.5.16f" in this
case) is the extended release name. The extended release name is the
"version" we refer to throughout this document.

To see if Samba is installed, execute the following command:

% versions samba\_irix
I = Installed, R = Removed

 Name Date Description

 I samba\_irix 07/02/2002 Samba 2.2.4 for IRIX
 I samba\_irix.man 07/02/2002 Samba Online Documentation
 I samba\_irix.man.doc 07/02/2002 Samba 2.2.4 Documentation
 I samba\_irix.man.manpages 07/02/2002 Samba 2.2.4 Man Page
 I samba\_irix.man.relnotes 07/02/2002 Samba 2.2.4 Release Notes
 I samba\_irix.src 07/02/2002 Samba Source Code
 I samba\_irix.src.samba 07/02/2002 Samba 2.2.4 Source Code
 I samba\_irix.sw 07/02/2002 Samba Execution Environment
 I samba\_irix.sw.base 07/02/2002 Samba 2.2.4 Execution Environment

If the result is similar to the above and the version shown is less than
2.2.8, then the system is vulnerable.

- ----------------------------
- --- Temporary Workaround ---
- ----------------------------

Though it is possible to limit exposure by filtering what IPs can talk to
your Samba server, there is no effective workaround to fully address these
problems. SGI recommends upgrading to Samba version 2.2.8.

- ----------------
- --- Solution ---
- ----------------

SGI has provided an instable version of Samba for this vulnerability. Our
recommendation is to upgrade to Samba version 2.2.8.

The free unsupported Samba 2.2.8 version can be currently downloaded
from the following websites:
<http://freeware.sgi.com/beta/fw_samba-2.2.8.tardist>
<http://master.samba.org/samba/ftp/Binary_Packages/IRIX/>

For customers who have purchased the SGI supported version of Samba
called samba\_irix, please contact your SGI Support Representative and
request CD part number 812-0893-010 -- Samba 2.2.8 for IRIX on CD.

1)  problem description, brief discussion, solution, upgrade information

    Sebastian Krahmer, SuSE Security Team, reviewed security-critical
    parts of the Samba server within the scope of security audits that
    the SuSE Security Team conducts on a regular basis for security-critical
    Open Source Software.
    Buffer overflows and a chown race condition have been discovered and
    fixed during the security audit. The buffer overflow vulnerabilitiy
    allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands as root on the
    system running samba. In addition to the flaws fixed in the samba
    server, some overflow conditions in the samba-client package have
    been fixed with the available update packages. It is strongly
    recommended to install the update packages on a system where the
    samba package is used.

    There exists no temporary workaround against this vulnerability other
    than shutting down the smbd daemon.

    We would like to thank the Samba Team, especially Jeremy Allison, Andrew
    Bartlett and Volker Lendecke for their quick response and cooperation.

    Please note that the package names for SuSE products vary for different
    products. There exist the following pairings:

2)  Pending vulnerabilities in SuSE Distributions and Workarounds:

    - wget
    New wget packages are available which filter certain characters
    such as .. and / in filenames to ensure evil servers cannot overwrite
    important system-files or files outside the current directory.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

3)  standard appendix: authenticity verification, additional information

  - Package authenticity verification:

    SuSE update packages are available on many mirror ftp servers all over
    the world. While this service is being considered valuable and important
    to the free and open source software community, many users wish to be
    sure about the origin of the package and its content before installing
    the package. There are two verification methods that can be used
    independently from each other to prove the authenticity of a downloaded
    file or rpm package:
    1) md5sums as provided in the (cryptographically signed) announcement.
    2) using the internal gpg signatures of the rpm package.

    1) execute the command
        md5sum <name-of-the-file.rpm>
       after you downloaded the file from a SuSE ftp server or its mirrors.
       Then, compare the resulting md5sum with the one that is listed in the
       announcement. Since the announcement containing the checksums is
       cryptographically signed (usually using the key security@suse.de),
       the checksums show proof of the authenticity of the package.
       We disrecommend to subscribe to security lists which cause the
       email message containing the announcement to be modified so that
       the signature does not match after transport through the mailing
       list software.
       Downsides: You must be able to verify the authenticity of the
       announcement in the first place. If RPM packages are being rebuilt
       and a new version of a package is published on the ftp server, all
       md5 sums for the files are useless.

    2) rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the authenticity
       of an rpm package. Use the command
        rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
       to verify the signature of the package, where <file.rpm> is the
       filename of the rpm package that you have downloaded. Of course,
       package authenticity verification can only target an un-installed rpm
       package file.
       Prerequisites:
        a) gpg is installed
        b) The package is signed using a certain key. The public part of this
           key must be installed by the gpg program in the directory
           ~/.gnupg/ under the user's home directory who performs the
           signature verification (usually root). You can import the key
           that is used by SuSE in rpm packages for SuSE Linux by saving
           this announcement to a file ("announcement.txt") and
           running the command (do "su -" to be root):
            gpg --batch; gpg < announcement.txt | gpg --import
           SuSE Linux distributions version 7.1 and thereafter install the
           key "build@suse.de" upon installation or upgrade, provided that
           the package gpg is installed. The file containing the public key
           is placed at the top-level directory of the first CD (pubring.gpg)
           and at ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/suse/pubring.gpg-build.suse.de .

  - SuSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
    subscribe:
