[![Proxy Screenshot](/contents/graphics/screenshot/proxy.gif "Proxy Screenshot")](/contents/download/Network/proxy/Screenshots.htm)    Do you have several machines on a network, but only one connection to the internet? Wish you could browse the net from the other machines, just like you can from the machine that's connected? Then what you're looking for is called a Proxy Server, and AnalogX has just what you want. AnalogX Proxy is a small and simple server that allows any other machine on your local network to route its requests through a central machine. So what does that mean in English? Simple, run Proxy on the machine with the internet connection, configure the other machines to use a proxy (it's very easy, there's a detailed description in the readme), and voila! You're surfing the web from any other machine on your network! Supports HTTP (web), HTTPS (secure web), POP3 (receive mail), SMTP (send mail), NNTP (newsgroups), FTP (file transfer), and Socks4/4a and partial Socks5 (no UDP) protocols! It works great with Internet Explorer, Netscape, AOL, AOL Instant Messenger, Microsoft Messenger, and many more!

Proxy works on **all** versions of Windows, from Window 95 to Windows 7 and everything inbetween (including XP, Vista, Win2k, etc). If you have a general question related to any of the programs on the site, or would like some additional info related to the downloads in general, then check out the [downloads FAQ](/contents/download/faq.htm).

===============================================
Buffer Overflow In Analogx Proxy 4.13
Vendor: Analogx
Versions affected: Proxy 4.13
Date: 26th May 2003
Type of Vulnerability: Remotely Exploitable Buffer Overflow
Severity: High
By: Network Intelligence India [www.nii.co.in](http://www.nii.co.in)
===============================================

I. BACKGROUND
"AnalogX Proxy is a small and simple server that allows any other machine on your \
local network to route it's requests through a central machine. It supports HTTP \
(web), HTTPS (secure web), POP3 (recieve mail), SMTP (send mail), NNTP (newsgroups), \
FTP (file transfer), and Socks4/4a and partial Socks5 (no UDP) protocols. It works \
with Internet Explorer, Netscape, AOL, AOL Instant Messenger, Microsoft Messenger, \
and many more. "

When the AnalogX Proxy is supplied with a URL greater than 340 characters it crashes \
with a buffer overflow. A specially crafted URL allows remote execution of arbitrary \
code.

II. DESCRIPTION
The buffer overflow occurs when a user supplies a URL of length greater than 340 \
characters.  In its default configuration the proxy listens on all interfaces for \
proxy requests. In such a configuration, anyone may cause the buffer overflow attack \
over the Internet by connecting to TCP 6588 port and supplying an overly long URL. \
With a specially crafted URL, it may be possible to manipulate the stack and execute \
code of the attacker's choice. This code would naturally be executed with the \
privileges with which AnalogX is running. In most cases, these are Administrator \
privileges. The software strongly urges the user to bind it to the internal private \
IP. This would leave it vulnerable only to attacks from local users.

III. VENDOR RESPONSE
The vendor responded quickly and patched up the software. The updated version is \
available at <http://www.analogx.com/contents/download/network/proxy.htm> The updated \
version number is 4.14
