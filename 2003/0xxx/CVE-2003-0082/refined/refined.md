May result in crashing the\nKDC.\nAFFECTED SOFTWARE\n=================\nMIT Kerberos 5, all released versions though 1.2.7 and 1.3-alpha1.\nFIX\n===\nThe following patches should fix the most urgent aspects of the\nproblems in the 1.2.7 release. If these patches do not apply cleanly\nto 1.2.6 and earlier versions, the corresponding changes should be\nfairly straightforward. The patch to krb5.hin should change any\nmissed overrun cases in this area into null pointer dereferences,\nwhich will be more likely to crash the program instead of referencing\narbitrary data.\nPatch: http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/www/advisories/MITKRB5-SA-2003-005-patch.txt\nPatch PGP signature: http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/www/advisories/MITKRB5-SA-2003-005-patch.txt.asc\nThe problem exists in other parts of the code as well, but should only\nresult in crashing application servers when the realm has been\nmisconfigured to use broken service names, or crashing application\nclients when they are supplied broken principal names.\nREFERENCES\n==========\nCVE CAN-2003-0082\nBuffer underrun\nCVE CAN-2003-0072\nArray overrun -- only the portions that appeared to affect a server\nwith no strange realm configurations were included here.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n===============\nThanks to Nalin Dahyabhai of Red Hat for bringing the problems to our\nattention.",
