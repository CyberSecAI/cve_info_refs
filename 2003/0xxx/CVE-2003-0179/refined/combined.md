## Lotus Notes and Domino COM Object Control Handler contains buffer overflow

#### Vulnerability Note VU#571297

Original Release Date: 2003-02-19 | Last Revised: 2003-03-26

---

### Overview

Lotus Notes is a client application that provides access to Lotus Domino servers. A vulnerability exists that could permit a remote attacker to cause a user to execute arbitrary code.

### Description

| A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the in both Lotus Notes clients and Domino Servers in a backend COM class method that handles controls. If a remote attacker could trick a victim into viewing a malicious web page or email message, the attacker could exploit this buffer overflow to execute arbitrary code on the system.  This was originally reported as a vulnerability in an iNotes ActiveX control. The vulnerable code is not iNotes or ActiveX specific, this was an attack vector, not the affected code base.Further information is available in NGSSoftware advisory [NISR17022003e](http://www.nextgenss.com/advisories/lotus-inotesclientaxbo.txt) and in IBM Technote [1104543](http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21104543) (SPR# KSPR5J2QET). |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker could crash the Notes client or Domino server and potentially execute arbitrary code on the system with the privileges of the current user. This is not Microsoft Windows platform specific and can affect other platforms. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Apply the appropriate [patches](http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/r5fixlist.nsf/80bff5d07b4be477052569ce00710588/8bc951d3ff1e578385256ce10052a78a?OpenDocument) from IBM Technote [1104543](http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21104543).Note that the patch listed in the NGSSoftware advisory [NISR17022003e](http://www.nextgenss.com/advisories/lotus-inotesclientaxbo.txt) is incorrect. |

## History

The CERT Division is the birthplace of cybersecurity. For nearly 30 years, the CERT Division of the SEI has partnered with government, industry, law enforcement, and academia to advance cybersecurity and improve the security and resilience of computer systems and networks.

Originally focused on incident response, we have expanded into cybersecurity areas such as network situational awareness, malicious code analysis, secure coding, resilience management, insider threats, digital investigations and intelligence, workforce development, DevOps, forensics, software assurance, vulnerability discovery and analysis, and risk management.

## Former Director Richard Pethia

[Richard Pethia](/about/leadership/display.cfm?customel_datapageid_2623=3545) was founding director of the SEI's CERT Division. Pethia, who served as director of CERT from 1988 to 2016, guided the organization through tremendous growth and change. Under Pethia's leadership, the unit expanded and evolved from the CERT Coordination Center—a small group focused on computer incident response—to a research organization of more than 200 professionals dedicated to solving problems with widespread cybersecurity implications.
