- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Stack-based buffer overflow in `db2dart` and `db2licm` binaries.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The `db2dart` and `db2licm` binaries do not properly validate the length of command-line arguments, leading to a stack buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local attacker can execute arbitrary code with root privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation occurs by providing a long command-line argument to the vulnerable binaries.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs local access to the system and must be able to execute the setuid binaries with access to one of the db2 user accounts.
