Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2003-0854:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way `wu-ftpd` calls the `/bin/ls` command. Specifically, it fails to sanitize user-provided input, allowing an attacker to inject arguments into the `ls` command.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Sanitization:** `wu-ftpd` does not properly sanitize user-provided arguments when calling `/bin/ls`. This allows for command injection.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:** By injecting specific arguments (`-w 1000000 -C`), an attacker can cause `ls` to consume excessive memory, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation results in the `wu-ftpd` server slowing down due to excessive memory consumption, effectively denying service to legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely by sending specially crafted FTP commands to the `wu-ftpd` server.
*   **FTP LIST command:** The vulnerability is triggered by the `LIST` command, where an attacker injects malicious arguments to `ls`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable `wu-ftpd` server.
*   **FTP Client:** The attacker needs to be able to send FTP commands to the server, which is easily done with any FTP client.
*  **Basic FTP knowledge:** The attacker needs to know how to send `USER`, `PASS` and `LIST` FTP commands.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Georgi Guninski.
*   The `ls` command also has an integer overflow vulnerability, however, it is not exploitable in this context and is a different vulnerability.
*   The attack is performed by sending `LIST -w 1000000 -C` command to wu-ftpd.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in `coreutils` CVS on October 12, 2003.
