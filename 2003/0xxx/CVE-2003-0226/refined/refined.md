Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2003-0226:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a flaw in how IIS 5.0 and 5.1 handle overly long WebDAV requests, particularly those containing XML commands. The error handling sequence for malformed XML data can get out of order, causing IIS to fail.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Error Handling:** IIS fails to handle errors gracefully when processing malformed XML data within WebDAV requests exceeding a certain length. Specifically, the error handling sequence gets out of order.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** IIS does not properly validate the length of WebDAV requests, allowing an attacker to send overly long requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation leads to a temporary denial of service, causing IIS to crash and stop serving web pages. While IIS 5.0 and 5.1 will automatically restart, there is a disruption to service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **WebDAV Request:** Attackers send a crafted WebDAV request containing malformed XML data that exceeds a certain size. The request is typically made using the `PROPFIND` or `SEARCH` methods.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable IIS server.
*   **WebDAV Enabled:** The WebDAV service must be enabled on the target IIS server for this vulnerability to be exploited.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability specifically affects IIS 5.0 and 5.1. IIS 4.0 and 6.0 are not affected by this particular flaw.
*   The IIS Lockdown tool, if used, disables WebDAV by default, which can mitigate this vulnerability.
*  The provided information indicates that requests with a body over 49,153 bytes can trigger the issue.

This information is consistent with the description of CVE-2003-0226 being a WebDAV denial of service vulnerability.
