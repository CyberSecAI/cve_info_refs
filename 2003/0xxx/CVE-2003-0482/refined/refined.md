Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities in Tutos 1.1:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in various parts of the Tutos application. This allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into URLs, which are then executed by the victim's browser.
*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The application allows users to upload files without proper validation, including HTML files. This can allow an attacker to upload and execute malicious scripts via HTML files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **XSS Vulnerability:** The application is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting attacks. Specifically, the `msg` parameter in various URLs (e.g., `file_select.php?msg=<hostile code>`) is vulnerable because it renders the message directly onto the page without sanitization.
*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The application allows uploading arbitrary files to the `repository` directory which can include malicious HTML files and lead to XSS attacks, due to the browser's behavior in executing HTML files even without the .html extension.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **XSS:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser. This could lead to:
    *   Session hijacking (stealing cookies)
    *   Defacing the web page
    *   Redirecting users to malicious sites
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user
*    **Malicious File Execution:** An attacker can execute malicious scripts on a victim's computer by uploading an HTML file and causing the victim to browse the file using their browser.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **XSS:** An attacker can craft a malicious URL containing the hostile script and trick the victim into clicking it. This can be done by embedding the link in emails, other websites, or social media messages.
*   **Malicious File Upload:** An attacker can upload a malicious HTML file to the repository. They can then trick the user into accessing the file via a provided link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs with JavaScript payloads.
*   The attacker needs to be able to upload files to the server using the upload functionality provided by Tutos.
*   The attacker needs to be able to trick the victim to access a malicious link or navigate to the malicious file that has been uploaded.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The advisory mentions that the issue with long URLs was also addressed by storing most messages in session data instead of URLs.
*   The fix involves ensuring that any input that is output to a user's browser is interpreted as NON-HTML code, preventing the browser from executing it.
*   The vulnerability was reportedly fixed in the branch-1-1 version available via CVS.
