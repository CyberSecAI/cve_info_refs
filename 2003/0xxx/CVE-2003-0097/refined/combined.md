   PHP Security Advisory: CGI vulnerability in PHP version 4.3.0

Issued on: February 17, 2003
Software:  PHP/CGI version 4.3.0
Platforms: All

   The PHP Group has learned of a serious security vulnerability in
   the CGI SAPI of PHP version 4.3.0.

Description

   PHP contains code for preventing direct access to the CGI binary with
   configure option "--enable-force-cgi-redirect" and php.ini option
   "cgi.force_redirect". In PHP 4.3.0 there is a bug which renders these
   options useless.

   NOTE: This bug does NOT affect any of the other SAPI modules.
         (such as the Apache or ISAPI modules, etc.)

Impact

   Anyone with access to websites hosted on a web server which employs
   the CGI module may exploit this vulnerability to gain access to any file
   readable by the user under which the webserver runs.

   A remote attacker could also trick PHP into executing arbitrary PHP code
   if attacker is able to inject the code into files accessible by the CGI.
   This could be for example the web server access-logs.

Solution

   The PHP Group has released a new PHP version, 4.3.1, which incorporates
   a fix for the vulnerability. All users of affected PHP versions are
   encouraged to upgrade to this latest version. The downloads web site at

      <http://www.php.net/downloads.php>

   has the new 4.3.1 source tarballs, Windows binaries and source patch
   from 4.3.0 available for download. You will only need to upgrade if
   you're using the CGI module of PHP 4.3.0. There are no other bugfixes
   contained in this release.

Workaround

   None.

Credits

   The PHP Group would like to thank Kosmas Skiadopoulos for discovering
   this vulnerability.
