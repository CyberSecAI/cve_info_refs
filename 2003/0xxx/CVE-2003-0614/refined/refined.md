**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue found within the `search.php` file of Gallery versions 1.1 through 1.3.4.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is remote. A remote attacker can craft a URL containing the malicious script in the `searchstring` parameter of `search.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be able to craft and deliver a malicious URL to a victim user. No special privileges or access beyond normal web access to the Gallery application are required.
