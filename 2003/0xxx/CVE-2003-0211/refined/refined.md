Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2003-0211

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `xinetd` service was not properly freeing allocated memory when a connection was rejected or when the service was configured with `no_wait` or special flags. Specifically, the connection data structure was not being freed under certain error conditions in `svc_request` function. The `sigchld` handler, which normally frees the connection's data, was not being invoked in these scenarios leading to memory leak.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Leak:** Failure to free allocated memory for each rejected connection, or connections using `no_wait` or special flags.
- **Incorrect Resource Management:**  The code did not consistently free the connection's data, leading to a resource leak.
- **Lack of Error Handling:** The code did not properly handle errors in `svc_request`, not freeing memory when errors occurred.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote attacker could send numerous connection requests to a service managed by xinetd, configured to reject connections (e.g., via `tcp_wrappers`, `access_times`), causing it to leak memory.  The cumulative memory leak could lead to xinetd exhaustion and eventually to denial of service for services managed by it.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** Attacker sends connection requests to a service managed by `xinetd`.
- **Configuration Dependent:** The vulnerability is exploitable if `xinetd` is configured to reject connections, or when using `no_wait` or special service flags.  Configuration settings like `tcp_wrappers`, `only_from`, `no_access`, `sensors`, `access_times`, `cps`, `load_avg` which would reject connections would make the system vulnerable to memory leak.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the target machine.
- **Knowledge of Target Configuration:** The attacker would benefit from knowing if the target is configured to reject connections via `xinetd` options.

**Additional Details:**
- The memory leak was 144 bytes per rejected connection.
- The issue was fixed in `xinetd` version 2.3.11.
- Red Hat issued an errata (RHSA-2003:160) to address the issue.
- The affected code was primarily in the `svc_request` function in `service.c`.
- The vulnerability also exists for services configured with `no_wait` or special flags, even if not rejecting connections explicitly.
