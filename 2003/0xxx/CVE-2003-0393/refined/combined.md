Some problems in Privatefirewall 3.0
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Product: Privatefirewall
version: 3.0
Vendor : Privacyware (<http://www.privacyware.com>)
Author : UkR-XblP (cuctema@ok.ru) - the chief specialist
of UkR security team (<http://ust.icqinfo.ru>)

About Privatefirewall:
Privatefirewall is a powerful Personal Firewall and
Intrusion Detection Application that eliminates
unauthorized access to your PC, at home, the office, or on
the road. It provides users with full system protection
"out-of-the-box", and allows extensive customization for
advanced users. It continually monitors sensitive areas of
a PC where intrusion can occur and reports on their status
so users can make informed decisions about these areas and
make changes as necessary. A report is generated as a HTML
file which the user has the option of viewing.
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Overview:
Privatefirewall monitors incoming and outgoing Internet
traffic.  This consists of blocks of information called
"packets", which can be passed between any 2 computers on
the Internet or local network.  The amount and type of
packets allowed to and from the user's PC is based on what
level of monitoring the user chooses.  The user can Allow,
Filter, or Deny Internet traffic.
1) Filter Internet Traffic (RECOMMENDED)  This setting
allows the user to access the Internet while maintaining
maximum protection from incoming intrusion attempts, but
Privatefirewall cannot detect FIN scan and Xmas tree scan.
Hence the task to not allow scanning ports or even to
detect it remains outstanding.
2)Deny Internet Traffic  This blocks all incoming and
outgoing Internet traffic. - Yes, the given setting blocks
all connections, but attacking not looking at it all the
same can FIN scan or Xmas tree scan. Though ALL
connections should be blocked...
