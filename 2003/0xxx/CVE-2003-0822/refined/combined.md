(To determine what version of FrontPage Server Extension that is installed on your system please see "How can I determine what version of FrontPage Server Extensions I am running?" in the FAQ Section of this bulletin.)

The software listed above has been tested to determine if the versions are affected. Other versions are no longer [supported](https://support.microsoft.com/directory/discontinue.asp), and may or may not be affected.

### General Information

## Technical Details

**Technical description:**

Subsequent to the release of this bulletin, it was determined that the vulnerability addressed also affects other versions of the affected products and components. Microsoft has updated the bulletin with additional information about Windows XP 64-Bit Edition and Office 2000 Server Extensions and also to direct users to an update for these additional affected platforms.

This bulletin addresses two new security vulnerabilities in Microsoft FrontPage Server Extensions, the most serious of which could enable an attacker to run arbitrary code on a user's system.

The first vulnerability exists because of a buffer overrun in the remote debug functionality of FrontPage Server Extensions\*\*.\*\* This functionality enables users to remotely connect to a server running FrontPage Server Extensions and remotely debug content using, for example, Visual Interdev. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could be able to run code with IWAM\_machinename account privileges on an affected system, or could cause FrontPage Server Extensions to fail.

The second vulnerability is a Denial of Service vulnerability that exists in the **SmartHTML interpreter.** This functionality is made up of a variety of dynamic link library files, and exists to support certain types of dynamic web content. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause a server running Front Page Server Extensions to temporarily stop responding to requests.

**Mitigating factors:**

* Administrators that have installed the Front Page Server extensions included in Windows and then applied Windows 2000 Service Pack 4 are not affected by these vulnerabilities
* Windows XP does not have FrontPage Server Extensions installed by default
* Windows NT 4.0 does not have FrontPage Server Extensions installed by default unless you have applied Windows NT4.0 Option Pack

**Severity Rating:**

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Microsoft FrontPage Server Extensions 2000 (For Windows NT4) and Microsoft Office 2000 Server Extensions (Shipped with Office 2000)** | Critical |
| **Microsoft FrontPage Server Extensions 2000 (Shipped with Windows 2000)** | Critical |
| **Microsoft FrontPage Server Extensions 2000 (Shipped with Windows XP)** | Moderate |
| **Microsoft FrontPage Server Extensions 2000 64-bit (Shipped with Windows XP 64-bit)** | Moderate |
| **Microsoft FrontPage Server Extensions 2002** | Critical |
| **Microsoft SharePoint Team Services 2002 (Shipped with Office XP)** | Critical |

The above [assessment](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21140) is based on the types of systems affected by the vulnerability, their typical deployment patterns, and the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would have on them.

**Vulnerability identifier for the Buffer Overrun vulnerability:** [CAN-2003-0822](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=can-2003-0822)

**Vulnerability identifier for SmartHTML interpreter vulnerability:** [CAN-2003-0824](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=can-2003-0824)

## Workarounds

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds that apply across all the vulnerabilities. These workarounds help block known attack vectors, however they will not correct the underlying vulnerabilities. Workarounds may reduce functionality in some cases; in such cases, the reduction in functionality is identified below.

6. Choose Next in the Windows Components Wizard and choose Finish.

**Impact of workaround:**

With FrontPage Server Extensions uninstalled or disabled webpage and server functionality relying on them will be unavailable or will not operate as expected.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Why have you issued a version 2 of this bulletin?**

Subsequent to the release of this bulletin, it was determined that the vulnerability addressed also affects other versions of the affected products and components. Microsoft has updated the bulletin with additional information about Windows XP 64-Bit Edition and Office 2000 Server Extensions and also to direct users to an update for these additional affected platforms.

**I have been offered this update from Windows Update and I am running Windows XP, why am I being offered this update?**

A change to the detection method that Windows Update uses to offer the update to customers was recently altered to provide it to customers who are not affected by this issue.

**Have you re-released this patch?**

No - A change in how Windows Update scans and offers this update was introduced on December 9th which prompted users who were not at risk to download it. There has been no change to the update, and customers who were vulnerable were offered the update when it was first released in November.

**Are you changing Windows Update to correct the issue?**

Yes - Microsoft is currently making a change to the Windows Update detection to correct this problem.

**Do I need to install the patch if I have not already?**

Microsoft recommends that customers install the update if prompted from Windows Update or Automatic Update. There are no known negative affects with installing this update if offered.

**If I installed the update in November, do I need to install the patch again?**

No - Customers who were at risk have been offered the update from Windows Update or the Microsoft Download Center since it was first released in November. The update is effective at addressing the issue and customers who have applied the update do not need to reapply it.

**How can I determine what version of FrontPage Server Extensions I am running?**

To determine the version of FrontPage Server Extensions that is installed on your computer, follow these steps.

**Note:** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
2. In the **Search Results pane**, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type **fp4awel.dll** or **fp5awel.dll**, and then click **Search**.
4. If you have the **fp4awel.dll** file you your system, you have FrontPage Server Extensions 2000 installed
5. If you have the fp5awel.dll you have either FPSE 2002 or SharePoint Team Services installed.

To differentiate FrontPage Server Extensions 2002 from SharePoint Team Services do the following:

1. Open the Control Panel task "Add or Remove Programs".
2. Check whether "Microsoft SharePoint" is listed as installed software.

If a list entry called "Microsoft SharePoint" exists, then you do have SharePoint Team Services installed.

**Note:** If you have both fp4awel.dll and fp5awel.dll you need to apply both the FrontPage Server Extension 2000 and FrontPage Server Extension 2002 update.

**What are the FrontPage Server Extensions?**

[FrontPage Server Extensions](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/aa167867%28office.11%29.aspx) (FPSE) is a set of tools that can be installed on a web site. They serve two basic functions: to allow authorized personnel to manage the server, add or change content, and perform other tasks; and to add functions that are frequently used by web pages, such as search and forms support.
FPSE installs by default as part of IIS 4.0, 5.0 and 5.1. Only Windows 2000 Server, Windows 2000 Advanced Server, and Windows 2000 Datacenter install IIS by default. IIS can be uninstalled if desired. Microsoft recommends that web administrators uninstall FPSE if not needed.

**If I have installed the stand-alone version of FrontPage Server extensions and then applied Windows 2000 Service Pack 4 am I vulnerable?**

Yes - You need to install the separate stand-alone update for FrontPage Server Extensions

**CAN-2003-0822: BO in FrontPage Server Extensions**

**What's the scope of the remote debug vulnerability?**

This is a [buffer overrun](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21142) vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause code of their choice to be executed as though it originated on the local machine. Such code could provide the attacker with the ability to take any desired action on the machine, including adding, deleting or modifying data on the system.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability results because of an unchecked buffer in one of the FrontPage Server Extensions dll files.

**What could the remote debug vulnerability enable an attacker to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run code of his or her choice with IWAM\_machinename account privileges on an affected system, or could cause FrontPage Server Extensions to fail.

**Who could exploit the vulnerability?**

Any unauthenticated attacker that can connect to the FrontPage Server Extensions service could seek to exploit this vulnerability

**How could an attacker exploit this vulnerability?**

An unauthenticated attacker could seek to exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted request to FrontPage Server Extensions which would then cause FrontPage Server Extensions to fail in such a way that an attacker could execute code of his or her choice.

**What steps could an administrator take to protect against the vulnerability?**

The simplest way to address the vulnerability is to install the update. However, if the update were not installed, a server wouldn't be at risk if FrontPage Server Extensions had been uninstalled.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by removing the remote debugging functionality, as this functionality is no longer supported. Microsoft recommends that customers use the Terminal Server functionality for remote debugging.

**CAN-2003-0824: Denial of Service in SmartHTML interpreter**

**What's the scope of the SmartHTML interpreter vulnerability?**

This is a [denial of service](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21142) vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause a server running Front Page Server Extensions to temporarily stop responding to requests.

**What is the SmartHTML interpreter?**

The SmartHTML interpreter is part of FPSE, and supports certain types of dynamic web content. It is made up of a variety of dynamic link library files. Using SmartHTML, a web developer can build a web page that relies on FrontPage features. For example, a web developer might want to embed the current date and time in a web page. In order to do that, the developer might use one of the WebBot components that come with FrontPage.
When the web page author inserts a WebBot into an HTML page, what actually gets inserted is a specially formatted HTML comment. A WebBot comment looks like a standard HTML comment with special notation that identifies the WebBot and its properties. The web page author sets the property values from a dialog box when the WebBot gets inserted. Each WebBot has its own dialog. Microsoft calls the WebBot notation "SmartHTML", and HTML pages containing WebBots "SmartHTML pages".
A WebBot is "executed" when the FrontPage Editor saves the HTML page. A FrontPage Server Extensions application scans the page for embedded WebBot components and replaces them with standard HTML text. As a result of this scanning process, a new page is created containing the standard HTML text generated from the WebBot components and a visitor to the web page sees the date and time rendered on the web page.

**What's wrong with the SmartHTML interpreter?**

If a request is made to a web server using FrontPage Server Extensions in a particular way, it could have the effect of causing the SmartHTML interpreter to cycle, temporarily consuming all of the server's CPU availability and preventing the server from performing useful work.

**What could an attacker do via this vulnerability?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause a server running Front Page Server Extensions to temporarily stop responding to requests.

**Who could exploit the vulnerability?**

Any unauthenticated attacker that can connect to the FrontPage Server Extensions service could seek to exploit this vulnerability

**How might an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

The attack itself would only require that the attacker send a particular type of request to the SmartHTML interpreter repeatedly.

**What steps could an administrator take to protect against the vulnerability?**

The simplest way to address the vulnerability is to install the update. However, if the update were not installed, a server wouldn't be at risk if FPSE had been uninstalled, or if the SmartHTML interpreter were not in use. For instance, the [IIS Lockdown Tool](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/tools/locktool.mspx), if used to configure a static web server, disables the interpreter.

**How does the update eliminate the vulnerability?**

The update causes the SmartHTML interpreter to properly validate the incoming requests and discard those that are not valid.

= Frontpage Extensions Remote Command Execution
=
= MS Bulletin posted:
= http ://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms03-051.asp
=
= Affected Software:
=	Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 2, Service Pack 3

= Public disclosure on November 11, 2003
========================================================================

Continuing 'The Methodical Approach To Finding Overflows' we moved to
the next attack avenue. After the success against nsiislog.dll we were
again greeted by an access violation message leading to the discovery
of another remote vulnerability.

== Description ==

Sending a chunked encoded post to fp30reg.dll will cause an access
violation resulting in the following error log.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Event Type:	Warning
Event Source:	W3SVC
Event Category:	None
Event ID:	37
Description:
Out of process application '/LM/W3SVC/1/ROOT' terminated unexpectedly.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

A chunked encoded post will result in the control of ECX and EDI, with
the exception occurring at a mov dword ptr [ECX+4],EDI instruction leading
to remote command execution with privileges associated with the
IWAM_machinename account.

== Chunked Transfer-Encoding Post ==

POST /_vti_bin/_vti_aut/fp30reg.dll HTTP/1.1
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

PostLength
PostData
0

== Exploitation ==

[Code Segment]
 67D46AD3 mov ecx,dword ptr [ebx+edx+8]
 67D46AD7 mov edi,dword ptr [ebx+edx+4]
 67D46ADB mov dword ptr [ecx+4],edi

[Registers]
 EAX = 046F83E8 EBX = 00000010 ECX = 58585858
 EDX = 05450FEC ESI = 0000000C EDI = 58585858
 EIP = 67D46ADB ESP = 0120F648 EBP = 0120F668

[EDX DUMP]
 05450FEC  11 00 00 00 58 58 58  ....XXX
 05450FF3  58 58 58 58 58 58 58  XXXXXXX
 05450FFA  58 58 58 58 58 58 58  XXXXXXX
 05451001  58 58 58 58 58 58 58  XXXXXXX
 05451008  58 58 58 58 58 58 58  XXXXXXX
 0545100F  58 58 58 58 58 58 58  XXXXXXX
 05451016  58 58 58 58 58 58 58  XXXXXXX

Many different ways to exploit this malloc/free scenario, so instead of
the usual SEH redirect to a JMP instruction, we took a two step approach
for higher reliability.

At the first exception error we are in control of ECX and EDI allowing
us to write our JMP instruction to a known writeable space. This does
not cause an exception and execution flow continues through to a CALL
instruction that uses a value from our buffer. We use this CALL to

== Solutions ==

- Every day is a 0-day day on the Internet. Limiting the avenues of attack
  can be a key factor in reducing the risk to a web server. Programs such
  as secureIIS and URLscan should be setup to reduce the number of methods
  that can be used to send data to a server. Removing unnecessary services,
  files and isapi extensions reduces the number of listeners that data can
  be fed to limiting the number of vulnerabilities that a server is
  susceptible to.
- Install the vendor supplied patch.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Microsoft FrontPage Server Extensions contains buffer overflow in remote debugging functionality

#### Vulnerability Note VU#279156

Original Release Date: 2003-11-12 | Last Revised: 2003-11-14

---

### Overview

Microsoft FrontPage Server Extensions contains a vulnerability that allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code with local system privileges.

### Description

| Microsoft FrontPage Server Extensions (FPSE) is an optional set of tools that adds functionality to a web site. This functionality includes remote server administration, content updates, and a variety of site-specific tools such as searching support and form handling. According to [MS03-051](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS03-051.asp), FPSE is installed by default on Internet Information Server (IIS) 4.0, 5.0, and 5.1.  The FPSE contains a buffer overflow vulnerability in its support of remote debugging. This vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated remote attacker and allows arbitrary code to be executed with local system privileges. |
| --- |

### Impact

| This vulnerability allows unauthenticated remote attackers to execute arbitrary code with local system privileges. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply a patch from Microsoft**Microsoft has published Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS03-051](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS03-051.asp) to address this vulnerability. For a complete list of systems affected, please read the Microsoft bulletin. |
| --- |

| **Disable FrontPage Server Extensions**As a an interim measure, sites may reduce their exposure to this vulnerability by disabling FrontPage Server Extensions. Note that this may reduce the functionality of sites that utilize FPSE extensions.**Disable Internet Information Server**The IIS web server is installed by default on several versions of Microsoft Windows. As a general rule, the CERT/CC recommends that system administrators disable or remove any nonessential software. In this case, IIS should be removed from any host that is not expected to serve web pages. |
