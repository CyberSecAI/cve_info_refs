Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in how Adobe Acrobat 5 validates JavaScript within PDF files. Specifically, the JavaScript parsing engine does not adequately validate the code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Inadequate JavaScript Validation:** The core issue is the lack of proper validation in the Acrobat 5 JavaScript parsing engine, which allows malicious JavaScript code to bypass security checks.
*   **Arbitrary File Write:** Due to the inadequate validation, the malicious JavaScript can instruct Acrobat to write arbitrary files to locations on the local file system.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File System Access:** Attackers can write arbitrary files to any location on the local file system that is writeable by the user running Acrobat. This includes, but is not limited to, the user's Plug-ins folder.
*   **Malware Installation:**  A virus (W32.Yourde) has been discovered that exploits this vulnerability to write malicious code into the user's Plug-ins folder, which automatically runs when Acrobat is launched. This can lead to arbitrary code execution on the victim machine, depending on the malicious code that was placed.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Malicious PDF Documents:** The primary attack vector is a specially crafted PDF document that contains malicious JavaScript code.
*   **User Interaction:** The user must open the malicious PDF document with the vulnerable Adobe Acrobat 5 application to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to Create Malicious PDF:** An attacker needs the ability to create a malicious PDF containing the exploit JavaScript code.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick the user into opening the malicious PDF document using a vulnerable version of Acrobat.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to Adobe Acrobat 5 and Acrobat Approval 5 for Windows.
*   Acrobat 6 and all versions of Acrobat Reader are not vulnerable.
*   Acrobat and Acrobat Approval for Macintosh and Acrobat for UNIX are not vulnerable.
*   The vulnerability was reported by John Landwehr of Adobe Systems Inc.
*   The CVE ID assigned to this vulnerability is CVE-2003-0284.
