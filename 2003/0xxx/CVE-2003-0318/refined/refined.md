- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Statistics module in PHP-Nuke does not properly sanitize user input provided through the `year` URL parameter. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML and script code into the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Code injection vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization on the `year` parameter in the URL.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts (JavaScript, VBScript), iframes, and other HTML elements. This can lead to:
    - Execution of malicious code on the victim's browser.
    - Redirection to malicious websites via iframes.
    - User data theft or other malicious activities.
    - Potential for cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious URL with the `year` parameter containing HTML or script code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL and induce a user to visit that URL.
