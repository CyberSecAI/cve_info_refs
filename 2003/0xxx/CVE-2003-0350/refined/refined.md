- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Utility Manager in Windows 2000 does not properly validate Windows messages sent to it, specifically when presenting the list of accessibility functions. This allows a process to cause the Utility Manager to execute a callback function at an address of the attacker's choice.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper validation of Windows messages leading to arbitrary code execution through a callback function.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can gain elevated privileges, including complete control over the system, allowing them to add, delete, or modify data, create/delete user accounts, and add accounts to the local administrators group.
- **Attack vectors:** A local attacker needs to log on to the system interactively, start the Utility Manager and then execute a program that sends a specially crafted Windows message to it, including the desired callback function address.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
  - Valid logon credentials to the target system.
  - Ability to interactively log on to the system.
  - Ability to start the Utility Manager.
  - Ability to create and run a process to send the malicious Windows message.
