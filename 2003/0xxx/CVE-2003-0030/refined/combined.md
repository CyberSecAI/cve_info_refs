## Protegrity Secure.Data for Microsoft SQL Server 2000 contains buffer overflows in extended stored procedures

#### Vulnerability Note VU#247545

Original Release Date: 2003-03-13 | Last Revised: 2003-03-13

---

### Overview

Protegrity Secure.Data for Microsoft SQL Server 2000 includes several extended stored procedures that contain buffer overflow vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code, gain access to databases, or cause a denial of service.

### Description

| Protegrity Secure.Data for Microsoft SQL Server 2000 provides access control and encryption for individual data records. Secure.Data interacts with Microsoft SQL Server via extended stored procedures that are part of the Secure.Data Extension Feature (SEF). From Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [190987](http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;190987): "Extended stored procedures provide a way to dynamically load and execute a function within a dynamic-link library (DLL) in a manner similar to that of a stored procedure, seamlessly extending SQL Server functionality." Extended stored procedures execute under the security context and in the process space of SQL Server. By default, the SQL Server 2000 service runs as a Windows domain user.  Several extended stored procedures (xp\_pty\_checkusers, xp\_pty\_insert, and xp\_pty\_select) included as part of the SEF contain buffer overflow vulnerabilities. These extended stored procedures could be exploited by specially crafted SQL commands. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the SQL Server process or cause a denial of service. This could give an attacker full access to databases stored on a vulnerable system. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade**Protegrity has issued an updated version of protegrity.dll (2.2.3.9) that resolves these vulnerabilities. |
| --- |

| **Restrict Access**Using firewall or similar technology, restrict direct access to SQL servers to only those hosts and networks that require it. By default, SQL Server 2000 listens on port 1433/tcp. Named/clustered SQL instances may require special configuration. See Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [287932](http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;287932) for more information. Note that this will only limit the possible sources of attacks. |

Vulnerability Note VU#247545
Buffer overflow vulnerability in Protegrity Secure.Data for Microsoft SQL Server

**Overview**

Protegrity Secure.Data for Microsoft SQL Server 2000 exposes a buffer overflow vulnerability in the Microsoft SQL extended stored procedures xp\_pty\_checkusers, xp\_pty\_insert, and xp\_pty\_select.

**I. Description**

Here's an example of a possible buffer overflow situation in which Secure.Data for Microsoft SQL Server 2000 could be vulnerable:

DECLARE @test varchar(8000)
SET @test = (SELECT replicate('x',1926))
execute master.dbo.xp\_pty\_checkusers 'as', @test

DECLARE @test varchar(8000)
SET @test = (SELECT replicate('x',850))
execute master.dbo.xp\_pty\_insert @test, @test, @test

DECLARE @test varchar(8000)
SET @test = (SELECT replicate('x',850))
execute master.dbo.xp\_pty\_select @test, @test, @test
**II. Impact**

A non-privileged user can gain administrative access to the database and cause a denial of service attack.

**III. Solution**

1. The following Secure.Data for SQL Server 2000 releases are affected by this vulnerability.

   > Secure.Data version 2.2.2.0 for SQL Server 2000
   > Secure.Data version 2.2.3.0 for SQL Server 2000
2. A patch release is now available for the above mentioned releases. All Protegrity customers having one or both of these releases will automatically receive the patch from our Global Support Team along with installation instructions. Following are the installation instructions for applying the patch to Secure.Data version 2.2.3.0 for SQL Server 2000.

   Purpose

   This patch release is for Secure.Data Server version 2.2.3.0 for SQL Server 2000. The patch includes a new protegrity.dll file which fixes a buffer overflow vulnerability in the extended store procedures xp\_pty\_checkusers, xp\_pty\_insert, and xp\_pty\_select. (TD4182)

   How to check if this patch should be installed

   This patch should be installed if the version number of the existing protegrity.dll is less than 2.2.3.9. Follow these simple steps to check the version number of the existing protegrity.dll file.

   1. Locate the file protegrity.dll. In a default installation the file is found in C:\Program Files\Protegrity\Secure.Data Server\Cartridge\Lib.
   2. Right click on the file and choose Properties.
   3. Click on the version tab.
   4. If the file has a version less than 2.2.3.9 this patch must be applied. (i.e if the last digit is less than 9.)

   How to install the patch

   To install the patch the new protegrity.dll must replace the old one:

   1. Shut down the Protegrity Secure.Data Server from the Control Panel.
   2. Shut down the SQL Server.
   3. Replace the old protegrity.dll by copying the new file to the same location as the old. In a default installation the file is found in C:\Program Files\Protegrity\Secure.Data Server\Cartridge\Lib.
   4. Start the SQL Server.
   5. Start the Protegrity Secure.Data Server.

4. Any customers that purchase Protegrity Secure.Data for SQL Server 2000 after 2/21/2003 will not be affected by this vulnerability, as the patch has already been included in a new service release, Secure.Data version 2.2.3.1 for SQL Server 2000.

Additional details can be found at
<http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/247545>

There is a company that does encryption of databases
called Protegrty. They use extended stored procedures
to do the encryption and decryption. I tested 3 of the
extended stored procedures and found all 3 vulnerable
to buffer overflows.

DECLARE @test varchar(8000)
SET @test = (SELECT replicate('x',1926))
execute master.dbo.xp_pty_checkusers 'as', @test

DECLARE @test varchar(8000)
SET @test = (SELECT replicate('x',850))
execute master.dbo.xp_pty_insert @test, @test, @test

DECLARE @test varchar(8000)
SET @test = (SELECT replicate('x',850))
execute master.dbo.xp_pty_select @test, @test, @test

These security holes are fully exploitable and would
allow an attacker to perform any of the following:

1)become sa on the box
2)gain control of the operating system
3)decrypt the sensitive data Protegrity is encrypting

If you have this software, contact the vendor for the
patch.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
