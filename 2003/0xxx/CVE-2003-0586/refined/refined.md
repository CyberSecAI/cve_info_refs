- **Root cause of vulnerability:**
    - SQL injection vulnerability due to unsanitized user input in the login process
    - Path disclosure vulnerability due to direct access to a configuration file

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - SQL Injection: The `$user` and `$pass` variables from user input are directly used in an SQL query without sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
    - Path Disclosure: The `settings.inc.php` file can be accessed directly via a web browser, revealing sensitive information such as database connection details.

- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - SQL Injection: An attacker can bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the application by injecting malicious SQL code into the `user` and `pass` fields in the login form. This could allow them to gain access to administrative functionality and potentially full control over the application's database.
    - Path Disclosure: An attacker can access sensitive database configuration information contained in `settings.inc.php` , including database credentials, server addresses, user names and passwords.

- **Attack vectors:**
    - SQL Injection: The attacker modifies the `user` and `pass` parameters in the login form (`/admin/login.asp`) using HTTP GET or POST method.
    - Path Disclosure: The attacker directly accesses `settings.inc.php` file through a web browser.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - SQL Injection: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable eStore application. No specific privilege is required, however, the attacker needs to be able to construct the appropriate SQL injection payloads.
    - Path Disclosure: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable eStore application.
