Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2003-0156 (based on the content, this seems likely, though the CVE description is missing)

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The LXR (Linux Cross-Referencer) application does not properly filter user-supplied input when reading the kernel version from the 'v' variable. Specifically, it fails to filter out ".." sequences, allowing directory traversal.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Directory Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is directory traversal. The application uses the value of the 'v' parameter to construct a file path without adequate sanitization, allowing an attacker to navigate up the directory tree.
*  **Lack of Input Validation:** The application does not sanitize the input, which leads to the directory traversal issue.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary File Reading:** By crafting a malicious 'v' parameter, an attacker can read any file on the system that the webserver user has permission to access. This includes sensitive files like `/etc/passwd` which is mentioned in the exploit example.
*  **Information Disclosure**: The attacker can gain unauthorized access to sensitive information by reading files that are not intended to be accessed.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is carried out through a standard HTTP GET request, by manipulating the 'v' parameter in the URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable LXR web application.
*   **Basic Understanding of HTTP:** The attacker must understand how to modify URL parameters to include the exploit payload.

**Technical Details**
The vulnerability lies in the `v` parameter of LXR. The application takes the `v` parameter, and then uses it as a part of the file path to open the file. The issue is that it does not filter for `..` (dot-dot) sequences. An attacker can provide a `v` parameter that has `../` sequences, which will cause the application to traverse the file system and read files outside the intended directory. In addition, a null byte (`%00`) is needed at the end to ignore the remaining part of the original path being constructed.

**Example Attack:**
```
http://vulnerable/source?v=../../../../../../../etc/password%00
```
This URL would use the path traversal vulnerability to read the `/etc/passwd` file.

**Patch**
The provided content also notes that a fix for this would be to filter the `v` variable using a regex that filters for `..`.
