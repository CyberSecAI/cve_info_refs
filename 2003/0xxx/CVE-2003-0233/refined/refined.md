Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities described:

**1. URLMON.DLL Buffer Overrun (CAN-2003-0113)**

*   **Root Cause:**  A buffer overrun vulnerability exists in `URLMON.DLL` due to improper parameter checks when processing information received from a web server.
*   **Weakness:** Insufficient validation of parameters received from a web server, leading to a buffer overflow.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the user's system with the privileges of the currently logged-in user. This could lead to a complete system compromise.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker can exploit this by hosting a malicious website or sending a specially crafted HTML email.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to create a malicious web page or HTML email containing the overflow trigger. No specific user interaction beyond visiting the page or previewing/viewing the email is required.

**2. Internet Explorer File Upload Control Vulnerability (CAN-2003-0114)**

*   **Root Cause:** The file upload control allows a script to supply a file name to the control, which then uploads the file to a web server without user interaction.
*   **Weakness:** The file upload control does not properly validate or restrict input, allowing a script to specify the file to be uploaded.
*   **Impact:** An attacker could upload arbitrary files from the user's system to a remote server, potentially exfiltrating sensitive data.
*   **Attack Vector:**  The attacker would need to trick a user into visiting a malicious web page that automatically triggers the file upload by exploiting the file upload control.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker must know the exact path and file name of the file to be uploaded in advance. Also, the targeted file must not be currently in use by the user or the OS.

**3. Third-Party Plug-in Rendering Flaw (CAN-2003-0115)**

*   **Root Cause:** Internet Explorer does not properly check parameters passed when rendering third-party files, leading to potential script injection during rendering.
*   **Weakness:** Improper parameter handling during the loading operation of third-party plugins, specifically for plugins using the "EnableFullPage" feature.
*   **Impact:**  An attacker could inject and execute scripts within the security context of the user (specifically, the local computer zone), potentially gaining access to local resources.
*   **Attack Vector:**  The attacker must host a website with a malicious URL that invokes a third-party plugin with the vulnerability. The user would need to visit the page and click the malicious link.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to create a specially crafted URL referencing a third-party file type and host it on a web server. The vulnerability only impacts systems with vulnerable plugins installed.

**4. Modal Dialog Script Execution Flaw (CAN-2003-0116)**

*   **Root Cause:** A flaw in how Internet Explorer handles modal dialogs allows an attacker to inject script code through a parameter, which is not properly checked.
*   **Weakness:** The modal dialogs' input parameter is not sanitized, allowing script injection.
*   **Impact:** An attacker could potentially access files on the user's local system.
*   **Attack Vector:**  The attacker could create a malicious webpage that uses a crafted modal dialog to trigger the vulnerability when a user visits the page.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker must know the exact location and name of the files to be read from the user's system. No user interaction is required beyond visiting the attacker's web page.

**Additional Notes from marc.info:**

*   The `marc.info` content focuses on the **Plugin.ocx heap overflow**, which is related to the ActiveX control kill bit fix mentioned in the Microsoft bulletin, but it is not directly assigned a CVE in this bulletin. This is different from the other 4 CVEs.
*   The `Plugin.ocx` vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow that can be triggered via a malicious webpage or HTML email.
*   The overflow occurs when an overly long string is passed to the `Load` method of the control.

**Summary**

The Microsoft Security Bulletin MS03-015 addresses four critical vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer, all of which can be exploited remotely via malicious web pages or specially crafted emails. The vulnerabilities include a buffer overflow, a file upload control flaw, a third-party plugin rendering vulnerability, and a modal dialog script execution issue. Each vulnerability has the potential for significant impact, ranging from arbitrary code execution to information disclosure.
The bulletin also addresses a separate `Plugin.ocx` ActiveX control vulnerability by setting the kill bit for it.
