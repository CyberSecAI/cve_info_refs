## Ethereal contains integer overflow in Mount dissector

#### Vulnerability Note VU#232164

Original Release Date: 2003-05-12 | Last Revised: 2003-05-12

---

### Overview

Ethereal is a network traffic analysis package. The mount packet dissector contains a vulnerability that may result in the execution of arbitrary code.

### Description

| The mount packet dissector for Ethereal contains an integer overflow vulnerability. According to the [Ethereal Advisory](http://www.ethereal.com/appnotes/enpa-sa-00009.html), tvb\_get\_nstringz() and tvb\_get\_nstringz0() were used in an unsafe manner.  Versions 0.9.11 and earlier of Ethereal are affected. |
| --- |

### Impact

| It may be possible for a remote attacker to crash the program or run arbitrary code on the system via a crafted packet. |
| --- |

### Solution

| [Upgrade](http://www.ethereal.com/download.html) to version 0.9.12 which resolves this issue. |
| --- |

RHSA-2003:077 - Security Advisory

Issued:
2003-07-08
Updated:
2003-07-08
# RHSA-2003:077 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

ethereal security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Topic

Updated Ethereal packages fixing a number of remotely exploitable security
issues are now available.

## Description

Ethereal is a package designed for monitoring network traffic.

A number of security issues affect Ethereal. By exploiting these issues it
may be possible to make Ethereal crash or run arbitrary code by injecting a
purposefully malformed packet onto the wire, or by convincing someone to
read a malformed packet trace file.

Ethereal 0.9.9 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial
of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via carefully
crafted SOCKS packets. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0081 to this issue.

A heap-based buffer overflow exists in the NTLMSSP code for Ethereal
0.9.9 and earlier. (CAN-2003-0159)

Multiple off-by-one vulnerabilities exist in Ethereal 0.9.11 and earlier in
the AIM, GIOP Gryphon, OSPF, PPTP, Quake, Quake2, Quake3, Rsync, SMB, SMPP,
and TSP dissectors, which do not properly use the tvb\_get\_nstringz and
tvb\_get\_nstringz0 functions. (CAN-2003-0356)

Multiple integer overflow vulnerabilities exist in Ethereal 0.9.11 and
earlier in the Mount and PPP dissectors. (CAN-2003-0357)

A vulnerability in the DCERPC dissector exists in Ethereal 0.9.12 and
earlier, allowing remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory
consumption) via a certain NDR string. (CAN-2003-0428)

A possible buffer overflow vulnerability exists in Ethereal 0.9.12 and
earlier, caused by invalid IPv4 or IPv6 prefix lengths and possibly
triggering a buffer overflow. (CAN-2003-0429)

A vulnerability exists in Ethereal 0.9.12 and earlier, allowing remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via an invalid ASN.1 value.
(CAN-2003-0430)

The tvb\_get\_nstringz0 function in Ethereal 0.9.12 and earlier does not
properly handle a zero-length buffer size. (CAN-2003-0431)

Ethereal 0.9.12 and earlier does not handle certain strings properly in the
BGP, WTP, DNS, 802.11, ISAKMP, WSP, CLNP, ISIS, and RMI dissectors.
(CAN-2003-0432)

Users of Ethereal should update to these erratum packages containing
Ethereal version 0.9.13, which are not vulnerable to these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

Please note that this update is available via Red Hat Network. To use Red
Hat Network, launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

## Affected Products

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 2 ia64
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 2 i386
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux Workstation 2 ia64
