Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a buffer overflow in the Lotus Domino Web Retriever when it receives an overly long HTTP status line from a remote web server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The Web Retriever program does not properly handle excessively long HTTP status lines, leading to a buffer overflow. This occurs when the program writes data beyond the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** If the Web Retriever is running as a server task, a successful exploit will crash the service, causing a denial of service on the server.
- **Client Crash:** If the Web Retriever is running locally on a client, the exploit will crash the Notes client application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Web Server:** A malicious remote web server can send an HTTP response with an overly long status line to trigger the vulnerability.
- **HTTP Response Manipulation:** An attacker could manipulate the HTTP response to include a status line exceeding the buffer limit of the Web Retriever.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send an HTTP response to a Lotus Domino server or client running the vulnerable Web Retriever task.
- **Control of a Web Server:** The attacker either needs to control a web server or be able to manipulate a legitimate web server's response.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Software:** The attacker needs to know that the target is using a vulnerable version of Lotus Domino and that the Web Retriever task is enabled.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered with an HTTP status line of around 6000 bytes.
- The vulnerability affects Lotus Notes/Domino R4.5, R4.6, R5, and R6 beta (pre-Gold) server and client versions.
- The vulnerability does not affect Lotus Notes/Domino R6.0 Gold, R6.0.1 and R5.0.12.
- A workaround is to disable the WEB task on the server.
- Notes clients are vulnerable if configured to use the Notes web browser.
