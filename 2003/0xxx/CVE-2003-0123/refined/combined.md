## Lotus Domino Web Retriever contains a buffer overflow vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#411489

Original Release Date: 2003-03-13 | Last Revised: 2003-03-18

---

### Overview

A buffer overflow vulnerability may be exploited via the Lotus Domino Web Retriever. Versions prior to 5.0.12 and 6.0 are affected.

### Description

| According to the [Rapid7 Advisory](http://www.rapid7.com/advisories/R7-0011.html):  *The Lotus Notes/Domino Web Retriever task is responsible for retrieving web pages on behalf of Notes users who want to access the web via their Notes server.**The Web Retriever program will crash when it receives an overly long HTTP status line from a remote web server.**If the Web Retriever is running as a server task, the crash will cause a denial of service on the server.**If the Web Retriever is running locally on a client, the crash will bring down the Notes client with it.* |
| --- |

### Impact

| This vulnerability may be used to cause a denial of service. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Lotus has published a [support document](http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=463&uid=swg21105060) for this issue. Upgrade to version 5.0.12 or 6.0 Gold or 6.0.1. |
| --- |

| In their [support document](http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=463&uid=swg21105060), Lotus recommends disabling the WEB task on the server as a workaround. This task is not enabled by default. |

## History

The CERT Division is the birthplace of cybersecurity. For nearly 30 years, the CERT Division of the SEI has partnered with government, industry, law enforcement, and academia to advance cybersecurity and improve the security and resilience of computer systems and networks.

Originally focused on incident response, we have expanded into cybersecurity areas such as network situational awareness, malicious code analysis, secure coding, resilience management, insider threats, digital investigations and intelligence, workforce development, DevOps, forensics, software assurance, vulnerability discovery and analysis, and risk management.

## Former Director Richard Pethia

[Richard Pethia](/about/leadership/display.cfm?customel_datapageid_2623=3545) was founding director of the SEI's CERT Division. Pethia, who served as director of CERT from 1988 to 2016, guided the organization through tremendous growth and change. Under Pethia's leadership, the unit expanded and evolved from the CERT Coordination Center—a small group focused on computer incident response—to a research organization of more than 200 professionals dedicated to solving problems with widespread cybersecurity implications.

Rapid7 Advisory R7-0011
Lotus Notes/Domino Web Retriever HTTP Status Buffer Overflow

   Published:  March 12, 2003
   Revision:   1.0
   <http://www.rapid7.com/advisories/R7-0011.html>

   CVE:           CAN-2003-0123
   Lotus SPR:     KSPR5DFJTR
   IBM Technote:  1105060
   Bugtraq ID:    7038

1. Affected system(s):

   KNOWN VULNERABLE:
    o Lotus Notes/Domino R4.5 server and client
    o Lotus Notes/Domino R4.6 server and client
    o Lotus Notes/Domino R5 server and client
    o Lotus Notes/Domino R6 beta (pre-Gold) server and client

   NOT VULNERABLE:
    o Lotus Notes/Domino R6.0 Gold
    o Lotus Notes/Domino R6.0.1
    o Lotus Notes/Domino R5.0.12

2. Summary

   The Lotus Notes/Domino Web Retriever task is responsible for
   retrieving web pages on behalf of Notes users who want to access the
   web via their Notes server.

   The Web Retriever program will crash when it receives an overly long
   HTTP status line from a remote web server.

   If the Web Retriever is running as a server task, the crash will
   cause a denial of service on the server.

   If the Web Retriever is running locally on a client, the crash will
   bring down the Notes client with it.

3. Vendor status and information

   Lotus
   <http://www.lotus.com/>
   <http://www.ibm.com/>

   Lotus was notified and they have fixed this vulnerability.  Lotus is
   tracking this issue with SPR #KSPR5DFJTR.  [[1]](#1) IBM has also prepared
   Technote #1105060, which discusses this vulnerability.  [[2]](#2)

   See the References section for more information.

4. Solution

   Users running R5 should upgrade to Notes R5.0.12.  Users of R6
   pre-Gold releases should upgrade R6.0 Gold or higher.  Due to other
   vulnerabilities discovered in R6.0 Gold, you should consider
   upgrading to R6.0.1, which was released in February 2003.

   Domino incremental installers may be downloaded from the following
   URL (which has been wrapped):

   <http://www14.software.ibm.com>
      /webapp/download/search.jsp?go=y&rs=ESD-DMNTSRVRi&sb=r

   As a workaround, you can disable the Web Retriever task on the
   server.  To do this, first remove the 'Web' entry from the
   ServerTasks line in the server's NOTES.INI file, then issue the
   'tell web quit' command at the server console.

   In addition, consider removing the Web Retrieval database (typically
   /WEB.NSF) or lock down its ACL so that no users can access it.  If
   the Web Retriever is disabled, users probably do not need access to
   this database.

   Notes clients will be vulnerable to this if they are configured to
   use the Notes web browser instead of an external browser program.
   This option can be viewed in the Internet browser section of the
   current Location document.

5. Detailed analysis

   By issuing an overly long status message in its HTTP response, a
   remote server can crash the Web Retriever process.  The response
   line consists of the standard HTTP version and code followed by an
   overly long (~6000 bytes) status message, followed by two carriage
   return/linefeed pairs.

      HTTP/1.1 200 Ax6000<crlf><crlf>

   A response length of around 6000 bytes is usually sufficient to crash
   the Web Retriever.  Using a somewhat smaller buffer will still
   corrupt the heap, but the crash may not occur until the corrupted
   portions of the heap are later used.
