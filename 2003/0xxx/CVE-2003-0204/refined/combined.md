| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=56808#c0)  Keith Winstein    2003-04-03 21:02:42 UTC  ``` Version:            (using KDE Devel) Installed from:    Compiled sources  This is a critical security hole in konquerer and kghostview.  kgvconfigdialog.cpp includes the default gs execution arguments, which do not include -dPARANOIDSAFER or -dSAFER (unlike gv, which uses -dSAFER by default.)  Because kghostview is run by konquerer to produce Postscript previews of a directory, this means that a malicious postscript file can cause arbitrary code to be executed merely by _opening the directory containing the file_ in konquerer.  Also, because the default configuration is copied to the home directory kghostviewrc on first execution, just adding -dPARANOIDSAFER to the arguments in kgvconfigdialog.cpp is not sufficient to fix the bug for existing users.  Please add -dPARANOIDSAFER to the default arguments and have kghostview add it to existing users' home-directory kghostviewrc, and please release a new KDE version incorporating the fixed kghostview quickly. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=56808#c1)  Luís Pedro Coelho    2003-04-03 23:00:23 UTC  ``` If you look at kpswidget.cpp you will see that -dSAFER is always included.    You don't even have a chance to change that which is why it is not even included  in the configuration widget.    luis pedro coelho  ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=56808#c2)  Maksim Orlovich    2003-04-03 23:15:49 UTC  ``` Luis: unfortunately, it's not kghostivew that's used for thumbnails    ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=56808#c3)  Keith Winstein    2003-04-03 23:37:45 UTC  ``` Luis: Yes, you are right; I was misled by <http://www.konqueror.org/features/viewer.php>, which says "Konqueror embeds components (parts) provided by other applications.    The image-viewing part is KView, the text-viewing part is KWrite, the    DVI viewer KDVI, the PostScript viewer KGhostview, and of course all    KOffice documents are shown by their originating application."  So there remains a vulnerability that -dSAFER is not used when previewing in konquerer (apparently just bug ID 53157 was not fixed), leading to malicious postscript files being able to execute arbitrary code on directory-open, but it's not kghostview's fault. ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=56808#c4)  Maksim Orlovich    2003-04-03 23:41:42 UTC  ``` Keith: I forwarded your report to security@kde.org, they're looking into it.     ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=56808#c5)  Dirk Mueller    2003-04-09 21:09:25 UTC  ``` NOT invalid  ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=56808#c6)  Luís Pedro Coelho    2003-04-09 21:26:17 UTC  ``` Subject: Re:  Security hole (-dPARANOIDSAFER not used) allows arbitrary command execution  Le Mercredi 9 Avril 2003 21:09, Dirk Mueller a  ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=56808#c7)  Dirk Mueller    2003-04-09 23:10:20 UTC  ```   *** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of [53157](show_bug.cgi?id=53157 "RESOLVED FIXED - Vulnerability in ghostscript thumbnail creation") *** ``` |  |

GENTOO LINUX SECURITY ANNOUNCEMENT 200304-04
- - ---------------------------------------------------------------------

          PACKAGE : kde-3.x
          SUMMARY : aribitrary code execution
             DATE : 2003-04-10 15:34 UTC
          EXPLOIT : remote
VERSIONS AFFECTED : <3.1.1a || <3.0.5b
    FIXED VERSION : >=3.1.1a || >=3.0.5b
              CVE :

- - ---------------------------------------------------------------------

- From advisory:

"KDE uses Ghostscript software for processing of PostScript (PS)
and PDF files in a way that allows for the execution of arbitrary
commands that can be contained in such files.

An attacker can prepare a malicious PostScript or PDF file which will
provide the attacker with access to the victim's account and privileges
when the victim opens this malicious file for viewing or when the
victim browses a directory containing such malicious file and has
file previews enabled.

An attacker can provide malicious files remotely to a victim in an
e-mail, as part of a webpage, via an ftp server and possible other
means."

Read the full advisory at:
<http://www.kde.org/info/security/advisory-20030409-1.txt>

INFORMATION REGARDING OTHER ARCHITECTURES THAN X86

kde-3.1.1a and kde-3.0.5b are currently only marked stable for x86.
If you have succesfully compiled and merged 3.1.1a or 3.0.5a on any
other architecture than x86 please report this to kde@gentoo.org.

SOLUTION

It is recommended that all Gentoo Linux users who are running
kde-base/kde upgrade to kde-3.1.1a or kde-3.0.5b as follows:

emerge sync
emerge kde OR \=kde-base/kde-3.0.5b
emerge clean

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=53343#c0)  uno    2003-01-24 05:57:32 UTC  ``` Version:           0.13.2 (using KDE 3.1.0 (RC6)) Installed from:    compiled sources Compiler:          gcc version 3.2 20020903 (Red Hat Linux 8.0 3.2-7) OS:          Linux (i686) release 2.4.18-19.8.0  The heading says it all. Unfortunately I have no idea  what pdf version the files that faile to open has. But the ones I have encountered starts with: %PDF-1.3 ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=53343#c1)  klee    2003-02-21 02:41:25 UTC  ``` I can confirm, using the KDE 3.1 release.  Actually, I've had this problem as long as I  can remember using KDE.  (Yes, I should have reported a long time ago; I've been  using Acrobat instead.)  I can also confirm that this happens with PDF 1.2 files.   Actually, almost no PDF files in the world that I have ever encountered work with  kghostview, even the ones that display OK with gv.    More precisely, the file loads, and the correct number of pages are shown in the page  chooser, but the main window displays a blank page.  This happens when I'm loading  PDFs over the network, when I'm doing it on a local file system, when I'm doing it on  an NFS-mounted filesystem, whatever.  It happens when I use the embedded  kghostviewer component or when I'm using the standalone kghostviewer.  If I load up  a PostScript file in kghostview, print to PDF, and load up the resulting PDF in  kghostview, it does not work.    BTW, this may be a duplicate of [Bug 22771](show_bug.cgi?id=22771 "RESOLVED WORKSFORME - kghostview loads pdf or ps, but displays blank pages"), but I can't confirm for sure.    When I enable "Show Ghostscript messages in a separate box", load up a PDF file,  and hit "Redisplay", I get the following messages:    -----------begin messages---------------  Error: /invalidfileaccess   in --file--    Operand stack:     (/homes/gws/klee/etc/papers/practical-linear-types.pdf)   (r)  Execution stack:     %interp_exit   .runexec2     --nostringval--   --nostringval--   --nostringval--   2   %stopped_push   --nostringval--    --nostringval--   --nostringval--     false   1   %stopped_push   1   3   %oparray_pop   1   3   %oparray_pop   .runexec2    --nostringval--   --nostringval--   --nost  ringval--   2   %stopped_push   --nostringval--   --nostringval--   --nostringval--  Dictionary stack:     --dict:1029/1123(ro)(G)  --   --dict:0/20(G)--   --dict:72/200(L)--   --dict:100/127(ro)(G)--   --dict:221/230(G)--  Current allocation mode is local  AFPL Ghostscript DEVELOPMENT RELEASE   7.20  :   Unrecoverable error, exit code 1  -----------end messages---------------    I get at least the "Error: \invalidfileaccess" part of this message pretty consistently  across the non-working PDF files.  So, you might think this is a ghostscript  interpreter error, except that gv displays these files just fine.  And it's definitely not the  PDF file, since xpdf and Acrobat Reader display fine too.  ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=53343#c2)  Luís Pedro Coelho    2003-03-14 12:45:11 UTC  ``` Can someone post such a .pdf file?

OK, I've attached one that's relatively small.  You can also view it at:  <http://www.ccs.neu.edu/scheme/pubs/fse01-flf.pdf>  ~k    Created an attachment (id=1170) fse01-flf.pdf ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=53343#c4)  Luís Pedro Coelho    2003-03-14 19:24:05 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1171](attachment.cgi?id=1171 "test case") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1171&action=edit "test case") test case  I had problems with the previous attachment ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=53343#c5)  Luís Pedro Coelho    2003-03-14 19:26:08 UTC  ``` I wasn't able to open the attachment on bugzilla (bc bugzilla was giving me an  empty file), but the ftp link seemed to work and open on kghostview, so I can't  reproduce the bug.    I added the file to bugzilla because external test case links often become stale after  some time.  ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=53343#c6)  klee    2003-03-14 19:28:22 UTC  ``` What ghostview version are you using?

I even got kghostview BRANCH and 3.1.0  (everything else (kdelibs,etc.) is from  HEAD, though) to see if I could make the bug show up.    I always opened the file without any problems.  ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=53343#c8)  klee    2003-03-18 21:52:20 UTC  ``` Subject: Re:  Frequently fails to open pdf files           OK, it turns out I'm running 7.20 (I had forgotten that some other user installed 7.20 in our "unsupported software" partition).  The old gs was in my bash PATH, but the new gs was in the PATH of my KE environment.  Anyway, running kghostview with the debug window yields the spew of error messages I posted earlier:    Error: /invalidfileaccess    in --file--    ... [lots of error junk] ...    AFPL Ghostscript DEVELOPMENT RELEASE    7.20   :    Unrecoverable error, exit code 1  Given the /invalidfileaccess, I think this problem is related to the new semantics of -dSAFER in 7.20:  <http://www.ghostscript.com/pipermail/gs-devel/2002-April/001499.html>  This security change appears to have been propagated into all post-7.20 releases of GhostScript; see the 8.00 docs:  <http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/doc/AFPL/8.00/Use.htm>  Searching reveals that kpswidget.cpp always passes -dSAFER.  I believe the fix is to make kghostview do the right thing w.r.t. the new -dSAFER semantics, possibly conditionally depending on whether the ghostview version is post-7.20.  Doing the secure thing appears pretty tricky, but maybe you could look at what newer versions of gsview do.  Someday, I assume, the newer versions of gs will be standard everywhere.  ~k    ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=53343#c9)  Waldo Bastian    2003-04-09 23:09:00 UTC  ``` This is supposed to be fixed with the KDE security update that we have issued  today.

              CVE :

- - ---------------------------------------------------------------------

- From advisory:

"KDE uses Ghostscript software for processing of PostScript (PS)
and PDF files in a way that allows for the execution of arbitrary
commands that can be contained in such files.

An attacker can prepare a malicious PostScript or PDF file which will
provide the attacker with access to the victim's account and privileges
when the victim opens this malicious file for viewing or when the
victim browses a directory containing such malicious file and has
file previews enabled.

An attacker can provide malicious files remotely to a victim in an
e-mail, as part of a webpage, via an ftp server and possible other
means."

Read the full advisory at:
<http://www.kde.org/info/security/advisory-20030409-1.txt>

SOLUTION

It is recommended that all Gentoo Linux users who are running
kde-base/kde upgrade to fixed packages as follows:

emerge sync
emerge \=kde-base/kdebase-2.2.2-r5
emerge \=kde-base/kdelibs-2.2.2a-r2
emerge \=kde-base/kdegraphics-2.2.2-r2

KDE Security Advisory: PS/PDF file handling vulnerability
Original Release Date: 2003-04-09
URL: http://www.kde.org/info/security/advisory-20030409-1.txt
0. References

1. Systems affected:
All KDE 2 and KDE 3 versions up to and including KDE 3.1.1.
2. Overview:
KDE uses Ghostscript software for processing of PostScript (PS)
and PDF files in a way that allows for the execution of arbitrary
commands that can be contained in such files.
An attacker can prepare a malicious PostScript or PDF file which will
provide the attacker with access to the victim's account and privileges
when the victim opens this malicious file for viewing or when the
victim browses a directory containing such malicious file and has
file previews enabled.
An attacker can provide malicious files remotely to a victim in an
e-mail, as part of a webpage, via an ftp server and possible other
means.
3. Impact:
The vulnerabilities potentially enable local or remote attackers
to compromise the privacy of a vicitim's data and to execute arbitrary
shell commands with the victim's privileges, such as erasing files or
accessing or modifying data.
4. Solution:
The affected applications have been fixed in KDE 3.0.5b and
KDE 3.1.1a, both released today. We strongly recommend upgrading
to these releases.
KDE 3.0.5b can be downloaded from
http://download.kde.org/stable/3.0.5b/
KDE 3.1.1a can be downloaded from
http://download.kde.org/stable/3.1.1a/
Please note that the KDE 3.1.1a release only consists of updates
to the affected KDE packages.
For affected KDE 2 systems, two patches for the 2.2.2 source code
have been made available which fixes these vulnerabilities. Contact
your OS vendor / binary package provider for information about how
to obtain updated binary packages.
People unable to upgrade to a version of KDE in which these problems
have been fixed can, as a temporary workaround, remove the following
files from their KDE installation:
thumbnail.protocol
eps.kimgio
kghostview.desktop
kdvi.desktop
After doing so KDE should be restarted. Note that this reduces KDE's
functionality in areas related to file previews, print previews and
limits the ability to handle PostScript (PS), PDF and DVI files.
