{
  "cve": "CVE-2003-0204",
  "affected_products": [
    "KDE 2.x",
    "KDE 3.x"
  ],
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from KDE's use of Ghostscript to process PostScript (PS) and PDF files. The lack of the `-dPARANOIDSAFER` or `-dSAFER` options when invoking Ghostscript allows embedded arbitrary commands within these files to be executed.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper command-line argument sanitization",
      "Unsafe processing of PostScript and PDF files"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user viewing the malicious file. This could lead to data compromise, modification, or deletion, and allow for further system compromise.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Malicious PostScript or PDF files",
      "Email attachments",
       "Webpages",
      "Files on FTP servers",
       "Files in a directory being viewed with file previews enabled"
    ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a malicious PostScript or PDF file with embedded commands and then deliver it to the victim. The victim must either open the file or browse a directory containing it with file previews enabled."
  },
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability was present in Konqueror and Kghostview. The default arguments used by KDE when executing Ghostscript did not include the necessary `-dPARANOIDSAFER` or `-dSAFER` flags which prevent the execution of arbitrary commands. The fix involves adding `-dPARANOIDSAFER` or `-dSAFER` to the default arguments when invoking Ghostscript and also addresses the issue of updating user configurations if needed."
