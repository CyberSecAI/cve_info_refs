Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies within the NASL (Nessus Attack Scripting Language) scripting engine, specifically in the handling of function parameters and buffer management within functions like `insstr()`, `scanner_add_port()`, and `ftp_log_in()`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Integer Handling Vulnerability in `insstr()`:**
    *   A negative value used as the fourth argument in `insstr()` could lead to an integer handling error which results in a segmentation fault/crash.

2.  **Buffer Overflow in `scanner_add_port()`:**
    *   A very long string supplied as the `proto` argument to `scanner_add_port()` could cause a buffer overflow.

3.  **Buffer Overflow in `ftp_log_in()`:**
    *   Very long strings used as the `user` or `pass` arguments in `ftp_log_in()` could cause a buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Crash:** Exploitation of these vulnerabilities results in a segmentation fault, causing the NASL interpreter to crash. While the provided text specifies that these issues cannot be exploited by a tested host to crash `nessusd` remotely, the crash indicates a denial of service to the NASL engine.
*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** The initial advisory from Renaud Deraison mentions the possibility of a script breaking out of its sandboxed environment and executing arbitrary commands on the `nessusd` host, though this is not described by the individual issues reported by Sir Mordred. This is mitigated by sandboxing and the plugin upload option.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Plugin Upload:** An attacker with a valid Nessus account and the ability to upload plugins to the Nessus server could upload a specially crafted plugin that uses the vulnerable functions.
*   **Specially Crafted NASL Script:**  An attacker could trick a user into running a specially crafted NASL script that triggers the vulnerabilities.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   A valid Nessus account.
*   The ability to upload plugins to the Nessus server (if the `plugins_upload` option is enabled).
*   Alternatively, the ability to trick a user into running a malicious NASL script.

**Additional details:**

* The vulnerability was reported by Sir Mordred and quickly fixed by Renaud Deraison.
* The vulnerability exists in the NASL scripting engine of Nessus versions prior to 2.0.6.
* The provided content does not explicitly mention remote code execution but does mention arbitrary command execution from a previous advisory.
* The fix is an update to Nessus 2.0.6
* A workaround was provided disabling plugin uploads by setting `plugins_upload` to `no` in `nessusd.conf`
