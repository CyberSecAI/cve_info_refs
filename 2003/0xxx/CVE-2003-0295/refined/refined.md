Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the "Preview Message" functionality of the vBulletin private messaging system. Specifically, the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when generating the preview, allowing for the injection of malicious HTML and JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is an XSS vulnerability. User-supplied input is not properly sanitized before being displayed in the "Preview Message," allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML and Javascript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** By injecting malicious JavaScript, an attacker can execute code in the context of the victim's browser.
*   **Session Hijacking:** An attacker could steal cookies or other sensitive information, potentially hijacking the victim's session.
*   **Malicious Actions:** An attacker could redirect the user to a malicious website, deface the forum, or perform other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Private Message Preview:** The attack vector is through the "Preview Message" functionality when composing a private message. The attacker crafts a message containing malicious code in the `title` field. When a user clicks "Preview Message" the unsanitized code will be executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Forum User:** The attacker needs to be a registered user of the vBulletin forum to compose and preview a private message.
*   **Crafted Input:** The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious string of HTML/JavaScript to inject into the message title.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided exploit code demonstrates how to inject JavaScript into the `title` field of a private message form, triggering the XSS vulnerability when the "Preview Message" button is clicked.
*   The vulnerability affects vBulletin 3.0.0 Beta 2, and it was stated that vBulletin 2.2 was not vulnerable.
*   The vendor (vBulletin) claims to have fixed the issue rapidly after being notified, however, the initial report mentions issues with contacting the vendor.
*   The suggested solution is to perform HTML encoding of user input, as done on the post thread preview page.
