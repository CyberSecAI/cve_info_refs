- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A buffer overflow exists in the Progress 4GL Compiler when parsing invalid datatypes. Specifically, when an invalid datatype exceeding 364 characters is provided, the compiler crashes due to an issue with `memmove()`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Buffer overflow vulnerability when handling excessively long invalid datatypes.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - On both Windows and Unix platforms, successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the compiler.
    - On Windows, this can be achieved through the Progress Application Compiler tool, especially when compiling from a directory containing a malicious .p file.
    - On Unix, the _progres binary is suid root, however it drops root privileges before executing .p files
    - It is also possible to use this vulnerability to execute malicious code on the server by providing a specially crafted .p file when using "compile on the fly" feature
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Malicious .p files: An attacker can create a specially crafted .p file with an overly long invalid datatype definition.
    - For Windows, the attacker can place the malicious .p file in a directory that the victim will attempt to compile.
    - For Unix, an attacker can convince the user to compile a malicious .p file using _progres.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to either get a user to compile a malicious file on Windows or execute the vulnerable binary on Unix with a malicious .p file.
