  "CVE-2003-0688": {
    "Metadata": {
      "Source": "Multiple",
      "Published": "2003-08-25",
      "Updated": "2003-12-30"
    },
    "Analysis": {
      "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly initialize RESOURCE_RECORD_T data structures within sendmail's DNS map implementation. Specifically, the `dns_parse_reply()` function in `sm_resolve.c` fails to initialize memory before use.",
      "Vulnerabilities": [
        "Uninitialized data structure",
         "Use of uninitialized memory"
      ],
      "Impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by sending crafted DNS responses to a vulnerable sendmail server. This can crash the sendmail daemon due to a call to `free()` on an uninitialized pointer. It may also be possible to gain arbitrary code execution if the attacker can control the uninitialized pointer.",
      "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through crafted DNS responses sent to a vulnerable sendmail server that is configured to use DNS maps (e.g., using FEATURE(`enhdnsbl`)).",
      "Attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send crafted DNS responses to the target sendmail server and needs the server to be configured to use DNS maps."
    },
    "Affected_software": [
      "Sendmail versions 8.12.x before 8.12.9.",
       "FreeBSD 4.6-RELEASE (up to -p16), 4.7-RELEASE (up to -p13), 4.8-RELEASE (up to -p3), 5.0-RELEASE (up to -p11), 4-STABLE prior to Mar 29 19:33:18 2003 UTC",
       "Mandrake Linux 8.2, 9.0, Corporate Server 2.1",
        "OpenBSD 3.2",
        "OpenPKG 1.2 <= sendmail-8.12.7-1.2.2",
         "SGI IRIX 6.5.19, 6.5.20, 6.5.21",
         "SuSE Linux 8.0, 8.1, 8.2, SuSE Linux Enterprise Server 8"
    ],
    "Patches": [
        "Upgrade to sendmail 8.12.9 or later.",
        "Apply vendor-specific patches.",
         "Disable features in sendmail that use DNS maps"
    ],
    "Additional_information": "The vulnerability was initially fixed in sendmail 8.12.9 as a bug, but wasn't labeled as a security fix at the time because its security implications weren't recognized until later. The issue affects systems that use DNS maps, which are enabled by specifying `FEATURE('enhdnsbl')` in sendmail configuration."
