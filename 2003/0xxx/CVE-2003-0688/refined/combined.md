## Sendmail fails to appropriately initialize data structures for DNS maps

#### Vulnerability Note VU#993452

Original Release Date: 2003-08-25 | Last Revised: 2003-12-30

---

### Overview

There is an uninitialized data structure in sendmail 8.12.(x < 9) servers configured to use DNS maps. An attacker able to send crafted DNS responses to affected sendmail servers may be able crash the sendmail daemon, or potentially execute arbitrary code.

### Description

| DNS maps are used in sendmail to provide a capability to dynamically look up information about a host before accepting mail from it. For example, a DNS request can be made to some site-specific authoritative source to determine whether the source of some message has previously been identified as a spam relay.  A failure to initialize RESOURCE\_RECORD\_T data structures in sendmail's implementation of DNS maps may lead to portions of memory in the sendmail process being freed in error. The error is in the dns\_parse\_reply() function in sm\_resolve.c ([patched](http://www.sendmail.org/sm_resolve.c.p1)):--- sm\_resolve.c.orig   Fri Jun 28 00:43:24 2002+++ sm\_resolve.c        Thu Jul 10 01:21:17 2003@@ -233,6 +233,7 @@\t\t\tdns\_free\_data(r);\t\t\treturn NULL;\t\t}+\t\tmemset(\*rr, 0, sizeof(\*\*rr));\t\t(\*rr)->rr\_domain = sm\_strdup(host);\t\tif ((\*rr)->rr\_domain == NULL)\t\t{A fix for this condition was made in sendmail 8.12.9 in March 2003, but it was not known to be a security issue at that time. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker may be able to cause sendmail to *free(**)* arbitrary chunks of memory. This could crash affected sendmail daemons, causing a denial of service. If an area of memory being freed is under the control of the intruder, remote execution of code with the privileges of the running daemon may be possible. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Apply patches as recommended by an appropriate vendor or upgrade to [sendmail 8.12.9](http://www.sendmail.org/8.12.9.html). |
| --- |

| In addition, disabling features in sendmail that use DNS maps will also remove one necessary precondition needed to exploit this vulnerability (e.g., disable FEATURE(`enhdnsbl') == "enhanced DNS-based blacklist lookups") . |

For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit
<URL:<http://www.freebsd.org/security/>>.

I.   Background

FreeBSD includes sendmail(8), a general purpose internetwork mail
routing facility, as the default Mail Transfer Agent (MTA).

II.  Problem Description

Some versions of sendmail (8.12.0 through 8.12.8) contain a
programming error in the code that implements DNS maps.  A malformed
DNS reply packet may cause sendmail to call `free()' on an
uninitialized pointer.

NOTE: The default sendmail configuration in FreeBSD does not utilize
DNS maps.

III. Impact

Calling `free()' on an uninitialized pointer may result in a sendmail
child process crashing.  It may also be possible for an attacker to
somehow influence the value of the `uninitialized pointer' and cause
an arbitrary memory trunk to be freed.  This could further lead to
some other exploitable vulnerability, although no such cases are known
at this time.

IV.  Workaround

Do not use DNS maps.

V.   Solution

Do one of the following:

1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to 4-STABLE, 5.1-RELEASE, or to the
RELENG\_5\_1, RELENG\_4\_8, or RELENG\_4\_7 security branch dated after the
correction date (5.1-RELEASE-p11, 4.8-RELEASE-p4, or 4.7-RELEASE-p14,
respectively).

2) To patch your present system:

The following patch has been verified to apply to FreeBSD 5.0, 4.8,
4.7, and 4.6 systems.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/patches/SA-03:11/sendmail.patch
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/patches/SA-03:11/sendmail.patch.asc

b) Execute the following commands as root:

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
# cd /usr/src/lib/libsm
# make obj && make depend && make
# cd /usr/src/lib/libsmutil
# make obj && make depend && make
# cd /usr/src/usr.sbin/sendmail
# make obj && make depend && make && make install

c) Restart sendmail.  Execute the following command as root.

# /bin/sh /etc/rc.sendmail restart

Package name:           sendmail
Advisory ID:            MDKSA-2003:086
Date:                   August 26th, 2003

Affected versions:8.2, 9.0, Corporate Server 2.1
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Problem Description:

A vulnerability was discovered in all 8.12.x versions of sendmail up to
and including 8.12.8.  Due to wrong initialization of RESOURCE\_RECORD\_T
structures, if sendmail receives a bad DNS reply it will call free() on
random addresses which usually causes sendmail to crash.

These updated packages are patched to fix the problem.

### Vendor Information

The vendor has not provided us with any further information regarding this vulnerability.

### Addendum

Text of statement for [VU#993452](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/993452) follows:
There is a potential problem in the sendmail 8.12 series with respect
to DNS maps in sendmail 8.12.8 and earlier sendmail 8.12.x versions.
The bug did not exist in versions before 8.12 as the DNS map type
is new to 8.12. The bug was fixed in 8.12.9, released March 29,
2003 but not labeled as a security fix as it wasn't believed to be
a security bug at the time. Note that only FEATURE(`enhdnsbl')
uses a DNS map. We do not have an assessment whether this problem
is exploitable but we want to inform you just in case you distribute
sendmail 8.12.x versions before 8.12.9.

OpenBSD 3.2 shipped with sendmail 8.12.8 and thus has the bug.
OpenBSD 3.3 shipped with sendmail 8.12.9 and does \*not\* have the bug.

The problem has been fixed in the OpenBSD 3.2-stable branch.
In addition, a patch is available for OpenBSD 3.2:
 ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.2/common/016\_sendmail.patch

Please note that this only affects sendmail configurations that use
the "enhdnsbl" feature. The default OpenBSD sendmail config does
\*not\* use this. Unless you have created a custom config that uses
enhdnsbl, you do not need to apply the patch or update sendmail.

If you have feedback, comments, or additional information about this vulnerability, please send us email.

Dependent Packages:  none

Description:
Oleg Bulyzhin reported to FreeBSD [1] a confirmed [2] Denial of
Service (DoS) vulnerability in all version of the Sendmail MTA [0]
earlier than 8.12.9. Due to a wrong initialization of an internal
structure, if Sendmail gets a bad DNS reply (with actual reply size
not equal the announced reply size), it later calls free() on a random
address. This usually cause Sendmail to crash.

Please check whether you are affected by running "<prefix>/bin/rpm
-q sendmail". If you have the "sendmail" package installed and its
version is affected (see above), we recommend that you immediately
upgrade it (see Solution). [3][4]

Solution:
Select the updated source RPM appropriate for your OpenPKG release
[5], fetch it from the OpenPKG FTP service [6] or a mirror location,
verify its integrity [7], build a corresponding binary RPM from it [3]
and update your OpenPKG installation by applying the binary RPM [4].
For the affected release OpenPKG 1.2, perform the following operations
to permanently fix the security problem (for other releases adjust
accordingly).

$ ftp ftp.openpkg.org
ftp> bin
ftp> cd release/1.2/UPD
ftp> get sendmail-8.12.7-1.2.3.src.rpm

$ <prefix>/bin/rpm -v --checksig sendmail-8.12.7-1.2.3.src.rpm

- -----------------------
- --- Issue Specifics ---
- -----------------------

It's been reported by sendmail.org that there is a potential problem in the
sendmail 8.12 series with respect to DNS maps in sendmail 8.12.8 and earlier
sendmail 8.12.x versions: <http://www.sendmail.org/dnsmap1.html>

SGI ships sendmail 8.12.5 with IRIX 6.5.19 and later. The bug did not exist
in versions before 8.12 as the DNS map type is new to 8.12.x versions.
This bug could potentially be exploited to cause a Denial of Service.
There may be a possibility of using it to gain remote root access.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name CAN-2003-0688 to this issue:
<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0688>

SGI has investigated the issue and recommends the following steps for
neutralizing the exposure.  It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that these measures be
implemented on ALL vulnerable SGI systems.

These issues have been corrected in patches and in future releases of IRIX.

- --------------
- --- Impact ---
- --------------

The sendmail binary is installed by default on IRIX 6.5 systems as part of
eoe.sw.base.

To determine the version of IRIX you are running, execute the following
command:

  # /bin/uname -R

That will return a result similar to the following:

  # 6.5 6.5.19f

The first number ("6.5") is the release name, the second ("6.5.16f" in this
case) is the extended release name.  The extended release name is the
"version" we refer to throughout this document.

- ----------------------------
- --- Temporary Workaround ---
- ----------------------------

There is no effective workaround available for these problems if you use dns
maps with sendmail.  SGI recommends either upgrading to IRIX 6.5.22 (when
available), or installing the appropriate patch from the listing below.

- ----------------
- --- Solution ---
- ----------------

SGI has provided a series of patches for these vulnerabilities. Our
recommendation is to upgrade to IRIX 6.5.22 (when available), or install the
appropriate patch.

**DNS map problem in 8.12.x before 8.12.9**

There is a potential problem in sendmail 8.12.8 and earlier sendmail 8.12.x versions with respect to DNS maps. The bug did not exist in versions before 8.12 as the DNS map type is new to 8.12. The bug was fixed in 8.12.9, released March 29, 2003 but not labeled as a security fix as it wasn't believed to be a security bug:

 Properly initialize data structure for dns maps to avoid various
 errors, e.g., looping processes. Problem noted by
 Maurice Makaay of InterNLnet B.V.

Note that only FEATURE(`enhdnsbl') uses a DNS map. We do not have an assessment whether this problem is exploitable, however, if you use a DNS map and an 8.12 version older than 8.12.9, then either upgrade (strongly recommended) or apply the trivial patch given below.

This problem has been [reported to FreeBSD](http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=bin/54367) by Oleg Bulyzhin, see

Here's a quote from the [report](http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=bin/54367):

1)  problem description, brief discussion, solution, upgrade information

The well known and widely used MTA sendmail is vulnerable to a
remote denial-of-service attack in version 8.12.8 and earlier (but not
before 8.12). The bug exists in the DNS map code. This feature is
enabled by specifying FEATURE(`enhdnsbl').
When sendmail receives an invalid DNS response it tries to call free(3)
on random data which results in a process crash.

After your system was updated you have to restart your sendmail daemon
to make the update effective.

There is no known workaround for this vulnerability other than using a
different MTA.

Please download the update package for your distribution and verify its
integrity by the methods listed in section 3) of this announcement.
Then, install the package using the command "rpm -Fhv file.rpm" to apply
the update.
Our maintenance customers are being notified individually. The packages
are being offered to install from the maintenance web.

2)  Pending vulnerabilities in SuSE Distributions and Workarounds:

- traceroute(-nanog)
A integer overflow in traceroute can be abused by local attackers
to gain access to a raw IP socket.
New packages are available on out FTP servers.

- gdm2
Due to a bug in GDM it is possible for local users to read any text
file on a system by creating a symlink from ~/.xsession-errors.
Updated packages will be available on our FTP servers soon.

- pam\_smb
A buffer overflow in the password handling function of pam\_smb
allows remote root compromise.
Fixed packages will be available soon.

- exim
Two bugs where fixed in exim. One bug allows remote access as user
mail/mail and the other one allows local root access for 'Admin Users'.
Fixed packages are available on our FTP servers.

3)  standard appendix: authenticity verification, additional information

- Package authenticity verification:

SuSE update packages are available on many mirror ftp servers all over
the world. While this service is being considered valuable and important
to the free and open source software community, many users wish to be
sure about the origin of the package and its content before installing
the package. There are two verification methods that can be used
independently from each other to prove the authenticity of a downloaded
file or rpm package:
1) md5sums as provided in the (cryptographically signed) announcement.
2) using the internal gpg signatures of the rpm package.

1) execute the command
md5sum <name-of-the-file.rpm>
after you downloaded the file from a SuSE ftp server or its mirrors.
Then, compare the resulting md5sum with the one that is listed in the
announcement. Since the announcement containing the checksums is
cryptographically signed (usually using the key security@suse.de),
the checksums show proof of the authenticity of the package.
We disrecommend to subscribe to security lists which cause the
email message containing the announcement to be modified so that
the signature does not match after transport through the mailing
list software.
Downsides: You must be able to verify the authenticity of the
announcement in the first place. If RPM packages are being rebuilt
and a new version of a package is published on the ftp server, all
md5 sums for the files are useless.

2) rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the authenticity
of an rpm package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, where <file.rpm> is the
filename of the rpm package that you have downloaded. Of course,
package authenticity verification can only target an un-installed rpm
package file.
Prerequisites:
a) gpg is installed
b) The package is signed using a certain key. The public part of this
key must be installed by the gpg program in the directory
~/.gnupg/ under the user's home directory who performs the
signature verification (usually root). You can import the key
that is used by SuSE in rpm packages for SuSE Linux by saving
this announcement to a file ("announcement.txt") and
running the command (do "su -" to be root):
gpg --batch; gpg < announcement.txt | gpg --import
SuSE Linux distributions version 7.1 and thereafter install the
key "build@suse.de" upon installation or upgrade, provided that
the package gpg is installed. The file containing the public key
is placed at the top-level directory of the first CD (pubring.gpg)
and at ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/suse/pubring.gpg-build.suse.de .

- SuSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:

suse-security@suse.com
-   general/linux/SuSE security discussion.
All SuSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an email to
<suse-security-subscribe@suse.com>.

suse-security-announce@suse.com
-   SuSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SuSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an email to
<suse-security-announce-subscribe@suse.com>.

For general information or the frequently asked questions (faq)
send mail to:
<suse-security-info@suse.com> or
<suse-security-faq@suse.com> respectively.

Sendmail Open Source

# Sendmail Open Source

## Email Security and Threat Protection

---

The sendmail Sentrion platform is specifically designed for large, complex environments, but we make a subset of that solution available as an open-source offering. Sentrion is not for everyone, but if you are using open source email for a large complex environment and need an enterprise platform that will enable your messaging roadmap for years to come (virtualization, consolidation, cloud migration, etc.), [speak with a specialist](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/contact) to see if Sendmail Sentrion is right for you.

[Frequently Asked Questions](/us/sendmail/faq)

### Current Sendmail Open Source Release

Sendmail [8.18.1](https://ftp.sendmail.org/sendmail.8.18.1.tar.gz) is available from [ftp.sendmail.org](https://ftp.sendmail.org/). The release has a [gzipped tar](https://ftp.sendmail.org/sendmail.8.18.1.tar.gz) file and a [PGP signature](https://ftp.sendmail.org/sendmail.8.18.1.tar.gz.sig) file. The compressed/gzipped tar files are [signed](#Signing_Keys) by the [2024 signing key](https://www.proofpoint.com/sites/default/files/signing-keys/sendmail2024.asc). See the Security and PGP Signing Keys section for more information about how releases are signed.

### Signing Keys

Security advisories are issued by The Computer Emergency Response Team [CERT](http://www.cert.org/). Sendmail server related security problems should be sent to:

**sendmail-security-*YYYY*@support.sendmail.org**

Replace YYYY with the current year, e.g., 2015. This address is only for reporting security problems in sendmail. When reporting security problems, please use PGP-the public key is available in the file PGPKEYS of the sendmail distribution.

**Please do not use this address to report problems that are not related to the security of the sendmail server.**Questions about [avoiding spam risk](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-reference/spam), how to set up your own certificate authorities, etc. should be posted in comp.mail.sendmail, and Unix-related security in the comp.security.unix newsgroup.

All sendmail distributions are signed with a PGP key named "Sendmail Signing Key/*YYYY*" where *YYYY* is the year of release.

### Contact Us

These addresses are for contributing patches or reporting problems about V8 sendmail. The members of these lists do not have the resources to support vendor versions. Before sending to any of these addresses, please check the [FAQ](/us/sendmail/faq "Sendmail FAQ") and the files README, sendmail/README (on this web-site as Compiling Sendmail) and cf/README (on this web-site as the Configuration README pages) to see if they are already answered; about half of the questions received can be answered in this way.

**Notes**

* Do not send us mail in HTML format, use plain text only (even multipart/alternative with an HTML part will be classified as spam by some of our members and hence an answer will most likely be delayed).
* Do not use 8bit characters in the Subject: nor use some encoding, e.g., =?GB2312?B?, but only plain 7bit ASCII without any charset encoding.
* If you send e-mail to sendmail.org, the answer will most likely not come from a system in the sendmail.org domain. If you use some anti-spam techniques (e.g., challenge-response systems) or you block hosts that are connected via DSL then please do not expect an answer. More and more often replies are blocked which is very annoying. Do not block this address or make sure that your system accepts at least STARTTLS secured mail. A list of IPs is available in the sendmail.org SPF record.
* If you use a challenge/response system, make sure that it does NOT send us a challenge when we reply to your question or when you receive mail from the announce list. We will not reply to those annoying mails.
* If you are using the blacklist from spamlist.org then please do not send us e-mail, the reply of the sendmail maintainer will not reach you.
* Do not send us mail in proprietary formats.
* The mailservers for support.sendmail.org now (2004-11-24) use the following DNSBLs:
  + sbl-xbl.spamhaus.org
  + dnsbl.sorbs.net
  + list.dsbl.org
  + bl.spamcop.net
* The mailserver for support.sendmail.org performs strict RFC checks, for example, it does not accept mail if the domain part has an [MX record](/us/threat-reference/mx-record "MX Record") that points to an IP address (instead of hostname as required).

If you have a question about sendmail, then please post it to the Usenet group comp.mail.sendmail. This newsgroup is dedicated to sendmail. Please make sure you check the usual resources before posting and follow the netiquette.

E-mail addresses to contact sendmail.org are (do *not* send questions about sendmail to these addresses, see above instead; replace YYYY with the current year, e.g., 2006, in all of these addresses):

* sendmail-YYYY@support.sendmail.org for contributing patches, feature requests, and general comments but not questions how to use, install, or configure sendmail;
* sendmail-bugs-YYYY@support.sendmail.org to report implementation bugs;
* sendmail-faq-YYYY@support.sendmail.org only for comments / questions about the FAQ. Please mark your mail clearly with "FAQ: item" where item is the entry in the faq to which you are referring. If it is a general comment about the FAQ, use "FAQ: general", if it is an addition, use "FAQ: new".
* sendmail-security-YYYY@support.sendmail.org (use this only to report related bugs or problems in sendmail). Please do not use this to ask about problems with your configuration, including how to stop spam, how to set up your own certificate authority, how to make sendmail work with S/MIME, etc. All such questions should be asked in comp.mail.sendmail. Also, please do not tell us that you were able to forge mail by using telnet to connect to port 25; this is fundamental to the Internet design for [SMTP](/us/threat-reference/smtp-relay "SMTP Relay"), and not a sendmail bug. Please use encryption to send mail to this address.
* sendmail-mirror-YYYY@support.sendmail.org for updates about a mirror (e.g., a new mirror or an address change).
* webmaster-YYYY@support.sendmail.org for comments about the website.

These are not open lists, meaning that subscription is by invitation only.

### DKIM

The [Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM)](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/corporate-blog/post/what-is-dkim) Internet standard enables email senders to digitally sign their messages so that receivers can verify that those messages have not been forged. The DKIM sender authentication scheme allows the recipient of a message to confirm a message originated with the sender’s domain and that the message content has not been altered. A cryptography-based solution, DKIM provides businesses an industry-standard method for mitigating [email fraud](/us/products/email-protection/email-fraud-defense "Email Fraud Defense") and [protecting an organization’s brand](/us/solutions/digital-risk/digital-brand-protection "Digital Brand Protection") and reputation at a relatively low implementation cost.

DKIM has been approved by the IETF as a draft standard (RFC 4871). The protocol was developed through the cooperation of Sendmail, Cisco Systems and Yahoo!

Since being approved by the IETF, a new open source project was started. The OpenDKIM Project is a community effort to develop and maintain a C library for producing DKIM-aware applications and an open source milter for providing DKIM service.

The project started from a code fork of version 2.8.3 of the open source [dkim-milter](http://sourceforge.net/projects/dkim-milter/) package developed and maintained by Sendmail, Inc.

The Sendmail [Sentrion Message Processing Engine](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/products/email-protection/open-source-email-solution) comes standard with OpenDKIM. More information is available at [opendkim.org](http://opendkim.org/) and [dkim.org](http://dkim.org/)

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.
