The provided content describes two vulnerabilities in `gkrellm-newsticker`. This response focuses on CVE-2003-0206.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way `gkrellm-newsticker` parses RDF files. Specifically, it crashes when the `link` or `title` elements within the RDF file are not entirely on a single line. The parsing logic in `newsticker.c` uses functions like `strchr` and `strstr` to locate the start and end tags of these elements. When the tags span multiple lines, these functions can return NULL, leading to memory allocation errors which crash the program.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper handling of multi-line `link` and `title` elements in RDF feeds.
- Lack of robust error handling in the parsing routine, leading to a crash when encountering unexpected data formats.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): A malicious attacker can craft an RDF file with multi-line `link` or `title` elements to crash the `gkrellm-newsticker` plugin and the entire `gkrellm` system.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker must be able to provide a crafted RDF file to the `gkrellm-newsticker`. This typically involves the user subscribing to a malicious news feed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to control or influence the content of the RDF feed that the victim subscribes to. The attacker can host a malicious feed or inject malicious content into a legitimate feed.
