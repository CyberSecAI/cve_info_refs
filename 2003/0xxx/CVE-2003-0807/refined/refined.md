Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2003-0807:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in how Microsoft's COM Internet Services (CIS) and Remote Procedure Call (RPC) over HTTP Proxy components handle responses to forwarded requests. Specifically, when a request is forwarded to a backend system via these components, an attacker can send a specially crafted response.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Improper input validation/handling of responses by CIS and RPC over HTTP Proxy components.
- The components do not properly handle a crafted response, leading to a state where they stop accepting future requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful attack leads to the vulnerable component (CIS or RPC over HTTP proxy) becoming unresponsive and unable to accept new requests. This effectively denies service to legitimate users relying on these components.
- In a DoS condition, the system could stop responding, requiring a manual restart of the affected services/components.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network-based:** The attacker sends a specially crafted response over the network to a system running a vulnerable version of CIS or RPC over HTTP proxy. The crafted response is sent in reply to a forwarded request to a backend system.
- The attacker can either control the backend system and send a malicious response directly, or intercept traffic locally and send a malicious response on behalf of the backend.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the targeted system. This can be from a remote location, within the same network, or locally.
- **Man-in-the-middle:** If attacking through intercepting traffic, attacker needs to be positioned to intercept or monitor traffic.
- **For NT 4.0 and Windows 2000:** The attacker can be anonymous as long as they can send the malicious response
- **For Windows Server 2003:** The attacker needs to provide valid logon credentials as well in order to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Knowledge of the protocol and data:** The attacker needs to know how to craft a malicious response that will trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is present in Windows NT Server 4.0, Windows NT Server 4.0 Terminal Server Edition, Windows 2000, and Windows Server 2003.
- The affected components (CIS or RPC over HTTP Proxy) typically listen on ports 80 and 443.
- The vulnerability is not enabled by default; it requires manual enabling of the vulnerable components or vulnerable configuration by the administrator.
- On Windows Server 2003, the vulnerability is only exposed if IIS 5.0 compatibility mode is enabled, which is not the default configuration.
- Microsoft Security Bulletin MS04-012 provides a patch to resolve the issue.
