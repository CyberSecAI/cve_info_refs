- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient bounds checking of the `-player` command-line argument in `/usr/bin/Maelstrom`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists when the `-player` argument is excessively long.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can overwrite the return address on the stack, leading to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running Maelstrom.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by providing an overly long string as the argument to the `-player` option of the Maelstrom executable.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to execute the vulnerable Maelstrom binary locally and provide command-line arguments.
