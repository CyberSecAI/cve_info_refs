Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability lies in the way PCAnywhere's help interface interacts with the Windows operating system's help function. When PCAnywhere runs in service mode (with SYSTEM privileges), the help interface inherits those elevated privileges. A flaw in how this interface is implemented allows a non-privileged user to manipulate the help function to gain SYSTEM level access. This is related to a flaw in the Win32 help API that allows help functionality to assume permissions from PCAnywhere.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A local, non-privileged user can escalate their privileges to SYSTEM.
*   **Insecure Help Interface:** The PCAnywhere help interface improperly uses the Windows help function, inheriting the privileges of the PCAnywhere process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full System Access:** An attacker can gain full control of the local system by manipulating the help interface and gaining SYSTEM privileges.
*   **Data Breach:** The attacker can access, modify, or delete any files on the local machine.
*   **Administrative Control:** An attacker could add themselves to the local administrators group, gaining persistent control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have a local user account on the target machine.
*   **Interactive Login:** The attacker must be able to interactively log in to the system.
*   **PCAnywhere in Service Mode:** The PCAnywhere host service must be running in service mode.
*   **Help Interface Manipulation:** The attacker exploits the vulnerable help interface within the PCAnywhere GUI.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local user account:** The attacker needs a standard user account on the system where PCAnywhere is installed.
*   **Interactive Access:** The attacker must be able to log into the system interactively.
*   **PCAnywhere configuration awareness:** The attacker needs to know that PCAnywhere is running in service mode.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to PCAnywhere running in service mode. It is not exploitable when running in application mode.
*   The attacker cannot use this vulnerability to gain remote access to other machines through PCAnywhere.
*   Symantec was responsive and released a patch via LiveUpdate.
*   The vulnerability is based on a known flaw in the Win32 Help API (referenced as [http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/8884](http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/8884)).
