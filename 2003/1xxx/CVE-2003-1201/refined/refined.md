The provided content relates to CVE-2003-1201.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a coding error in the `ldbm_back_exop_passwd` function of the OpenLDAP server (slapd).
- If the `slap_passwd_parse` function returns an error (something not equal to LDAP_SUCCESS), the code attempts to free the `ndn->bv_val` pointer. However, under certain conditions, this `ndn->bv_val` pointer might not have been initialized, leading to a double-free or use-after-free condition.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use of uninitialized memory: The code tries to free memory that has not been allocated/initialized.
- Double free/use-after-free: If an attacker manages to trigger this code path, the program will attempt to free memory that was never allocated, leading to a crash or undefined behavior.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The primary impact is that an attacker can crash the OpenLDAP server (slapd) by sending a specially crafted password modify request, leading to a denial of service for legitimate users.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is a specially crafted LDAP password modify extended operation request. The attacker does not need to authenticate, but it does need to send the request to an open port.
- The vulnerability is triggered by a failed password extended operation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the OpenLDAP server, indicating a remote attack.
- The attacker does not need specific privileges to exploit the vulnerability. It can be triggered by any user that can send this type of request to the server.
