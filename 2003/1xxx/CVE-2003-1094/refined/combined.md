## BEA WebLogic Server code execution paths may cause the current user to be incorrect

#### Vulnerability Note VU#999788

Original Release Date: 2003-08-05 | Last Revised: 2003-08-05

---

### Overview

A vulnerability in BEA WebLogic Server and Express may allow a local attacker to gain elevated privileges.

### Description

| BEA Systems describes [WebLogic Server](http://www.bea.com/framework.jsp?CNT=index.htm&FP=/content/products/server) as "an industrial-strength application infrastructure for developing, integrating, securing, and managing distributed Java applications." A vulnerability in BEA WebLogic Server and Express may allow a local attacker to gain elevated privileges. Quoting from [BEA03-35.00](http://dev2dev.bea.com/resourcelibrary/advisoriesnotifications/BEA03-35.jsp):  Certain code execution paths can cause the current user to be incorrect. This is most likely to happen when JNDI initial contexts are used repeatedly to log users in but can even occur in programs that never explicitly execute a login. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A local attacker may be able to gain elevated privileges. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Apply a patch. BEA Systems also notes "*When Service Pack 4 is available, you can use that Service Pack instead of this patch.*" |
| --- |

# Oracle WebLogic Server

Oracle WebLogic Server is a unified and extensible platform for developing, deploying, and running enterprise applications in Java for on-premises and in the cloud. WebLogic Server offers a robust, mature, and scalable implementation of Jakarta EE.

**WebLogic Server on Kubernetes**

Oracle WebLogic Server is fully supported on Kubernetes and enables users to migrate and efficiently build modern container apps with comprehensive Java services. Check out the WebLogic Kubernetes Toolkit, a complete set of open source tools that simplifies running on Kubernetes, on-premises, or in the cloud.

[Learn about the ToolKit](//blogs.oracle.com/weblogicserver/weblogic-kubernetes-toolkit-update-operator-3)

**Run WebLogic applications in the cloud**

With rapid provisioning and choice of infrastructure and pricing, Oracle WebLogic Server for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) provides full support to run Jakarta EE applications in the cloud.

[Learn about the features](//blogs.oracle.com/weblogicserver/announcing-oracle-weblogic-server-for-oracle-cloud-infrastructure)

### Why build with Oracle WebLogic Server?

#### Full Jakarta EE implementation

Jakarta EE provides a powerful combination of technologies and APIs that focus on ease of enterprise application development and management.

#### Application modernization reduces time to market

The WebLogic Kubernetes Toolkit enables users to easily deploy their WebLogic Server domains and applications in Kubernetes. Rich management tooling and APIs automate operations, while autoscaling and auto-restarts of failed nodes ensure high availability. Achieve greater agility through the use of integrated, open source tooling when existing WebLogic Server applications move to Kubernetes or leverage Helidon to run microservices in a portable way.
