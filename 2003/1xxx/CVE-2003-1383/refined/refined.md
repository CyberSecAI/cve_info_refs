Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The web application `web-erp 0.1.4` and earlier versions expose the `logicworks.ini` configuration file through HTTP requests. This file contains the MySQL username and password used by the application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The application fails to properly protect its configuration file, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive credentials.
*   **Insecure Configuration:** The database credentials are stored in a plain text configuration file accessible via a web request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full Database Access:** An attacker who obtains the MySQL username and password can connect directly to the database.
*   **Data Manipulation:**  The attacker can then add, modify, and delete data within the database. This could include sensitive financial and company information.
*   **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact:** The vulnerability has a partial impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Access:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable via a web request.
*   **Direct HTTP Request:** An attacker can simply request the `logicworks.ini` file using a web browser or a similar tool.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the server hosting the web application.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker only needs to be able to make a basic HTTP request. No authentication is required.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is rated as high risk with a CVSS base score of 7.5.
*   The vendor was notified and quickly released a fix in version 0.1.5.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Ryan Fox
*   The exploitability subscore is 10, indicating how easily this vulnerability can be exploited
