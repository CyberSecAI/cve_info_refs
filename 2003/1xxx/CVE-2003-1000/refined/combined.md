GENTOO LINUX SECURITY ANNOUNCEMENT 200312-06
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

GLSA:        200312-06
Package:     net-irc/xchat
Summary:     Malformed dcc send requests in xchat-2.0.6 lead to a denial of
             service
Severity:    medium
Gentoo bug:  35623
Date:        2003-12-14
CVE:         none
Exploit:     remote
Affected:    =2.0.6
Fixed:       >=2.0.6-r1

DESCRIPTION:

There is a remotely exploitable bug in xchat 2.0.6 that could lead to a denial
of service attack.  This is caused by sending a malformed DCC packet to xchat
2.0.6, causing it to crash.  Versions prior to 2.0.6 do not appear to be
affected by this bug.

For more information, please see:

<http://mail.nl.linux.org/xchat-announce/2003-12/msg00000.html>

SOLUTION:

For Gentoo users, xchat-2.0.6 was marked ~arch (unstable) for most
architectures. Since it was never marked as stable in the portage tree, only
xchat users who have explictly added the unstable keyword to ACCEPT_KEYWORDS
are affected. Users may updated affected machines to the patched version of
xchat using the following commands:

emerge sync
emerge -pv '>=net-irc/xchat-2.0.6-r1'
emerge '>=net-irc/xchat-2.0.6-r1'
emerge clean
