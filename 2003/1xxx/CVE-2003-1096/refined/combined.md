## Cisco Lightweight Extensible Authentication Protocol (LEAP) uses passwords that are vulnerable to dictionary attacks

#### Vulnerability Note VU#473108

Original Release Date: 2003-10-30 | Last Revised: 2004-05-20

---

### Overview

The Cisco LEAP protocol uses hashed passwords that are vulnerable to dictionary attacks. Successful attackers will be able to gain unauthorized access to affected networks.

### Description

| The Cisco Lightweight Extensible Authentication Protocol (LEAP) provides an authentication mechanism for IEEE 802.1X wireless clients. The protocol uses passwords to provide authentication between wireless clients and networks and allows both parties to exchange key material for dynamically-generated WEP session keys. Passwords sent over the network are hashed twice using the MD4 algorithm, which prevents casual eavesdroppers from reversing the hashed contents and recovering the original password  The Cisco LEAP protocol is vulnerable to dictionary attacks against users' passwords. Using readily available software, weak passwords can be cracked in a matter of minutes, so it is essential for users to choose good passwords. This vulnerability is common among password-based authentications schemes, and the best protection against this type of attack is to set and enforce password checking policies. For more information on what constitutes a "good" password, please see the CERT/CC Tech Tip, [UNIX Configuration Guidelines](http://www.cert.org/tech_tips/unix_configuration_guidelines.html#A). |
| --- |

### Impact

| Attackers can conduct off-line dictionary attacks against passwords, then use cracked passwords to gain unauthorized access to affected networks. |
| --- |

### Solution

| The CERT/CC is currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem. |
| --- |

| **Set and Enforce Password Checking Policies**Site administrators are encouraged to regularly check users' passwords and enforce policies that promote strong passwords. This includes such measures as requiring regular password changes, testing proposed passwords before accepting them, and maintaining a password history to prevent users from reusing passwords.**Use Alternate EAP Authentication Mechanisms**The Cisco LEAP is one of several EAP authentication mechanisms available for IEEE 802.1X networks. Cisco has introduced the EAP-FAST authentication mechanism to address this vulnerability; for more information, please see the [Cisco Bulletin](http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sn-20030802-leap.shtml). Sites that require restricted access networks should evaluate all available options for authentication. |

      Cisco Security Notice: Dictionary Attack on Cisco LEAP Vulnerability

Revision 2.0

Summary

   Cisco LEAP is a mutual authentication algorithm that supports dynamic
   derivation of session keys. With Cisco LEAP, mutual authentication relies
   on a shared secret, the user's logon password-which is known by the client
   and the network, and is used to respond to challenges between the user and
   the Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) server.

   As with most password-based authentication algorithms, Cisco LEAP is
   vulnerable to dictionary attacks.

   Cisco has now announced the availability of EAP-Flexible Authentication
   via Secure Tunneling (EAP-FAST) for users who wish to deploy an 802.1X
   Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) type that does not require
   digital certificates and is not vulnerable to dictionary attacks.

   This notice will be posted at
   <http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sn-20030802-leap.shtml>.

Details

   At DEFCON, on August 3, 2003, a presentation by Joshua Wright explored
   mechanisms that could make it easier for someone to write a tool to launch
   an offline dictionary attack on password-based authentications that
   leverage Microsoft MS-CHAP, such as Cisco LEAP. The source code of the
   dictionary attack tool called "asleap" was released on April 6, 2004.

   During a dictionary attack, variations of passwords are used to compromise
   a user's authentication credentials. Most password-based authentication
   algorithms are vulnerable to dictionary attacks in the absence of a strong
   password policy.

   Cisco developed EAP-FAST for users who wish to deploy an 802.1X EAP type
   that does not require digital certificates and is not vulnerable to
   dictionary attacks.

Workarounds

   Creating a strong password policy is the most effective way to mitigate
   against dictionary attacks. This includes using strong passwords and
   periodically expiring passwords. Cisco recommends that customers review
   their security policies and incorporate the best practices outlined in the
   802.11 Wireless LAN Security White Paper -
   <http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/cc/pd/witc/ao1200ap/prodlit/wswpf_wp.htm>
   (refer to section 5.2 "Cisco LEAP Deployment").

   Users could migrate to another EAP type like EAP-FAST, PEAP or EAP-TLS
   whose authentication methods are not susceptible to dictionary attacks.

     \* EAP-FAST is an authentication protocol that creates a secure tunnel
       without using certificates.
     \* PEAP is a hybrid authentication protocol that creates a secured TLS
       tunnel between the WLAN user and the RADIUS server to authenticate the
       user to the network. This requires certificate and public key
       infrastructure (PKI) management on both RADIUS servers and WLAN
       clients.
     \* EAP-TLS uses pre-issued digital certificates to authenticate a user to
       the network. This requires certificate and PKI management on both
       RADIUS servers and WLAN clients.

Status of This Notice: Final

   This is a final notice. Although Cisco cannot guarantee the accuracy of
   all statements in this notice, all of the facts have been checked to the
   best of our ability. Cisco does not anticipate issuing updated versions of
   this notice unless there is some material change in the facts. Should
   there be a significant change in the facts, Cisco may update this notice.

   A stand-alone copy or paraphrase of the text of this security notice that
   omits the distribution URL in the following section is an uncontrolled
   copy, and may lack important information or contain factual errors.

In August 2003, I wrote a tool called asleap for Linux systems to
exploit a weakness in the Cisco LEAP authentication protocol.  Using
this tool, an attacker can actively compromise Cisco LEAP networks
by mounting an offline dictionary attack against weak user
passwords.  In my testing, I was able to search through large
dictionary files very quickly for user passwords (~45 million
passwords per second on meager hardware.)

A quick summary of asleap features are as follows:

+ Can read live from any wireless interface in RFMON mode with
   libpcap.
+ Can monitor a single channel, or perform channel hopping to look
   for target networks running LEAP.
+ Will actively deauthenticate users on LEAP networks, forcing them
   to reauthenticate.  This makes the capture of LEAP passwords very
   fast.
+ Will only deauth users who have not already been seen, doesn't
   waste time on users who are not running LEAP.
+ Can read from stored libpcap files, or AiroPeek NX files (1.X or
   2.X files).
+ Uses a dynamic database table and index to make lookups on large
   files very fast.  Reduces the worst-case search time to .0015% as
   opposed to lookups in a flat file.
+ Can write *just* the LEAP exchange information to a libpcap file.
   This could be used to capture LEAP credentials with a device short
   on disk space (like an iPaq), and then process the LEAP
   credentials stored in the libpcap file on a system with more
   storage resources to mount the dictionary attack.

Upon advising the Cisco PSIRT team, I was asked to wait for six
months until February 2004 before making the tool publicly
available.  In the end of January 2004, Cisco PSIRT asked me to wait
another few months while they finished testing the EAP-FAST
protocol, the designated replacement for the flawed LEAP protocol.

After working out a release date with Cisco, I am making the source
for asleap v1.0 available including a partial-functionality Win32
port.  I encourage LEAP users to install and use asleap to evaluate
the risks of using LEAP as a mechanism to protect the security of
wireless networks.

Windows users can use third-party wireless sniffer tools including
AiroPeek NX to capture the LEAP authentication exchange to test the
security of LEAP user passwords.

The source and Win32 binary distribution are available at
<http://asleap.sourceforge.net>, along with documentation and a
user-support mailing list.  I welcome your comments, suggestions or
bug reports.
