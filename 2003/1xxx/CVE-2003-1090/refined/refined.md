Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- Insufficient bounds checking in the code responsible for setting the program's title bar. This lack of validation allows for a buffer overflow when the title string exceeds the allocated buffer size.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the title bar setting function of AbsoluteTelnet.
- The application stores the SSH login and password in plaintext in memory throughout the session, which can be a separate weakness.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: An attacker can overwrite the return address (EIP) on the stack by overflowing the buffer used for the window title, allowing them to execute malicious code.
- Potential disclosure of sensitive information: An attacker might be able to recover SSH login/password credentials from memory.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious server operator:** A malicious server operator can send a crafted title string to the client that overflows the buffer.
- **Enticing the user:** An attacker can trick a user into viewing a file containing the malicious escape sequence for setting the title bar.
- **Meta refresh exploit:** A meta-refresh tag in a webpage redirecting to a telnet URI with a crafted title can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to send data to the vulnerable client: An attacker needs to be able to send a specially crafted string to the AbsoluteTelnet client. This could be done via a malicious server, a manipulated file, or a crafted URL.
- Knowledge of the escape sequence to set the title bar.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by sending the escape sequence `\033]0;` followed by a long string.
- Overwriting 174 bytes results in EIP being set to 0x0.
- Overwriting 296 bytes results in EBP/EIP being set to 0x41414141 (AAAA), allowing for the execution of attacker-controlled code.
- AbsoluteTelnet 2.00 is vulnerable.
- AbsoluteTelnet 2.11 is also vulnerable, but the buffer is converted to unicode, which makes direct exploitation slightly more complicated.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability was discovered by Knud Erik HÃ¸jgaard.
- A proof of concept exploit is publicly available.
- Vendor provided a fix in a beta version.
