The provided content is related to CVE-2003-1095.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The BEA WebLogic Server fails to discard cached authentication information when a web application is updated using "dynamic redeployment".

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The server stores user authentication information for future sessions.
- This stored information is not erased when a web application is updated.
- This allows users who authenticated before the update to bypass authentication after the update, even if the update changes the authentication mechanism.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Remote users can bypass the authentication mechanism of a given web application. This can lead to unauthorized access to the web application after an update that changes its security policies.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker would need to have previously authenticated to the web application prior to a dynamic redeployment/update that changes the security/authentication policy, then attempt to access the application again after the update.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker must have been a legitimate user of the web application before it was updated with a new authentication policy.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is especially significant if the update to a web application changes its authentication mechanism.
- BEA Systems Inc. published Security Advisory BEA03-27.00 to address this vulnerability.
