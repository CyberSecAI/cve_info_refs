## Apple QuickTime/Darwin Streaming Server integer overflow in MP3Broadcaster utility

#### Vulnerability Note VU#148564

Original Release Date: 2003-12-23 | Last Revised: 2003-12-23

---

### Overview

Apple's QuickTime and Darwin Streaming Server (DSS) package includes a utility called MP3Broadcaster. This utility contains an integer overflow which may be exploited to cause a denial of service.

### Description

| Apple's QuickTime and Darwin Streaming Server is software which provides integrated distribution of various forms of digital content. Such content can be delivered over a network using Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) and Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP). Streaming media content can include files encoded in QuickTime, MPEG, and MP3 formats. A utility package called MP3Broadcaster contains an integer overflow vulnerability. Like buffer overflows, an integer overflow may be exploited to cause affected software to crash. Under certain circumstances, an integer overflow has the potential to be allow an attacker to exploit arbitrary code, but in this case, does not appear possible.  The integer overflow in MP3Broadcaster in DSS 4.1.3 is triggered when parsing malformed ID3 tags within crafted MP3 files. This vulnerability only has the potential to be exploited by remote attackers if they can get vulnerable servers to parse malicious MP3 files (i.e., by uploading a file). |
