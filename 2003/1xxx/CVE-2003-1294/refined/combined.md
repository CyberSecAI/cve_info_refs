| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=182286#c0)  Mark J. Cox    2006-02-21 17:03:19 UTC  ``` Stan Bubrouski contacted jwz the maintainer of xscreensaver         and cc'd Red Hat security folks on 20031031 to report an         insecure temporary file flaw introduced in xscreensaver         version 4.14.  This was due to a bit of debugging code that         got left in by mistake, it was removed in 4.15, and therefore         didn't affect any RHEL releases.  This was [CVE-2003-0885](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2003-0885).  However SUSE then found some other suspect temporary file issues which also got silently fixed in 4.15 release.  I've applied for a CVE name for these.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=182286#c1)  Mark J. Cox    2006-02-21 17:03:19 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 124968](attachment.cgi?id=124968&action=diff "Proposed patch as used by SUSE") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=124968&action=edit "Proposed patch as used by SUSE") Proposed patch as used by SUSE   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=182286#c4)  Jiri Pallich    2012-06-20 13:24:42 UTC  ``` Thank you for submitting this issue for consideration in Red Hat Enterprise Linux. The release for which you requested us to review is now End of Life.  Please See <https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/>  If you would like Red Hat to re-consider your feature request for an active release, please re-open the request via appropriate support channels and provide additional supporting details about the importance of this issue.   ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

xscreensaver security update (RHSA-2006-0498)

Original Release Date: June 5, 2006

Last Revised: February 14, 2008

Number: ASA-2006-107

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 5.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

XScreenSaver is a set of screensavers and a screensaver framework for the X
Window System.

XScreenSaver was found to contain a bug where it did not always ensure that
it correctly had the keyboard focus when the screensaver was active. As a
result, it was possible that a user's password could end up being leaked to
the program that had the keyboard focus. This was found to be an uncommon
issue only certain application combinations with XScreenSaver caused this
issue. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name
[CVE-2004-2655](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2004-2655) to this issue.

XScreenSaver was found to have numerous bugs in temporary file creation.
These bugs could possibly allow a local attacker to create a specialy
crafted temporary file that might overwrite different files that the user
running XScreenSaver has write permissions to. The Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2003-1294](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2003-1294) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security
advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2006-0498.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with xscreensaver installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Intuity AUDIX LX | IALX 1.x | Low | Update to IALX 2.0 or later. |
| Avaya Messaging Storage Server | MSS 1.x - 2.x | Low | Upgrade to MSS 3.0 or later. |
| Avaya Message Networking | MN 1.x - 3.0 | Low | Update to MN 3.1 or later. |

**Recommended Actions:**
For all system products which use vulnerable
versions of XScreenSaver, Avaya recommends that customers restrict local and
network access to the server. This restriction should be enforced through
the use of physical security, firewalls, ACLs, VPNs, and other
generally-accepted networking practices until such time as an update becomes
available and can be installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating
system or applications that come with the operating system. These
vulnerabilities often do not impact the software-only product directly but
may threaten the integrity of the underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by
the vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers should determine on which Linux operating system the product was
installed and then follow that vendors guidance:

## 4. Software-Only Products:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Interactive Response(IR) | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected packages may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IR application. The IR application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| CVLAN | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected packages may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. The CVLAN application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite(IMS) | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected packages may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. The IMS application does not require the software described in this advisory. |

**Recommended Actions:**
Avaya recommends that customers follow
recommended actions supplied by the Operating System vendor (e.g. RedHat
Linux) or remove the affected packages.

openSUSE offers a continuous stream of software security patches for your product. The update applet informs you about the availability of patches and lets you easily install them with just a few clicks.

  + [4.1 Installing Patches](#Installing_Patches)
    - [4.1.1 Configuring the Software Update Applet](#Configuring_the_Software_Update_Applet)
## Zypper

Open your terminal emulator (Terminal/Konsole) and execute **zypper** commands.

In openSUSE Leap:

sudo zypper up

In openSUSE Tumbleweed:

sudo zypper dup

Zypper provides full functionality of patches and updates management. You are able to handle all architecture and vendor changes, file conflicts and dependency problems.

For openSUSE Tumbleweed, **zypper dup** is the only recommended way to update the system.

## YaST

Open **YaST** and choose **Online Update** module.

Note, this module is **only for patches**. You cannot update regular packages through it.

The advantage of YaST Online Update is that you can choose which patch to install.

## KDE

KDE 5 provides a system tray widget to check and install updates. The UI is very basic.

In future, this function will be provided by KDE Discover.

### Install software updates

You will get notification when updates are available. Click system tray icon to view details.

In Leap, you can choose and install packages.

In Tumbleweed, you have to open terminal and run:

sudo zypper dup
### Configure software updates

Right click the system tray widget, choose **Configure Software Update** to open configuration dialog. Here you can configure update checking cycle and whether to check updates on battery and mobile network.

### Disable KDE update checking

KDE update widget will check online updates every time you login. This often fails and throw annoying error notifications. If you don't want to use it, run the following commands:

```
sudo zypper remove plasma5-pk-updates
sudo zypper addlock plasma5-pk-updates

```
## Using the GNOME Update Applet

The update applet resides in the notification area of the panel. Its icon changes depending on the availability and relevance of patches and the status of the update. To invoke the applet manually, choose *Computer*+*More Applications*+*System*+*Software Update*.

**Icon visibility:** By default, the update applet icon is only visible in the notification area, if patches are available.

**Open box with a globe:** The update is busy (for example checking for updates or installing software).

**Red Star with Exclamation Mark:** Security patches are available.

**Orange Star with an Up Arrow:** Important patches are available.

**Yellow Star with a Down Arrow:** Trivial patches are available.

**Yellow Triangle with Exclamation Mark:** An error has occurred.

### Installing Patches

1. Whenever new patches are available, a notification message will appear and the Update Applet icon will be visible in the notification area. Either click *Install updates* in the notification message or click the icon to open the *Software Update* window.
2. All security and important patches are preselected. It is strongly recommended to install these patches. Trivial patches can be manually selected by ticking the respective check boxes. Get detailed information on a patch by clicking on its title.
3. Click *Install Updates* to start the patch installation.
4. The *Additional Confirmation Required* window showing an installation summary opens. Click *Continue* to proceed.
5. Enter the `root` password in the authentication screen and proceed with *Authenticate*.

[![GNOME Update Applet](/images/5/5c/Gupdater_updates.png)](/File%3AGupdater_updates.png "GNOME Update Applet")

The YaST Online Update offers advanced features to customize the patch installation. Please refer to [*YaST Online Update*](http://doc.opensuse.org/products/opensuse/openSUSE/opensuse-reference/cha.onlineupdate.you.html) for more information.

#### Configuring the Software Update Applet

To configure the update applet, right-click the update icon in the panel and choose *Preferences*. The configuration dialog lets you modify the following settings:

*Check for Updates*: Choose how often a check for updates is performed: *Hourly*, *Daily*, *Weekly*, or *Never*.

*Automatically Install*: Configure whether patches are installed automatically or not (default). Automatic installation can be chosen for either security patches only or for all patches.

*Check for Major Upgrades*: Choose how often a check for major upgrades is performed: *Daily*, *Weekly*, or *Never*.

*Check for updates when using mobile broadband*: This configuration option is only available on mobile computers. Turned off by default.

More options are configurable using **gconf-editor**: *apps*+*gnome-packagekit*.

RHSA-2006:0498 - Security Advisory

Issued:
2006-05-23
Updated:
2006-05-23
# RHSA-2006:0498 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

xscreensaver security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Topic

An updated xscreensaver package that fixes two security flaws is now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 and 3.

This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

XScreenSaver is a collection of screensavers.

A keyboard focus flaw was found in the way XScreenSaver prompts the user to
enter their password to unlock the screen. XScreenSaver did not properly
ensure it had proper keyboard focus, which could leak a users password to
the program with keyboard focus. This behavior is not common, as only certain
applications exhibit this focus error. (CVE-2004-2655)

Several flaws were found in the way various XScreenSaver screensavers
create temporary files. It may be possible for a local attacker to create a
temporary file in way that could overwrite a different file to which the user
running XScreenSaver has write permissions. (CVE-2003-1294)

Users of XScreenSaver should upgrade to this updated package, which
contains backported patches to correct these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.
