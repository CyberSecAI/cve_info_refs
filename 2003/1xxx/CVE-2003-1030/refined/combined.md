## DameWare Mini Remote Control vulnerable to buffer overflow via specially crafted packets

#### Vulnerability Note VU#909678

Original Release Date: 2003-12-22 | Last Revised: 2003-12-22

---

### Overview

DameWare Mini Remote Control is a lightweight remote control intended primarily for administrators and help desks for management of desktop systems. A vulnerability in DameWare Mini Remote Control may permit an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system.

### Description

| A buffer overflow vulnerability has been discovered in versions of DameWare Mini Remote Control prior to 3.73. A remote attacker can send a specially crafted packet to the DameWare Mini Remote Control (default port 6129/TCP) to mimic a client and exploit this vulnerability against the server. Since the buffer overflow occurs in a section of the code used to handle authentication, a remote unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary code on the system.  The CERT/CC has seen reports of active exploitation. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code. |
| --- |

### Solution

| This vulnerability is resolved in version [3.73 or higher](http://www.dameware.com/download/default.asp#dmrc). |
| --- |

| Block access to the DameWare Mini Remote Control Service port (default 6129/TCP) at the network perimeter. This will not mitigate attacks from within the firewall perimeter, but may mitigate attacks from outside your network. |
