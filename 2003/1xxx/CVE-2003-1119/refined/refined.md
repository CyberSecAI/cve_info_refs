Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2003-1119, as extracted from the content:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the ASN.1 libraries used by SSH Communications' Secure Shell product. Specifically, the decoding of BER/DER encoded packets is flawed. These encodings are utilized in digital certificates, which are crucial for user authentication to a host and also for SSL/TLS connections.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of BER/DER encoded packets.
- Vulnerable ASN.1 library.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote attacker can crash the target server, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.
- **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** The vulnerability may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is carried out remotely over a network.
- A malformed BER/DER encoded packet is sent to the vulnerable server.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the target server.
- No special privileges or prior authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is specific to the commercial versions of SSH Secure Shell.
- The non-commercial versions of SSH Secure Shell (Unix) do not contain the vulnerable ASN.1 related libraries and are thus not affected.
- The vulnerability is related to but distinct from "Multiple vulnerabilities in SSL/TLS implementations" described in [VU#104280](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/104280)

**Mitigation:**
- Upgrading to SSH Secure Shell version 3.2.9 or later.
-  The following conditions indicate that a server is NOT vulnerable
   -  Password authentication only is used
   -  Using non-commercial Unix distribution that does not contain the PKI functionality.
    - Public key authentication is allowed WITHOUT specifying the "Pki" keyword in the server configuration file (sshd2_config).
