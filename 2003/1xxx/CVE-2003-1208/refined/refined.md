The provided content describes multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities in Oracle 9i Database related to date/time conversions and session parameters.

The specific vulnerabilities include:

*   **VU#399806**: Buffer overflow in the `FROM_TZ()` function.
*   **VU#819126**: Buffer overflow in the `NUMTOYMINTERVAL()` function.
*   **VU#240174**: Buffer overflow in the `TIME_ZONE` session parameter.
*   **VU#846582**: Buffer overflow in the `NUMTODSINTERVAL()` function.

Here's a breakdown of the common elements:

**Root Cause:** Buffer overflows in the specified functions/parameters due to insufficient bounds checking when handling character strings.

**Weakness:**

*   Lack of proper input validation.
*   Insecure handling of character strings in date/time conversion functions and session parameters.

**Impact:**

*   Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the vulnerable process (Oracle). This typically translates to SYSTEM on Windows and the ORACLE user on UNIX.
*   Unauthorized data access.

**Attack Vector:**

*   Supplying an overly long character string to the vulnerable function/parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities:**

*   Ability to query the Oracle server.

**Mitigation:**

*   Apply the patch specified by Oracle (9i Database Release 2, version 9.2.0.3).
