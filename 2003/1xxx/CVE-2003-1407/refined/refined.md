- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `cmd.exe` command processor when processing the `cd` command with a long path name. Specifically, the `cd` command doesn't properly handle path names longer than 256 characters.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - **Buffer Overflow (Windows NT 4.0):** `cmd.exe` has a buffer overflow vulnerability when processing the `cd` command with a path longer than 256 characters.
    - **Denial of Service (DoS) (Windows 2000):** While not a buffer overflow, `cmd.exe` gets "jailed" in a directory when using `cd` with a path slightly longer than 256 characters, causing the `cd ..` command to fail, leading to DoS for batch scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - **Windows NT 4.0:** The buffer overflow can be exploited to execute arbitrary code, potentially gaining complete control of the affected system.
    - **Windows 2000:** The inability to navigate directories via `cd ..` results in a denial of service, disrupting batch processing.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - A local attacker can execute commands using `cmd.exe` with specially crafted long paths.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to execute commands locally on the affected system. No authentication is required.
