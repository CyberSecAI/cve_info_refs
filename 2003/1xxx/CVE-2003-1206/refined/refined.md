**CVE ID:** CVE-2003-1206 (based on the analysis of the provided content, it seems that the content provided is related to a vulnerability in Crob FTP Server. There is no CVE assigned to this specific vulnerability, this content seems to provide more detail than the official CVE description)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Crob FTP Server 2.60.1 is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks due to insufficient input validation and error handling.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Invalid Filename Handling:** The server crashes when a file is renamed to "con". This indicates a lack of proper input validation for filenames, particularly when dealing with reserved or special filenames.
*   **Format String Vulnerability:** The server crashes when processing the format string "%s" in both login credentials and FTP commands. This points towards a format string vulnerability where user-controlled input is being directly used in a function that expects a format string (like printf), leading to a crash due to memory access violations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities results in a denial-of-service (DoS), causing the FTP server to crash. This makes the server unavailable to legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Renaming a File:** An attacker with write access to the server's file system could rename a file to "con", triggering the crash.
*   **Malicious Login:** An attacker could attempt to log in with a username containing format string specifiers (e.g., "%s%s%s%s%s%s").
*   **Malicious FTP Commands:** An attacker could send FTP commands (e.g., `DIR`) containing format string specifiers (e.g., `dir %s%s%s%s%s%s`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   For the "con" filename vulnerability, the attacker needs the ability to rename files on the server. This implies having some level of authenticated access or control over the files.
*   For the format string vulnerability, the attacker needs to be able to interact with the FTP server, either through authentication or by sending commands.
