```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The IBM Tivoli Storage Manager Server may allow an unauthorized administrator to start an admin session in "console mode" with the server due to session exposure.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Session exposure leading to unauthorized access to the server console.
- Impact of exploitation: An unauthorized user can monitor activities on the TSM server through the "console mode" session. However, this access does not allow for the execution of commands.
- Attack vectors: Network access to the TSM server.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to initiate a console mode session with the server, possibly by exploiting a flaw that bypasses authentication.
