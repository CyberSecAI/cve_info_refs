Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2003-1262:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a buffer overflow within the HTTP Fetcher library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- A buffer overflow vulnerability is present, meaning that a specially crafted input can overwrite adjacent memory regions in the buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The vulnerability is described as "very fatal", implying a severe impact.
- Successful exploitation could lead to remote code execution, as stated in the security announcement. This means an attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code on the victim machine.
- The vulnerability affects other programs that use the vulnerable HTTP Fetcher library, broadening the impact.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote, meaning an attacker can exploit the vulnerability over a network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the affected software or program using the vulnerable http-fetcher library.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `http-fetcher` library, version `1.0.1` and earlier.
- A Gentoo Linux security announcement (GLSA 200301-6) was released to address the vulnerability.
- The advisory indicates that it affects other programs that use this library, not just http-fetcher itself.
- The fix involves updating the `http-fetcher` package via the Gentoo package management system.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability is a remotely exploitable buffer overflow in the HTTP Fetcher library. Exploitation can lead to remote code execution, posing a serious threat to vulnerable systems.
