## History

The CERT Division is the birthplace of cybersecurity. For nearly 30 years, the CERT Division of the SEI has partnered with government, industry, law enforcement, and academia to advance cybersecurity and improve the security and resilience of computer systems and networks.

Originally focused on incident response, we have expanded into cybersecurity areas such as network situational awareness, malicious code analysis, secure coding, resilience management, insider threats, digital investigations and intelligence, workforce development, DevOps, forensics, software assurance, vulnerability discovery and analysis, and risk management.

## Former Director Richard Pethia

[Richard Pethia](/about/leadership/display.cfm?customel_datapageid_2623=3545) was founding director of the SEI's CERT Division. Pethia, who served as director of CERT from 1988 to 2016, guided the organization through tremendous growth and change. Under Pethia's leadership, the unit expanded and evolved from the CERT Coordination Center—a small group focused on computer incident response—to a research organization of more than 200 professionals dedicated to solving problems with widespread cybersecurity implications.

## Multiple implementations of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) contain multiple types of vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability Note VU#528719

Original Release Date: 2003-02-21 | Last Revised: 2007-05-21

---

### Overview

Oulu University has discovered a variety of vulnerabilities affecting products that implement the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). These vulnerabiltites affect a wide variety of products, with impacts ranging from denial of service to execution of arbitrary code. SIP is used in Voice Over Internet (VoIP), instant messaging, telephony, and various other applications and devices.

### Description

| The Oulu University Secure Programming Group (OUSPG) has discovered a variety of vulnerabilities in multiple implementations of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). OUSPG has previously conducted research into vulnerabilities in various protocol implementations, including LDAP, culminating in [CERT Advisory CA-2001-18](http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2001-18.html) and SNMP, resulting in [CERT Advisory CA-2002-03](http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2002-03.html). OUSPG has again asked us to coordinate with them in letting affected vendors know of their findings.  The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is a signaling protocol for various instant messaging, Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP), and other telephony applications. OUSPG has focused on a subset of SIP as the subject protocol for vulnerability assessment. Information about SIP can be found on the [IETF Charter page](http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/sip-charter.html) for SIP. OUSPG is has released the [results](http://www.ee.oulu.fi/research/ouspg/protos/testing/c07/sip/) of their investigations to the public. More details may be found in [CERT Advisory CA-2003-06](http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2003-06.html). |
| --- |

### Impact

| Impacts range from unexpected system behavior and denial of service to execution of arbitrary code. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Upgrade or apply the patches as specified by your vendor. |
| --- |

| Vulnerable applications supporting the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) may have access blocked at a network perimeter on ports 5060/tcp and 5060/udp. |
| --- |

Notified:  October 30, 2002  Updated: March 24, 2003

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

Pingtel has verified that the current versions of software for the Pingtel xpressa desk phone and instant xpressa softphone products, Release 2.1.6, are not vulnerable to any of the tests developed by the University of Oulu and described in CERT Vulnerability Note VU#528719.

Pingtel strongly encourages its customers to use Version 2.1.6. Existing customers may upgrade to this software, free of charge. This software is available at <http://www.pingtel.com/s_upgrades.jsp>.

While the process of updating software for xpressa and instant xpressa can take a phone out of service for two minutes, Pingtel recommends that customers make the effort to stay current, if they aren't already, by upgrading to Version 2.1.6 now. Earlier software revisions are vulnerable, making the use of any release prior to 2.1.6 inadvisable.

Customers that have any questions or concerns are welcome to contact the Pingtel Technical Assistance Center at any time by calling 781-938-5306, emailing support@pingtel.com, or going online at <http://support.pingtel.com>. Emergency cases are always handled 24 x 7 x 365.
