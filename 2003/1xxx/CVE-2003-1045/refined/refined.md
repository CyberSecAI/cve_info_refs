  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the `votes.cgi` script in Bugzilla not properly checking the permissions of the current user when displaying vote information.

      "Information disclosure"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could view the summary of a restricted bug by knowing the email of a user who has voted on the bug.",
