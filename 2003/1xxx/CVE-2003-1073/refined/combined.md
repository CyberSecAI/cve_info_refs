How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Synopsis: at -r job name handling and race condition vulnerabilities
Product: Sun Microsystems Solaris
Version: all
URL: http://isec.pl/vulnerabilities/isec-0008-sun-at.txt
Author: Wojciech Purczynski
Date: November 1, 2002
Update: January 27, 2003
Issue:
======
Race condition and argument handling vulnerabilities in the setuid-root
/usr/bin/at binary allows to remove any file on the filesystem.
Details:
========
At utility reads commands from standard input and groups them together
as an at-job, to be executed at a later time.
Each at-job is kept in separate file in at spool directory. At jobs my
be removed if -r option is used with a job-id parameter to the at
command.
However, there are two vulnerabilities within the code that removes
at-job from at spool directory.
At utility does not properly handle job ids specified as a parameter to
the -r option. It allows to remove jobs outside of at's spool directory
if relative path name is used. Only absolute path names are filtered
out.
At verifies ownership of the file and limits the user to remove only its
own at-jobs. Unfortunatelly, a race condition occurs after at stats the
file and before the file is unlinked. By altering directory structure
between these two system calls, at may be fooled to remove file other
than it expects.
Since this code is executed with full root privileges, these two
vulnerabilities may allow unprivileged users to remove any files on the
filesystem.
Below is an example of truss output that uncovers the vulnerability:
bash# truss -o log /usr/bin/at -r ../../../../tmp/foo
[...]
chdir("/var/spool/cron/atjobs") = 0
stat64("../../../../tmp/foo", 0xFFBEF360) = 0
[...]
unlink("../../../../tmp/foo") = 0
[...]
Exploit:
========
Below is attached a working proof-of-concept exploit. It should succeed
after few trials (single dot is printed on each trial):
