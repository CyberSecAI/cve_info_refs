Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `eZnet.exe` application, which is part of the eZ product suite (eZmeeting, eZnetwork, eZphotoshare, eZshare). The vulnerability occurs due to improper parsing of HTTP requests, specifically when handling the `autologin` parameter within the `SwEzModule.dll` module.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stack-based Buffer Overflow:** The `eZnet.exe` application copies data from a network request into a fixed-size buffer on the stack without proper bounds checking. Specifically, the vulnerable code uses what appears to be a `strcpy()` type of function in an internal parsing routine, which continues copying data until a null byte is encountered, without any limit to the amount of data copied.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The application does not properly validate the length of the `autologin` parameter in the HTTP request, allowing an attacker to send an overly long string that overwrites the saved return address on the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** By overwriting the saved return address, an attacker can redirect program execution to malicious code injected into the buffer. This allows for complete control over the target system.
*   **Trojan Download and Execution:** The exploit provided demonstrates the ability to download and execute a trojan on the victim's machine, showcasing the severity of the vulnerability.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** While not the primary impact, the vulnerability can be exploited to cause the application to crash, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `eZnet.exe` service listening on port 80/tcp.
*   **`autologin` Parameter:** The overflow occurs when an overly long string is provided as the value of the `autologin` parameter in a request to `SwEzModule.dll`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker must be able to connect to the target machine on port 80/tcp.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know how to construct the malicious HTTP request with the overly long `autologin` parameter.
*   **Ability to Craft Shellcode (for arbitrary code execution):** To achieve remote code execution, the attacker needs to provide shellcode that will be executed when the overwritten return address is reached.

**Additional Details:**

*   The `eZnet.exe` application runs as a service, and is configured to execute as soon as Windows is loaded, making every user of eZ vulnerable by default.
*   The provided proof-of-concept code shows that a specially crafted HTTP GET request can overwrite the saved return address.
*   The exploit code on exploit-db demonstrates a full trojan downloader and execution.
*   The vendor has released patches that are linked in the provided content.
