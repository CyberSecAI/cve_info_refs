Attached file demonstrates GNU Emacs 21.2.1 starting process if a text file is
opened. Just open it with emacs and check for processes "yes".

I suggest disabling local variables by default, because probably there are
similar bugs of the same nature.

All the best in the new year!

Is the new attached file also fixed?
It requires mouse over text.

I suggest you disable local variables by default - they are not portable and
some people use emacs for examining untrusted log files or read mail.

Emacs CVS gives a warning about the code.

Disabling local variables completely seems silly. Making Emacs warn
the user when running local-hook's or eval's is a far better idea;
which is done in CVS. Local variables are very useful.

Yes; here's the \*Messages\* output for that file:

So since emacs CVS fixes at least 2 security bugs you may think about releasing
a new version or at least patches.

I continue to disagree that local variables on by default is a good idea, but am
tired of arguing about it.
So here are some last arguments:
1. I found 2 security bugs on release version of emacs in less than week. How
many left do you think are? Of course the idea of warning about eval or hooks
seems good, but covering all cases of non-obvious evals in a large project is
difficult task.

2. Lusers like micro$oft thought in the beginning that scripting in email/word
is a good idea and it is sandboxed. Now it is off by default in their email
products. Think about it.

3. Local variables are not portable accross editors, which makes them almost
useless, unless every document has all the version of local variables for every
editor.

To be fair, both your examples were already taken care of.

This is not scripting. Whether or not emacs is as restrictive as it
should be, I don't know, but there's clearly a large subset of
variables/values that can quite safely be set.

Yes, if emacs were the kernel, it would have to take a more conservative
approach -- but it's not, and convience \_is\_ important.

[Of course, it helps that the `local variables' section is not
interpreted for such obviously suspicious sources such as email or news,
and that emacs users are in general a more clueful lot than typical MS
product users]

Who cares about other editors? I certainly don't.

Georgi's file is enclosed verbatim.

I just tried it with emacs in Woody and indeed, the yes processes
started to spawn on a fast pace.  I went even a bit further and found
out that the execution is not sandboxed in any way, as I was able to
execute a script that writes out a script in my home directory, chmod +x
it, and runs it in turn.

In the above thread, it's mentioned another security bug was found
earlier that week, so please take a look at it.

Cheers,

I can verify this in the stable emacs21.  So far I've been unable to
reproduce it in unstable (21.3+1-8).

Security team summary: openening the emacs1.emacs file in the
indicated google link with a stable emacs will result in yes being
launched many times without any advance warning to the user.  I
presume arbitrary other code might be substituted.  I'm not yet sure
how this was changed in 21.3+1, but that version (the one in
testing/unsable) doesn't appear to execute the code provided in either
the emacs1.emacs or emacs2.emacs sample exploits.  I'm going to see if
I can locate the relevant diff.

Thanks

I've culled a patch from the diff between 21.2 and 21.3 which appears
to fix the problem.  I'll wait to hear from the security team, and I
may also run it by emacs-devel.

Other emacs and xemacs packages might/probably are affected as well.  I
am not familiar with emacs packages in debian (or emacs at all),
therefore someone else will have to check this.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
