- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Zorum message board software fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `method` variable, leading to both XSS and path disclosure vulnerabilities.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: The `method` parameter in `index.php` is vulnerable to XSS attacks because it doesn't filter or sanitize user-provided input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.
    - **Path Disclosure**: By sending a malformed HTTP request using multiple variables and triggering an error, the system inadvertently reveals the installation path in the error message.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - **XSS**: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of a user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or further malicious activity.
    - **Path Disclosure**: An attacker can gain knowledge of the full server-side path of the Zorum installation, which can assist in further attacks, like exploiting local file inclusion vulnerabilities or other attack vectors.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - **XSS**: By crafting a malicious URL with the injected script in the `method` parameter.
    - **Path Disclosure**: By sending a malformed HTTP request with a combination of multiple variables.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
    - No special privileges are required to exploit these vulnerabilities.
