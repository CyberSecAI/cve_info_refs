SUMMARY

SCALANCE X-200RNA switch devices before V3.2.7 contain multiple OpenSSL and OpenSSH vulnera-
bilities. The most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow a denial of service condition or could lead to
execution of arbitrary code.

Siemens has released updates for the affected products and recommends to update to the latest versions.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Restrict access to the affected systems, especially to ports 22/tcp and 443/tcp to trusted IP

addresses only

• Deactivate the webserver if not required, and if deactivation is supported by the product

Product-speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The SCALANCE X-204RNA Industrial Ethernet network access points enable the cost-effective connection
of non-PRP terminal devices to separate parallel networks, where a high availability is required.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2003-0190

OpenSSH-portable (OpenSSH) 3.6.1p1 and earlier with PAM support enabled immediately sends
an error message when a user does not exist, which allows remote attackers to determine valid

Vulnerability CVE-2003-1562

sshd in OpenSSH 3.6.1p2 and earlier, when PermitRootLogin is disabled and using PAM keyboard-
interactive authentication, does not insert a delay after a root login attempt with the correct password,
which makes it easier for remote attackers to use timing differences to determine if the password step
of a multi-step authentication is successful, a different vulnerability than CVE-2003-0190.

Vulnerability CVE-2016-10012

The shared memory manager (associated with pre-authentication compression) in sshd in OpenSSH
before 7.4 does not ensure that a bounds check is enforced by all compilers, which might allows local
users to gain privileges by leveraging access to a sandboxed privilege-separation process, related to
the m_zback and m_zlib data structures.

Vulnerability CVE-2019-1552

OpenSSL has internal defaults for a directory tree where it can ﬁnd a conﬁguration ﬁle as well as
certiﬁcates used for veriﬁcation in TLS. This directory is most commonly referred to as OPENSSLDIR,
and is conﬁgurable with the –preﬁx / –openssldir conﬁguration options. For OpenSSL versions 1.1.0
and 1.1.1, the mingw conﬁguration targets assume that resulting programs and libraries are installed
in a Unix-like environment and the default preﬁx for program installation as well as for OPENSSLDIR
should be ‘/usr/local’. However, mingw programs are Windows programs, and as such, ﬁnd themselves
looking at sub-directories of ‘C:/usr/local’, which may be world writable, which enables untrusted users
to modify OpenSSL’s default conﬁguration, insert CA certiﬁcates, modify (or even replace) existing
engine modules, etc. For OpenSSL 1.0.2, ‘/usr/local/ssl’ is used as default for OPENSSLDIR on
all Unix and Windows targets, including Visual C builds. However, some build instructions for the
diverse Windows targets on 1.0.2 encourage you to specify your own –preﬁx. OpenSSL versions
1.1.1, 1.1.0 and 1.0.2 are affected by this issue. Due to the limited scope of affected deployments this
has been assessed as low severity and therefore we are not creating new releases at this time. Fixed
in OpenSSL 1.1.1d (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1c). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0l (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0k). Fixed in
OpenSSL 1.0.2t (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2s).

Vulnerability CVE-2019-6111

An issue was discovered in OpenSSH 7.9. Due to the scp implementation being derived from 1983 rcp,
the server chooses which ﬁles/directories are sent to the client. However, the scp client only performs
cursory validation of the object name returned (only directory traversal attacks are prevented). A
malicious scp server (or Man-in-The-Middle attacker) can overwrite arbitrary ﬁles in the scp client
target directory. If recursive operation (-r) is performed, the server can manipulate subdirectories as
well (for example, to overwrite the .ssh/authorized_keys ﬁle).

Vulnerability CVE-2019-16905

OpenSSH 7.7 through 7.9 and 8.x before 8.1, when compiled with an experimental key type, has a
pre-authentication integer overﬂow if a client or server is conﬁgured to use a crafted XMSS key. This
leads to memory corruption and local code execution because of an error in the XMSS key parsing
algorithm. NOTE: the XMSS implementation is considered experimental in all released OpenSSH
versions, and there is no supported way to enable it when building portable OpenSSH.

Subject: sshd: no delay on successful root login with permitroot = no
Date: Thu, 13 May 2004 01:02:07 +0200
```
Package: ssh
Version: 1:3.8p1-3
Severity: normal

Hello,

I found this bug and googled for it to get more informations, The
following link is a security advisory mentionning it::
<http://lab.mediaservice.net/advisory/2003-01-openssh.txt>

Basicly, if user root is not authorized to connect to ssh, if you enter
the correct password you will have no delay before the "password:"
prompt is shown again.
An attacker could then bruteforce the ssh login and just time the server
answer, if the answer is fastly given back, the password tried is the
correct one.

Many thanks for maintning this package btw, it works well :o)

For a bad password, the delay is provided by PAM.  If you want root to
behave the same way even for a correct password you need to arrange for
PAM to do it (eg in the sshd session stack) and not use PermitRootLogin.

This is not an OpenSSH problem as such, the Debian folks would be in a
much better position to help you.

I would recommend that this be added to a README file as a caveat of
using this service.  Provide workarounds (like using nodelay in pam and
restricting root logins via pam instead of ssh to get similar behavour)
in the blurb but I don't see how the package can ensure configurations
like this don't exist.

This bug allows for an enumeration of users, which can be done on many
machines using smtp, http, and other protocols.  Therefore I feel we
gain very little in trying to fix this for all users, but it is
important to note for users who want to lock their machine down.

Here's a further patch on top of your openssh-pam-kbdint-leak.patch
which makes sure that attempted root logins when PermitRootLogin is not
set to yes always have the same delay (Debian bug #248747). It's the
same as you did for PAM PasswordAuthentication.
