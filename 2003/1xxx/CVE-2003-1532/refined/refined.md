Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described for CVE-2003-1532:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw present in the `compte.php` file of phpMyShop version 1.00.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The code directly incorporates user-supplied input (`$identifiant` and `$password`) into the SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

    ```php
    $sql = "SELECT id_cli,login_cli,pass_cli FROM $table_client where login_cli='$identifiant' and pass_cli='$password'";
    ```

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** An attacker can bypass the authentication mechanism by injecting malicious SQL code into the `identifiant` and `password` parameters. For example:
    `http://[target]/compte.php?achat=1&valider=1&identifiant='%20OR%20''='&password='%20OR%20''='`
    This injection causes the query to return true, allowing access without correct credentials.
*   **Partial Information Disclosure:** The attacker may be able to retrieve sensitive information from the database.
*   **Partial Integrity Impact:**  With further crafted SQL injections, an attacker might be able to modify the data stored in the database.
*   **Partial Availability Impact:** Under some circumstances, the injection may cause unexpected errors, leading to denial of service conditions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network using HTTP requests to the vulnerable `compte.php` script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the web server hosting the phpMyShop application.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker must be able to send crafted HTTP GET requests.
*   **SQL injection knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand how to craft SQL injection payloads

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered in 2007, despite the CVE ID being from 2003. This could be due to the vulnerability being discovered and assigned to an existing CVE later.
