- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Microsoft IIS web server fails to log HTTP requests using the `TRACK` verb.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
  - Failure to log `TRACK` requests, which are similar to `TRACE` requests.
  - Vulnerability to cross-site tracing (XST) attacks through the `TRACK` verb, allowing attackers to potentially access credentials and cookies (session hijacking).
- **Impact of exploitation**:
  - Unlogged traffic generation.
  - Information disclosure of the server header.
  - Potential cross-site tracing (XST) attacks leading to session hijacking and unauthorized access to sensitive information (credentials, cookies).
- **Attack vectors**:
  - Sending a crafted HTTP request with the `TRACK` verb to a vulnerable IIS server.
  - Using client-side scripting (e.g., from a malicious webpage or email) to send `TRACK` requests to other websites for XST attacks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
  - Ability to send HTTP requests to a vulnerable IIS server.
  - Ability to utilize client-side scripting for cross-site attacks.
