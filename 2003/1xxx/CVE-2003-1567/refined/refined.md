Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the Microsoft IIS server's support for the non-RFC compliant HTTP `TRACK` method. This method echoes the complete client HTTP request, including headers, back to the client in the response body. This behavior is similar to the `TRACE` method but is not logged by IIS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Non-RFC Compliant HTTP Method:** The `TRACK` method is not officially documented or part of the HTTP standards, yet IIS implements it.
*   **Lack of Logging:**  IIS fails to log requests made using the `TRACK` method.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The `TRACK` response exposes potentially sensitive information, like HTTP headers, cookies, and authentication data, which are included in the echoed request.
*   **Cross-Site Tracing (XST):** By leveraging client-side scripting (e.g., XMLHTTP ActiveX, XMLDOM) and cross-domain browser vulnerabilities, attackers can send `TRACK` requests to other websites and gain access to the sensitive information in the response. This technique bypasses the HttpOnly cookie attribute.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can steal sensitive information such as cookies, session identifiers, authentication credentials, and other data transmitted in HTTP headers.
*   **Session Hijacking:** Stolen session cookies can be used to impersonate legitimate users and take over their accounts.
*   **Probing Vulnerable Systems:** The ability to use `TRACK` requests without logging makes it easier for attackers to probe IIS systems and identify vulnerabilities, as this traffic would be hidden.
*   **Bypassing Security Measures:**  The `TRACK` method can bypass security features like the HttpOnly cookie flag, which is designed to prevent script access to cookies.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Client-Side Scripting:**  Attackers use malicious web pages or emails that use client-side scripting languages (e.g., JavaScript, ActiveX) to send `TRACK` requests to the target web server.
*   **Cross-Domain Attacks:** By exploiting cross-domain vulnerabilities in web browsers, attackers can send requests to any domain that supports the `TRACK` method and read the response, gaining access to information on third-party sites.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to inject malicious code:** Attackers need to be able to inject malicious scripts or content that will be executed by the client's browser. This can be done through techniques like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
*   **Web Presence/Malicious Site:** The attacker needs a platform to deliver their exploit, such as a malicious web page or a compromised site.

**Additional Notes:**

*   IIS 6.0 is reportedly not vulnerable to this issue, suggesting Microsoft removed the functionality in later versions.
*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Parcifal Aertssen.
*   The recommended solution is to disable the `TRACK` method by adding it to the `DenyVerbs` section of the `urlscan.ini` file in Microsoft's URLScan tool.
