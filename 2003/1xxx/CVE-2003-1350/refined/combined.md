List Site Pro v2 user account Hijacking vulnerablity
Severity:Low
homepage:http://www.listsitepro.com
It is possible to take over another user account by signing up and using | in one of the required feilds.
List Site Pro uses '|' to delimit the database but the form input is not checked and stripped of them.
So a user could sign up like this
username:username
email:email (at) emial (dot) com [email concealed]
url:www.url.com
bannerurl:www.site.com/banner.gif ||password|1036360992|60|468
banner height:68
banner width:460
password:pass
this would take over the account 1036360992 and let the user log in with the password 'password'
Since the user id is displayed in teh link of the topsite, an attacker could successfully log into whatever
account he chooses to. Then the attacker could change the link the banner points to, or any thing else in the account.
This doesn't give the attacker admin access. But it gives him an opportunity to render the topsite useless.
I contacted the author(s) (http://www.listsitepro.com/) on 11-3-02 and again 12-01-02. no response from either request.
