Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2003-1350:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of input sanitization in the List Site Pro v2 application. Specifically, the application fails to properly validate and sanitize user-supplied input, particularly within the `bannerurl` field during user registration.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The application uses a pipe symbol (`|`) as a delimiter to separate fields in the database, but it doesn't prevent users from including this character in the `bannerurl` field.
*   **Data Injection:** By injecting a crafted string containing pipe symbols into the `bannerurl` field, an attacker can manipulate the data being written to the database, effectively hijacking existing user accounts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **User Account Hijacking:** An attacker can take over another user's account by injecting a specially crafted string into the `bannerurl` field during registration. This allows the attacker to login using the hijacked account's credentials.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Once logged into the hijacked account, the attacker can alter the account details, such as the banner link, potentially leading to further malicious activity.
*   **Website Disruption:** Though not providing admin access, the attacker can render the top site useless through actions performed via the compromised account.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through the user registration form.
*   **Web Interface:** The attack is performed through the web interface by manipulating the input fields during user registration.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Basic Web Interaction:** The attacker only needs to know how to interact with a standard web form.
*   **Knowledge of the Pipe Delimiter:** The attacker needs to be aware of the application's use of the pipe symbol (`|`) as a delimiter and use this in the attack.
*   **No Authentication Required:** No prior authentication is needed. The attacker simply needs to be able to register a new user account on the vulnerable application.

**Technical Details:**

*   The attacker injects a crafted string into the `bannerurl` field of the registration form, such as:
    `www.site.com/banner.gif ||password|1036360992|60|468`
*   This injected string, containing `||`, causes the system to write the attacker's provided values as the password and other user details for an existing user id (1036360992 in the example), effectively hijacking the user's account.
*   The targeted user ID may be obtained from the top site link as it is displayed there.

**Additional Notes**
* The original report was made in 2002, while the CVE was published in 2003 and the report was later published in 2007.
* The vendor was contacted multiple times with no response.
