- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The RPM installation of SAP DB server executables sets insecure file permissions (777, world-writable) on `lserver` and `dbmsrv` binaries.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure file permissions. The `lserver` and `dbmsrv` executables are world writable, allowing any local user to modify them.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local, unprivileged user can overwrite the executables. This could lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the server processes (typically root or a highly privileged user).
- **Attack vectors:** Local access to the system where the vulnerable SAP DB server is installed. An attacker with a regular user account can modify the vulnerable files.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A local user account on the system. No other capabilities are needed.
