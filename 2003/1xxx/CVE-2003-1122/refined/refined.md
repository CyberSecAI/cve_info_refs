{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The ScriptLogic installation program creates a network share for logging without explicitly setting restrictive share-level permissions, resulting in the Windows default permissions being applied. This grants the 'Everyone' group full access to the share.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure default permissions on network share.",
      "Lack of access control on shared resource."
    ],
    "impact": "Any user with access to the network share can modify ScriptLogic log records, consume disk space, introduce malicious code, or store unauthorized files. When used with other vulnerabilities, an intruder could execute malicious code stored on the share. Excessive disk space consumption can also disrupt system operations.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network access to the improperly configured share.",
      "Exploitation via access to the network share and its resources."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Any user with network access to the shared resource can exploit this vulnerability."
  }
