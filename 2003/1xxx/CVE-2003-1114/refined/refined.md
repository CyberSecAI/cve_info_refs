**CVE-2003-1108 and VU#528719 Details:**

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in various implementations of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) due to inadequate handling of input data. The vulnerabilities were found by the Oulu University Secure Programming Group (OUSPG) using their PROTOS test suite.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerabilities include denial of service, unexpected system behavior, and potential for arbitrary code execution. The exact nature of each vulnerability varies depending on the implementation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Exploitation of these vulnerabilities can lead to:
- Denial of service
- Unexpected system behavior
- Execution of arbitrary code

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vectors involve sending crafted SIP messages to vulnerable SIP implementations.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs the ability to send malicious SIP messages to a vulnerable SIP implementation, typically over a network.

**Additional Details:**
- The OUSPG investigation focused on a subset of SIP.
- A number of vendors were notified, with some confirming their products were affected, others that they were not, and some remaining unknown.
- Patches and upgrades were provided by some affected vendors.
- The vulnerability affects various SIP-related applications, including VoIP, instant messaging, and telephony.
- The vulnerabilities were also covered in CERT Advisory CA-2003-06.
- The vulnerabilities could be mitigated by blocking access to SIP ports (5060/tcp and 5060/udp) at the network perimeter.
