Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2003-1599:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability. The `abspath` variable in `links.all.php` is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject a URL.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application does not properly validate or sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `abspath` variable, before using it in a file inclusion operation. This allows an attacker to include a remote file into the application's context.

*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   **Remote command execution:** By injecting a malicious URL into the `abspath` variable, an attacker can achieve remote command execution on the server with the privileges of the webserver user (typically 'nobody').

*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   **HTTP Request:** An attacker sends a crafted HTTP request to the `links.all.php` file, including a malicious URL in the `abspath` parameter.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
    *   **Knowledge of vulnerable endpoint:** The attacker needs to know about the existence of `links.all.php` file and its vulnerable `abspath` parameter.

Additional Notes:
* The affected software is WordPress version 0.7.
*   The vulnerability was identified in 2003.
*   The content clarifies a mix-up of CVE assignments, noting that CVE-2003-1599 is associated with the RFI vulnerability in `links.all.php`, not the SQL injection in `blog.header.php`.
