Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Internet Explorer handles the `showHelp()` function, which is used to display HTML help content. Specifically, it bypasses the cross-domain security model, allowing a webpage from one domain to access resources from another domain (including the local file system).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Improper Cross-Domain Security Validation:** The `showHelp()` function does not perform proper security checks on the origin of the request, leading to a bypass of the cross-domain security model. This allows a malicious website to access files and data that should be restricted.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Reading:** An attacker can read arbitrary files on the victim's local system if they know the full path and filename. This could expose sensitive information like user credentials.
*   **Local Executable Invocation:** An attacker could potentially invoke executables already present on the local system with specific parameters, leading to further compromise of the system.
*   **User Information Disclosure:** Attackers could potentially gain access to user information by exploiting the vulnerability in conjunction with a specially crafted URL.
*   **Malware Installation:** In the worst case, a remote attacker could potentially load and execute malicious code on the user's system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Website:** The attacker hosts a malicious website with a webpage designed to exploit the `showHelp()` vulnerability.
*   **User Lure:** The attacker needs to entice the user to visit the malicious website, typically through a link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Web Server:** The attacker needs access to a web server to host the malicious website.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to use some form of social engineering or trickery to lure the victim to the malicious site, since they can't force a user to visit the site.

**Additional Information:**

*   The provided information is more detailed than the typical CVE description, providing the root cause, specific impacts, attack vectors, and mitigations.
*   Microsoft acknowledged the vulnerability (identified as CAN-2003-1328, which maps to CVE-2003-1328).
*   The patch for this vulnerability disables the `showHelp()` functionality initially and requires an update to HTML Help to restore limited functionality.
*   The vulnerability affects Internet Explorer 5.01, 5.5, and 6.0.
*   The vulnerability is related to another vulnerability, CAN-2003-1326 (related to dialog boxes bypassing cross-domain security model).
*   The security bulletin MS03-004 is a cumulative patch, also addressing the CAN-2003-1326 vulnerability.
