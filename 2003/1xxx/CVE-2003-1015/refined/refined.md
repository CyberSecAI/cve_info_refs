Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from inconsistent interpretations of the MIME standard, specifically regarding the handling of whitespace within MIME fields. RFC2822 allows for whitespace between various elements and even allows folded lines of whitespace. However, different vendors have implemented this flexibility with varying degrees of strictness.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **MIME Parsing Inconsistencies:** Security products that analyze MIME content are not consistently handling whitespace. Some might fail to interpret fields containing unexpected whitespace, while others might outright block it. This inconsistency creates an opportunity for attackers.
*   **Evasion of Security Controls:** By strategically inserting whitespace in MIME fields, attackers can bypass security products designed to block certain content types (e.g., executables or files containing viruses).
*   **Lack of Robustness:** The security products lack robustness in that they cannot handle common misinterpretations and deliberate corruptions of MIME standards.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Bypassing Content Filters:** Attackers can evade security measures designed to block specific file types, potentially leading to the delivery of malicious content.
*   **Compromising Systems:** By bypassing these filters, malicious files such as viruses or other malware can reach the end user.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malformed MIME Messages:** Attackers craft MIME messages with whitespace inserted in unexpected locations within header fields, parameters, or values.
*   **Email/HTTP:** The attack can be delivered through various protocols that utilize MIME encoding, such as email (SMTP) and web traffic (HTTP).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to Craft Malformed MIME:** Attackers need to be able to create MIME messages with specific whitespace manipulations.
*   **Knowledge of Target's Vulnerabilities:**  Attackers would need to have an understanding of which security products (e.g., proxies, email gateways) interpret MIME messages in a way that allows them to bypass filters.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The advisory notes that the issue affects "various" applications, including browsers, proxy servers, email clients, content security gateways, and antivirus products.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Corsaire's security assessment team using a custom SMTP/HTTP vulnerability analysis tool.
*   The advisory includes a reference to a NISCC document consolidating vendor statements related to this issue.
