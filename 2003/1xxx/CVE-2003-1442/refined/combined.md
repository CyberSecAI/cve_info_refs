On behalf of Peter Linder, Technical Director, Ericsson Ethernet Broadband Access:

On February 11 a report was issued on BugTraq related to Ericsson's DSL modem HM 220.
The initial report included some statements that could be misinterpreted  and in \
order to avoid  any further confusion on this subject we would like provide the \
following clarifications.

Ericsson hm220 is a flexible ADSL modem targeting the residential market.
For small offices Ericsson recommend hm230 (standard ADSL ), hn310 (ADSL Annex J
support 3Mbps upstream) and hn800 (SHDSL) which has a feature set that is targeted \
towards the small business customers needs.

hm220 can be operated in two modes, bridged and routed mode. There is no possibility \
to remotely manage the modem from the WAN side in netither of these two modes. It is \
possible to perform local  administration routines from a PC connceted to the LAN \
side of the modem but that option is restricted to the Routed mode only. No such \
options exist for the products configured for Bridged mode operation.

Ericsson have scheduled a maintenance release for March 15 for the hm220 software \
that will eliminate any risk for access to the modem being manipulated from the LAN \
side.

Any end-user experiencing service interuption through unwanted actions form the PC \
towards the modem  can perform a factory reset, which is described in the user \
manual, which will return all initial installations.

All Ericsson ADSL modems launched after the hm220 have an increased security feature \
set for residential  as well as small business users and the indication that other \
products in the hm and hn product families  would be vulnerable is not correct.
