Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `cc_guestbook.pl` script in CGI-City's CCGuestBook fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input. Specifically, it doesn't filter the "name" and "webpage title" fields.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability (CWE-79):** Due to the lack of input sanitization, attackers can inject malicious scripts into the guestbook. These scripts are then executed in the browsers of users who visit the guestbook.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the vulnerable web application. This could lead to:
    *   Stealing user cookies and session tokens.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Defacing the guestbook page.
    *   Performing other actions within the user's browser with the privileges of the vulnerable site.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the "name" and "webpage title" fields of the guestbook form. By submitting a malicious script within these fields, the script will be stored by the server, and executed each time a user views the guestbook entry

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to submit a post to the guestbook. No authentication is required.
*   The attacker can be remote.

**Additional Details:**

*   The exploit example provided is a basic alert box (`<script>alert('obvious?')</script>`), which demonstrates the ability to inject arbitrary JavaScript.
