===================================================
Path Disclosure in Macromedia ColdFusion MX Server
Vendor: Macromedia http://www.macromedia.com
Versions affected: ColdFusion MX Server
Operating System: Windows 2000
Date: 26th April 2003
Severity: Low
Network Intelligence India Pvt. Ltd. http://www.nii.co.in
Online location: http://www.nii.co.in/vuln/pdmac.html
===================================================
Background:
=========
Macromedia Cold Fusion MX Server is a powerful web application server that lets you create robust sites and applications without a long learning curve.
Description:
=========
In its default installation, the Macromedia ColdFusion MX Server starts a web server (jrun) on port 8500. This is mainly for administrative purposes. When this server is accessed with the following URL http://host:8500/CFIDE/probe.cfm, an error message is displayed which reveals the Physical path of the location where the MX Server has been installed.
Error occured in:
C:\CFusionMX\wwwroot\CFIDE\probe.cfm:line56
Vendor Response:
=============
The vendor response is that this is a feature controlled by the 'Debugging Settinsg' page in the Administrator console.
[X] Enable Robust Exception Information. This checkbox is checked by default on a new installation to allow application development. For a production system the checkbox must be disabled.
Impact:
=====
Like with any other Path Disclosure, this bug would only allow vital information to be disclosed. By itself, it will not allow for a system compromise, but in conjunction with some other vulnerability in a Web app or in the server, it might be dangerous.
Workaround:
==========
Disable the checkbox mentioned above in a production environment. Alternatively, firewall the 8500 port to disable outside access to the administrator's console. It looks like the old debate on feature-or-bug, where the default configuration is not secure out-of-the-box.
