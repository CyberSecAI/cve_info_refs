Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2003-1469

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a path disclosure issue in Macromedia ColdFusion MX Server's default configuration.
- When accessing `http://host:8500/CFIDE/probe.cfm`, an error message reveals the physical path of the ColdFusion installation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of the server's physical file system path within the error message. This is caused by the default settings of the application.
- The default "Enable Robust Exception Information" is checked which allows revealing the path.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can gain knowledge of the server's file system structure and the installation path of ColdFusion.
- Although the path disclosure itself doesn't allow for a system compromise, it can be used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to further attacks.
- The impact is rated as low, with partial impact to integrity.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending a crafted HTTP request to the ColdFusion server.
- Specifically, the attack vector is accessing the URL `http://host:8500/CFIDE/probe.cfm`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the ColdFusion server (specifically, port 8500).
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability does not require any authentication to be exploited.

**Additional Details:**
- The vendor classifies this behavior as a feature that is controlled by the 'Debugging Settings' page, where 'Enable Robust Exception Information' is checked by default.
- The recommended workaround is to disable this setting or firewall port 8500.
