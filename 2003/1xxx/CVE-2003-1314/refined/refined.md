```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application includes the file 'auth_func.php' using a variable '$emgb_admin_path' which is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to control the path and include arbitrary remote files.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include and execute arbitrary code from a remote server by injecting a malicious URL into the 'emgb_admin_path' parameter.",
  "Attack vectors": "HTTP GET request with the 'emgb_admin_path' parameter in the URL targeting the 'admin/auth.php' file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. The attacker also needs to host a malicious file on a server which can be accessed via HTTP."
