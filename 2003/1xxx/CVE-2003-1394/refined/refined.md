{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The CoffeeCup Password Wizard stores user credentials (usernames and passwords) in a plain text file with the `.apw` extension which is placed in a publicly accessible location.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information",
       "Predictable File Name"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can easily obtain usernames, passwords and direct access URLs to protected pages by downloading and viewing the .apw file. This allows for unauthorized access to protected resources.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attacker gains access by directly requesting the `.apw` file through HTTP, usually after identifying the location of the corresponding `.swf` file.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs knowledge of the location of the `.swf` file (which is typically found in the HTML source code) to derive the path to the `.apw` file. No authentication is required"
