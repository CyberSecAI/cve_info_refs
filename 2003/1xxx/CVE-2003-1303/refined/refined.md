      "vulnerability": {
        "root_cause": "The `rfc822_write_address()` function in `php_imap.c` writes email addresses to a fixed-size buffer without verifying if the address fits within the buffer.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Buffer overflow"
        ],
        "impact": "A long email address in the `From:` or `To:` header can cause a segfault when `imap_fetch_overview()` is called.  A crafted email can lead to code execution due to this overflow. Specifically, the bug report mentions the ability to cause code execution at 0xdeadbeef",
        "attack_vector": "A malicious actor can send a crafted email with an overlong email address in the `From:` or `To:` header to a target mailbox.",
         "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send email to an account which will then be accessed using a vulnerable version of php-imap."

        "root_cause": "The `imap_fetch_overview()` function attempts to write a potentially very long email address into a fixed-size buffer called `address`. The buffer size is determined by `MAILTMPLEN` which is 1024.",

          "Buffer overflow"

        "impact": "A very long `From:` or `To:` email address in a mailbox causes `imap_fetch_overview()` to crash.",
        "attack_vector": "A remote attacker could send a specially crafted email to an account and when the overview is fetched, the server crashes.",
