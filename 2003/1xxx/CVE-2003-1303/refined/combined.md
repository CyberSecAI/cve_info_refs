Combined patch for listed PHP bugs.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=175040#c3)  David Eisenstein    2006-01-17 23:07:48 UTC  ``` New Security bug:  CVE-2006-0208:    "Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in PHP 5.1.1 allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via unknown attack vectors in 'certain error conditions.'"  As a result, PHP has released PHP 5.1.2  <<http://www.php.net/release_5_1_2.php>>.  Red Hat has opened a bug for RHEL4, [Bug #178028](show_bug.cgi?id=178028 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2006-0208 PHP Cross Site Scripting (XSS) flaw").  Josh Bressers has determined that his affects PHP 5.1 and PHP 4.3 releases.  Josh also states that RHEL 3 and RHEL 2.1 are affected.  Josh says in [Bug #178028](show_bug.cgi?id=178028 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2006-0208 PHP Cross Site Scripting (XSS) flaw"), "The problem exists in the way PHP displays error messages.  This issue is only exploitable when 'display_errors' and 'html_errors' are both set to 'On' in the PHP configuration file.  When a HTML error message was being generated, the output was not properly sanitized, which could allow an attacker to insert arbitrary HTML, thus allowing a XSS attack.  "This issue is only exploitable if 'html_errors' is on, which the configuration file cleary states should not be used on production machines.  "I have verified this flaw exists in the PHP 4.3 and 5.1 branches."  RHEL 2.1 uses PHP 4.1.2.         RHL 7.3 uses PHP 4.1.2.                                  RHL 9   uses PHP 4.2.2. RHEL 3   uses PHP 4.3.2. RHEL 4   uses PHP 4.3.9.                                  FC1     uses PHP 4.3.11.                                  FC2     uses PHP 4.3.11.                                  FC3     uses PHP 4.3.11.  This issue therefore should affect RHL 7.3, RHL9, FC1, FC2, FC3.     ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=175040#c4)  Marc Deslauriers    2006-04-27 00:10:11 UTC  ``` The phpinfo() PHP function did not properly sanitize long strings. An attacker could use this to perform cross-site scripting attacks against sites that have publicly-available PHP scripts that call phpinfo(). ([CVE-2006-0996](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-0996))  The html_entity_decode() PHP function was found to not be binary safe. An attacker could use this flaw to disclose a certain part of the memory. In order for this issue to be exploitable the target site would need to have a PHP script which called the "html_entity_decode()" function with untrusted input from the user and displayed the result. ([CVE-2006-1490](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-1490))  The error handling output was found to not properly escape HTML output in certain cases. An attacker could use this flaw to perform cross-site scripting attacks against sites where both display_errors and html_errors are enabled. ([CVE-2006-0208](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-0208))  An input validation error was found in the "mb_send_mail()" function. An attacker could use this flaw to inject arbitrary headers in a mail sent via a script calling the "mb_send_mail()" function where the "To" parameter can be controlled by the attacker. ([CVE-2005-3883](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2005-3883))  A buffer overflow flaw was discovered in uw-imap, the University of Washington's IMAP Server. php-imap is compiled against the static c-client libraries from imap and therefore needed to be recompiled against the fixed version. This issue only affected Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3. ([CVE-2005-2933](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2005-2933)).   <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2006-0276.html>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=175040#c5)  Marc Deslauriers    2006-04-27 00:21:24 UTC  ``` John, is the bug you reported a security issue? Is there a CVE number for it?   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=175040#c6)  John Dalbec    2006-04-27 12:40:48 UTC  ``` I don't know of any CVE numbers.  I was able to modify the e-mail message in the above link to cause code execution at 0xdeadbeef, so I think it's at least potentially a security issue.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=175040#c7)  Marc Deslauriers    2006-04-30 23:09:16 UTC  ``` -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- Hash: SHA1  Here are updated packages to QA.  ab70ee5354cb74eada34ae7ac47de58d1c86b7e8  7.3/php-4.1.2-7.3.19.legacy.src.rpm f1d8a4ac3abd883e9d08f0ab2192b697df331788  9/php-4.2.2-17.20.legacy.src.rpm 71c935bd4983b07cb15fadc21d81323664e014e0  1/php-4.3.11-1.fc1.5.legacy.src.rpm 2d1b0533ea030ddd8b86ce2700720bc8ef25f547  2/php-4.3.11-1.fc2.6.legacy.src.rpm 2e40f983d095a4bb496abd8d5e03a5683ed3be93  3/php-4.3.11-2.8.2.legacy.src.rpm  Downloads:  <http://www.infostrategique.com/linuxrpms/legacy/7.3/php-4.1.2-7.3.19.legacy.src.rpm> <http://www.infostrategique.com/linuxrpms/legacy/9/php-4.2.2-17.20.legacy.src.rpm> <http://www.infostrategique.com/linuxrpms/legacy/1/php-4.3.11-1.fc1.5.legacy.src.rpm> <http://www.infostrategique.com/linuxrpms/legacy/2/php-4.3.11-1.fc2.6.legacy.src.rpm> <http://www.infostrategique.com/linuxrpms/legacy/3/php-4.3.11-2.8.2.legacy.src.rpm>  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1.4.3 (GNU/Linux)  iD8DBQFEVUXeLMAs/0C4zNoRAgqWAKCPaF6M/kdqV6YS9WxZjMbWGEmvugCffy7y UKTaPk2RxWEPNyat5tKefsA= =EYga -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----    ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=175040#c8)  Pekka Savola    2006-05-02 19:28:21 UTC  ``` RHEL21 update hasn't apparently been released yet, I hope there won't be patch mismatches..   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=175040#c9)  Marc Deslauriers    2006-05-02 20:54:47 UTC  ``` There will be, as I backported the patches to rh9 and rh73 myself.

Not sure whether it affects other versions.  2) php-4.1.2-php_imap.c.patch seems to be a bit different than php-4.1.2-bug24150.patch and php-4.3.2-bug24150.patch that RHEL shipped.   Are these fixing the same bug?  This might be applicable to RHL9 as well.  It might be best to use RHEL patches if feasible.  3) the patches for 2006-0996 seem OK compared to RHEL, there are a couple of minor diffs wrt TSRMLS_CC etc. those are probably OK.  4) the approach for 2006-0208 was different, and RHEL21 seemed a bit simpler (at least to verify :-).  If the RPMs would need to be redone, I'd recommend that approach.   Name 	[CVE-2006-1990](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-1990) (under review) Status 	Candidate Description 	Integer overflow in the wordwrap function in string.c in PHP 4.4.2 and 5.1.2 might allow context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via certain long arguments that cause a small buffer to be allocated, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow in a memcpy function call, a different vulnerability than [CVE-2002-1396](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2002-1396).

The Bugs that John specifically pointed out have the effect of causing imap_fetch_overview() to segfault when a mailbox contains a From: or To: header with an overlong email address.  (See [Comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=175040#c0)).  John has just indicated that the patch, php-4.1.2-bug24150.patch, included in one of the RHEL updates, fixed only 3 out of 4 of the bugs he noticed (See [comment #12](show_bug.cgi?id=175040#c12)).  I haven't myself had a chance to dig into the code, but I thought you might wish to know this.  Do you think there indeed is an (additional) code-execution vulnerability here?  Also, did the patched php packages released with RHSA-2006-0501 fix all of the vulnerabilities that need fixing in php?  Does a new CVE number need to be allocated or anything?  Thanks.   -David   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=175040#c14)  Josh Bressers    2006-06-01 02:15:04 UTC  ``` Hi David,  Thanks for the heads up on this.  These issues never seem to have gotten CVE ids.  We'll have to sort all this out (which versions fixed which bugs, which bugs are really dupes, etc.)  It does seem that upstream [bug 15595](show_bug.cgi?id=15595 "CLOSED NOTABUG - RH 7.0 beta 5 and Zip drives") isn't fixed in RHEL2.1.

Folks,  Looks like we need to issue new packages here, perhaps based on the RHEL packages with the patch <http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=15595> added in.  Do you want me to do it, Marc?  Jeff?  Are there any other outstanding issues? -Dave    ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=175040#c16)  Josh Bressers    2006-06-14 12:40:14 UTC  ``` ------- Additional Comments From jorton  2006-06-12 09:51 EST ------- Sorry for the slow response David.  Yes, I can reproduce a segfault with the test case for the upstream PR 15595 issue on the RHEL2.1 php.  Thanks for bringing this to our attention.   This will need a CVE name (the issue is from 2002!).    ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=175040#c17)  Josh Bressers    2006-06-14 12:41:05 UTC  ``` ------- Additional Comments From jorton  2006-06-12 10:33 EST -------   This patch is incremental to php-4.1.2-bug24150.patch and should fix the 15595 issue (tested to do so, and testing in no other way).     Joe, we lost this patch, can you re-add it?   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=175040#c18)  Joe Orton    2006-06-14 12:52:38 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 130838](attachment.cgi?id=130838&action=diff "the patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=130838&action=edit "the patch") the patch   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=175040#c19)  Marc Deslauriers    2006-06-15 00:25:12 UTC  ``` Thanks, I'll build new packages.   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=175040#c20)  Josh Bressers    2006-06-15 14:12:36 UTC  ``` I have CVE ids for these issues now:  <http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=15595>   [CVE-2002-2214](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2002-2214)  <http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=19280>   [CVE-2002-2215](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2002-2215)  <http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=22048>   [CVE-2003-1302](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2003-1302)  <http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=24150>   [CVE-2003-1303](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2003-1303)   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=175040#c21)  Marc Deslauriers    2006-06-24 21:33:46 UTC  ``` -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- Hash: SHA1  Here are updated packages to QA.  76199403c774945630d04838fa53e46891dd95d0  7.3/php-4.1.2-7.3.20.legacy.src.rpm d60f6afef3b9ff5f815e34d8a65162ce81141dc0  9/php-4.2.2-17.21.legacy.src.rpm 826b9f6353176f31561ae3410ca1357940478b15  1/php-4.3.11-1.fc1.6.legacy.src.rpm 5c81b01a9d51c864691cee6b36c1dab0fd69e831  2/php-4.3.11-1.fc2.7.legacy.src.rpm 4ce0c7fdfa9a7e9032bcdd2e1160da6a24d18ccb  3/php-4.3.11-2.8.3.legacy.src.rpm  Downloads:  <http://www.infostrategique.com/linuxrpms/legacy/7.3/php-4.1.2-7.3.20.legacy.src.rpm> <http://www.infostrategique.com/linuxrpms/legacy/9/php-4.2.2-17.21.legacy.src.rpm> <http://www.infostrategique.com/linuxrpms/legacy/1/php-4.3.11-1.fc1.6.legacy.src.rpm> <http://www.infostrategique.com/linuxrpms/legacy/2/php-4.3.11-1.fc2.7.legacy.src.rpm> <http://www.infostrategique.com/linuxrpms/legacy/3/php-4.3.11-2.8.3.legacy.src.rpm>  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1.4.3 (GNU/Linux)  iD8DBQFEnbJoLMAs/0C4zNoRAvZBAJ9MwJI9TpJsXlEeLU9yMkqlpKS4DwCgn2K0 AMZMZI3p9OxkOUvBQxNIGX0= =QuHz -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----    ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=175040#c22)  Pekka Savola    2006-06-30 06:13:01 UTC  ``` -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- Hash: SHA1   QA w/ rpm-build-compare.sh:  - source integrity good  - spec file changes minimal  - 1990 patch verified from RHEL and upstream, 0208 looks good.

commitsRelated reports  **[2003-06-12 09:59 UTC] [sniper@php.net](//people.php.net/sniper)** ``` Thank you for this bug report. To properly diagnose the problem, we need a backtrace to see what is happening behind the scenes. To find out how to generate a backtrace, please read <http://bugs.php.net/bugs-generating-backtrace.php>  Once you have generated a backtrace, please submit it to this bug report and change the status back to "Open". Thank you for helping us make PHP better.    ``` **[2003-06-16 08:33 UTC] nuno at co dot sapo dot pt** ``` (gdb) bt #0  0x80ed07a in zif_imap_fetch_overview (ht=1717791080, return_value=0x6a756479, this_ptr=0x636e626b, return_value_used=1785165933)     at /servers/sources/php-4.3.2/ext/imap/php_imap.c:224 #1  0x65796866 in ??

And remember to delete config.cache before running configure again.  Also, which c-client version are you using?   ``` **[2003-06-16 09:09 UTC] nuno at co dot sapo dot pt** ``` Checking imap_fetch_overview() function source code (php_imap.c, line 2666) we can see that the address variable is an array with a length of MAILTMPLEN (defined in phplib as 1024, I think).  Well, this from address has around 10k length, so seems obvious what's happening.  Why doesn't php truncate the from address as it does in imap_headerinfo() ?  Note: This is just speculation. I'm not really sure about what I'm talking about since I never looked at the php sources, and don't code C for some years now. :)  ``` **[2003-06-16 09:28 UTC] nuno at co dot sapo dot pt** ``` No, I didn't recompile it with --enable-debug. With PHP 4.3.2 I used an hacked c-client.  *But* before I submitted the bug I tryed it in my laptop which runs PHP 4.2.3 installed via apt-get and it also segfaulted.  $ dpkg -l php* | grep IMAP ii  php4-imap      4.2.3-9        IMAP module for php4  $ dpkg -S /usr/include/c-client/mail.h libc-client2001-dev: /usr/include/c-client/mail.h  ``` **[2003-06-16 12:43 UTC] [iliaa@php.net](//people.php.net/iliaa)** ``` This bug has been fixed in CVS.  In case this was a PHP problem, snapshots of the sources are packaged every three hours; this change will be in the next snapshot. You can grab the snapshot at <http://snaps.php.net/>.   In case this was a documentation problem, the fix will show up soon at <http://www.php.net/manual/>.  In case this was a PHP.net website problem, the change will show up on the PHP.net site and on the mirror sites in short time.   Thank you for the report, and for helping us make PHP better.    ``` |
