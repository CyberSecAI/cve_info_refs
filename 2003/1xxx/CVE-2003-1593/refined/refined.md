      "details": "The provided document describes multiple vulnerabilities and fixes in the Novell NetWare FTP Server (NWFTPD.NLM), and some of them are related to buffer overflows caused by overly long commands. Specifically, the following entries relate to a buffer overflow vulnerability:\n\n*   **NWFTPD.NLM 5.10.02, March 9, 2011:**\n    *   **Root cause:** FTP clients could submit lengthy commands causing a buffer overflow in NWFTPD's command buffer, leading to stack corruption.\n    *   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability.\n    *   **Impact of exploitation:** Individual FTP session threads could crash. In some cases, a severe abend could occur, requiring a system restart.\n    *   **Attack vectors:** Sending specially crafted, lengthy FTP commands.\n    *  **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  Attacker needs to be able to connect to the FTP server and send commands. It does not require authentication.\n\n*   **NWFTPD.NLM 5.10.01, March 26, 2010:**\n    *   **Root cause:** Similar to the 5.10.02 fix, this addresses lengthy commands that could cause a buffer overflow and stack corruption.\n    *   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability.\n    *   **Impact of exploitation:** Individual FTP session threads could crash and in some cases a severe abend might cause system restart.\n    *   **Attack vectors:** Sending crafted lengthy FTP commands.\n    *  **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  Attacker needs to be able to connect to the FTP server and send commands. It does not require authentication.\n\nThe document also describes other fixes that do not appear to be directly related to buffer overflows, but are related to other types of vulnerabilities and operational issues of the FTP server, like:\n\n*   Issues related to the 'pwd' command returning duplicate paths.\n*   Abends due to manual alteration of the FTPSERV.CFG file.\n*   Incorrect enforcement of the 'NOREMOTE' restriction.\n*   Security issues related to partial matches of container names in the 'ftprest.txt' file.\n*   Inability to report large file sizes.\n*   Abends when unloading multiple instances of the FTP server.\n*   Incorrect eDir subtree searching.\n*   Issues with the MDTM command and large path names.\n*   Issues with TransmitFile API usage.\n*   Low-risk security issue related to passwords (not detailed)\n*   Other issues that affect multi-IP address servers, home directories, connection management, logging, etc.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe document provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description, including specific versions, dates, bugzilla IDs, and detailed explanations of the fixes.  It shows that there were multiple buffer overflow issues due to long commands being sent to the FTP server, resulting in potential server crashes.\n\n"
