Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2003-1447:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the use of a weak obfuscation algorithm to protect passwords within the XML configuration export feature of IBM WebSphere Advanced Server Edition 4.0.4.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **Weak Password Obfuscation:** The passwords in the exported XML configuration file are "obfuscated" using a simple XOR operation with the underscore character "_" and then Base64 encoded. This method is easily reversible.
-   **Exposure of Sensitive Information:**  The exported XML file contains credentials needed to access keying material and data sources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   An attacker who obtains a copy of the exported XML configuration file can easily deobfuscate passwords, gaining unauthorized access to password-protected resources. This could lead to unauthorized access to databases and other sensitive parts of the system.
- The impact is categorized as partial loss of confidentiality, with no impact on integrity or availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Local Access:** The primary attack vector is local. An attacker would require access to the system where the configuration is exported to obtain the exported configuration file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   The attacker must have access to the exported XML configuration file, which is typically located on the same system where WebSphere is running. The attacker does not need authentication to exploit the vulnerability once they have the configuration file.
-   The attacker needs to be able to Base64 decode and XOR the characters of the password to decrypt.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Software:** IBM WebSphere Advanced Server Edition 4.0.4 is specifically listed as vulnerable. It's also suggested that other versions might be affected.
*   **CVSS Metrics:** The provided CVSS v2 metrics are:
    *   AV:L (Local Attack Vector)
    *   AC:M (Medium Attack Complexity)
    *   Au:N (No Authentication Required)
    *   C:P (Partial Confidentiality Impact)
    *   I:N (No Integrity Impact)
    *   A:N (No Availability Impact)
    *   Base Score: 1.9/10
    *   Impact Subscore: 2.9/10
    *   Exploitability Subscore: 3.4/10
*   **Workaround:** Administrators are advised to export configuration files to administrator-accessible directories and delete these files after use.
*   **Deobfuscation:** The content explicitly lays out the deobfuscation process: Base64 decode the password, then XOR each character with the underscore character to reveal the actual password.
