# Topic: WebSphere Advanced Server Edition 4.0.4
# Subject: Insufficient Password Protection in
# Configuration Export
# Author: Jan P. Monsch
# Date: February 3, 2003
#
#############################################################
Problem:
--------
Passwords in WebSphere XML configruation export are not sufficiently
protected. If the exported configuration gets into the hands of a
malicous user, he or she can deobfuscated passworts easily and can gain
access to the password protected resources.
Workaround:
-----------
Administrators should take care that they export the configuration to an
administrator accessible directory only and destroy the export file
after use.
Vulnerable:
-----------
- WebServer Advanced Server 4.0.4
- other versions might be vulnerable as well
Not vulnerable:
---------------
- Unknown
Details:
--------
WebSphere Advanced Server Edition 4.0.4 offers a management
functionality which allows an administrator to export the whole
WebSphere configuration as an XML file. The export includes passwords
needed for accessing keying material and data sources:
<jdbc-driver action="update" name="Sample DB Driver">
...
<config-properties>
<property name="serverName" value=""/>
<property name="password" value="{xor}KD4sa28="/>
<property name="portNumber" value=""/>
<property name="databaseName" value="was40"/>
<property name="user" value="was40"/>
<property name="disable2Phase" value="true"/>
<property name="ifxIFXHOST" value=""/>
<property name="URL" value=""/>
<property name="informixLockModeWait" value=""/>
</config-properties>
</data-source>
These passwords are obfuscated and Base64Encoded. Those areas obfuacated
are marked with the {XOR}-prefix.
The obfuscation algorithm is as follows:
- CHARobfuscated(n) = CHARpassword(n) XOR CHAR("\_"),where n is the
position of the character
- ObfuscatedPasswordBase64Encoded = Base64Encode(ObfuscatedPassword)
Deobfuscation process:
- ObfuscatedPassword = Base64Decode(ObfuscatedPasswordBase64Encoded)
- CHARpassword(n) = CHARobfuscated(n) XOR CHAR("\_")
