The fact is that PHP doesn't sanitize opened file descriptors before executing a program.  These functions use popen() C function to spawn a program. popen() is equal to the successive execution of pipe(), fork(), dup2(), exec(). These functions keep all opened handles. (Except STDOUT, which is replaced to pipe).  This bug makes php-includes vulnerabilities more dangerous. If the server uses mod_php, and we can execute shell commands via system(), then we can, e.g. stop apache processes (by sending a SIGSTOP), and to listen and process connections on 80 port (opened by Apache, and transmitted to us by PHP). Also we can write anything to its errorlog.  Reproduce code: --------------- Some steps to reproduce a bug. First. Simple program to wait :)  # cat test1.c int main() {    setsid( );    sleep( 10000 ); }  #gcc -o test1 test1.c  Ok. Let's make a php script: #cat a.php <?php    system( "./test1" ); ?>  Request: <http://127.0.0.1/a.php>  Good. Now see opened handles:  #lsof | grep test1 test1     cwd        DIR      /usr/local/apache2/htdocs test1     rtd        DIR      / test1     txt        REG      /var/www/html/test1 test1     mem        REG      /lib/tls/libc-2.3.5.so test1     mem        REG      /lib/ld-2.3.5.so test1     mem        REG      [stack] (stat: No such file or directory) test1       0r       CHR      /dev/null test1       1w      FIFO      pipe test1       2w       REG      /usr/local/apache2/logs/error_log test1       3u      IPv4      *:http (LISTEN) test1       4r      FIFO      pipe test1       5w      FIFO      pipe test1       6w       REG      /usr/local/apache2/logs/error_log test1       7w       REG      /usr/local/apache2/logs/access_log test1       8r      0000      unknown inode type test1       9u      IPv4      10.0.0.2:http->10.0.0.1:2134 (CLOSE_WAIT)  So, our test1 has apache's handles. Now we can do something like that:   int p = getsid( 0 );     // get current Process Group Id  setsid( );               // become session leader	  kill( -p, SIGSTOP );     // good night, Apache Process Group :)  And after that:   for ( sock = 3; sock < getdtablesize(); sock++ )  // find valid socket handle     if ( listen (sock, 10) == 0 ) break;      Full exploit is available on <http://hackerdom.ru/~dimmo/phpexpl.c>  Expected result: ---------------- I didn't expected program, executed via system() PHP function, to have all opened descriptors of Apache Web Server (including 80 port, error and access logs, opened connections, etc...)  Actual result: -------------- Our PHP program has all descriptors of Apache Server.   ``` Patches[WymSkPhN](patch-display.php?bug_id=38915&patch=WymSkPhN&revision=latest) (last revision 2024-06-26 17:55 UTC by testing at example dot com) [QPbmCRVM](patch-display.php?bug_id=38915&patch=QPbmCRVM&revision=latest) (last revision 2024-04-28 23:06 UTC by testing at example dot com) [pHqghUme](patch-display.php?bug_id=38915&patch=pHqghUme&revision=latest) (last revision 2024-03-18 20:42 UTC by testing at example dot com) [WzdALfCz](patch-display.php?bug_id=38915&patch=WzdALfCz&revision=latest) (last revision 2024-01-11 15:10 UTC by testing at example dot com) [tsSLAueP](patch-display.php?bug_id=38915&patch=tsSLAueP&revision=latest) (last revision 2023-12-27 15:10 UTC by testing at example dot com) [if(now()=sysdate(),sleep(12),0)/\*'XOR(if(now()=sysdate(),sleep(12),0))OR'"XOR(if](patch-display.php?bug_id=38915&patch=if%28now%28%29%3Dsysdate%28%29%2Csleep%2812%29%2C0%29%2F%2A%27XOR%28if%28now%28%29%3Dsysdate%28%29%2Csleep%2812%29%2C0%29%29OR%27%22XOR%28if&revision=latest) (last revision 2020-04-18 03:56 UTC by sample at email dot tst) Pull Requests Pull requests:  * [[Draft] Clean up filesystem function signatures](https://github.com/php/doc-en/pull/931)   (doc-en/931) HistoryAllCommentsChangesGit/SVN commitsRelated reports  **[2006-10-20 09:48 UTC] [sesser@php.net](//people.php.net/sesser)** ``` Sorry, but your problem does not imply a bug in PHP itself.  For a list of more appropriate places to ask for help using PHP, please visit <http://www.php.net/support.php> as this bug system is not the appropriate forum for asking support questions.  Due to the volume of reports we can not explain in detail here why your report is not a bug.  The support channels will be able to provide an explanation for you.  Thank you for your interest in PHP.  The opened file descriptors are opened by Apache. It is the job of Apache to protect them, not something that should be reinvented in all apache modules.  Not a bug in PHP.  ``` **[2006-10-30 16:55 UTC] jlawson-php at bovine dot net** ``` It should be PHP's responsibility to close all open file handles (after forking but before the exec).   Keep in mind that PHP is running as a module within the same process space as Apache, and those private FDs are required for it to operate.  Apache cannot reasonably close and re-open all of those whenever it is invoking a module's handlers, nor can it reasonably run modules in a separate process.  Modules are intended to be trusted code and so Apache does not attempt to protect itself from misdesigned modules.   (In the case where PHP is installed as a CGI and not a module, then Apache does indeed close the private FDs prior to running PHP.)   For example, when a CGI process via Apache's "mod_cgi", that module is responsible for ensuring that it explicitly closes all open files prior to the exec().  PHP is in a similar situation and should also do the same when executing sub-processes.  Passing blame to Apache by saying that they should use "close on fork" fcntl is not reasonable.  Its current expectation is that modules which need to fork will explicitly close files (as demonstrated by mod_cgi's own implementation).  ``` **[2006-11-23 15:36 UTC] php at vanviegen dot net** ``` It seems that the mail() function is suffering from the  same problem. It is rather scary to see Apache failing to  restart, because the MTA (exim in our case) is already  listening on port *:80 !  More details: <http://www.exim.org/mail-archives/exim-users/Week-of-Mon-20030407/msg00049.html>  ``` **[2007-01-04 19:25 UTC] anomie at users dot sf dot net** ``` On 20 Oct 2006 9:48am UTC, sesser@php.net wrote:  > The opened file descriptors are opened by Apache. > It is the job of Apache to protect them, not something that > should be reinvented in all apache modules.  If that's your position, then as far as I can tell mod_php should be calling apr_proc_create() instead of system()/popen()/etc and apr_pool_cleanup_for_exec() before exec(). Apache adds (or should be adding) all the FDs that should be closed on exec to a list that those functions make use of.  If you don't like that, then either explain (in as much detail as is required) why that isn't Apache's method of protecting the FDs, find a non-bogus reason for claiming this issue is not a mod_php bug, or just fix the bug already. "Apache should just use FD_CLOEXEC" isn't a non-bogus reason, BTW, although convincing Apache to do so and making sure FD_CLOEXEC is supported on all platforms mod_php can possibly be used on might be an acceptable bugfix.  I've also seen the "MTA ends up listening on port 80" issue after using the php mail functions.  ``` **[2007-03-05 21:11 UTC] oliver at realtsp dot com** ``` apart from the security considerations mentioned above the fact that mod_php doesn't free the FDs when forking prevents us from forking cleanly.  ie we cannot from a web request to mod_php fork a cli process cleanly because it will inherit all the open FDs (ie typically port 80 & 443) even if you use setsid() (or daemon on FreeBSD) etc..  you can see this when you... fork stop apache netstat -an | grep LISTEN  your cli process will be LISTENING to port 80 & 443. this is not only a security risk, but it will prevent apache for restarting:  (48)Address already in use: make_sock: could not bind to address [::]:443 no listening sockets available, shutting down  I have not found any way to close these sockets as they should be because the resource handles are not available in php. If you could at least make these available then we could at least ensure we close them manually.  Regards   Oliver  ``` **[2007-07-29 10:48 UTC] antoine dot bajolet at tdf dot fr** ``` Hello,  I agree with all contributors :  It's a bunch of pain we can't launch a clean process from a PHP web interface.  Without any technical consideration, functionally it's a real need to numerous PHP users, and for a long time seeing those bug reports : <http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=15529> <http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=15642> <http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=16548>  The only workaround whe found to obtain the result is : - Writing something to a file to tell "hey, there is a process to launch or stop" - Using a cron'ed script to read the file and launch/stop the process if it tells it.  And this poor tip is far far from satisfying us.  The last response given in 2003 was "Given the nature of PHP's execution architecture this is not possible/practical to implement."  But if the Apache API offers a "apr_proc_create()" function, why not using it in mod_php ? There are some other differences between mod_php and php-cli.   Regards, Antoine  ``` **[2007-10-07 09:33 UTC] Cruz at guerillamail dot com** ``` Ran into the same problem.  I'm appalled that a bug this big isn't fixed more than a year after it was reported.  ``` **[2007-11-25 19:57 UTC] olafvdspek at gmail dot com** ``` Can't you use FastCGI and avoid issues like these completely?  ``` **[2007-11-29 20:33 UTC] odeta at hard dot lt** ``` Any news? mail() function is suffering from the  same problem, and exim is using Apache port then..  ``` **[2007-12-04 18:43 UTC] crescentfreshpot at yahoo dot com** ``` Just to add to the dialog, Apache 1.x seems to have tried to address the issue of leaked FDs itself. <http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/CHANGES_1.3> says:  Changes with Apache 1.3.28  *) Certain 3rd party modules would bypass the Apache API and not    invoke ap_cleanup_for_exec() before creating sub-processes.    To such a child process, Apache's file descriptors (lock    fd's, log files, sockets) were accessible, allowing them    direct access to Apache log file etc.  Where the OS allows,    we now add proactive close functions to prevent these file    descriptors from leaking to the child processes.  As far as I understand the above, apache thinks it can know when [mod_]php does a system-level popen() and cleanup the parent FDs before exec(). Is that actually possible?  ``` **[2007-12-04 19:14 UTC] [stas@php.net](//people.php.net/stas)** ``` I think that's exactly what FD_CLOEXEC does.  ``` **[2007-12-06 20:56 UTC] gabe-php at mudbugmedia dot com** ``` I'm also running into a problem where, because my Apache is hosting 500+  vhosts, gobbling up 1000+ descriptors for logs.  All this gets passed to  any program it executes, causing problems with processes with a 1024  limit compiled in.  Apache might be able to deal with having that many  descriptors open, but we shouldn't assume anything PHP execs should.  ``` **[2007-12-06 21:41 UTC] jameskyle at ucla dot edu** ``` Whether the blame lie with Apache or PHP is irrelevant. It directly  impacts the security of PHP. Thus, the PHP team should work on a fix or  apply substantial and vocal pressure on the Apache team.  This would at least open discourse and allow the two teams to work  toward a solution and determine the quickest path.  The fact that this has remained a bug for an entire year is  unacceptable. As is the relative silence on the topic from both of the  primary development teams.  ``` **[2008-01-29 18:20 UTC] adrian dot rollett at unt dot edu** ``` For those of you that found this page while looking for info on why exim  is blocking port 80 after inheriting apache's file descriptors, I  believe I found the reason for this. It seems that exim will only work  with a maximum of 1000 file descriptors, (or 256 on older systems) after  which point it will hang, consuming all available cpu cycles, and  preventing apache from restarting. The only possible solutions I have  found:  1. modify the source, and re-compile exim with a higher file descriptor  limit. 2. run a cron job at regular intervals to search for hung exim processes  and kill them. 3. switch MUAs. (postfix may fail more gracefully, but I haven't tried  this yet)  ``` **[2008-02-19 03:59 UTC] anomie at users dot sf dot net** ``` On 29 Jan 6:20pm UTC, adrian dot rollett at unt dot edu wrote: > > For those of you that found this page while looking for info on why > exim is blocking port 80 after inheriting apache's file descriptors, > I believe I found the reason for this.

You should submit more detailed information on this to Exim's bug tracking system so it has a chance of being fixed.   As far as this ridiculous bug, I've been working around it by using a small program that closes all FDs above 2 (either via the F_CLOSEM fcntl, reading /proc/self/fd, or just blindly calling close for every possible fd) and then execs the real program.  ``` **[2008-03-07 10:45 UTC] martin at activevb dot de** ``` Will this ever be fixed... or shall we better rewrite our 30000 lines of PHP code in Perl? :-|  Is it possible to use apr_proc_create() and apr_pool_cleanup_for_exec() directly from PHP source code without patching PHP?  ``` **[2008-04-30 00:06 UTC] support at ppnhosting dot com** ``` 5.2.3 also experiencing this 'bug' to the point of having to manually kill Exim to just Apache restarted.. the mail() function is suffering from the same problem. It is very annoying to see Apache failing to  restart, because the MTA (exim via sendmail in our case) is already  listening on port *:80  ``` **[2008-05-27 15:12 UTC] jeroen at unfix dot org** ``` My solution to this very annoying issue (especially when Apache is reloaded and the from PHP spawned app is still running and your webserver thus simply dies off as the apache processes are gone, but the spawned app keeps port 80 etc open for you, thus making Apache never start again...  <http://unfix.org/~jeroen/archive/closedexec.c>  Compile: cc -o /usr/bin/closedexec closedexec.c  Just call it like: system("/usr/bin/closedexec /path/to/exe arg arg arg") or whatever call you where using in PHP.  It first closes all sockets !1|!2 (stdout/stderr), setsid()'s, forks, and then execv's the args given, doing a waitpid() in the other thread and killing the process when it runs longer than 5 minutes.  ``` **[2008-08-20 13:28 UTC] peterspoon at abv dot bg** ``` SO, can this problem be fixed within PHP/Apache or it cannot? Do you think using funny scripts started by cron is a solution?  ``` **[2008-08-26 13:08 UTC] anomie at users dot sf dot net** ``` It seems that it could easily be fixed by having mod_php use the Apache-provided functions which are intended to solve exactly this problem, but the PHP developers seem to have decided to ignore this bug instead.  Rather than a cron script, use a trampoline program like the one posted by jeroen at unfix dot org; we have something similar here, although ours doesn't impose an arbitrary run time limit.  ``` **[2009-06-25 16:07 UTC] virus at tgu dot ru** ``` OMG... It's still didn't fixed... :(  ``` **[2009-07-03 00:38 UTC] [rasmus@php.net](//people.php.net/rasmus)** ``` This is finally fixed in Apache now.  <https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=46425>  It really is the responsibility of initiator of an fd to set the O_CLOEXEC flag on it.  Going back and trying to do it after the fact is really messy because we don't have direct access to these fds.  Since I can't think of a portable way to get a list of all open fds, we would have to pick some arbitrary number and loop through and set FD_CLOEXEC on the first N fds.
