The provided content describes a vulnerability in PHP's `exec`, `system`, `popen`, and similar functions when used within a web server environment like Apache with `mod_php`. The core issue is that when these functions are used to execute external programs, the spawned processes inherit all the open file descriptors of the webserver (e.g. Apache) process including network sockets, log files, and other resources.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- PHP's `exec`, `system`, and `popen` functions utilize the `popen()` C function to spawn external programs.
- `popen()` does not sanitize open file descriptors before execution.
- Child processes inherit all open file descriptors from the parent (Apache).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **File Descriptor Leakage:** Executed programs inherit the webserver's file descriptors, including listening sockets (e.g., port 80).
- **Security Risk:** This leakage allows a malicious script executed through PHP to potentially:
    - Access and write to the web server's log files.
    - Listen on the webserver's port and handle network traffic.
    - Send signals to the webserver processes, potentially halting them.
    - Exploit other open resources.
- **Operational Issues:** Inherited file descriptors can prevent the web server from restarting, as the spawned process may still be listening on the port and the child process may have limited number of FD's available.
- **Resource Exhaustion:** Having a large number of open file descriptors can lead to resource issues within spawned processes.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service:** An attacker could shut down the webserver by sending a `SIGSTOP` signal to the Apache process group.
- **Data Exposure:** An attacker could write to the web serverâ€™s log files.
- **Server Compromise:** An attacker could listen on port 80 and take over the webserver.

**Attack vectors:**

- Exploiting vulnerabilities in PHP scripts to execute arbitrary shell commands through vulnerable functions (e.g., `system()`).
- Utilizing the ability to execute shell commands via `system()` or similar functions to take control of the server's resources.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the server. This is usually achieved through a PHP vulnerability such as a file inclusion vulnerability, a code injection vulnerability, or similar.
- The attacker must be able to control the parameters passed to the vulnerable PHP functions such as `system()`, `exec()`, or `popen()`.
- The attacker must have access to the web server's file system in order to execute code.

The provided content indicates this issue is not a bug in PHP itself, but rather in how PHP interacts with Apache and how Apache manages file descriptors. It suggests that the issue is related to the fact that Apache's open file descriptors are not automatically closed upon execution of external scripts by mod_php. The comments suggest that the use of `FD_CLOEXEC` or Apache's `apr_proc_create` function could mitigate the vulnerability.

Several workarounds are mentioned, including using wrapper scripts or modifying the source code to close file descriptors before execution. However, the core issue stems from PHP not explicitly closing all open file handles after forking but before executing the external process.
