## Apple Mac OS X "cd9660.util" buffer overflow

#### Vulnerability Note VU#878526

Original Release Date: 2004-03-15 | Last Revised: 2004-03-15

---

### Overview

A component utility in Apple's Mac OS X operating system suffers from a buffer overflow vulnerability in its handling of command-line arguments. This vulnerability could allow a local attacker to gain elevated privileges on the vulnerable system.

### Description

| [Apple](http://www.apple.com/)'s [Mac OS X](http://www.apple.com/macosx/) operating system includes a program for mounting, probing, and unmounting ISO 9660 filesystems called cd9660.util (/System/Library/Filesystems/cd9660.fs/cd9660.util). A buffer overflow defect exists in the handling of the argument supplied to the '-p' option of this program. An overly long, specially crafted string supplied on the command-line may allow an attacker to execute code of their choosing on the system. The intruder-supplied code would be executed as the root user since the cd9660.util program is setuid to root by default. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A local attacker may be able to gain administrative (root) privileges on the vulnerable system. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply a patch from the vendor**  Apple Computer, Inc. has released patches for this vulnerability. Please see the Systems Affected section of this document for more details. |
| --- |

| **Workarounds**  Remove the setuid permission from the cd9660.util program. This can be accomplished by executing the following command:chmod u-s /System/Library/Filesystems/cd9660.fs/cd9660.utilas root. Users, particularly those that are not able to apply the patches, are encouraged to implement this workaround. |
