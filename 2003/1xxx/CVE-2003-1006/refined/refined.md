- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A buffer overflow exists in the `cd9660.util` program when handling the argument supplied to the `-p` option.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The `cd9660.util` program has a buffer overflow vulnerability. It is setuid to root by default, meaning it runs with elevated privileges.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local attacker can execute arbitrary code with root privileges, gaining administrative access to the vulnerable system.
- **Attack vectors**: A local attacker provides an overly long, specially crafted string as an argument to the `-p` option of the `cd9660.util` program.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have local access to the vulnerable system to execute the `cd9660.util` program.
