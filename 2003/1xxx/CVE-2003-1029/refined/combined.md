| Summary:  multiple vulnerabilities.                                    |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------+

  EnGarde Secure Linux is an enterprise class Linux platform engineered
  to enable corporations to quickly and cost-effectively build a complete
  and secure Internet presence while preventing Internet threats.

OVERVIEW
- --------
  Several buffer overflows were recently discovered in tcpdump, a program
  used for inspecting network traffic.  By sending specially constructed
  packets across the wire a malicious remote attacker could cause tcpdump
  to crash or potentially run arbitrary code as the user under which
  tcpdump was being run.

  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
  assigned the following names to these issues:

    CAN-2004-0057 -- The rawprint function in the ISAKMP decoding
      routines (print-isakmp.c) for tcpdump 3.8.1 and earlier allows
      remote attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation fault)
      via malformed ISAKMP packets that cause invalid "len" or "loc"
      values to be used in a loop, a different vulnerability than
      CAN-2003-0989.

    CAN-2003-0989 -- tcpdump before 3.8.1 allows remote attackers to
      cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via certain ISAKMP
      packets, a different vulnerability than CAN-2004-0057.

    CAN-2003-1029 -- The L2TP protocol parser in tcpdump 3.8.1 and earlier
      allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop
      and memory consumption) via a packet with invalid data to UDP port
      1701, which causes l2tp_avp_print to use a bad length value when
      calling print_octets.

  Guardian Digital products affected by this issue include:

    EnGarde Secure Community v1.0.1
    EnGarde Secure Community 2
    EnGarde Secure Professional v1.1
    EnGarde Secure Professional v1.2
    EnGarde Secure Professional v1.5

  It is recommended that all users apply this update as soon as possible.

  affected systems by accessing their account from within the Guardian

In-Reply-To: <3FE4CAC1.8010306@freebsd.lublin.pl>

When an l2tp control packet is sent with optional bits set but containing invalid \
data, l2tp_avp_print() is passed this bad data. Then, l2tp_avp_print() calls itself \
and continues an infinite loop of passing bad data to itself.

I had the consistent results sending:
\x82 (control+length bits)
\0x02 (version) then 10 bytes of zeros.

This is in print-l2tp.c
Lines: ~566-616

After commenting out (breaking the infinite loop):
~609: l2tp_avp_print(dat + len, length - len);
I was no longer able to crash tcpdump.

Obviously, properly validating the input is the real solution.

Tested on: OpenBSD 3.3 and 3.4
tcpdump: 3.4.0
libpcap" 0.5

Thanks,
Mike

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

	System      : OpenBSD 3.3
	Architecture: OpenBSD.i386
	Machine     : i386
>Description:
	Sending a packet containg 0xff,0x02 bytes to port 1701/udp causes
	a L2TP protocol parser in tcpdump to enter an infinite loop, eating
	all available memory and then segfaulting.

	This bug also affects tcpdump in -CURRENT.
>How-To-Repeat:
	tcpdump -i lo0 -n udp and dst port 1701 &
	perl -e 'print "\xff\x02"' | nc -u localhost 1701
>Fix:
	Unknown, recent versions of tcpdump are immune to this problem.

Subject:    [tcpdump-workers] Seg fault of tcpdump (v 3.8.1 and below) with malformed l2tp packets
From:       [MH <procana () insight ! rr ! com>](?a=102848704400001&r=1&w=2)
Date:       [2003-12-24 15:20:44](?l=tcpdump-workers&r=1&w=2&b=200312)
[Download RAW [message](?l=tcpdump-workers&m=107228187124962&q=mbox) or [body](?l=tcpdump-workers&m=107228187124962&q=raw)]

The initial report came from Przemyslaw Frasunek regarding a crash of tcpdump
on OpenBSD with a malformed l2tp packet.  However, I have found versions of tcpdump
up to 3.8.1 vulnerable to other malformed l2tp packets.  The results range
from sending tcpdump into an infinite loop to forcing it to seg fault.

The issue is with the way the l2tp_avp_print() and print_octets() functions in
file print-l2tp.c handle input.  In particular it seems this is in its handling of a bad
length value.  Even if the control message packet does not specify a length
option (violation of RFC 2661) tcpdump will still try to interpret the  length field
instead of  raising an error/shunning due to this malformed packet.  The seg fault
occurs when l2tp_avp_print() passes a bad length argument to print_octets() and sends
it looping until it segfaults.

The first test sent tcpdump into an infinite loop because the l2tp_avp_print()
function calls itself and passes bad data.

Test 1:
perl -e 'print .\x80\x02...\x00.x6 | nc -u 10.1.1.1 1701

The second test seg faulted tcpdump because l2tp_avp_print() passes bad data
to print_octets().

Test 2:
perl -e 'print .\x80\x00...\x00.x6 . .\x01.' | nc -u 10.1.1.1 1701

uP: i386
tcpdump: (up to 3.8.1)
libpcap: 0.7.2
os: Linux
I have not been able to seg fault tcpdump on OpenBSD.  And, the infinite looping
does not occur on OpenBSD after applying Otto Moerbeek's patch.

Can anyone else reproduce these results?

Thanks,
Mike
