Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2003-1571:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

   - The exploit-db.com content explicitly mentions "CVE: [2003-1571](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2003-1571)" linking to the official CVE page, confirming relevance.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

   - **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the fact that the Microsoft Access database file (`WWGguestbook.mdb`) used by Web Wiz Guestbook v8.21 is directly accessible via a web browser. The webserver is not correctly configured to prevent direct access to this file.
   - **Weakness:** Unrestricted access to the database file allows unauthorized users to download the database.
   - **Impact of Exploitation:** Attackers can obtain sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, guestbook entries, and other potentially private data stored in the database.
   - **Attack Vector:** The attack vector is via a direct HTTP request to the vulnerable database file: `http://site.com/[Path]/database/WWGguestbook.mdb`
   - **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker only needs to know or discover the path to the database file on the web server. No authentication or other special access is required.

**3. Additional Details (from Exploit-DB):**

   -  **Vulnerable Application:** Web Wiz Guestbook v8.21.
   -  **Platform:** ASP (Active Server Pages).
   - **Dork:**  `webwizguestbook_license.asp`. This Google dork can be used to find vulnerable websites.

**Summary:**

CVE-2003-1571 describes a direct database disclosure vulnerability in Web Wiz Guestbook v8.21. By directly accessing the Microsoft Access database file, attackers can download the entire database, exposing sensitive information. This is due to misconfiguration of the webserver, which does not block direct access to the database file. This vulnerability is easily exploitable by any remote unauthenticated attacker who knows the path to the vulnerable database file.
