As a result, PHP has released PHP 5.1.2  <<http://www.php.net/release_5_1_2.php>>.  Red Hat has opened a bug for RHEL4, [Bug #178028](show_bug.cgi?id=178028 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2006-0208 PHP Cross Site Scripting (XSS) flaw").  Josh Bressers has determined that his affects PHP 5.1 and PHP 4.3 releases.  Josh also states that RHEL 3 and RHEL 2.1 are affected.  Josh says in [Bug #178028](show_bug.cgi?id=178028 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2006-0208 PHP Cross Site Scripting (XSS) flaw"), "The problem exists in the way PHP displays error messages.  This issue is only exploitable when 'display_errors' and 'html_errors' are both set to 'On' in the PHP configuration file.  When a HTML error message was being generated, the output was not properly sanitized, which could allow an attacker to insert arbitrary HTML, thus allowing a XSS attack.  "This issue is only exploitable if 'html_errors' is on, which the configuration file cleary states should not be used on production machines.  "I have verified this flaw exists in the PHP 4.3 and 5.1 branches."  RHEL 2.1 uses PHP 4.1.2.         RHL 7.3 uses PHP 4.1.2.                                  RHL 9   uses PHP 4.2.2. RHEL 3   uses PHP 4.3.2. RHEL 4   uses PHP 4.3.9.                                  FC1     uses PHP 4.3.11.                                  FC2     uses PHP 4.3.11.                                  FC3     uses PHP 4.3.11.  This issue therefore should affect RHL 7.3, RHL9, FC1, FC2, FC3.     ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=175040#c4)  Marc Deslauriers    2006-04-27 00:10:11 UTC  ``` The phpinfo() PHP function did not properly sanitize long strings. An attacker could use this to perform cross-site scripting attacks against sites that have publicly-available PHP scripts that call phpinfo(). ([CVE-2006-0996](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-0996))  The html_entity_decode() PHP function was found to not be binary safe. An attacker could use this flaw to disclose a certain part of the memory. In order for this issue to be exploitable the target site would need to have a PHP script which called the "html_entity_decode()" function with untrusted input from the user and displayed the result. ([CVE-2006-1490](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-1490))  The error handling output was found to not properly escape HTML output in certain cases. An attacker could use this flaw to perform cross-site scripting attacks against sites where both display_errors and html_errors are enabled. ([CVE-2006-0208](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-0208))  An input validation error was found in the "mb_send_mail()" function. An attacker could use this flaw to inject arbitrary headers in a mail sent via a script calling the "mb_send_mail()" function where the "To" parameter can be controlled by the attacker. ([CVE-2005-3883](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2005-3883))  A buffer overflow flaw was discovered in uw-imap, the University of Washington's IMAP Server. php-imap is compiled against the static c-client libraries from imap and therefore needed to be recompiled against the fixed version. This issue only affected Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3. ([CVE-2005-2933](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2005-2933)).   <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2006-0276.html>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=175040#c5)  Marc Deslauriers    2006-04-27 00:21:24 UTC  ``` John, is the bug you reported a security issue? Is there a CVE number for it?   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=175040#c6)  John Dalbec    2006-04-27 12:40:48 UTC  ``` I don't know of any CVE numbers.  I was able to modify the e-mail message in the above link to cause code execution at 0xdeadbeef, so I think it's at least potentially a security issue.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=175040#c7)  Marc Deslauriers    2006-04-30 23:09:16 UTC  ``` -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- Hash: SHA1  Here are updated packages to QA.  ab70ee5354cb74eada34ae7ac47de58d1c86b7e8  7.3/php-4.1.2-7.3.19.legacy.src.rpm f1d8a4ac3abd883e9d08f0ab2192b697df331788  9/php-4.2.2-17.20.legacy.src.rpm 71c935bd4983b07cb15fadc21d81323664e014e0  1/php-4.3.11-1.fc1.5.legacy.src.rpm 2d1b0533ea030ddd8b86ce2700720bc8ef25f547  2/php-4.3.11-1.fc2.6.legacy.src.rpm 2e40f983d095a4bb496abd8d5e03a5683ed3be93  3/php-4.3.11-2.8.2.legacy.src.rpm  Downloads:  <http://www.infostrategique.com/linuxrpms/legacy/7.3/php-4.1.2-7.3.19.legacy.src.rpm> <http://www.infostrategique.com/linuxrpms/legacy/9/php-4.2.2-17.20.legacy.src.rpm> <http://www.infostrategique.com/linuxrpms/legacy/1/php-4.3.11-1.fc1.5.legacy.src.rpm> <http://www.infostrategique.com/linuxrpms/legacy/2/php-4.3.11-1.fc2.6.legacy.src.rpm> <http://www.infostrategique.com/linuxrpms/legacy/3/php-4.3.11-2.8.2.legacy.src.rpm>  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1.4.3 (GNU/Linux)  iD8DBQFEVUXeLMAs/0C4zNoRAgqWAKCPaF6M/kdqV6YS9WxZjMbWGEmvugCffy7y UKTaPk2RxWEPNyat5tKefsA= =EYga -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----    ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=175040#c8)  Pekka Savola    2006-05-02 19:28:21 UTC  ``` RHEL21 update hasn't apparently been released yet, I hope there won't be patch mismatches..   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=175040#c9)  Marc Deslauriers    2006-05-02 20:54:47 UTC  ``` There will be, as I backported the patches to rh9 and rh73 myself.

Not sure whether it affects other versions.  2) php-4.1.2-php_imap.c.patch seems to be a bit different than php-4.1.2-bug24150.patch and php-4.3.2-bug24150.patch that RHEL shipped.   Are these fixing the same bug?  This might be applicable to RHL9 as well.  It might be best to use RHEL patches if feasible.  3) the patches for 2006-0996 seem OK compared to RHEL, there are a couple of minor diffs wrt TSRMLS_CC etc. those are probably OK.  4) the approach for 2006-0208 was different, and RHEL21 seemed a bit simpler (at least to verify :-).  If the RPMs would need to be redone, I'd recommend that approach.   Name 	[CVE-2006-1990](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-1990) (under review) Status 	Candidate Description 	Integer overflow in the wordwrap function in string.c in PHP 4.4.2 and 5.1.2 might allow context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via certain long arguments that cause a small buffer to be allocated, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow in a memcpy function call, a different vulnerability than [CVE-2002-1396](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2002-1396).

The Bugs that John specifically pointed out have the effect of causing imap_fetch_overview() to segfault when a mailbox contains a From: or To: header with an overlong email address.  (See [Comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=175040#c0)).  John has just indicated that the patch, php-4.1.2-bug24150.patch, included in one of the RHEL updates, fixed only 3 out of 4 of the bugs he noticed (See [comment #12](show_bug.cgi?id=175040#c12)).  I haven't myself had a chance to dig into the code, but I thought you might wish to know this.  Do you think there indeed is an (additional) code-execution vulnerability here?  Also, did the patched php packages released with RHSA-2006-0501 fix all of the vulnerabilities that need fixing in php?  Does a new CVE number need to be allocated or anything?  Thanks.   -David   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=175040#c14)  Josh Bressers    2006-06-01 02:15:04 UTC  ``` Hi David,  Thanks for the heads up on this.  These issues never seem to have gotten CVE ids.  We'll have to sort all this out (which versions fixed which bugs, which bugs are really dupes, etc.)  It does seem that upstream [bug 15595](show_bug.cgi?id=15595 "CLOSED NOTABUG - RH 7.0 beta 5 and Zip drives") isn't fixed in RHEL2.1.  I'm going to have a better look tomorrow when I'm more attentive.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=175040#c15)  Josh Bressers    2006-06-14 12:36:54 UTC  ``` This comment is from my mail archive.  Due to the bugzilla crash some data was lost:  ------- Additional Comments From deisenst  2006-06-10 17:12 EST ------- Josh,  Anything new on the RHEL 2.1 front?  Folks,  Looks like we need to issue new packages here, perhaps based on the RHEL packages with the patch <http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=15595> added in.  Do you want me to do it, Marc?  Jeff?  Are there any other outstanding issues? -Dave    ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=175040#c16)  Josh Bressers    2006-06-14 12:40:14 UTC  ``` ------- Additional Comments From jorton  2006-06-12 09:51 EST ------- Sorry for the slow response David.

Here are sample headers to reconstruct the problem:  --- From test@test.com  Mon Feb  3 14:08:06 2003 Return-Path: <test@test.com> Date: Mon,  3 Feb 2003 14:08:08 -0500 From: PHP Test Case <test@test.com> To: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ <t@t.com> Subject: test 4 MIME-Version: 1.0 Content-Type: text/plain Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit ---  Swapping the To: and From: headers causes the same problem.  The following script will reproduce the segfault:  --- <?php      $mailbox = imap_open(         "{127.0.0.1:143/imap/notls}"."test",         "rob", "******", OP_READONLY);      $header = imap_header($mailbox, 1);     echo $header->toaddress . "\n";     echo $header->fromaddress . "\n";      imap_close($mailbox); ?> ---  Notes:  In ext/imap/php_imap.c, if I change the define: #define PHP_IMAP_ADDRESS_SIZE_BUF 10 to something larger, say 100, the segfault disappears.  Since PHP_IMAP_ADDRESS_SIZE_BUF was added to solve [bug #19280](bug.php?id=19280) I thought this may be a related issue.  The badly constructed address above (\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ <t@t.com>) was the shortest test case I could come up with.  Note that reducing the number of backslashes makes it work, but adding the same number of alphanumeric characters back into the email address itself (between the <>) breaks it again.  An older server running PHP 4.1.2, imap-2001a, Apache 1.3.27, Horde/IMP, was not affected by the same messages.  Thanks for looking into this!  Let me know if you need additional information.  PHP ./configure line pasted below:  './configure' '--prefix=/usr/local/php4-STABLE-200302041230' '--with-config-file-path=/etc' '--enable-force-cgi-redirect' '--disable-debug' '--enable-pic' '--disable-rpath' '--enable-inline-optimization' '--with-bz2' '--with-db4' '--with-zlib' '--with-gd' '--with-png-dir=/usr' '--with-freetype-dir=/usr' '--enable-gd-native-ttf' '--with-ttf' '--with-gdbm' '--with-gettext' '--with-ncurses' '--with-gmp' '--with-iconv' '--with-jpeg-dir=/usr' '--with-png' '--with-pspell' '--with-regex=system' '--with-xml' '--with-expat-dir=/usr' '--enable-bcmath' '--enable-exif' '--enable-ftp' '--enable-magic-quotes' '--enable-safe-mode=no' '--enable-sockets' '--enable-sysvsem' '--enable-sysvshm' '--enable-discard-path' '--enable-track-vars' '--enable-trans-sid' '--without-oci8' '--with-pear=/usr/share/pear' '--with-imap=shared' '--with-imap-ssl' '--with-ldap=shared' '--with-mysql=shared,/usr' '--enable-memory-limit' '--enable-bcmath' '--enable-shmop' '--enable-versioning' '--with-apxs2=/usr/local/apache-2.0.44/bin/apxs' '--with-kerberos=/usr/kerberos'   ``` PatchesPull RequestsHistoryAllCommentsChangesGit/SVN commitsRelated reports  **[2003-02-11 12:30 UTC] [iliaa@php.net](//people.php.net/iliaa)** ``` Could you try the patch at: <http://bb.prohost.org/imap.txt> it should fix the problem. The solution you've proposed is not quite right, while may solve the problem in some cases it is only a temporary fix, E-mail address with couple a hundred \\ in it would still result in a crash.  ``` **[2003-02-11 16:59 UTC] [iliaa@php.net](//people.php.net/iliaa)** ``` This bug has been fixed in CVS.  In case this was a PHP problem, snapshots of the sources are packaged every three hours; this change will be in the next snapshot. You can grab the snapshot at <http://snaps.php.net/>.   In case this was a documentation problem, the fix will show up soon at <http://www.php.net/manual/>.  In case this was a PHP.net website problem, the change will show up on the PHP.net site and on the mirror sites in short time.   Thank you for the report, and for helping us make PHP better.    ``` |
