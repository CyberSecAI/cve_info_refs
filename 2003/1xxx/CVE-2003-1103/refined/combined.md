### Overview

Hummingbird CyberDOCS contains an SQL injection vulnerability that could allow a remote attacker to execute SQL commands.

### Description

| Hummingbird CyberDOCS (Hummingbird DM) is a web-based enterprise document management solution that runs on Windows NT/2000 using SQL database technology. The login page (loginact.asp on IIS) does not properly filter user input, allowing a remote attacker to supply SQL commands that may be executed by the underlying database. |

### Solution

| **Upgrade**  This vulnerability does not exist in CyberDOCS 3.9 or later. Hummingbird recommends that customers upgrade to the most recent version of CyberDOCS. |
| --- |

| **Limit SQL database user privileges**To limit the effects of a successful attack, configure SQL databases to run with limited user privileges. |
