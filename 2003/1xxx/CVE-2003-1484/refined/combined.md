Affected product : IE 6.0 Sp1
Vendor Status : the issue will be solved in the next service pack
Description :
Internet explorer can be crashed by clicking on a specially crafted link .
The problem is in the AnchorClick DHTML behaviour of the A ( link )
object . With this behaviour you can specify a Folder instead of using the
href attribute . If you leave this field blank , upon clicking on the link
internet explorer will crash with an access violation when trying to write
to a null pointer . You can test this issue by clicking the link on this
page
