```
- Root cause of vulnerability: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in CuteFTP 5.0 XP when processing the response to a "LIST" command from an FTP server.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The application fails to properly handle a directory listing response, leading to a buffer overflow. Specifically, sending 257 bytes over the data connection causes the buffer to overflow, and sending 260 bytes allows overwriting the EIP register.
- Impact of exploitation: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.
- Attack vectors: The attack vector involves luring the victim to connect to a malicious FTP server controlled by the attacker. When the victim's CuteFTP client requests a directory listing ("LIST" command), the malicious server sends a specially crafted response that triggers the buffer overflow.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to control a malicious FTP server and be able to lure a victim into connecting to that server and issuing a "LIST" command.
