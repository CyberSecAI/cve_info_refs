It does not contain tools and utilities such as compilers or debuggers for developing applets and applications.Sun Alert [55100](http://sunsolve.sun.com/pub-cgi/retrieve.pl?doc=fsalert%2F55100&zone_32=category%3Asecurity) indicates that a vulnerability in the Sun JRE "may allow an untrusted applet to access information from a trusted applet.
