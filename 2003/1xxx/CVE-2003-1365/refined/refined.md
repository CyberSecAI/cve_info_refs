{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `escape_dangerous_chars` function in CGI::Lite fails to properly escape certain characters that have special meaning to shell command processors.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient character escaping",
      "Improper input sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote attackers can potentially read or write local files, gain shell-level access to the server, and potentially achieve root or privileged access if the CGI script using the vulnerable function has elevated privileges. The impact includes potential compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "The primary attack vector is through a web CGI script that uses `CGI::Lite::escape_dangerous_chars()` to sanitize user input before using it in shell commands.  An attacker crafts malicious input through HTML forms, such as carefully constructed email addresses or file paths, to inject shell commands.",
        "Specifically, the function's failure to escape characters like backslash, question mark, tilde, caret, newline, and carriage return allows for command injection.",
     "The vulnerability can also be exploited by including shell meta-characters like '|', ';', and '>' in the crafted input."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send crafted input to a web CGI script that uses the vulnerable function. They don't need any authentication or special access."
  },
  "affected_component": "CGI::Lite module (versions 2.0 and earlier)",
   "cve_id": "CVE-2003-1365",
  "additional_notes": "The advisory highlights that even if whitespace is removed from user input in addition to using `escape_dangerous_chars`, the vulnerability is not mitigated."
