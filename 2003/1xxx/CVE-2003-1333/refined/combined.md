I have just received an email alert from Intersystems

<snip>

November 14, 2003 - Cache' Server Pages

InterSystems has encountered a critical issue with the use of Cache'

Server Pages, which would allow an attacker to remotely compromise the

Cache' Server and gain complete control over it.

All Cache' versions starting with 4.0.3 are affected by this

vulnerability and will be fixed with Cache' 5.1. Please install the

appropriate patch, available from our ftp site

ftp://ftp.intersystems.com/pub/cache/PatchProdlog34606.zip

to help to protect your Cache' system. Included in the zip file are

complete instructions on the steps required to correct this issue.

<snip>

I guess that you need a current support contract to cover this, and I'm

not really sure if the Single user version will be patched,

thought you might want to know.

in the main/latest (5.1) branch only. Since then Marvin has checked-in to

5.0/latest (will be 5.0.6), 5.0.5, and 4.1 objects branches.

It supposed to be fixed in all subsequent maintenance releases.

If you have purchased Caché directly from InterSystems and have a valid

support contract, you can contact your local office about getting an update.

If you have purchased Caché(or Caché is part of an application you

purchased) from a distributor/reseller/VAR/etc., you should talk to your

 supplier to determine what options are available to you/your application.
