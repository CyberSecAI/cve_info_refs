Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2003-1054:

**Root Cause:**
A malformed Referer header field causes the Apache `ap_parse_uri_components` function to discard it, leading to an uninitialized pointer within the `mod_access_referer` module.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Null pointer dereference: The `mod_access_referer` module attempts to use a pointer that has not been properly initialized due to the malformed Referer header.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote denial of service: Exploiting the null pointer dereference can cause the affected Apache server to crash, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malformed Referer header: An attacker sends a crafted HTTP request with a malformed Referer header field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Remote attacker: The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely by sending HTTP requests with malformed Referer headers.
