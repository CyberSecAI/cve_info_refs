The provided content contains information about CVE-2003-1025.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the incorrect parsing of URLs containing specific non-printable characters by Microsoft Internet Explorer. Specifically, the browser incorrectly handles URLs with NULL characters or similar non-printable characters before the "@" symbol in the userinfo part of the URL, leading to a misrepresentation of the URL in the address bar.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper URL canonicalization: The browser fails to properly interpret special characters in the URL.
- URL Spoofing: The address bar displays a misleading URL while the browser navigates to a different location.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can mislead users into believing they are on a legitimate site, potentially tricking them into divulging sensitive information such as credit card details, account numbers, and passwords.
- This vulnerability enables phishing attacks by creating a false sense of security through a deceptive URL display.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious Web Site: An attacker hosts a web page with a crafted URL.
- HTML Email: An attacker sends an HTML email containing a crafted URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to host a malicious website or send a specially crafted HTML email with a malicious link.
- The attacker needs to persuade the victim to click on the malicious link.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is related to how Internet Explorer handles the `<userinfo>@<host>:<port>` structure of a URL. If non-printable characters are present before the "@" sign, the browser displays the `<userinfo>` part of the URL while accessing the location specified by the `<host>:<port>` portion.
- This vulnerability enhances phishing attacks, making them more effective as the displayed URL is not the actual location.
- RFC 2396 discourages the practice of including passwords in the `<userinfo>` portion of a URL.
- The vulnerability is addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS04-004, which is a cumulative security update for Internet Explorer.
- A patch is available (832894) that addresses the issue. However, the status bar may still display the truncated URL even after the patch is applied.
