- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Incomplete security checking in Internet Explorer's cross-domain security model, specifically when handling dialog boxes and the `showHelp()` function. This allows websites to bypass security restrictions designed to prevent cross-domain information sharing.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - **Improper Cross Domain Security Validation with dialog box:** Internet Explorer does not properly validate the origin of scripts running within a dialog box, allowing a malicious website to inject code that can access data from other domains or the local system.
    - **Improper Cross Domain Security Validation with ShowHelp functionality:** The `showHelp()` function does not have proper security checks, allowing an attacker to execute code or access files by exploiting the function using a malicious website.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - An attacker could potentially access information from other domains, including local files, if the attacker knows the file paths.
    - An attacker could invoke executables already present on the user's system.
    - In the worst case, the attacker could load and execute malicious code on the user's system.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - The attacker needs to host a malicious website designed to exploit the vulnerabilities.
    - The attacker needs to lure a user to visit this malicious website. This could be through social engineering, email links, or other means.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Ability to host a malicious website.
    - Ability to lure a user to visit the malicious website.
    - For local file access, knowledge of the local file path or social engineering to induce the user to interact with a link to a local file.
