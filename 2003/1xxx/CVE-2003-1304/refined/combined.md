How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Security Recommendations for
ProductCart-powered stores

We encourage you to use the following security precautions to minimize the chance of unauthorized
access to your ProductCart Control Panel and store database.

1.  Rename the “pcadmin” folder (ProductCart v2.1 and above). Once you have activated

ProductCart, you can change the name of the folder that contains all the files that are used for
your store's administration area (the Control Panel). By default, this folder is named
“pcadmin”. By renaming the folder to something that is hard to guess, you will make it
virtually impossible for hackers to find the location of your Control Panel. This increases the
level of security for your store as it prevents hackers to locate the Control Panel login page
and run attacks against it. To rename the “pcadmin” folder, follow these steps:

a.  Activate ProductCart v2.1
b.  Locate the file “secureadminfolder.asp” in the “includes” directory and download it to

your local system using your favorite FTP program.

c.  Open the file with Notepad or an HTML editor and change the name “pcadmin” to any
other name that you would like to use (only use alphanumeric characters in the
name). Save the edited file and reupload it to your server via FTP.

d.  Change the name of the “pcadmin” folder to the new folder name that you have just

entered in the “secureadminfolder.asp” file.

e.  You are done. To log into the Control Panel, remember to edit the URL to reflect the

new folder name.

2.  Change the name of your MS Access database, and of the folder that contains it. This

does not apply to ProductCart stores that use a SQL database. The MS Access database that
powers your ProductCart store is named "eipc.mdb" and is stored by default in the folder
"productcart/database". You can rename both the database file and the folder it to anything
you like, as long as you preserve the *.mdb extension for the database file. Just remember to
edit the DSN or DSN-less database connection string accordingly (you will be able to test it on
the next page).

3.  Password-protect your MS Access database. This does not apply to ProductCart stores

that use a SQL database. To password protect your store database you need to download it to
your computer via FTP, open it using Microsoft Access, which is part of Microsoft Office
Professional, and then select "Security/Set Database Password" from the "Tools" menu. When
you open the database, make sure to do so using the "Open Exclusive" option from the "Open"
drop-down selection menu.

If you password protect your MS Access database, edit your database connection string to
include the password.

For example, if you are using a DSN connection:
"DSN=productcart"

becomes...
"DSN=productcart;PWD=yourPassword"

If you are using a DSN-less connection:
"DRIVER={Microsoft Access Driver (*.mdb)};DBQ=c:\database.mdb"

becomes...
"DRIVER={Microsoft Access Driver (*.mdb)};DBQ=c:\database.mdb;PWD=password"

4.  Regularly change your Control Panel password. You can do so from within the Control
Panel, under "General Settings/Change Password". We recommend that you change your
Control Panel password every month or two, and whenever someone that had access to it no
longer works for your company.

Security Recommendations for
ProductCart-powered stores

5.  Backup your store. Regularly backup your store to ensure quick and effortless recovery in
case your store needs to be restored for any reason (e.g. hardware failures, unauthorized
access, change of Web server, change of Web hosting company, etc.). This task should be
performed on a weekly basis, more often for busy stores. You should back up the following
store data.

a.  Your store database (if you are using MS SQL, enquire with your Web hosting

company to find out how often they back it up for you)

b.  The "includes" folder, which contains a variety of store settings (include in backup

when you have edited any of the store settings)

c.  Any ProductCart files that you have modified to better meet your needs (include in

backup any file that was recently edited)

6.  Disable directory browsing. When directory browsing is disabled, Web site visitors cannot

view a tree of the folders that exist within the Web site. Contact your Web hosting company to
ensure that they have disabled directory browsing.

7.  Remove or rename cmd.exe. If you are hosting your store on your own dedicated Web

server, then this security tip can help you further reduce the chances of unauthorized access
to the Web server. The objective of a hacker attack is often to gain full control of the victim’s
computer. Hackers often do so by accessing a program called cmd.exe, which allows you to
execute commands on the system. We recommend that you rename, move, or restrict access
to cmd.exe. Renaming it or limiting its use to members of the administrator group removes
this vulnerability. This is not a generally needed file for a Web server and if it doesn't exist
then it is impossible for an attacker to gain access to it.

8.  Edit the Print Settings in Internet Explorer. If you print out order invoices from the

Control Panel and send them to your customers, note that Internet Explorer by default prints
the complete URL to the page at the bottom of the document. You can easily change this
setting in Internet Explorer by selecting File > Page Setup and removing the characters that
appear in the Footer field.
