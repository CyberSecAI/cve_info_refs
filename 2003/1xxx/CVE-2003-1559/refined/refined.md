Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2003-1559:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the improper handling of the HTTP Referer header by Internet Explorer 5.22 on Mac. Specifically, it violates the HTTP 1.1 specification by including the Referer header in non-secure HTTP requests when the referring page was accessed via a secure protocol (HTTPS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability leads to the disclosure of the referring URL from a secure (HTTPS) page to a non-secure (HTTP) destination. This is a violation of the intended behavior, as specified in RFC 2616, Section 15.1.3 which states, "Clients SHOULD NOT include a Referer header field in a (non-secure) HTTP request if the referring page was transferred with a secure protocol."
*   **Privacy Violation:** Sensitive information in the URL of the referring secure page (e.g., session IDs, user-specific parameters) can be leaked through the Referer header to the non-secure destination.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Impact:** Partial - Sensitive information from secure pages can be disclosed to third-party, non-secure sites.
*   **Integrity Impact:** None
*   **Availability Impact:** None

**Attack Vectors:**

*   A user browses a secure (HTTPS) web page in Internet Explorer 5.22 on a Mac.
*   The user clicks a link on this secure page that points to a non-secure (HTTP) page.
*   The browser, in violation of the RFC, includes the Referer header containing the URL of the secure page in the request to the non-secure destination.
*   The non-secure page (or an eavesdropper) can extract sensitive information from the Referer header.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have control over the non-secure (HTTP) page the user is visiting after navigating from a secure page.
*   The attacker doesn't need any authentication since it relies on the user's actions to navigate to the non secure page after accessing the secure page.
*   The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the victim and can be remote.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The content explicitly mentions that this behavior is a violation of the HTTP 1.1 specification (RFC 2616).
*   The provided links further detail the vulnerability and provide specific scenarios (e.g., Outlook Web Access).
*   The CVSS base score is given as 5/10 with an exploitability subscore of 10/10 because the attack is easily carried out remotely.
