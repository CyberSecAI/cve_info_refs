Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Admin Access:** The `verif_admin.php` and `check_admin.php` files use a flawed authentication mechanism. The code checks for a `connect` parameter matching the `$passadmin` variable to set a cookie, but does not appear to define or validate this variable securely. It also sets the cookie directly. The code is susceptible to direct cookie manipulation.
*   **Arbitrary File Copy:** The `upload.php` script allows an attacker to copy arbitrary files using a manipulated POST request, due to insufficient input validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Authentication:** The admin authentication in `verif_admin.php` and `check_admin.php` is weak. The code sets a cookie with a fixed value if $connect equals $passadmin. The value of $passadmin is not checked in the code and is likely hardcoded and guessable, or not used at all. Additionally, the script uses a header location to redirect back to itself, which can be bypassed using direct cookie manipulation.
*   **Arbitrary File Copy:** The `upload.php` script does not properly validate the file path provided. Specifically the script uses `$file` which is the path to the source of the uploaded file, in the `copy()` function, and `$dest_file` as destination path. By setting a cookie named "file" with the value as the path to the target file, an attacker can force the server to copy an arbitrary server-side file to the web root. There is also an issue of not properly validating the content of $dest_file, where the `$folder` variable may be subject to manipulation. The filename generated using `makeRandomName()` is also susceptible to collisions, albeit with a low chance of occurrence.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Admin Access:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the administrative panel by directly setting the `loggedin` cookie.
*   **Arbitrary File Copy:** An attacker can read arbitrary server files (like `config.php`, which likely contains database credentials) by exploiting the file copy vulnerability in `upload.php`.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Admin Access:** The attacker can gain admin access by manually setting a cookie named "loggedin" to "ok". Another way is to submit a POST request with connect=admin. The value "admin" is mentioned as the password in the code itself, which could lead to a trivial exploit.
*   **Arbitrary File Copy:** The attacker needs to:
    1.  Set a cookie named "file" with the path of the server file to be copied (e.g., "config.php").
    2.  Fill the form on `form.php` with valid data, including a real image file upload.
    3.  Submit the form.
    4.  Access the newly created image file from the gallery. The content of config.php would be viewable in the image.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Admin Access:** The attacker can be any user with network access to the server. No special privileges are needed.
*   **Arbitrary File Copy:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the web server through a browser to send HTTP requests. No special privileges are needed. The attacker needs to be able to upload a valid GIF or JPG image.
