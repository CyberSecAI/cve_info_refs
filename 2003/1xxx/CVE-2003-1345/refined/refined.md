- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application uses insufficient input validation when handling file paths provided in a URL. Specifically, it fails to properly sanitize the path, allowing an attacker to bypass intended directory restrictions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Path traversal vulnerability; improper input validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem that the web server process has access to, which could potentially include sensitive files like boot logs.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a URL that includes a leading "/" and the path to the desired file, the attacker can force the application to read the specified file from the server's filesystem.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
