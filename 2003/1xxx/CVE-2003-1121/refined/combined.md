## ScriptLogic RunAdmin service can allow users to gain administrative access

#### Vulnerability Note VU#231705

Original Release Date: 2003-04-30 | Last Revised: 2003-04-30

---

### Overview

There is a vulnerability in version 4.01 of [ScriptLogic](http://www.scriptlogic.com/) that may allow local or domain users to gain administrative access to workstations running the ScriptLogic RunAdmin service.

### Description

| The [ScriptLogic](http://www.scriptlogic.com/) product from ScriptLogic, Inc. provides remote system administration capabilities for Microsoft Windows systems in a domain. A vulnerability in the RunAdmin service included in version 4.01 of the ScriptLogic software could allow a local user to gain administrative access to any workstations in the domain that are managed by the ScriptLogic server. According to ScriptLogic, "the ScriptLogic RunAdmin services (SLRAserver.exe & SLRAclient.exe) are used to perform configurations on the client workstation when the user logging on does not have Administrative privileges."  The RunAdmin service runs in the context of a domain account (typically SLSVCUSER or similar) that is added to the Local Administrators group by the installation program. Version 4.01 of ScriptLogic, as tested by the CERT/CC, fails to prevent normal users from making requests supplied with configuration data of their own choosing. As a result, it is possible for normal users to use the RunAdmin service to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the SLSVCUSER account. If a malicious end-user requests his/her own configuration be executed by a ScriptLogic client, this would in turn cause the ScriptLogic RunAdmin client service to be installed to the machine (if it was not already present), and the RunAdmin client to execute the applications specified in the malicious configuration with the privileges of a local administrator (i.e., under the security context of the RunAdmin client service).Since the SLSVCUSER account is normally part of the Administrators group, exploitation results in a root compromise of the system. Furthermore, because SLSVCUSER is a domain account, local access can be leveraged to gain administrative access to other ScriptLogic-managed workstations in the domain which have had the SLSVCUSER account added to their own local Administrators group (e.g., other workstations in the domain that have had the RunAdmin client service installed).This vulnerability affects workstations running Microsoft Windows NT, Microsoft Windows 2000, and Microsoft Windows XP. Although the ScriptLogic software also runs on Microsoft Windows 95, Microsoft Windows 98, and Microsoft Windows Me, this vulnerability is irrelevant to systems running these versions of Windows. Since they do not feature distinct users and security contexts, access to a user account in the domain, which is a necessary precondition to exploitation of this vulnerability, is already tantamount to administrative access on these platforms. Furthermore, since the RunAdmin service is an optional component of the ScriptLogic system, sites that have not installed this service during the initial installation of the ScriptLogic software are not affected by this vulnerability.The CERT/CC has verified the existence of this vulnerability in version 4.01 of the ScriptLogic software. Version 4.14 of the ScriptLogic software has been tested by the CERT/CC and shown not to contain the vulnerability. The RunAdmin service has been replaced in this version of the ScriptLogic software. |
| --- |

### Impact

| Local users can gain administrative control of workstations with the ScriptLogic RunAdmin service installed. This access can be leveraged to gain administrative control of other workstations in the domain that have had the SLSVCUSER account added to the Local Administrators group (e.g., as a result of the ScriptLogic RunAdmin service being installed) and have the default administrative shares enabled. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade to the latest version of the software**Version 4.14 of the ScriptLogic software has been tested by the CERT/CC and shown not to contain the vulnerability. Users of potentially vulnerable versions of the software are encouraged to upgrade to this version. |

## ScriptLogic RPC service allows local users to modify arbitrary registry settings

#### Vulnerability Note VU#609137

Original Release Date: 2003-04-30 | Last Revised: 2003-04-30

### Overview

There is a vulnerability in version 4.01 of [ScriptLogic](http://www.scriptlogic.com/) that could allow local users to gain full access to the registry.

### Description

| The [ScriptLogic](http://www.scriptlogic.com/) product from ScriptLogic, Inc. provides remote system administration capabilities for Microsoft Windows systems in a domain. A vulnerability in version 4.01 of the ScriptLogic RPC service allows unauthorized end-users to obtain full access to their registry, regardless of security restrictions therein. According to ScriptLogic, "The ScriptLogic RPC service allows the client to request a registry modification from the SLRPC service running on the authenticating domain controller."  If the ScriptLogic client application is unable to set a registry setting on the end-user's workstation, it makes an RPC request to the ScriptLogic RPC service. This service then connects to the remote registry on the workstation, and sets the setting. It is only able to do so because it has administrative permissions on the workstation. However, version 4.01 of ScriptLogic, as tested by the CERT/CC, fails to prevent normal users from making requests supplied with registry configuration data of their own choosing. This flaw allows the unauthorized user to make changes to the registry that they would normally be prevented from making. This vulnerability affects end-user systems running Microsoft Windows NT, Microsoft Windows 2000, and Microsoft Windows XP. Although the ScriptLogic software also runs on Microsoft Windows 95, Microsoft Windows 98, and Microsoft Windows Me, this vulnerability is irrelevant to systems running these versions of Windows. Since they do not feature distinct users and security contexts, access to a user account in the domain, which is a necessary precondition to exploitation of this vulnerability, is already tantamount to administrative access on these platforms. Furthermore, since the ScriptLogic RPC service is an optional component of the ScriptLogic system, sites that have not installed this service during the initial installation of the ScriptLogic software are not affected by this vulnerability.The CERT/CC has verified the existence of this vulnerability in version 4.01 of the ScriptLogic software.

The ScriptLogic RPC service has been replaced in this version of the ScriptLogic software. |

### Impact

| An unauthorized user can make arbitrary changes to the registry of the affected system. This level of access can easily be leveraged by an attacker to gain administrative privileges. |
