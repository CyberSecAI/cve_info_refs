The provided content describes two distinct vulnerabilities in ScriptLogic version 4.01, identified by VU#231705 and VU#609137. Neither of these vulnerabilities are associated with a CVE ID. However, they are described in enough detail to provide vulnerability information.

**Vulnerability 1:**

*   **Vulnerability Note:** VU#231705
*   **Root Cause:** The ScriptLogic RunAdmin service (SLRAserver.exe and SLRAclient.exe) in version 4.01 does not properly restrict user-supplied configuration data. It allows regular users to send arbitrary commands to the service for execution.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Insufficient input validation.
    *   Lack of authorization checks for configuration requests.
    *   The RunAdmin service runs with domain administrator privileges (SLSVCUSER), a domain account that is added to the local administrators group of workstations.
*   **Impact:** Local users can execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the SLSVCUSER account, resulting in a full system compromise. This can also be used to gain administrative access to other ScriptLogic-managed workstations in the domain.
*  **Attack vectors:**
    *   Local, authenticated users can send malicious configuration data to the RunAdmin service.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A normal domain user account is required. The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the RunAdmin service which is installed on the local workstation.

**Vulnerability 2:**

*   **Vulnerability Note:** VU#609137
*   **Root Cause:** The ScriptLogic RPC service in version 4.01 allows unauthenticated users to make arbitrary changes to the system registry.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Insufficient access control on the RPC service
    *   Lack of input validation on the registry configuration data in requests.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized users can make arbitrary changes to the registry of the affected system. This level of access can easily be leveraged by an attacker to gain administrative privileges.
*   **Attack vectors:** Local, authenticated users can send malicious registry configuration data to the RPC service.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  A normal domain user account is required. The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the RPC service.

Both vulnerabilities are fixed in ScriptLogic version 4.14 where the vulnerable services have been replaced.
