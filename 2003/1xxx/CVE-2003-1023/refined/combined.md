How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

________________________________________________________________________

Package:             mc
Vulnerability:       arbitrary code execution
OpenPKG Specific:    no

Affected Releases:   Affected Packages:          Corrected Packages:
OpenPKG CURRENT      <= mc-4.6.0-20040207        >= mc-4.6.0-20040405
OpenPKG 2.0          <= mc-4.6.0-2.0.0           >= mc-4.6.0-2.0.1
OpenPKG 1.3          <= mc-4.6.0-1.3.0           >= mc-4.6.0-1.3.1

Dependent Packages:  none

Description:
  According to a message from Ilya Teterin posted on Bugtraq [[0]](#0), the
  Midnight Commander application [[1]](#1) uses a uninitialized buffer to
  handle symlinks in VFS. This allows attackers to execute arbitrary
  code during symlink conversion. The Common Vulnerabilities and
  Exposures (CVE) project assigned the id CAN-2003-1023 [[2]](#2) to the
  problem.

  Please check whether you are affected by running "<prefix>/bin/rpm
  -q mc". If you have the "mc" package installed and its version is
  affected (see above), we recommend that you immediately upgrade it
  (see Solution). [3][[4]](#4)

Solution:
  Select the updated source RPM appropriate for your OpenPKG release
  [5][[6]](#6), fetch it from the OpenPKG FTP service [7][[8]](#8) or a mirror
  location, verify its integrity [[9]](#9), build a corresponding binary RPM
  from it [[3]](#3) and update your OpenPKG installation by applying the
  binary RPM [[4]](#4). For the most recent release OpenPKG 2.0, perform the
  following operations to permanently fix the security problem (for
  other releases adjust accordingly).

  $ ftp ftp.openpkg.org
  ftp> bin
  ftp> cd release/2.0/UPD
  ftp> get mc-4.6.0-2.0.1.src.rpm
  ftp> bye
  $ <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm -v --checksig mc-4.6.0-2.0.1.src.rpm
  $ <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm --rebuild mc-4.6.0-2.0.1.src.rpm
  $ su -
  # <prefix>/bin/openpkg rpm -Fvh <prefix>/RPM/PKG/mc-4.6.0-2.0.1.*.rpm

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Security Contacts and Procedures

Red Hat takes security very seriously, and we aim to take immediate action to
address serious security-related problems that involve our products or
services.

Please report any suspected security vulnerability in a Red Hat product or service to Red Hat Product Security at secalert@redhat.com. You can use our [GPG key](#contact) to communicate with us securely.

To report an issue in any Red Hat branded website or online service, please contact Red Hat Information Security at site-security@redhat.com.

## When to contact Red Hat Product Security

You should contact Red Hat Product Security if:

* You think there might be a security vulnerability in a Red Hat product or service.
* You want to provide feedback about our standards of service and performance. If you feel your security concern is not dealt with in a satisfactory manner, please contact secalert@redhat.com.

In all other cases, you should contact [Red Hat Customer Experience & Engagement](/site/support/).

You should contact Red Hat Customer Experience & Engagement if:

* You are unsure about how a known vulnerability affects a Red Hat product or service.
* You wish to report an issue in a language other than English.
* You require technical assistance for a security function (for example, "How do I configure my firewall?").
* You need help upgrading packages due to security alerts. (Refer to "How do I apply package updates from the Red Hat Network?" for information on upgrading packages.)
* Your issue is not security related.

In any of these cases, please contact [Red Hat Customer Experience & Engagement](/site/support/) instead.

## Who reads email sent to secalert@redhat.com?

Only members of Red Hat Product Security, a restricted
and carefully chosen group of Red Hat employees, will have access to
material sent to the secalert@redhat.com address. No outside users can subscribe to this list.

## Reporting security vulnerabilities in Red Hat Offerings

Red Hat Product Security welcomes and encourages all potential vulnerability submissions. For us to provide the best customer service and address issues in a timely manner, please provide the following information, if known:

* The version number of the affected component, such as the rpm package, container image, and java component.
* The environment and corresponding version(s) where the issue was discovered, for example, the operating system's name, version, architecture, or container platform.
* The steps to reproduce, if available.
* The ways an attacker could exploit this vulnerability on a system.
* Is the vulnerability already known to the public? If not, when is the planned date for disclosure?
* The immediate impact if an attacker exploits the vulnerability, such as a denial of service, privilege escalation, or remote code execution.

## How to contact us securely

Red Hat Product Security uses an OpenPGP key to secure our email communications. Mail sent to secalert@redhat.com can be encrypted with this public key. We expect to change the key we use from time to time. Should we change the key, the previous keys will be revoked, and the [rhsa-announce](http://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/rhsa-announce) mailing list will be notified of the change.

#### DCE3823597F5EAC4: Red Hat, Inc. (Product Security)

This key is used for communicating securely with Red Hat Product Security and for signing the security advisories posted to mailing lists.

**Download:** [Red Hat](https://access.redhat.com/security/data/97f5eac4.txt)

**Fingerprint:** 77E7 9ABE 9367 3533 ED09 EBE2 DCE3 8235 97F5 EAC4

Please do not send messages encrypted with this public key to any address
other than security@redhat.com and secalert@redhat.com. We are unable to accept any non–security-related email that is encrypted with this public key.

## How we respond

Email sent to secalert@redhat.com is read and
acknowledged with a non-automated response within three working
days. For issues that are complicated and require significant attention, we will open an investigation and will provide you with a mechanism to check the status of our progress at any time.

Any information you share with us about security issues that are
not public knowledge is kept confidential within Red Hat. It is not
passed on to any third party without your permission.

## Notifications

Red Hat does not provide an advance notification service. Security
advisories are available from [Red Hat Product Security](/site/security/updates/) and via the [Red Hat Customer Portal](/site/security/updates/active/).

## Common Criteria Timely Updates

Refer to the [Life Cycle Security Update Policy](https://access.redhat.com/security/lifecycle-security-update-policy) for information on Red Hat's security update policy as well as information on embargoed (undisclosed) vulnerability handling.

### Resources include the following:

[Red Hat Security Updates (Advisories)](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/security-advisories)

[Red Hat CVE Database](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/cve)

[Red Hat Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure (CVE) Program](https://access.redhat.com/articles/red_hat_cve_program)

## Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD)

Red Hat engages with partners, vendors, researchers, and community coordinators to disclose newly discovered vulnerabilities in hardware, software, and services. Multi-party coordination is a complex process, and understanding the parties' vulnerability disclosure policies, vulnerability handling policies, and contractual agreements opens the way to trusted communication and collaboration. Increasing transparency between parties assures that vendors can understand and manage the risk imposed by the vulnerability and facilitate engagements with other parties. The aim of CVD is to provide timely and consistent guidance to parties and customers to help them protect themselves.

Please see the [Red Hat CNA Vulnerability Disclosure Policy](https://access.redhat.com/articles/red_hat_cna_vulnerability_disclosure_policy) for details on how Red Hat discloses security vulnerabilities under the Red Hat/Fedora scope.

For more information on CVD, please review the information provided in the following links:

RHSA-2004:035 - Security Advisory

Issued:
2004-02-03
Updated:
2004-02-03
# RHSA-2004:035 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

mc security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

Updated mc packages that resolve a buffer overflow vulnerability are now
available.

## Description

Midnight Commander is a visual shell much like a file manager.

A buffer overflow has been found in Midnight Commander's virtual filesystem
code. Specifically, a stack-based buffer overflow in vfs\_s\_resolve\_symlink
of vfs/direntry.c allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code during
symlink conversion.

Users of Midnight Commander should install these updated packages, which
resolve this issue.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade. Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated. Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated. Note that you
can also use wildcards (\*.rpm) if your current directory \*only\* contains the
desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network. Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates. To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

If up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL Certificate
Errors, you need to install a version of the up2date client with an updated
certificate. The latest version of up2date is available from the Red Hat
FTP site and may also be downloaded directly from the RHN website:

<https://rhn.redhat.com/help/latest-up2date.pxt>

## Affected Products

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 2 ia64
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux Workstation 2 ia64
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux Workstation 2 i386

## Fixes

* [BZ - 113850](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=113850)
  - CAN-2003-1023 mc stack overflow

### [Anstehendes Support-Ende (âEnd of lifeâ) von Windows 10](/blog/2024-10-14-windows-10-end-of-life)

Wir weisen darauf hin, dass Windows 10 ab dem 14. Oktober 2025 keine kostenlosen Sicherheitsupdates mehr erhÃ¤lt und ohne weitere MaÃnahmen nicht mehr im Uninetz betrieben werden darf. Wir zeigen mÃ¶gliche Optionen fÃ¼r Windows-10-Rechner auf. FÃ¼r neue Hardware oder kostenpflichtige Sicherheitsupdates kÃ¶nnen Kosten auf die Betreiber:innen zukommen.

### [Windows-Feature âRecallâ](/blog/2024-06-19-recall)

Aus aktuellem Anlass weist die Stabsstelle Informationssicherheit auf Probleme mit dem neuen Windows-Feature âRecallâ hin und rÃ¤t von der Verwendung ab.

### [Umgang mit vermeintlichen Warnungen des Virenscanners im Browser](/blog/2024-05-13-malicious-browser-popups)

Immer wieder erhalten wir Anfragen von Nutzer:innen, bei denen der Rechner den Fund von Malware meldet. Nicht in allen FÃ¤llen sind dies echte Warnungen unserer Endpoint Protection LÃ¶sung. Die andere ErklÃ¤rung ist, dass es sich um Push-Nachrichten aus dem Browser handeln kann, mit der die Person vor dem Rechner dazu verleitet werden soll, Malware zu installieren. Wir zeigen, wie sich falsche von echten Meldungen unterscheiden lassen und beschreiben am Beispiel von Google Chrome, wie Push-Nachrichten deaktiviert werden kÃ¶nnen.
