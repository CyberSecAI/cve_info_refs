## HP-UX shar utility creates files with predictable names in "/tmp" directory

#### Vulnerability Note VU#509454

Original Release Date: 2004-01-23 | Last Revised: 2004-01-23

---

### Overview

The shar program distributed with some versions of the HP-UX operating system creates files insecurely. This vulnerability could allow local users to gain escalated privilege on the system.

### Description

| shar is a program commonly available on UNIX systems to create a shell script that will recreate a file hierarchy specified by the command line operands. The shar program is often used for distributing a directory of files by FTP or email. The shar program distributed with some versions of the HP-UX operating system creates files with predictable names in the /tmp directory. In environments where multiple users have write access to the /tmp directory, this behavior could be exploited by an attacker to overwrite files with another user's privileges. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker with the ability to create symbolic links for predictable filenames in the /tmp directory may be able to overwrite files owned by another user. When a shell script generated by the flawed version of the shar program is executed, the symbolic links would be followed and the target files created with the permissions of the user who ran the script. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply a patch from the vendor**  Patches that address this vulnerability have been released. Please see the vendor information in the Systems Affected section of this document for more details.**NOTE:** After the patches have been applied, Hewlett-Packard recommends that users always specify a secure directory in the TMPDIR environment variable when creating shar archives. Hewlett-Packard also states that shar archives created with previous versions of the shar program will still use the /tmp directory even after the recommended patches are installed. Users are encouraged to inspect existing shar archives and replace references to /tmp with $TMPDIR. This can be accomplished by manually editing the files or with the simple script provided in the Hewlett-Packard bulletin. |

 Originally issued: 01 Dec 2003
 SSRT3630 Security Vulnerability in shar(1)
 -----------------------------------------------------------------

NOTICE: There are no restrictions for distribution of this
Bulletin provided that it remains complete and intact.

The information in the following Security Bulletin should be
acted upon as soon as possible.  Hewlett-Packard Company will
not be liable for any consequences to any customer resulting
from customer's failure to fully implement instructions in this
Security Bulletin as soon as possible.

 -----------------------------------------------------------------
PROBLEM:  shar(1) creates tmp files insecurely.

IMPACT:   Possible filesystem damage, execution of arbitrary
          code, or Denial of Service.

PLATFORM: HP9000 servers running HP-UX versions B.11.00, B.11.04,
          and B.11.11.

SOLUTION: Apply the appropriate patch from itrc.hp.com:
           PHCO\_29010    B.11.11
           PHCO\_29697    B.11.04
           PHCO\_28954    B.11.00

MANUAL ACTIONS: Yes
                If the /tmp directory is not trusted
                specify a trusted directory in the
                TMPDIR environment variable. Shar archives
                which do not use TMPDIR should be modified
                as discussed below.

AVAILABILITY:  All patches are available now on <itrc.hp.com>
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
 A. Background
    The shar(1) utility, which among other things is used to
    package HP-UX patches, creates temporary files with
    predictable names on /tmp.  If shar files are unpacked on
    a system where /tmp cannot be trusted a potential
    vulnerability exists.

    Shar archives created with the new version of shar(1) can
    specify a safe directory for temporary file creation
    using the TMPDIR environment variable.  Shar archives created
    with previous versions of shar(1) will still use /tmp
    even after the recommended patches are installed.

    There are additions to the man page for shar(1) describing
    the new environment variable TMPDIR.

    The following procedure can be used to replace references to
    /tmp with TMPDIR in existing shar archives.

  $ cat addTMPDIR.awk
  /..@EOF/ {scan\_off=1}
  /^@EOF/  {scan\_off=0}
  /unpacker <<.@eof./ {scan\_off=1}
  {
     if(scan\_off != 1) {
       gsub ("/tmp",  "$TMPDIR")
     }
     print $0
  }

  $ cp PHCO\_29010 PHCO\_29010.orig
  $ export TMPDIR=$HOME
  $ awk -f addTMPDIR.awk PHCO\_29010.orig >PHCO\_29010
  $ sh PHCO\_29010
  x - PHCO\_29010.text
  x - PHCO\_29010.depot [non-ascii]

    NOTE: This issue does not impact HP Tru64 UNIX nor
          HP NonStop Servers.

    AFFECTED VERSIONS
    The following is a list by HP-UX revision of affected
    filesets and the fileset revision or patch containing the
    fix.  To determine if a system has an affected version,
    search the output of "swlist -a revision -l fileset"
    for an affected fileset, then determine if a fixed
    revision or the applicable patch is installed.

    HP-UX B.11.11
    =============
    OS-Core.CMDS-AUX
    fix: install PHCO\_29010 or subsequent and unpack patches
         using the new procedure.

    HP-UX B.11.04
    =============
    OS-Core.CMDS-AUX
    fix: install PHCO\_29697 or subsequent and unpack patches
         using the new procedure.

    HP-UX B.11.00
    =============
    OS-Core.CMDS-AUX
    fix: install PHCO\_28954 or subsequent and unpack patches
         using the new procedure.

    END AFFECTED VERSIONS

    and by bulletin topic.  Security Patch Check completely
    automates the process of reviewing the patch matrix for
    11.XX systems.  Please note that installing the patches
    listed in the Security Patch Matrix will completely
    implement a security bulletin \_only\_ if the MANUAL ACTIONS
    field specifies "No."

    The Security Patch Check tool can verify that a security
    bulletin has been implemented on HP-UX 11.XX systems providing
    that the fix is completely implemented in a patch with no
    manual actions required.  The Security Patch Check tool cannot
    verify fixes implemented via a product upgrade.

    For information on the Security Patch Check tool, see:
    <http://www.software.hp.com/cgi-bin/swdepot_parser.cgi/cgi/>
    displayProductInfo.pl?productNumber=B6834AA

    The security patch matrix is also available via anonymous
    ftp:

    ftp://ftp.itrc.hp.com/export/patches/hp-ux\_patch\_matrix/

    On the "Support Information Digest Main" page:
    click on the "HP Security Bulletin Archive".

    The PGP key used to sign this bulletin is available from

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
