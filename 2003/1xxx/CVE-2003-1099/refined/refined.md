{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `shar` program in HP-UX creates temporary files with predictable names in the `/tmp` directory.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure creation of temporary files with predictable names.",
      "Lack of proper handling of the `TMPDIR` environment variable in older `shar` archives.",
        "The shar program did not use TMPDIR by default"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can create symbolic links with the predictable filenames in `/tmp`. When a `shar` archive is extracted, these links are followed causing the target files to be created with the privileges of the user running the script. This could lead to file system damage, execution of arbitrary code, or Denial of Service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local exploitation by creating symbolic links in `/tmp` before executing a vulnerable `shar` archive."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker requires the ability to create symbolic links in the `/tmp` directory and needs a user to execute a vulnerable `shar` archive. This is commonly a local user."
