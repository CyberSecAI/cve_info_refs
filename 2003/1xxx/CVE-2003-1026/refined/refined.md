{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Improper validation of the source of script URLs stored in Internet Explorer's Travel Log.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The cross-domain security model in Internet Explorer does not properly validate the source domain of URLs stored in the travel log stack.",
      "The vulnerability lies in how Internet Explorer processes and validates Script URLs when they are retrieved from the Travel Log, allowing a bypass of security checks."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running IE by causing script to be evaluated in the Local Machine Zone. This could also allow an attacker to read or modify data in other web sites.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafted HTML document (web page, HTML email) containing script that leverages the vulnerable travel log mechanism.",
      "Exploitation via malicious web sites or HTML email messages."
     ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to create a malicious web page or HTML email and entice the user to visit the page or view the email. The attacker can then use this to execute arbitrary code on the user's system by injecting specially-crafted code when the browser parses specially formatted Script URLs from the travel log."
