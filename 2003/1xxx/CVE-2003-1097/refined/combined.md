## HP-UX "rexec" command vulnerable to buffer overflow when supplied overly long command line argument to "-l" option

#### Vulnerability Note VU#322540

Original Release Date: 2003-05-28 | Last Revised: 2003-07-25

---

### Overview

A buffer overflow vulnerability in the rexec program supplied in some versions of the HP-UX operating system could allow local users to gain privileged access.

### Description

| The rexec program allows local users to execute commands on remote servers. rexec calls the rexec subroutine to act as a client for the remote host's rexecd server.  The rexec program includes a "-l" command-line option that allows an alternate login name to be specified on the remote host. The rexec program supplied with some versions of the HP-UX operating systems contains a buffer overflow in the handling of the username argument passed to the "-l" option. An overly long username causes the rexec program to segmentation fault and could allow a local attacker to execute commands of their choosing on the local system. Since the rexec program is normally setuid to *root*, these commands would be executed with *root* privileges. |
| --- |

### Impact

| On systems running vulnerable versions of HP-UX where the rexec program is setuid to user *root*, local users may be able to execute code as *root,*thereby compromising the system. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Hewlett-Packard has released software patches and workaround information for this vulnerability. Please see the vendor information section of this document for more details. |
| --- |

| **Workarounds**Sites may wish to consider removing the setuid permissions from the rexec client program on systems that do not require its use. |

NOTICE: There are no restrictions for distribution of this
Bulletin provided that it remains complete and intact.

The information in the following Security Bulletin should be
acted upon as soon as possible.  Hewlett-Packard Company will
not be liable for any consequences to any customer resulting
from customer's failure to fully implement instructions in this
Security Bulletin as soon as possible.

PROBLEM: Potential buffer overflow in rexec(1)

IMPACT: Potential increase in privilege.

PLATFORM: HP-UX B.10.20, B.11.00, and B.11.04.

SOLUTION: B.10.20 - install PHCO\_26158 or subsequent.
          B.11.00 - install PHCO\_24723 or subsequent.
 -->      B.11.04 - install PHCO\_29190 or subsequent.

MANUAL ACTIONS: No

AVAILABILITY: All patches are available.

CHANGE SUMMARY: Rev.01 - Added PHCO\_26158.
                         Added PHCO\_29190.
                         Added AFFECTED VERSIONS section.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
 A. Background

    The SSRT thanks Davide Del Vecchio for
    reporting this potential vulnerability to HP.

    HP Tru64 UNIX is not vulnerable to this reported problem.

 --> AFFECTED VERSIONS
 -->
 --> The following is a list by HP-UX revision of
 --> affected filesets and the fileset revision or
 --> patch containing the fix.  To determine if a
 --> system has an affected version, search the
 --> output of "swlist -a revision -l fileset"
 --> for an affected fileset, then determine if
 --> a fixed revision or the applicable patch is
 --> installed.
 -->
 --> HP-UX B.11.04
 --> =============
 --> OS-Core.C-MIN
 --> OS-Core.CORE-SHLIBS

 -->B.11.04 - Install PHCO\_29190 or subsequent.
    B.11.00 - Install PHCO\_24723 or subsequent.  PHCO\_24723 has
              been superseded.  To find the recommended
              superseding patch and the latest superseding patch,
              search the technical knowledge base on itrc.hp.com
