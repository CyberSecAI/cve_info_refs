Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2003-1511:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue present in the Bajie HTTP JServer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The server does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.
- The vulnerability exists in how the server handles parameters in URLs and POST requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can inject malicious scripts that execute in the context of the victim's browser.
- This can lead to stealing cookies, performing actions on behalf of the user, redirecting users to malicious sites, or other forms of client-side attacks. The provided example demonstrates the ability to display a popup with the user's cookie data using `<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>`.
- According to the content, the Integrity impact is Partial, while Confidentiality and Availability are not impacted.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Attackers can inject the XSS payload through URL parameters:
   - `http://localhost/cgi/bin/test.txt?<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>`
- Attackers can also inject the XSS payload through POST parameters, specifically within HTML forms or by crafting HTTP requests:
   -  `POST /servlet/custMsg?guestName=<script>alert("bang")</script> HTTP/1.0`
   -  `POST /servlet/CookieExample?cookiename=<script>alert("bang")</script>&cookiev alue=&cookiepath= HTTP/1.0`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests containing the malicious JavaScript to a vulnerable instance of the Bajie HTTP JServer.
- The attack is remote, meaning the attacker does not require local access to the server.
- No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability was discovered by Oliver Karow on 16.10.2003.
- The identified vulnerable versions include the latest version at the time of discovery BajieJSrv/0.95zxv4 and probably older ones.
- The vulnerability is considered to have a medium attack complexity.

The provided content gives a good overview of the vulnerability, providing specific examples of how to exploit the XSS issue through both GET and POST requests.
