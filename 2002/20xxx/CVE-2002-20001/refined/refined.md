  "cveId": "CVE-2002-20001",
  "description": "The Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement Protocol allows remote attackers (from the client side) to send arbitrary numbers that are actually not public keys, and trigger expensive server-side DHE modular-exponentiation calculations, aka a D(HE)at or D(HE)ater attack. The client needs very little CPU resources and network bandwidth. The attack may be more disruptive in cases where a client can require a server to select its largest supported key size. The basic attack scenario is that the client must claim that it can only communicate with DHE, and the server must be configured to allow DHE.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    {
      "rootCause": "The vulnerability lies in the Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement Protocol where the server performs expensive modular-exponentiation calculations based on arbitrary numbers received from the client, which are not actual public keys.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400)"
      ],
      "impact": "Denial of Service (DoS) due to server resource exhaustion. The server's CPU usage can be driven to 100% with minimal client resources.",
      "attackVectors": [
        "Network-based attack from the client-side."
      ],
      "attackerCapabilities": "An attacker only needs to claim support for DHE and send arbitrary numbers instead of public keys, requiring minimal CPU and bandwidth resources.",
      "additionalDetails": "The attack is more disruptive if the client can force the server to use its largest supported key size. The D(HE)at attack exploits the serverâ€™s computational overhead during DHE modular exponentiation, while requiring minimal client-side effort, allowing an attacker to cause significant server resource exhaustion with minimal client resources."
