$Header: /cvsroot/Net::EasyTCP/Changes,v 1.40 2004/03/16 21:19:43 mina Exp $

REVISION HISTORY:

0.26
	- Minor bugfix that caused a 1-second responsivity lag on the server
	- Major bugfix that caused data loss when server bombarded client

0.25
	- Added support for 3 new symmetric encryption modules: Crypt::Twofish2,
	  Crypt::Twofish and Crypt::TEA

0.24
	- Fixed a bug that prevented servers running on machines without any encryption
	  or compression modules installed from negotiating correctly unless donotencrypt
	  or donotcompress was supplied to the constructor.
	- Better comments in the SYNOPSIS examples of a server and a client
	- A couple of small documentation changes to clarify the difference between
	  a normal client and a hybrid (server-created) client, and the methods
	  available to each.  Thanks to Christian Chapman <secret_hamster@hotmail.com>

0.23
	- Fixed a bug in using Crypt::RSA that completely prevented it from functioning
	  on some systems.
	- Fixed random negotiation failure while using Crypt::RSA by moving the compatability
	  key length of from 338 to 512 bits.  Unfortunately, this means that negotiation
	  will take longer :(
	- Implemented two new parameters to be passed to the "new" constructor:
	  donotcompresswith, and donotencryptwith.  These allow you to selectively disable
	  the use of certain compression/encryption modules.
	- Much better+graceful error-handling for all Encryption and Compression modules
	- Minor internal code cleanups

0.22
	- Fixed a bug that prevented versions 0.20 and 0.21 from working correctly when
	  Crypt::RSA was installed.

0.21
	- Fixed a bug that prevented version 0.20 clients to talk to servers in older versions.

0.20
	- No more strict dependency on exact versions match for the Storable module, encryption
	  or compression modules.
	  It used to be that Net::EasyTCP clients and servers insisted that if they use a module
	  mentioned above, that both ends used the same version.  This was required because it
	  was observed that different versions of the same module could sometime produce
	  incompatible data (which is a bad thing when you're trying to decrypt an encrypted
	  message you just received).
	  This problem is now fixed.  During the negotiation phase, the clients and the servers
	  will test all the modules and decide on which to use on compatability checks and the
	  ability to deal with sample data, as opposed to version checks.
	- Callback suppplied to the start() method will be given the server object as it's only
	  argument as opposed to no arguments.
	- Internal code cleanups

0.19
	- Fixed a bug in the testing script that caused the test to fail if you already had a
	  TCP/IP daemon on the machine listening on port 2345
	- Increased the timeout for a client negotiationg with a server to avoid a race
	  condition of a server and a client launching shortly after each other (as in the
	  case of the test script) while the server takes a bit of time to prepare itself
	  before it's ready for negotiation.
	- Implemented various minor potential bugfixes and fixed some strict/warning error
	  messages thanks to Michael Krause (VKrauseM@web.de)'s patches
	- Implemented a "timeout" option that you can supply to the new() constructor
	  while creating a new client object, which you can use to override the default
	  30 second timeout to establish a TCP/IP socket with the server.  Thanks to Michael
	  Krause (VKrauseM@web.de)
	- Minor code cleanup, with slightly faster encryption key generation time compared
	  to version 0.18

0.18
	- Fixed a bug that caused clients on certain OSes (Noticably SunOS 5.6) to randomly fail
	  logging on to a server giving a "Server rejected supplied password" error
	- Minor internal code cleanups

0.17
	- Fixed some warnings that might have been generated by use strict/warnings. Thanks to
	  Michael Krause.
	- Changed test.pl a fork() to create a seperate client-and-server processes instead
	  of trying to multitask using select() and alarms (that failed on some older SunOSs).
	- Test script no longer hangs at step #4 for that long.
	- Fixed minor error message if do_one_loop() was invoked on a client object.

0.16
	- Fixed a bug that was introduced in 0.15 where the module died if Crypt::Random existed
	  but it was older than 0.34 or modules IT depended on (such as Math::Pari) didn't exist.

0.15
	- Implemented stronger number generator (Crypt::Random).  This module will be used instead
	  of perl's built-in rand() if it's available.
	- Fixed a potential bug that was introduced in version 0.14 that might have stopped the
	  test script (although not the module) from succeeding on BSD systems.
	- Test suite will now (nicely) refuse to run under Win32 as opposed to the fiasco that
	  happened before.  Keep in mind that the module itself should work okay under win32, the
	  problem was only with the test script trying to act as both a client and server without
	  being able to fork() or use alarm().  Testing could be done manually bu the /util/client.pl
	  and /util/server.pl scripts.
	- Implemented a (weak) internal encryption routine that will be used to encrypt the password
	  hash and encryption keys in transit, as a last resort in case no encryption modules were
	  found.
	- Fixed some warnings that might have been generated by use strict/warnings. Thanks to
	  Michael Krause.
	- Implemented more secure communications when using symmetric encryption modules by
	  utilizing the "password" paramater as part of the non-broadcastable encryption key.
	  This should dramatically increase the security of symmetric encryption, however it's
	  still no match for As-symmetric encryption modules such as Crypt::RSA.
	- Implemented an optional parameter to be passed to the start() method (a coderef).
	  If supplied, the code will be called every loop.  This could be used to allow you
	  to do other things concurrently while a server's running (comparable to the
	  do_one_loop() philosophy).
	- Added to the handshake phase the comparison of the version of the Storable module as
	  which would produce the same error as compression/encryption module version mismatches.
	  This can (also) be turned off by supplying the donotcheckversion constructor option.

0.14
	- Implemented a do_one_loop() method to allow servers you write to do other things
	  concurrently instead of the old way of being dedicated through the start() method.
	- Localized some variables to the server object.  This prevented running multiple servers
	  previously within the same program.
	- Added some more internal notes.

0.13
	- Fixed a bug where supplying 4 parameters to substr() choked on older versions of perl
	  substr() calls now only use 3 paramaters.
	- Added 2 new methods, addclientip() and deleteclientip() which may be used to restrict
	  a server to only accept connections from certain IP addresses.

0.12
	- Fixed a bug where if Crypt::RSA was not installed the test suite would fail.
	- The welcome message viewable via telnet-ting into the server is now formatted nicer.

0.11
	- Fixed a small issue where if a server and a client were configured to use a password, the
	  password negotiation occurred before the encryption negotiation, which caused the password
	  hash to be transmitted using weak internal encryption.  This has been fixed by making the
	  password negotiation occur after encryption negotiation.  It's not really a major security
	  issue since only a hash and not the real password was transmitted, but still.... this forces
	  a hacker to break the encryption first before they can get the hash, which they THEN have
	  to brute-force break....
	- As requested by a CPAN tester, added numbers to the output of 'make test'. Note that due to
	  the fact that make test fork()s, the numbers may not be consequtive.
	- The server will generate a new RSA keypair every hour, this substantially increases
	  security.
	- Implemented support of "donotcheckversion" which would allow the client to continue
	  negotiating even if an encryption/compression module version mismatch is encountered.
	  Before you use this feature read the POD/man Net::EasyTCP documentation to understand the
	  consequences.
	- The clear-text welcome message displayed by the server is now more organized.
	- Clarified some vague error messages that were sometimes returned if negotiations failed.
	- Minor internal re-organizations.

0.10
	- Bugfixes release.
	- A bug was introduced in version 0.09 where if a client did not have any encryption modules
	  installed it would fail negotiating with the server and would not be able to connect.  This
	  was fixed.
	- A bug where failure to generate encryption keys was not handled correctly and passed on as
	  a success, causing random halts and freezes during.  This was fixed.
	- Clarified the error message when a client times out during negotiating with a server
	- Encryption keypairs were always being generated and not used even if the objects were created
	  with "donotencrypt".  This caused slowdown especially when Crypt::RSA was used due to it's
	  slowness in generating keypairs.  This issue was fixed.
	- A potential bug where an encryption or compression module version-conflict error was incorrectly
	  reported.

0.09
	- Implemented Crypt::RSA support.  This is the first supported module that implements
	  assymmetric cryptography.  Users who are serious about the security of their en-route
	  data are strongly advised to upgrade and make use of this encryption module.
	- Small bugfix where client-negotiation-timeouts were not reported correctly.

0.08
	- Bugfix release.  An internal variable was assigned to both Crypt::Rijndael and Crypt::RC6
	  (they should have received different variables).  This causes negotiations to often fail
	  when a client has RC6 and not Rijndael and the server had the opposite, or vice-versa.
	- Implemented encryption and compression module version checking.  The client will fail
	  to connect to a server if the agreed-on encryption or compression module has a version
	  mismatch.  The failure error in $@ will advise of so.

0.07
	- Minor changes to the negotiation routine, including improved security during encryption key
	  exchange.
	- Implemented a "password" feature where a server will require a password from the client before
	  accepting connection.
	- Added 2 methods (remoteip() and remoteport()) to retrieve the IP address/port of the remote
	  connection.
	- Added support to Crypt::Rijndael encryption.
	- Added support to Crypt::RC6 encryption.
	- Changes to the send and receive routines to allow the server to better manage large amounts
	  of data from several clients at the same time.

0.06
	- Re-organized many internal functions to better manage memmory and free up memory no longer used
	  sooner.
	- Added new method clients() to return the list of clients or number of clients connected to a
	  server.
	- Modified the new() constructor to accept a "Welcome" message visible by telnetting into a server.

0.05
	- Fixed a bug where calling the receive() method may have failed if a signal (such as child dying)
	  was delivered to the process at the same time.  The bug became apparent on heavily-stormed
	  servers with many forked() children dying, causing the negotiation with new clients to sometimes
	  fail.
	- Re-wrote the server-side negotiating code to prevent it from blocking for couple of seconds during
	  negotiating with a newly connected client.

0.04
	- Fixed a bug where older versions of Crypt::CBC were not called correctly causing "make test"
	  and almost everything else to fail.
	- Minor changes to the protocol negotiation

0.03
	- Added encryption support for Crypt::DES_EDE3, Crypt::DES and Crypt::Blowfish
	- Added 2 new methods to determine what type of compression and encryption has been negotiated.

0.02
	- Implemented transparent compression
	- Implemented transparent encryption
	- Internal protocol majorly re-designed to accomodate new and future features
	- Re-wrote the test routine to use fork() and simulate a real-world scenario
	- Minor bugfixes in receive()

0.01
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.19

However, this suggests that it falls back to rand.

# DESCRIPTION

This class allows you to easily create TCP/IP clients and servers and provides an OO interface to manage the connection(s). This allows you to concentrate on the application rather than on the transport.

You still have to engineer your high-level protocol. For example, if you're writing an SMTP client-server pair, you will have to teach your client to send "HELO" when it connects, and you will have to teach your server what to do once it receives the "HELO" command, and so forth.

What you won't have to do is worry about how the command will get there, about line termination, about binary data, complex-structure serialization, encryption, compression, or about fragmented packets on the received end. All of these will be taken care of by this class.

# CONSTRUCTOR

new(%hash)

Constructs and returns a new Net::EasyTCP object. Such an object behaves in one of two modes (that needs to be supplied to new() on creation time). You can create either a server object (which accepts connections from several clients) or a client object (which initiates a connection to a server).

new() expects to be passed a hash. The following keys are accepted:

donotcheckversion

Set to 1 to force a client to continue connecting even if an encryption/compression/Storable module version mismatch is detected. (Using this is highly unrecommended, you should upgrade the module in question to the same version on both ends) (Optional and acceptable when mode is "client")

donotcompress

Set to 1 to forcefully disable [compression](/pod/COMPRESSION%20AND%20ENCRYPTION) even if the appropriate module(s) are found. (Optional)

donotencrypt

Set to 1 to forcefully disable [encryption](/pod/COMPRESSION%20AND%20ENCRYPTION) even if the appropriate module(s) are found. (Optional)

host

Must be set to the hostname/IP address to connect to. (Mandatory when mode is "client")

mode

Must be set to either "client" or "server" according to the type of object you want returned. (Mandatory)

password

Defines a password to use for the connection. When mode is "server" this password will be required from clients before the full connection is accepted . When mode is "client" this is the password that the server connecting to requires.

Also, when encryption using a symmetric encryption module is used, this password is included as part of the secret "key" for encrypting the data. (Optional)

port

Must be set to the port the client connects to (if mode is "client") or to the port to listen to (if mode is "server"). If you're writing a client+server pair, they must both use the same port number. (Mandatory)

welcome

If someone uses an interactive telnet program to telnet to the server, they will see this welcome message. (Optional and acceptable only when mode is "server")

# METHODS

**[C] = Available to objects created as mode "client"**

**[S] = Available to objects created as mode "server"**

addclientip(@array)

**[S]** Adds an IP address (or IP addresses) to the list of allowed clients to a server. If this is done, the server will not accept connections from clients not in it's list.

The compliment of this function is deleteclientip() .

callback(%hash)

See setcallback()

clients()

**[S]** Returns all the clients currently connected to the server. If called in array context will return an array of client objects. If called in scalar context will return the number of clients connected.

close()

**[C]** Instructs a client object to close it's connection with a server.

compression()

**[C]** Returns the name of the module used as the compression module for this connection, undef if no compression occurs.

data()

**[C]** Retrieves the previously-retrieved data associated with a client object. This method is typically used from inside the callback sub associated with the "data" event, since the callback sub is passed nothing more than a client object.

deleteclientip(@array)

**[S]** Deletes an IP address (or IP addresses) from the list of allowed clients to a server. The IP address (or IP addresses) supplied will no longer be able to connect to the server.

The compliment of this function is addclientip() .

disconnect()

See close()

do\_one\_loop()

**[S]** Instructs a server object to "do one loop" and return ASAP. This method needs to be called VERY frequently for a server object to function as expected (either through some sort of loop inside your program if you need to do other things beside serve clients, or via the start() method if your entire program is dedicated to serving clients). Each one loop will help the server do it's job, including accepting new clients, receiving data from them, firing off the appropriate callbacks etc.

encryption()

**[C]** Returns the name of the module used as the encryption module for this connection, undef if no encryption occurs.

mode()

**[C][S]** Identifies the mode of the object. Returns either "client" or "server"

receive($timeout)

**[C]** Receives data sent to the client by a server and returns it. It will block until data is received or until a certain timeout of inactivity (no data transferring) has occurred.

It accepts an optional parameter, a timeout value in seconds. If none is supplied it will default to 300.

remoteip()

**[C]** Returns the IP address of the host on the other end of the connection.

remoteport()

**[C]** Returns the port of the host on the other end of the connection.

running()

**[S]** Returns true if the server is running (started), false if it is not.

send($data)

**[C]** Sends data to a server. It can be used on client objects you create with the new() constructor, clients objects returned by the clients() method, or with client objects passed to your callback subs by a running server.

It accepts one parameter, and that is the data to send. The data can be a simple scalar or a reference to something more complex.

serial()

**[C]** Retrieves the serial number of a client object, This is a simple integer that allows your callback subs to easily differentiate between different clients.

setcallback(%hash)

**[S]** Tells the server which subroutines to call when specific events happen. For example when a client sends the server data, the server calls the "data" callback sub.

setcallback() expects to be passed a hash. Each key in the hash is the callback type identifier, and the value is a reference to a sub to call once that callback type event occurs.

Valid keys in that hash are:

connect

Called when a new client connects to the server

data

Called when an existing client sends data to the server

disconnect

Called when an existing client disconnects

Whenever a callback sub is called, it is passed a single parameter, a CLIENT OBJECT. The callback code may then use any of the methods available to client objects to do whatever it wants to do (Read data sent from the client, reply to the client, close the client connection etc...)

socket()

**[C]** Returns the handle of the socket (actually an [IO::Socket](/pod/IO%3A%3ASocket) object) associated with the supplied object. This is useful if you're interested in using [IO::Select](/pod/IO%3A%3ASelect) or select() and want to add a client object's socket handle to the select list.

Note that eventhough there's nothing stopping you from reading and writing directly to the socket handle you retrieve via this method, you should never do this since doing so would definately corrupt the internal protocol and may render your connection useless. Instead you should use the send() and receive() methods.

start(subref)

**[S]** Starts a server and does NOT return until the server is stopped via the stop() method. This method is a simple while() wrapper around the do\_one\_loop() method and should be used if your entire program is dedicated to being a server, and does not need to do anything else concurrently.

If you need to concurrently do other things when the server is running, then you can supply to start() the optional reference to a subroutine (very similar to the callback() method). If that is supplied, it will be called every loop. This is very similar to the callback subs, except that the called sub will NOT be passed anything (unlike normal client callbacks which are passed a client object). The other alternative to performing other tasks concurrently is to not use the start() method at all and directly call do\_one\_loop() repeatedly in your own program.

stop()

**[S]** Instructs a running server to stop and returns immediately (does not wait for the server to actually stop, which may be a few seconds later). To check if the server is still running or not use the running() method.

# COMPRESSION AND ENCRYPTION

Clients and servers written using this class will automatically compress and/or encrypt the transferred data if the appropriate modules are found.

Compression will be automatically enabled if one (or more) of: [Compress::Zlib](/pod/Compress%3A%3AZlib) or [Compress::LZF](/pod/Compress%3A%3ALZF) are installed on both the client and the server.

As-symmetric encryption will be automatically enabled if [Crypt::RSA](/pod/Crypt%3A%3ARSA) is installed on both the client and the server.

Symmetric encryption will be automatically enabled if one (or more) of: [Crypt::Rijndael](/pod/Crypt%3A%3ARijndael)\* or [Crypt::RC6](/pod/Crypt%3A%3ARC6)\* or [Crypt::Blowfish](/pod/Crypt%3A%3ABlowfish)\* or [Crypt::DES\_EDE3](/pod/Crypt%3A%3ADES_EDE3)\* or [Crypt::DES](/pod/Crypt%3A%3ADES)\* or [Crypt::CipherSaber](/pod/Crypt%3A%3ACipherSaber) are installed on both the client and the server.

Strong randomization will be automatically enabled if [Crypt::Random](/pod/Crypt%3A%3ARandom) is installed; otherwise perl's internal rand() is used to generate random keys.

Preference to the compression/encryption method used is determind by availablity checking following the order in which they are presented in the above lists.

Note that during the negotiation upon connection, the server and client will communicate the version of the selected encryption/compression modules. If a version mismatch is found, the client will report a connection failure stating the reason (module version mismatch). This behavior was necessary since it was observed that different versions of the same module could produce incompatible output. If this is encountered, it is strongly recommended you upgrade the module in question to the same version on both ends. However, if you wish to forcefully connect overlooking a version mismatch (risking instability/random problems/data corruption) you may supply the "donotcheckversion" key to the new() constructor of the client object.

To find out which module(s) have been negotiated for use you can use the compression() and encryption() methods.

\* Note that for this class's purposes, [Crypt::CBC](/pod/Crypt%3A%3ACBC) is a requirement to use any of the encryption modules with a \* next to it's name in the above list. So eventhough you may have these modules installed on both the client and the server, they will not be used unless [Crypt::CBC](/pod/Crypt%3A%3ACBC) is also installed on both ends.

\* Note that the nature of symmetric cryptography dictates sharing the secret keys somehow. It is therefore highly recommend to use an As-symmetric cryptography module (such as Crypt::RSA) for serious encryption needs; as a determined hacker might find it trivial to decrypt your data with other symmetric modules.

\* Note that if symmetric cryptography is used, then it is highly recommended to also use the "password" feature on your servers and clients; since then the "password" will, aside from authentication, be also used in the "secret key" to encrypt the data. Without a password, the secret key has to be transmitted to the other side during the handshake, significantly lowering the overall security of the data.

If the above modules are installed but you want to forcefully disable compression or encryption, supply the "donotcompress" and/or "donotencrypt" keys to the new() constructor.

# RETURN VALUES AND ERRORS

The constructor and all methods return something that evaluates to true when successful, and to false when not successful.

There are a couple of exceptions to the above rule and they are the following methods:

* clients()
* data()

The above methods may return something that evaluates to false (such as an empty string, an empty array, or the string "0") eventhough there was no error. In that case check if the returned value is defined or not, using the defined() Perl function.

If not successful, the variable $@ will contain a description of the error that occurred.

# NOTES

Incompatability with Net::EasyTCP version 0.01

Version 0.02 and later have had their internal protocol modified to a fairly large degree. This has made compatability with version 0.01 impossible. If you're going to use version 0.02 or later (highly recommended), then you will need to make sure that none of the clients/servers are still using version 0.01. It is highly recommended to use the same version of this module on both sides.

Internal Protocol

This class implements a miniature protocol when it sends and receives data between it's clients and servers. This means that a server created using this class cannot properly communicate with a normal client of any protocol (pop3/smtp/etc..) unless that client was also written using this class. It also means that a client written with this class will not properly communicate with a different server (telnet/smtp/pop3 server for example, unless that server is implemented using this class also). This limitation will not change in future releases due to the plethora of advantages the internal protocol gives us.

In other words, if you write a server using this class, write the client using this class also, and vice versa.

Delays

This class does not use the fork() method whatsoever. This means that all it's input/output and multi-socket handling is done via select().

This leads to the following limitation: When a server calls one of your callback subs, it waits for it to return and therefore cannot do anything else. If your callback sub takes 5 minutes to return, then the server will not be able to do anything for 5 minutes, such as acknowledge new clients, or process input from other clients.

In other words, make the code in your callbacks' subs' minimal and strive to make it return as fast as possible.

Deadlocks

As with any client-server scenario, make sure you engineer how they're going to talk to each other, and the order they're going to talk to each other in, quite carefully. If both ends of the connection are waiting for the other end to say something, you've got a deadlock.
