This document provides detailed information about the vulnerability described in CVE-2002-1183 and its original variant (CAN-2002-0862).

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the improper validation of the Basic Constraints field within X.509 digital certificates by CryptoAPI and similar implementations in some Microsoft products for Macintosh. Specifically, the affected software does not properly check the Basic Constraints field, which indicates whether a certificate is authorized to act as a Certificate Authority (CA) and the maximum length of the certificate chain.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary weakness is the failure to validate the Basic Constraints field. This allows an attacker to use a valid end-entity certificate to issue subordinate certificates that would otherwise be deemed invalid. This can be used to spoof identities by creating seemingly valid certificates.
Additionally, a new variant of the vulnerability, discovered later, also involves a flaw in the way certificate validation is performed and could enable an attacker to gain control over a user's system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
The original vulnerability could enable various identity spoofing attacks:
*   Setting up a website that poses as a different website, using a forged SSL certificate.
*   Sending emails with a digital signature that appears to belong to someone else.
*   Spoofing certificate-based authentication systems to gain unauthorized access.
*   Signing malware using an Authenticode certificate that claims to have been issued to a trusted company.
The new variant of the vulnerability could allow an attacker to gain complete control over the user's machine.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   An attacker would need to possess a valid end-entity certificate issued by a CA trusted by the target system.
*   The attacker would then use this certificate to create a bogus subordinate certificate.
*   The attacker would need to induce the user to interact with the forged certificate, either by visiting a malicious website, opening a malicious email, or other means.
* For the new variant, the attacker would also need to exploit the vulnerability by crafting a digital certificate that could be used to gain control over a user's machine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs a valid end-entity certificate issued by a trusted CA.
*   The attacker needs to have the technical knowledge to create a malicious, yet seemingly valid subordinate certificate.
*   For web site spoofing the attacker would need to redirect the user to the attacker's web site through DNS poisoning or similar methods.
*   For malware signing, the attacker would need to have access to software they want to sign with a forged certificate.

The document provides detailed information on mitigating factors, patch availability, and FAQ about the vulnerability. It also notes that the new variant affects only Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 98/98SE systems, while the original vulnerability also affected Windows Me, 2000 and XP, and Microsoft products for Macintosh.
