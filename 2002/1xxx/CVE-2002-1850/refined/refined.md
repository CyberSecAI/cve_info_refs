Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is a deadlock in Apache's `mod_cgi` module when a CGI script writes more data to `stderr` than the pipe's buffer can hold (4096 bytes on Linux). This occurs because `mod_cgi` first attempts to read all data from the CGI's `stdout` before processing `stderr`. When the `stderr` buffer fills up, the CGI process blocks, waiting for the data to be read. Meanwhile, Apache is blocked waiting to read from `stdout`, creating a deadlock.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Blocking I/O:** `mod_cgi` uses blocking reads on the CGI's `stdout` pipe, which leads to a deadlock if `stderr` fills its buffer.
*   **Sequential Processing:** The module reads `stdout` before `stderr`, which exacerbates the issue by not providing a mechanism for reading from the `stderr` pipe when it is full.
*   **Limited Buffer:** The default pipe buffer size of 4096 bytes on Linux is insufficient, especially for CGI scripts that might produce verbose error messages or debugging output.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A local user can cause the Apache `httpd` process to hang by crafting a CGI script that writes more than 4096 bytes to `stderr`. This can lead to a full denial of service on a web server as all the available `httpd` processes become blocked.
*   **Server Instability:** The deadlock can result in an accumulation of hung processes, leading to system instability, resource exhaustion, and potentially "out of memory" errors.
*   **Application Failure:** CGI scripts can fail to produce output or complete, impacting the functionality of web applications that rely on them.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious CGI Script:** An attacker with the ability to execute CGI scripts on the server can write a script designed to fill the `stderr` buffer, triggering the deadlock.
*   **Unexpected Application Behavior:**  A seemingly innocuous CGI script that generates a large amount of debugging information or warning messages to `stderr` can inadvertently cause the server to hang.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Access:** The attacker needs local user access to the web server to upload or create a CGI script or modify an existing one.
*   **CGI Execution Rights:** The attacker needs the ability to execute CGI scripts through the webserver.

**Additional Notes**

*   The issue is a regression from Apache 1.3, where `stderr` was simply hooked into the error log.
*   The problem was observed in Apache 2.0 versions 2.0.39 and 2.0.40, but also present in later versions before the fix was implemented.
*   A fix involved creating a new "CGI bucket" type that polls both `stdout` and `stderr` and drains them concurrently to prevent the deadlock.
*   A patch was developed and eventually integrated into Apache 2.0.50.
*   Workarounds include redirecting stderr to a file or setting it to non-blocking mode, which would cause the excess output to be dropped.
*   The vulnerability is platform-specific (primarily Linux). It does not appear on FreeBSD.

The provided information clearly relates to a vulnerability in the Apache HTTP server, specifically a deadlock within the `mod_cgi` module caused by excessive data on `stderr`. It provides a good level of detail regarding the root cause, impact, and attack vectors, and is therefore highly relevant to CVE-2002-1850.
