Root cause of vulnerability: The provided URL suggests a vulnerability related to Microsoft ActiveX Data Objects (ADO) due to the filename "ms-ado.txt". The query parameter "fp=-3" hints at a potential flaw related to the handling of file paths or offset within ADO.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The vulnerability appears to be related to how Microsoft ADO handles file paths or offsets, specifically when a negative offset is provided.

Impact of exploitation: The negative file offset could potentially lead to an out-of-bounds read or write, allowing an attacker to read or manipulate memory beyond the intended buffer. This could result in denial of service, or possibly arbitrary code execution if carefully crafted.

Attack vectors: The attack vector is through a malicious file or data stream processed by Microsoft ADO which contains the negative offset.

Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker would need to be able to provide input or a file containing the specific parameters that triggers the vulnerability to a system that is using Microsoft ADO for data access. This could be through a web application, file processing routine or another program utilizing the vulnerable components.
