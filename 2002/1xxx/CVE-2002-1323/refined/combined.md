Trustix Secure Linux Security Advisory #2002-0087

Package name:      perl
Summary:           Safe compartments not being safe
Date:              2002-12-19
Affected versions: TSL 1.01, 1.1, 1.2, 1.5

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
Package description:
  Perl is a high-level programming language with roots in C, sed, awk
  and shell scripting.  Perl is good at handling processes and files,
  and is especially good at handling text.  Perl's hallmarks are
  practicality and efficiency.  While it is used to do a lot of
  different things, Perl's most common applications (and what it excels
  at) are probably system administration utilities and web programming.
  A large proportion of the CGI scripts on the web are written in Perl.

Problem description:
  Perl allows for socalled "safe compartmemts" where code can be
  evalutated without access to variables outside this environment.
  There was, however, a bug with regards to applications using this
  safe compartment more than once.

Action:
  We recommend that all systems with this package installed be upgraded.
  Please note that if you do not need the functionality provided by this
  package, you may want to remove it from your system.

Location:
  All TSL updates are available from
  <URI:<http://www.trustix.net/pub/Trustix/updates/>>
  <URI:ftp://ftp.trustix.net/pub/Trustix/updates/>

About Trustix Secure Linux:
  Trustix Secure Linux is a small Linux distribution for servers. With focus
  on security and stability, the system is painlessly kept safe and up to
  date from day one using swup, the automated software updater.

Automatic updates:
  Users of the SWUP tool can enjoy having updates automatically
  installed using 'swup --upgrade'.

  Get SWUP from:
  <URI:ftp://ftp.trustix.net/pub/Trustix/software/swup/>

Public testing:
  These packages have been available for public testing for some time.
  If you want to contribute by testing the various packages in the
  testing tree, please feel free to share your findings on the
  tsl-discuss mailinglist.
  The testing tree is located at
  <URI:<http://www.trustix.net/pub/Trustix/testing/>>
  <URI:ftp://ftp.trustix.net/pub/Trustix/testing/>

Questions?
  Check out our mailing lists:
  <URI:<http://www.trustix.net/support/>>

Verification:
  This advisory along with all TSL packages are signed with the TSL sign key.
  This key is available from:
  <URI:<http://www.trustix.net/TSL-GPG-KEY>>

  The advisory itself is available from the errata pages at

________________________________________________________________________

Package:             perl
Vulnerability:       unsafe Safe compartment
OpenPKG Specific:    no

Dependent Packages:  none

Affected Releases:   Affected Packages:       Corrected Packages:
OpenPKG 1.0          <= perl-5.6.1-1.0.1     >= perl-5.6.1-1.0.2
OpenPKG 1.1          <= perl-5.6.1-1.1.0     >= perl-5.6.1-1.1.1
OpenPKG CURRENT      <= perl-5.8.0-20021129  >= perl-5.8.0-20021216

Description:
  Andreas Jurenda discovered [[0]](#0) a security hole in Safe.pm for Perl
  [[1]](#1). When a Safe compartment has already been used, there's no
  guarantee that it's safe any longer, because there's a way for code
  executed within the Safe compartment to alter its operation mask.
  Programs that use a Safe compartment only once aren't affected by this
  bug.

  Check whether you are affected by running "<prefix>/bin/rpm -q perl".
  If you have an affected version of the Perl package (see above),
  please upgrade it according to the solution below.

Solution:
  Update existing packages to newly patched versions of Perl. Select the
  updated source RPM appropriate for your OpenPKG release [2][3][[4]](#4), and
  fetch it from the OpenPKG FTP service or a mirror location. Verify its
  integrity [[5]](#5), build a corresponding binary RPM from it and update your
  OpenPKG installation by applying the binary RPM [[6]](#6). For the latest
  OpenPKG 1.1 release, perform the following operations to permanently fix
  the security problem (for other releases adjust accordingly).

  $ ftp ftp.openpkg.org
  ftp> bin
  ftp> cd release/1.1/UPD
  ftp> get perl-5.6.1-1.1.1.src.rpm
  ftp> bye
  $ <prefix>/bin/rpm -v --checksig perl-5.6.1-1.1.1.src.rpm
  $ <prefix>/bin/rpm --rebuild perl-5.6.1-1.1.1.src.rpm
  $ su -
  # <prefix>/bin/rpm -Fvh <prefix>/RPM/PKG/perl-5.6.1-1.1.1.*.rpm

GENTOO LINUX SECURITY ANNOUNCEMENT 200212-6
- - --------------------------------------------------------------------

PACKAGE : perl
SUMMARY : broken safe compartment
DATE    : 2002-12-20 14:12 UTC
EXPLOIT : local

- - --------------------------------------------------------------------

Quote from <http://use.perl.org/articles/02/10/06/1118222.shtml?tid=5>

"A security hole has been discovered in Safe.pm. When a Safe
compartment has already been used, there's no guarantee that it's safe
any longer, because there's a way for code executed within the Safe
compartment to alter its operation mask. (Thus, programs that use a
Safe compartment only once aren't affected by this bug"

Mor information is available at
<http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=rt-17744-39131.3.96370682846239%40bugs6.perl.org>

SOLUTION

It is recommended that all Gentoo Linux users who are running
sys-devel/perl-5.6.1-r9 or sys-devel/5.8.0-r5 and earlier update their
systems as follows:

emerge rsync
emerge perl
emerge clean

ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION

If you don't want to or can't upgrade your perl package right away,
you can emerge dev-perl/Safe to accomplish the same solution as above.
