Since the vendors didn't bother to respond, I might as well forward this
on.

Basic jizt - Invision Board (all version) - installation guide copies
across phpinfo.php, a file which calls phpinfo().

Example;
<http://blahblahblah.corp.com/phpinfo.php>

(just do a search on Google for "Invision Board" and append phpinfo.php to
the URL).

Why is this bad?  Well, duh.  It gives you system varibles, path names,
modules of apache, PHP setup, Apache module version numbers etc etc.

Note to vendors: please reply to security mail in the future.

Subject: Information Disclosure with Invision Board installation

Hi,

Okay, how to explain this one...

The installation procedure for Invision Board advises to upload various
files and directorys.  One of these is 'phpinfo.php'.

Now, I'm sorry, but this is dumb.

Why?

Example.

<http://forums.invisionboard.com/phpinfo.php>

I can now tell you don't have PHP Safe mode installed, exactly what Apache
modules you have loaded, your full Apache SERVER_SOFTWARE (Apache/1.3.26
(Unix) mod_bwlimited/1.0 PHP/4.2.1 mod_log_bytes/0.3 FrontPage/5.0.2.2510
mod_ssl/2.8.9 OpenSSL/0.9.6b)...

etc.

PHP modules, settings, system variables...  They're all out there.  Also,
note, your OpenSSL version is out of date and fully remotely exploitable
(I managed to obtain that from phpinfo.php - you had it hidden before, but
phpinfo.php discloses this information).

Do you agree this is a problem?

You need to modify the installation guide to say this file should *only*
be uploaded for diagnoises and debugging reasons, and possible move it to
a different folder (eg debug) to stop people uploading it by accident.
People also need to be reminded to *remove* the file if they upload it for
debugging purposes after they finish.

You also need to notify existing users of the software about the file.

I did a quick Google search for "Invision Board", and every single one of
the boards I tried (About 50) had the file.  Oops.

I'm planning to do some kind of bugtraq announcement after I've got a plan
of action from yourselves (and I've given you a decent grace period),
basically to make sure as many people as possible remove the file.

Thanks muchly,

Gossi The Dog.
