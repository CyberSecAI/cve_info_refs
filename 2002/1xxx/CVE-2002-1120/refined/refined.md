- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Stack buffer overflow in Savant 3.1 Web Server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to insufficient bounds checking when handling HTTP requests. The server processes the HTTP method without proper length validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system. This can lead to complete system compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered via a specially crafted HTTP request with an overly long method string sent to the server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server. The attacker is required to be in a network position where they can communicate with the vulnerable service.
