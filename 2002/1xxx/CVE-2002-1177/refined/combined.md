Foundstone Research Labs Advisory - FS2002-10

Advisory Name:	Multiple Exploitable Buffer Overflows in Winamp
 Release Date:	December 18, 2002
  Application:	Winamp 3.0 and Winamp 2.81
    Platforms:	Windows NT/2000/XP
     Severity:	Remote code execution
      Vendors:	Nullsoft (<http://www.nullsoft.com>)
      Authors:	Tony Bettini, Foundstone (tony.bettini@foundstone.com)
CVE Candidate:	CAN-2002-1176
			CAN-2002-1177
    Reference:	<http://www.foundstone.com/advisories>
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview:

One buffer overflow exists in Winamp 2.81 (latest 2.x release) and two
buffer overflows exist in Winamp 3.0 (latest 3.x release). The
Winamp 2.81 overflow is with the handling of the Artist ID3v2 tag upon
immediate loading of an MP3. The two Winamp 3.0 overflows are present
in Media Library's handling of the Artist and Album ID3v2 tags.

Detailed Description:

Winamp 2.81 Overflow

If a long Artist ID3v2 tag is present within an MP3, Winamp 2.81 will
crash yielding privileges immediately upon loading the MP3.

Two Winamp 3.0 Media Library Overflows

If an MP3 is loaded into Winamp 3.0 that has an ID3v2 tag, the Artist
and Album fields of the ID3v2 tag are displayed within the Media
Library window of Winamp3. An attacker could create a malicious MP3
file, that if loaded via the Media Library window, would compromise
the system and allow for remote code execution.

An attacker could create a malicious MP3 file that exploits either the
overflow of the Artist ID3v2 tag or the Album ID3v2 tag (or both). For
either overflow to occur, the user has to attempt to load the MP3 file
from the Media Library by at least single clicking on either the MP3
via the Artist or Album window.

Vendor Response:

Nullsoft has released fixed versions of Winamp 2.81 and Winamp 3.0 and
both are available at: <http://www.winamp.com>

Foundstone would like to thank Nullsoft for their cooperation with
the remediation of this vulnerability.

Solution:

For Winamp 2.81 users

We recommend either upgrading to Winamp 3.0 or redownloading Winamp 2.81
(which has since been fixed) from: <http://www.winamp.com>

For Winamp 3.0 users

Only Winamp 3.0 build #488 built on December 15, 2002 and later are not
vulnerable. We recommend if the About Winamp3 dialog box within
Winamp 3.0 displays a 3.0 release that has a lower build number than
488 or earlier date than Dec 15 2002, we recommend redownloading
Winamp 3.0 from: <http://www.winamp.com>
