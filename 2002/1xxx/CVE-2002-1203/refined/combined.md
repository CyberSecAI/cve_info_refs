Title: Flood ACK packets cause an IBM SecureWay FireWall DoS.

Released: 9th Oct 2002
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Vulnerable:
===========
- SecureWay 4.2.x on AIX

Overview:
=========
	SecureWay is a robust FireWall product developed by IBM who works over AIX
an Windows plataform. Is not a full fledged stateful packet filter, but more
like a stateful-inspection with connection-centric deterministic-filtering firewall.

There exists an stack problem with malformed TCP packets that can lead
SecureWay to a DoS condition. To reach this condition a big band width is require.

Details:
========
When an all zeroed flags TCP packets is sent to the SecureWay FireWall, this
recognize the invalid packet only after a lot of procesing has been done. Because
of this, a flood of this forged packeges consumes a lot of resources and can lead
the IBM SecureWay FireWall to a deny of services condition.

To reach the DoS condition the flood must be over 2.8 Mbps, so this is more a
DDoS attack.

On servers running SecureWay, the standar AIX fix does not work.

Vendor Response:
================
IBM was contacted on July 14, 2002. The vendedor confirm the problem and release
a fix.

Corrective Action:
==================
Update to SecureWay Firewall 4.2.2 version or install APAR IR49046.
