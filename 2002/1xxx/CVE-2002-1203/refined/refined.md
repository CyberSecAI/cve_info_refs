Based on the provided content, here's an analysis regarding CVE-2002-1203:

**Verification:** The provided content describes a vulnerability in IBM SecureWay Firewall where a flood of malformed TCP packets with zeroed flags leads to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition. This aligns with the typical characteristics of a vulnerability that might be assigned a CVE, although without the official description, it is not possible to definitively state the given content relates to CVE-2002-1203.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a stack problem when handling malformed TCP packets with all flags set to zero. The firewall spends excessive resources processing these invalid packets before recognizing them as invalid.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of malformed TCP packets.
- Lack of efficient early detection/rejection of invalid TCP packets.
- Susceptibility to resource exhaustion due to excessive processing of invalid packets.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS) against the IBM SecureWay Firewall.
- Firewall becomes unresponsive and unable to perform its intended function.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending a flood of malformed TCP packets with all flags zeroed to the firewall.
- Requires a high bandwidth connection to achieve the DoS condition (over 2.8 Mbps).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to generate and send a high volume of crafted TCP packets.
- Network access to the IBM SecureWay Firewall.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue affects SecureWay 4.2.x on AIX.
- A standard AIX fix does not address the vulnerability on SecureWay servers.
- IBM was contacted and released a fix.
- The vulnerability is more susceptible to a DDoS attack due to bandwidth requirements.
