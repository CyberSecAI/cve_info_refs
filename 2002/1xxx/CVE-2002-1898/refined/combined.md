    It is done via the Software Update application. This app checks in certain intervals (default weekly) if new updates are available and lets the user choose the updates to install. Most updates are also available for download from Apple's website. Apple provides a security mailing list which will alert you to security updates. Since summer, all updates are signed and the signature is being checked by Software Update before installing.

  I found this bug 2002/09/20, and start to make report for Apple.

  In fortunate thing, Apple fixed this bug and begin to distribute updater.

  Since Apple fixed this serious bug, I decided to open to the public.

  This is very serious security bug.

  **All Jaguar user should update immediately.**

  I prepared the test easy here.

  If link below is clicked, a Terminal will start and "ls -la" command will be executed by your authority.

  telnet://|ls -la [ls-la]

  Your use of updater vanishes this brittleness.

    Actually, I just clicked the link on multiple unpatched machines running OS X 10.2.1. The machine tried telneting to ls -la, to no effect. However, after giving it a good look, this is only because your link does not include the pipe. This is a pretty dangerous exploit, and could easily be changed to rm -rf \* rather than a simple ls.

    It's a damned good thing that Apple is so quick on the draw with security fixes...

  This update replaces the entire Terminal.app.

  It is now 528kb in size, as opposed to the previous 439kb.

  I've also noticed that it launches noticably faster after the update. Perhaps Apple added some tweaks in addition to the security changes.

  (no, it isn't the updated prebindings. I just did that myself this morning).

          This sounds reasonable. The launch speeds I see may have just been one of those things 10.2 improved that I hadn't noticed yet. Nice to have instant terminals, though.

          Since Jaguar, I've done nothing but shamelessly gloat about how cool OS X is.

    Simple solution.

    Use the Mac like it's supposed to be used, not like a damned windows box.

    When you close a terminal window, use Apple+W, NOT Apple+Q. Mac's are document-based, not application-based. Close the window, not the terminal app.

    Now, when you click on the terminal again it will open up a new window in a fraction of the time.

      That's fine if you're the only person who uses the machine. But when you share with someone else (my wife in my case), you find yourself logging in and out at least once a day, if not more. Waiting for everything to start up again each time can be a real drag if it takes more than a second or two per app. Especially when it's something as simple as Terminal, which by all accounts *should* open more or less instantaneously.

      But then again, an iBook with Airport is high on our Christmas wishlist, so perhaps this won't be a problem in the future. Instead of fighting over who gets to use the PowerMac, we'll fight over who gets to roam around the house instead of being chained to the desk. ;-)

      what do you mean? Linux developers have came up with alot of cool stuff. Like highlighting the text to copy then just middle clicking to paste. Of course you can do this on bsd or anything that runs X but its still cool. And we have based the desktops around it. No more need to right click to bring up a menu to copy/paste. also in X you can have a active window behind another window. this comes in handy when you are trying to look at both windows at the same time and so one doesnt cover the other. (you do this by right clicking on the window behind the main window to focus on it).

      As for the way the desktop looks, thats a personal preference. Do you really think kde/gnome and linux distros really ship with aqua themes?

      I like the macosx look and If I can have that look emulated on my free linux box, then thats a bonus.

      Linux is completely customizable, you can change everything about the desktop, kde and gnome are very flexable. If you dont like something you can pull the src apart and change it. (I wrote a couple patches my self because I like to use the mouse scroll to shade and unshade windows on the top bar)

      We have also made our own freetype fonts. So we dont have to steal them from microsoft. But we can also install the microsoft fonts if we want our desktop to look like a windows box.

      Linux developers are very innovative we have more updates and enhancements than macosx and windows put together.

      Yes somethings need improvement, but thats what you get when the developers are not being paid.

      I would like to see more fluid movement when moving windows across the desktop. Gnome 2.0.2 has really improved it, but its still nowhere as smooth as macosx.

      (this probably has something to do with Xfree86)

      Linux does have apps like itunes and dreamweaver and even microsoft word. One stop at freshmeat and you will find everything you need.

      A good Itunes replacement would be xmms, yes its a clone of winamp, but there is nothing wrong with that, FREE THEMES!

      A good replacemnt for dreamweaver would be hotdog, yes the name sounds kinda crude but its very useable and very fast. Reminds me alot of dreamweaver.

      And a good replacement for MSword is Abiword or kword, or openoffice. Any One of these will fill your needs. Abiword can read new and old docs perfectly.

      Sorry to go on forever but I dont like when people say that linux developers are not innovative.

        And how many of those updates were because they were nessesary to get a feature that has been availible in other OSes for a long time? Seriously, most of linux updates have just brought it closer to being comparable with the modern OSes, not major improvements.

        Themes don't replace functionality. You have no idea how useful something like a live search feature is untill you've become used to it iTunes is far superior to WinAMP

        I will grant that linux developers are innovative and that Linux is a fun system to toy arround with, but they are no more innovative than paid programmers and sadly do make most of their software from other peoples ideas (because otherwise no one would use Linux because people are too fricken dumb to learn a new OS, but that's an entirely differnt rant)

          Apple got rid of shading the window in macosx but you can get a plugin that will allow you to get the feature back. But the plugin still wont allow you to shade and unshade using the mouse wheel.

          So you can see that macosx cant be customized the same way linux can. If you dont like those above options in linux you can always turn them off.

          As for itunes/xmms I really dont care, I just like being able ot play music. I do have one thing to say about itunes, its confusing to some people. My dad got his first computer last month, he got the new imac with the 15" lcd. He is 78 years old. He asked me if I the computer was able to play the music cds that he had (he has a couple of cds that my sister made him) I told him I can copy the cd to the harddrive so he doesnt have to put the cd in everytime (I didnt expect him to do it him self) so Once I had the music converted to mp3 I made him a play list in itunes and i showed him how to use it. It was way to much for him, he kept hitting the wrong things and nothing is marked so he had a hard time finding the correct buttons. (he didnt understand if you hold the mouse over a button that it would show the name in a pop up) TO make a long story short, he had alot of problems with itunes, it took him a while to learn, while programs like xmms are a no brainer. I really wish there was a program like winamp for macosx.

          Sorry about grammar and spelling, I normally dont spell check or care about things I post on slashdot.....sorry if it bugs you.

One of the big problems with Linux is the myriad of options. Sometimes you never know what to do. Linux should really have a simple GUI option, sort of like the mac OS Simple Finder option. That could potentialy bring more desktop users to the OS.

            As for your father, I'm not going to assume anything before I know the exact problem because that would be rude. But from what you described, all he would need to know how to do is to start the program, press play stop and skip and quit. Is there somethign else he needed because I know all of those are clearly marked buttons.

              By default gnome/kde/windowmaker/fluxbox or whatever are very useable and have minor gui changes in their config menus which make it easier for the User.

              As for my father, he would click on the wrong button by mistake, like when he wanted to double click on a song he would end up dragging it by mistake or something silly like that. Bad thing is I cant see him doing this because he always does it when I am not around.

            So double clicking a window's title bar is too hard? I use WindowshadeX, I have it set so a double click shades the window, just as in OS 9, and the minimize button still minimizes. Are you using the mouse wheel as a button? You can do this with the software that came with the mouse. I have an MS Itellimouse Optical, and use USB Overdrive. If I wanted to I could program the wheel to do this. I have it set so when I click on the mouse wheel it opens a link in a new tab in Mozilla.

            Once again, that's easier than dragging the window by the title bar? I can move and resize a window with one hand.

            You can do a lot of customizing in OS X, you just don't seem familiar with what's available.

        I think you mean "XFree86 Developers" and not Linux developers. XFree86 runs on many kernels, not just Linux. The functionality they developed was not specific to Linux, it was specific to XFree86.

        > Linux is completely customizable, you can change everything about the desktop, kde and gnome are very flexable.

        I don't mean to nitpick, but once again, you're mixing the names up. The desktop customizability is a function of XFree86 and whatever desktop manager you use, not Linux (which I'll reiterate, is a kernel).

It would certainly be possible to implement similar functionality on other systems, but it wouldn't be nearly so straightforward as on PCs. Linux, in fact, has already done this - the fbcon text consoles do provide exactly this functionality using a frame buffer, so it works on sparc, ppc, etc. Sadly, OS X doesn't.
