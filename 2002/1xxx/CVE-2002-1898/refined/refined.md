Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from how `Terminal.app` in Mac OS X 10.2 and above handles specially crafted `telnet://` URLs. Specifically, it does not properly sanitize the input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Improper Input Sanitization:** The `Terminal.app` was susceptible to command injection through the `telnet://` URI scheme. The application was not properly sanitizing input, specifically the pipe character (|) within the URL, allowing it to be interpreted as a command separator.
- **Command Injection:** The application would execute the provided command in the URL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the user's system with the privileges of the user running `Terminal.app`. This could lead to a wide range of malicious activities, including data theft, system modification, or installation of malware.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Link:** An attacker could craft a malicious `telnet://` URL and entice the user to click it. This could be done via a website, email, or any medium that allows the user to click a link.
- **Browser Interaction:** The vulnerability is triggered by the browser (e.g., Internet Explorer, and likely others) when it attempts to handle a `telnet://` URL. This involves the browser launching the `Terminal.app`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious link to the victim.
- The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the victim, as the attack vector is through the browser and a crafted URL.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Taiyo FUJII, who reported it to Apple.
- The provided example URL `telnet://|ls -la [ls-la]` demonstrated how the `ls -la` command could be executed. The pipe character (`|`) is crucial for exploitation.
- The patch released by Apple fixes the vulnerability by encoding the `|` character as `%7C`, which is then not interpreted as a command separator in the `Terminal.app`.
- Some users reported that, after applying the patch, the `Terminal.app` launched faster, though it seems this was not directly related to the security fix itself.
