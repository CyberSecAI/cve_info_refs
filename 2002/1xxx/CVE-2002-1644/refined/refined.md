The provided content relates to CVE-2002-1644.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper removal of child processes from the master process group after non-interactive command execution in SSH Secure Shell for Servers.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Failure to remove child process from the master process group.
- The vulnerability occurs when executing commands without a pty.
- Affected platforms rely on `getlogin()` (mainly BSD variants).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Local attackers can potentially escalate privileges.
- Malicious users can send misleading messages to syslog and other applications because `getlogin()` will return "root".

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access is required to exploit this vulnerability.
- Non-interactive connections are the attack vector.
- Executing a command without a pty.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Local user access is required.
- Ability to execute commands through SSH without a pty is necessary for exploitation.
