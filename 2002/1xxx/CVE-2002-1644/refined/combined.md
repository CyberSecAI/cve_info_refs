## SSH Secure Shell for Servers fails to remove child process from master process group

#### Vulnerability Note VU#740619

Original Release Date: 2002-11-25 | Last Revised: 2008-05-29

---

### Overview

A locally exploitable privilege escalation vulnerability exists in SSH Secure Shell versions 2.0.13 - 3.2.1.

### Description

| [Secure Shell for Servers](http://www.ssh.com/products/security/secureshellserver/), developed by [SSH Communications Security](http://www.ssh.com/), does not properly remove the child process from the master process group after non-interactive command execution. Quoting from the [SSH Communications Security Advisory](http://www.ssh.com/company/newsroom/article/286/):  When used in non-interactive connections, a defect in process groupingof SSH Secure Shell processes may allow malicious activity. Ifexecuting a command without a pty (including running commands andsubsystems) the child process remains in the process group of themaster process.On platforms relying on getlogin() (mainly the different BSD variants)malicious users can at least send misleading messages to syslog andothers applications (getlogin() call will return "root").For more details, please see the [SSH Communications Security Advisory](http://www.ssh.com/company/newsroom/article/286/). |
| --- |

### Impact

| A local attacker may be able to gain elevated privileges. |
| --- |

### Solution

| [Upgrade](http://www.ssh.com/company/newsroom/article/286/) your software. Note that both Secure Shell for Servers **and** Secure Shell for Workstations need to be updated to eliminate this vulnerability. |
