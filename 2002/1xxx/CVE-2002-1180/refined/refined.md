This document provides details for multiple vulnerabilities patched in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS02-062. The specific vulnerability related to CVE-2002-1180 is the "Script Source Access Vulnerability".

**Root Cause:**
- A typographical error in the list of file types that are subject to the script source access permission in IIS 5.0. The entry for .COM files was misspelled, excluding them from the restrictions normally associated with executable files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Incorrect implementation of script source access control in IIS 5.0, where .COM files are not subject to the same restrictions as other executable files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker with write access to a virtual directory could upload .COM files to the server, potentially leading to the execution of malicious code.
- If the attacker also has execute permissions on the virtual directory, they could directly run the uploaded .COM file.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker needs write access to at least one virtual directory on the server.
- The attacker must upload a malicious .COM file to this directory.
- If execute permissions are also granted on the virtual directory, the attacker could directly execute the uploaded .COM file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have been granted write permissions to a virtual directory, which is not granted by default.
- If the attacker wants to directly run the malicious .COM file, they also need execute permissions on that virtual directory, which is also not granted by default.
- The vulnerability is only present in IIS 5.0.
