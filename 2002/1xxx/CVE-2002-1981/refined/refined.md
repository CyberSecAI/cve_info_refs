Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause lies in the default permissions assigned to the `public` role in Microsoft SQL Server 2000, allowing it to execute internal stored procedures `sp_MSSetServerProperties` and `sp_MSsetalertinfo`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Insecure Default Permissions:** The `public` role, which is accessible to all database users, has execute permissions on `sp_MSSetServerProperties` and `sp_MSsetalertinfo`.
*   **`sp_MSSetServerProperties` Vulnerability:** This stored procedure internally calls `xp_instance_regwrite` which is used to modify SQL Server startup settings (automatic or manual).
*   **`sp_MSsetalertinfo` Vulnerability:** This stored procedure allows modification of alert settings, including the email address for sending alerts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **`sp_MSSetServerProperties`:** A low-privileged user could modify the SQL Server startup setting. This could be used to prevent the server from automatically restarting after a reboot, potentially keeping a malicious shell active or delaying normal operations.
*   **`sp_MSsetalertinfo`:** A low-privileged user could modify alert email settings. This could be used to intercept alerts or prevent them from being sent to the correct administrator.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is exploited through the execution of the vulnerable stored procedures `sp_MSSetServerProperties` and `sp_MSsetalertinfo`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be a low-privileged user with access to the SQL Server database. This means they must be able to authenticate to the SQL Server instance.
*   No specific network position is mentioned other than requiring a user with an active login.

**Additional Details:**
*   The advisory states that the vulnerability is low risk on its own, but can be used in conjunction with other attacks to be more impactful (like keeping a shell listening on the default port 1433).
*   The advisory provides a fix by dropping the execute permissions from the `public` role for both vulnerable stored procedures.
