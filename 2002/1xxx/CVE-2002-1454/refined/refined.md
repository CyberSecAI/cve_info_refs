Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities in MyWebServer v1.0.2:

**1. Buffer Overflow in MWS Search Engine:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper bounds checking when handling the `searchTarget` parameter in the `HandleSearch.html` page.
*   **Weakness:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the search engine functionality.
*   **Impact:** A remote attacker can crash the web server or potentially execute arbitrary shellcode.
*   **Attack Vector:** By sending a GET request to `HandleSearch.html` with an overly large value for the `searchTarget` parameter (e.g., `searchTarget=990b_of_any_data`).
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker can be remote and needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.

**2. Remote JS/VB/HTML code execution**

*   **Root Cause:** The web server does not properly sanitize user-supplied data, allowing the injection of malicious code into the HTML output.
*   **Weakness:** The server is vulnerable to code injection.
*  **Impact:** Remote attacker can execute arbitrary Javascript/VBScript/HTML on client side.
*   **Attack Vector:** By injecting malicious code within the URL.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker can be remote and needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.

**3. Real Patch Attack**

*   **Root Cause:**  The web server reveals the real path of the webroot.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of path obfuscation.
*  **Impact:** A remote attacker can find the server's root path.
*   **Attack Vector:** By requesting a non-existent directory. The server then exposes its full path.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker can be remote and needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.

**Additional Details from the Exploit Script:**

*   The provided Perl script (`MWS_exp.pl`) exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability in the handling of GET requests.
*   It offers two options: a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack that crashes the server and a root exploit attempt that aims to execute shellcode and open a command prompt on port 7788.
*   The exploit uses a buffer size of 989 bytes.
*   The shellcode is designed for Windows ME/XP systems.
