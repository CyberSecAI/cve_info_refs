Yes, according to the documentation you are correct.  strip_tags only
returns the stripped string; it does not modify its argument.  1.2.8-1
contains the broken invocation:

/* strip any tags added to the url from PHP_SELF.
   This fixes hand crafted url XXS expoits for any
   page that uses PHP_SELF as the FORM action */

strip_tags($_SERVER['PHP_SELF']);

Hi,

in order to provide our users with a useful update for unstable as well and
since this bug is known to the maintainer for a week at least, I've decided
to NMU the package for unstable to fix the XSS bug finally.

Here's the patch I've used.  Please apply it to the next maintainer
upload.  Upstream was informed at the same time as the maintainer
was, so should be aware of it as well.

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.
