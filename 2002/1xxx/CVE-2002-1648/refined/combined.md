## SquirrelMail compose.php script does not adequately validate input thereby allowing arbitrary user to send messages

#### Vulnerability Note VU#153043

Original Release Date: 2002-05-30 | Last Revised: 2007-05-10

---

### Overview

Some versions of SquirrelMail do not properly validate input. Attackers can spoof email addresses through this vulnerability.

### Description

| SquirrelMail is a collection of PHP4 scripts that provides webmail services. Prior to version 1.24, SquirrelMail does not properly validate Universal Resource Identifiers (URI's) and JavaScript code embedded in HTML tags within an email message. These tags are sent by SquirrelMail to the user's web browser, which could make the browser request the embedded URI's or execute the JavaScript code. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker could craft an email message to a SquirrelMail user which, when read by the user, could automatically send email from the user's account to any address of the attacker's choice. This vulnerability could also be used in a cross-site scripting attack to hijack an authenticated user's session. |

### Solution

| Upgrade SquirrelMail to version 1.2.4 or later, available from:  <http://www.squirrelmail.org/download.php> |
