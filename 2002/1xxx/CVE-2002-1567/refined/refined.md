  "vulnerability_details": {
    "CVE-2002-1567": {
      "root_cause": "The unmodified requested URL is included in the 404 response header. New lines in this URL appear to the client to be the end of the header section.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The vulnerability is caused by improper handling of new line characters in the response header when generating a 404 error.",
        "Including unmodified user input (the URL) in HTTP headers"
      ],
      "impact": "Cross-site scripting (XSS). The remaining part of the URL, including script elements, is treated as part of the response body and the client executes the script.",
      "attack_vectors": "By crafting a URL with new line characters and malicious script code, an attacker can trigger a 404 response that will execute the script on the client's browser.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the server. No prior authentication is required."
