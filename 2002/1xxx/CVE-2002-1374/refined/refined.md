  - Root cause of vulnerability: Several vulnerabilities were discovered in the MySQL client and server.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
    - SERVER:
      - COM_TABLE_DUMP: Signed integer vulnerability where negative values turn into large unsigned numbers causing heap to heap copy operations to crash the server.
      - COM_CHANGE_USER: The password length check was not implemented for the COM_CHANGE_USER command, allowing an attacker to bypass the password check. Sending a response longer than 16 chars causes a stack buffer overflow that could overwrite the saved instruction pointer.
    - CLIENT:
      - libmysqlclient read_rows Overflow: The client library copies the returned fields to another buffer without checking if the field sizes are within the destination buffer boundaries, causing a heap overflow.
      - libmysqlclient read_one_row Byte Overwrites: The client library loops through the fields to remember pointers to the field values, trusting the field sizes, and writes a null byte to the previous field, which can lead to overwriting arbitrary memory address with a '\0'.
  - Impact of exploitation:
    - Server crashes (DoS).
    - Bypass of MySQL password check.
    - Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running mysqld.
    - Denial of service attacks against client applications.
    - Arbitrary code execution within anything linked against libmysqlclient.
  - Attack vectors:
    - Sending crafted COM_TABLE_DUMP packets to the server.
    - Sending crafted COM_CHANGE_USER packets to the server.
    - Sending a malformed answer row from server to client library triggering the `read_rows` overflow.
    - Sending a malformed packet from server to client library triggering the `read_one_row` overwrite.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position:
    - A valid mysql-account or a local user can exploit vulnerabilities in server.
    - Attacker can be remote or local.
    - Any user interacting with a vulnerable client library is at risk.

marc.info_50a9d1c9_20250125_191112.html:
  - Root cause of vulnerability: Multiple flaws within the MySQL server and client library.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
    - Two flaws in the MySQL server can be used to crash the server.
    - One flaw can be used to bypass the password check or to execute arbitrary code.
    - Heap overflow in the client library.
    - Vulnerability that allows writing a '\0' to any memory address.
  - Impact of exploitation:
    - Remote DOS and arbitrary code execution.
    - DoS attacks against or arbitrary code execution within anything linked against libmysqlclient.
  - Attack vectors: Remote
  - Required attacker capabilities/position:  Remote
