```
{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The SSH Secure Shell server versions 3.0.0 to 3.1.1 do not properly enforce client authentication. The AllowedAuthentications configuration keyword allows clients to override the server's authentication policy.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper enforcement of authentication configuration",
      "Use of AllowedAuthentications keyword instead of RequiredAuthentications"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can bypass the server's authentication policy and attempt to authenticate using password authentication even when public key authentication is configured.",
    "attack_vectors": "Remote network access to the SSH server.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable SSH server and valid username.",
      "additional_details": "The vulnerability lies in the interpretation of the `AllowedAuthentications` configuration keyword, which can be bypassed, while `RequiredAuthentications` will properly enforce the authentication methods specified. The vulnerability is specific to SSH Communications Security's SSH Secure Shell server and does not affect OpenSSH or other implementations."
