# What is SSH Public Key Authentication?

The [SSH protocol](/ssh/protocol/) supports many authentication methods. Arguably one the most important of these is Public Key authentication for interactive and automated connections.

### Contents

[Public Key authentication - what and why?](#public-key-authentication---what-and-why?) [Asymmetric Cryptography - Algorithms](#asymmetric-cryptography---algorithms) [Key Pair - Public and Private](#key-pair---public-and-private) [Setting Up Public Key Authentication for SSH](#setting-up-public-key-authentication-for-ssh) [Handling of the Private Key](#handling-of-the-private-key) [From Chaos to Order - SSH Key Management](#from-chaos-to-order---ssh-key-management)
## Public Key authentication - what and why?

The motivation for using public key authentication over simple passwords is security. Public key authentication provides cryptographic strength that even extremely long passwords can not offer. With [SSH](/ssh/), public key authentication improves security considerably as it frees the users from remembering complicated passwords (or worse yet, writing them down).

In addition to security public key authentication also offers usability benefits - it allows users to implement single sign-on across the [SSH servers](/ssh/server) they connect to. Public key authentication also allows automated, passwordless login that is a key enabler for the countless secure automation processes that execute within enterprise networks globally.

Public key [cryptography](/cryptography/) revolves around a couple of key concepts. The sections below explain these briefly.

### Asymmetric Cryptography - Algorithms

As with any encryption scheme, public key authentication is based on an algorithm. There are several well-researched, secure, and trustworthy algorithms out there - the most common being the likes of RSA and DSA. Unlike the commonly known (symmetric or secret-key) encryption algorithms the public key encryption algorithms work with *two separate keys*. These two keys form a pair that is specific to each user.

### Key Pair - Public and Private

In the SSH public key authentication use case, it is rather typical that the users create (i.e. provision) the key pair for themselves. SSH implementations include easily usable utilities for this (for more information see [ssh-keygen](/ssh/keygen/) and [ssh-copy-id](/ssh/copy-id)).

Each [SSH key](/ssh/key) pair includes two keys:

* A [public key](/academy/cryptography/private-and-public-keys) that is copied to the SSH server(s). Anyone with a copy of the public key can encrypt data which can then only be read by the person who holds the corresponding private key. Once an SSH server receives a public key from a user and considers the key trustworthy, the server marks the key as authorized in its [authorized\_keys file](/ssh/authorized_keys/). Such keys are called [authorized keys](/academy/ssh/authorized-key).
* A [private key](/academy/cryptography/private-and-public-keys) that remains (only) with the user. The possession of this key is proof of the user's identity. Only a user in possession of a private key that corresponds to the public key at the server will be able to authenticate successfully. The private keys need to be stored and handled carefully, and no copies of the private key should be distributed. The private keys used for user authentication are called [identity keys](/ssh/identity-key).

## Setting Up Public Key Authentication for SSH

The following simple steps are required to set up public key authentication (for SSH):

1. Key pair is created (typically by the user). This is typically done with [ssh-keygen](/ssh/keygen/).
2. Private key stays with the user (and only there), while the public key is sent to the server. Typically with the [ssh-copy-id](/ssh/copy-id) utility.
3. Server stores the public key (and "marks" it as [authorized](/ssh/authorized_keys/)).
4. Server will now allow access to anyone who can prove they have the corresponding private key.

## Handling of the Private Key

It is extremely important that the privacy of the private key is guarded carefully. For most user-driven use cases this is accomplished by encrypting the private key with a [passphrase](/ssh/passphrase).

When a private key is needed the user is asked to supply the passphrase so that the private key can be decrypted. The handling of passphrases can be automated with an [SSH agent](/ssh/agent).

In most [automated](/ssh/automated) use cases (scripts, applications, etc) the private keys are not protected and careful planning and key management practises need to be excercised to remain secure and compliant with regulatory mandates.

## From Chaos to Order - SSH Key Management

In environments where users are free to self-provision authentication keys it is common that over the years the numbers of provisioned and deployed keys grow very large. Since there is no way to find out who owns or has originally provisioned a given public key found on a server, and since these keys never expire, the true state of access control in large unmanaged environments can be very unclear or outright chaotic.

Managing and controlling access to servers and other IT infrastructure is a legal requirement for any enterprise that operates on regulated markets such as finance, energy, healthcare, or commerce. These enterprises need to employ solutions for [SSH key management](/iam/ssh-key-management/) to control the access granted by [SSH keys](/ssh/key).

We at SSH secure communications between systems, automated applications, and people. We strive to build future-proof and safe communications for businesses and organizations to grow safely in the digital world.

## SSHD allows users to override "AllowedAuthentications" configuration thereby permitting users to provide any type of authentication

#### Vulnerability Note VU#341187

Original Release Date: 2002-05-21 | Last Revised: 2002-10-30

---

### Overview

A remotely exploitable authentication vulnerability exists in the SSH Communications Security [SSH Secure Shell server](http://www.ssh.com/products/ssh/for_servers/), and possibly other SSH servers.

### Description

| SSH is a program used to provide secure communications between hosts. Versions 3.0.0 - 3.1.1 of SSH Secure Shell for Servers does not properly enforce client authentication. As a result, an attacker can attempt to authenticate to an SSH server using password authentication.  There are two methods a client can use to authenticate to an SSH server. The first method is password authentication. This method is generally the easiest to set up, but the least secure. As long as the client has a valid username and password, they can gain access to the system running the SSH server. The second method is public key authentication. Public key authentication is one of the most secure methods to authenticate a user. For a client to gain access to a system using public key authentication, a copy of the client's public key must exist on the SSH server. The client must also have the private key in possession as well as the passphrase associated with the private key. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker can attempt to authenticate to the vulnerable SSH server using password authentication, even if the server is configured to only allow public key authentication. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Apply a patch from your vendor or upgrade your software. |
| --- |

| Use "RequiredAuthentications" keyword instead of "AllowedAuthentications" in sshd2\_config:RequiredAuthentications\thostbased, publickey |

### [Nortel Networks](#IAFY-5A5P9H) Not Affected

Notified:  May 10, 2002  Updated: May 14, 2002

### Status

Not Affected

### Vendor Statement

Initial verification on a Solaris 8 server with OpenSSH 31p1
indicates that the "AllowedAuthentications" keyword is not used in
the OpenSSH server configuration. However, OpenSSH uses the following
two keywords for authentication configuration:

"PubkeyAuthentication"
"PasswordAuthentication"

The default value for both keywords is yes, which means the server
will allow both password and public key authentication. This is not
a vulnerability. But since all keywords including
"PasswordAuthentication" in the default OpenSSH sshd\_config file are
commented out, users who want public key authentication method only
may mistakenly just uncomment "PubkeyAuthentication" keyword and
assign a yes value to it, not knowing that password authentication is
on by default even though that keyword is commented out in the
configuration file.

Workaround fix: For OpenSSH, if public key authentication is the only
method allowed, change the default value from "yes" to "no" for the
"PasswordAuthentication" keyword in sshd\_config file.
