Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2002-1015:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from how RealJukebox and RealONE Gold players handle *skin* files. During the processing of a skin file, the applications store files in a predictable temporary file path location.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Predictable Temporary File Path:** The applications create temporary files in a known location.
- **Unsanitized Skin File Processing:** The application does not properly sanitize or validate the content of skin files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary script on the system within the "My Computer" security zone of Internet Explorer. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary commands with the privileges of the current user.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Skin Files:** The vulnerability is triggered by opening a skin file or any document embedding a skin file.
- **Embedded Skin Files:**  Attackers can embed malicious skin files in HTML formatted web pages, email messages, or other document types.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote Attacker:**  The attacker can be remote from the victim.
- **Malicious Skin File Creation:** The attacker needs to create a malicious skin file containing the commands to be executed.
- **Delivery of Malicious Content:** The attacker needs to deliver the malicious skin file or a document embedding it to the victim. This could be done via email, a website, etc.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability affects RealOne Player Gold US for Windows, RealJukebox2 version 379 Japanese and version 340 US for Microsoft Windows, and RealJukebox 2 Plus version 379 Japanese and version 340 US for Microsoft Windows.
- RealNetworks released a security advisory and patches to address the issue.
