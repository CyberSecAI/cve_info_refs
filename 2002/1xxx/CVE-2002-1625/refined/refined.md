- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Macromedia Flash Player 6 does not terminate connections initiated by `loadMovie` and `loadSound` commands when a user navigates away from a webpage. These connections persist, continuing to download media files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The Flash Player fails to terminate media download connections when the user leaves the page, leading to a resource leak. Specifically, the ActiveX version of the Flash Player for Microsoft Internet Explorer on Windows platforms is affected.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - An attacker can create a malicious Flash animation that, upon playback, triggers multiple media download connections.
    - These connections consume excessive bandwidth, potentially rendering the user's internet connection unusable.
    - The issue persists until the user closes the web browser, effectively acting as a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can host a webpage containing a malicious Flash animation. When a user visits this page, the animation starts downloading media files, consuming the user's bandwidth even after they have navigated away from the page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to host a webpage with a malicious flash file. No special capabilities other than this is required.
