Original Release Date: 2002-02-27 | Last Revised: 2002-03-12

---

### Overview

Oracle Application Server version 9iAS installs with sample pages that demonstrate various functions of the software. Many of these pages can be used by attackers to breach the security of the system.

### Description

| A fresh installation of Oracle Application Server version 9iAS (and possibly other versions) includes sample JSP scripts and other files that may be abused by an attacker. Vulnerable scripts include:  <http://servername/demo/email/sendmail.jsp><http://servername/demo/info/info.jsp><http://servername/cgi-bin/printenv><http://servername/fcgi-bin/echo><http://servername/fcgi-bin/echo2><http://servername/xsql/java/xsql/demo/adhocsql/query.xsql> |
| --- |

### Impact

| Attackers can send arbitrary emails as from the Oracle server or uncover server environment variables and other data. |
| --- |

### Solution

| The CERT/CC is currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem. |
| --- |

| Delete all sample pages and scripts before deploying an Oracle server in a production environment. |
