Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2002-1187:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from incomplete security checks within Internet Explorer when handling frame elements (`<frame>` and `<iframe>`). Specifically, it's possible to bypass the browser's cross-domain security model. The vulnerability is caused by the ability to set a frame's URL to a javascript: URL that executes code in the context of the parent document. Additionally, the attacker can change a frame's URL to match its parent and then re-assign the `javascript:[code]` URL, allowing for cross-domain scripting.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-frame scripting:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to execute scripts in the context of a different domain by manipulating frame URLs.
*   **Bypassing domain restrictions:** Internet Explorer's security measures that prevent scripts in one domain from accessing information in another are circumvented by exploiting the frame URL manipulation.
*   **Lack of proper security checks:** Internet Explorer doesn't correctly validate the frame's URL changes, allowing for the execution of arbitrary javascript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cookie Theft:** An attacker can steal cookies from websites the user has visited.
*   **Content Manipulation:** Attackers can access and modify content on other websites loaded in frames.
*   **Local File Access (Potentially):** By leveraging local HTML files containing frames (such as "PrivacyPolicy.dlg" in IE6), attackers can access and read local files.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution (Potentially):** In the most severe case, attackers can execute arbitrary code on the user's machine by combining local file access with script execution within the "My Computer" zone.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Website:** An attacker hosts a website containing malicious script that exploits the frame manipulation vulnerability.
*   **Local HTML File Exploitation:** The attacker can use a local HTML file (containing frames) on the user's machine, to act as a stepping stone to execute code within a different security context.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Web Hosting:** The attacker needs to be able to host a web page or have the user open a local file with malicious code.
*   **User Interaction:** The user must visit the attacker's website (or open the attacker controlled local file).
*   **Knowledge of Frame Structure:** The attacker needs to be aware of the frame structure of target pages.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Internet Explorer 5.5 and above.
- Other applications that use Internet Explorer's engine, such as Outlook and MSN Explorer are also affected.
- The advisory provides a proof-of-concept exploit that steals cookies from google.com.
- The advisory also describes how to read local files and execute programs, leveraging the `PrivacyPolicy.dlg` file in IE6.
