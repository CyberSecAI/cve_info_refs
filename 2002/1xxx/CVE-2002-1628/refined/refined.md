- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Mike Spice's Vote CGI script does not adequately validate user input, specifically the `type` variable, before passing it to Perl's `open()` function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Directory traversal vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization.
    - Unfiltered `../` sequences and null bytes are passed to the `open()` function.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Attackers can overwrite arbitrary files on the server to which the web server process has write privileges.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - By manipulating the `type` CGI variable, attackers can include directory traversal sequences.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable CGI script.
    - The attacker needs to be aware of the script's vulnerability.
    - The attacker does not need prior authentication.
    - The web server process must have write privileges to the target file.
