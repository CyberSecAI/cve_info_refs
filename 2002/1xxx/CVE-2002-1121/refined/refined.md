Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the way some email content filters and anti-virus scanners handle email messages that use the "message/partial" MIME type as defined in RFC 2046. This MIME type allows large messages to be fragmented into smaller parts and reassembled by the receiving mail client. The issue is that some security products only scan individual message parts and not the reassembled message, thus allowing malicious content to bypass filters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Incomplete Message Scanning:** Vulnerable systems do not reassemble fragmented email messages before scanning them. They only analyze individual "message/partial" parts, which might not contain complete malicious patterns or signatures.
*   **Lack of "message/partial" Parsing:** Some email security products or libraries, such as MIME::tools, do not properly parse or descend into "message/partial" MIME entities, causing them to be skipped during the scanning process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Bypassing Security Measures:** Attackers can bypass email filtering, virus scanning, and content checking mechanisms by sending malicious content within fragmented "message/partial" emails.
*   **Delivery of Malicious Payloads:** This allows the delivery of viruses, trojans, and other malicious code to end-user systems without detection by email security systems.
*   **Circumventing Corporate Policies:** Attackers can deliver file types or content that are normally blocked by corporate email policies.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Email Fragmentation:** The attacker crafts a malicious payload and splits it into multiple email messages using the "message/partial" MIME type.
*   **Outlook Express:** The content mentions that Microsoft's Outlook Express can easily fragment messages.
*   **SMTP:** The attack utilizes SMTP to deliver fragmented email messages to vulnerable systems.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Basic Email Client:** The attacker needs an email client capable of fragmenting emails using the "message/partial" MIME type such as Outlook Express, and the ability to send emails.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Systems:** The attacker benefits from the knowledge of which systems use vulnerable email security products that do not properly reassemble fragmented messages.

**Additional Information:**

*   The content provides a detailed explanation of how message fragmentation works and how it can be exploited.
*   It also mentions that a workaround can be to add an email footer, which could break the reassembly.
*   Several vendors' responses are included, detailing if their products are affected, and what steps they are taking to remediate the vulnerability.
*   CERT has assigned VU#836088 to track the vulnerability.
*   The content provides a detailed explanation of the vulnerability.
*   Several vendors responded including: Check Point, GFI, Symantec, Trend Micro, and Roaring Penguin.
*   MIMEDefang was identified as being vulnerable by relying on the MIME::tools Perl parsing module.
