  Bypassing SMTP Content Protection with a Flick of a Button
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Article reference:
<http://www.securiteam.com/securitynews/5YP0A0K8CM.html>

SUMMARY

Forget underground hacking tools. How about using Outlook Express as
your attack platform?

Beyond Security's SecurITeam has discovered a new method of bypassing
many SMTP-based content filter engines.
This discovery is alarming since it requires from the attacker nothing
more than an Outlook Express client and employs a rarely-used feature
called 'message fragmentation and re-assembly' that is available in
Outlook Express. Using this feature, an attacker can send e-mails that
will bypass most SMTP filtering engines including gateway Virus
scanners, content filters, Firewalls that do SMTP checking, etc.

DETAILS

One of the least known features of Outlook Express allows Internet and
Intranet users to split up sent messages. This allows slow connecting
users to send smaller segments of a larger email in multiple emails,
whereas the receiving client will automatically join them into a single
message. This RFC documented feature called "Message Fragmentation and
Reassembly" (RFC2046, section 5.2.2.1) allows anyone to bypass most of
the security restrictions imposed on email messages, due to the fact
that messages are spliced into smaller segments that will not be
detected by virus scanners or other content testing mechanisms.

Possibly affected:
Any email filtering, virus checking, and content checking mechanism that
is unable to assemble a fragmented email to its complete form.

Technical details:
The main idea behind the RFC 2046 message fragmentation is to enable
users to send large files as several partial messages, while making it
transparent to the recipient, who will receive a single message rather
than multiple smaller files.

Fragmentation and Reassembly example:
If a binary attachment is broken into two pieces, the first piece might
look something like this:

     X-Weird-Header-1: Foo
     From: Bill@host.com
     To: joe@otherhost.com
     Date: Fri, 26 Mar 1993 12:59:38 -0500 (EST)
     Subject: First mail (part 1 of 2)
     Message-ID:
     MIME-Version: 1.0
     Content-type: message/partial; id="ABC@host.com";
                   number=1; total=2

     X-Weird-Header-1: Bar
     X-Weird-Header-2: Hello
     Message-ID:
     Subject: Audio mail
     MIME-Version: 1.0
     Content-type: application/binary
     Content-transfer-encoding: base64

       VIRUS

And the second half might look something like this:

     From: Bill@host.com
     To: joe@otherhost.com
     Date: Fri, 26 Mar 1993 12:59:38 -0500 (EST)
     Subject: Second mail (part 2 of 2)
     MIME-Version: 1.0
     Message-ID:
     Content-type: message/partial;
                   id="ABC@host.com"; number=2; total=2

       SIGNATURE

When the fragmented message is reassembled, the resulting message will
look something of the sorts of:

     X-Weird-Header-1: Foo
     From: Bill@host.com
     To: joe@otherhost.com
     Date: Fri, 26 Mar 1993 12:59:38 -0500 (EST)
     Subject: Mail
     Message-ID:
     MIME-Version: 1.0
     Content-type: application/binary
     Content-transfer-encoding: base64

       VIRUS
       SIGNATURE

Since the emails traversing though the product will be the first email
and the second email, and not the completed form, any product looking
for the phrase "VIRUS SIGNATURE" will fail to detect the Virus, and the
message will pass undetected. Similarly, if compressed files are
involved, a product will try to decompress them in order to look into
its content, but will be unable to do so since each email contains only
a fragment of the compressed file.

So far, the only client that we found to support this feature with a
"flick of a button" is Microsoft's Outlook Express. This mail client
supports an option that allows fully transparent fragmentation and
reassembly of messages. The reassembly feature is enabled by default,
while the fragmentation feature is not. Note though, that it can be
easily enabled by going to: Tools -> Accounts -> Choose your email
account -> Advanced -> Sending / Break apart messages larger than [...].
No other mail client we have checked supports this feature including
Microsoft Outlook. However, Outlook Express is widely used in both
Cooperate and Home environments making this issue a possible high-risk
situation.

Impact:
Anyone wishing to bypass SMTP filtering engines can utilize the
mentioned method to bypass most types of content checking, and deliver
its payload to the end-client without any trouble, whether it is a
Virus, Trojan or a file type that is not allowed by the corporate
policy.

Workaround:
It seems that by embedding email footer (company disclaimer, privacy
note, etc) to each outgoing email traversing though the content filter
it is possible to completely hamper the effective usage of this attack.
However, since this is an RFC documented feature that may be used in
Outlook Express for legitimate purposes, this legitimate usage will be
hampered as well.

A vendor solution to this vulnerability would be to include a
reassembling agent at the server that will not allow any non-reassembled
message to traverse through it.

Vendor response - Check Point:
"Neither the latest 4.1 nor the latest NG versions of FW-1 are
vulnerable to this problem. A few details follow:

1. FW-1 does not directly analyze the body of attachments. In that
respect, the vulnerability is not applicable to FW-1.

2. FW-1 has the capability to easily filter these types of messages, by
specifying "message/partial" in the "Strip MIME of type:" section of the
resource definition.

3. FW-1 does serve as a platform for third party vendors to check
attachments for viruses via the "CVP" OPSEC mechanism. When defining a
CVP server, a message box is presented to the administrator (when
approving the resource) that says:

"When CVP server is used it is recommended to strip MIME of type
'message/partial'. Do you want to add 'message/partial'?"

Pressing "Yes" will automatically add 'message/partial' to the
appropriate place in the resource definition.

We therefore believe is safe to say that not only are we not vulnerable
to this problem ourselves, we also protect 3rd party opsec partners from
falling for this pitfall."

Vendor response - GFI:
GFI MailSecurity for Exchange/SMTP 7.2 has been updated to detect this
exploit as "fragmented message" through its email exploit detection
engine and quarantines it at server level.

GFI patch URL:
GFI's latest version of MailSecurity for Exchange is patched against
this problem. For more information, see:
<<http://www.gfi.com/mailsecurity/>> <http://www.gfi.com/mailsecurity/>

Vendor response - Symantec:
"Symantec has been aware for some time of the potential malicious use of
this email feature. As a result, all currently supported Symantec
gateway products, by default, block multi-part MIME messages at the
gateway. While this is a configurable feature of Symantec gateway
products and can be enabled if multi-part email is required, the
rejection of segmented messages should be a part of a company's
comprehensive security policy to restrict potentially harmful content
from the internal network.

Additionally, should known malicious code be delivered to a client
computer in this manner, the Symantec and Norton AntiVirus scanning
products will detect it when it is reassembled and downloaded to the
client computer and/or during attempted execution on the targeted
computer. As always, if previously unknown malicious code is being
distributed in this manner, Symantec Security Response will react and
send updated virus definitions via LiveUpdate to detect the new threat."

A full formal response from Symantec should be shortly available at:

MIMEDefang (<http://www.roaringpenguin.com/mimedefang/>) is an SMTP
filtering tool which in its default configuration is susceptible
to this attack.

MIMEDefang relies on the MIME::tools Perl parsing module.  This module
correctly descends into "message/rfc822" entities and parses parts
inside them, but it does not descend into "message/partial" entities.
Therefore, even the default filename checks will not work with
"message/partial" types.  I hope to have a patched version of MIME::tools
soon.

For the next MIMEDefang release, the default filter will be modified to drop
message/partial parts.  Current users of MIMEDefang should add the
following code to their filter and filter_multipart routines:

# Block message/partial parts
if (lc($type) eq "message/partial") {
    action_quarantine_entire_message();
    action_notify_administrator("Message quarantined because of message/partial type");
    return action_discard();
}

## **Vulnerability Management for a Variety of Industries**

Nearly every industry relies on applications and networks to conduct business, though some have more stringent security requirements than others. Organizations in the aviation, automotive, healthcare, and financial sectors have some of the strongest security regulations. Layers of security during software and application development as well as after product deployment are necessary to keep consumers safe and organizations compliant.

![airplane icon](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilitiesaviation.png)

### [Aviation](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guides/aviation-software-testing-guide)

Cybersecurity is crucial to the aviation industry. Travelers in the sky need to be protected from any attacks that can prevent airlines from operating normally. Those same customers need to have their payment and sensitive data protected when purchasing a ticket.

### [Automotive](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guide/how-fuzz-testing-helps-secure-automotive-industry)

Wireless connectivity is becoming commonplace inside of new vehicles. Automotive connectivity to WIFI and Bluetooth are making vehicles a bigger target for cybercriminals. One vulnerability can take down any vehicle with that technology. DAST, Black Box Fuzzing, and SAST during development are a solid foundation of security to prevent these attacks.

![](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-automative.png)

![heartbeat](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-healthcare.png)

### [Healthcare and Medical](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guides/security-testing-for-networked-medical-devices)

Wireless technology and application software are being used more in medical devices to automate and monitor individual healthcare needs. Device security is the utmost priority, preventing risks that can directly endanger lives. Application security is needed to prevent cyber attackers from tampering with devices and stealing private healthcare data. SAST and DAST during development can help find vulnerabilities that can compromise these devices.

### Critical Infrastructure and Industrial Facilities

Water, power, and gas are some prime targets for large scale attacks. The best way to keep cyberattackers from taking down an entire city’s water supply is to create a layered cybersecurity portfolio. From the start, vulnerabilities need to be identified, remediated, and constantly monitored to prevent a mass standstill of public utilities.

![lightning bolt icon](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-critical-industries.png)

![factory](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-manufactures.png)

### Discrete Manufacturers

Manufacturing industries keep building and assembling essential pieces for everyday life. Any attack on that automation would create a bottleneck in multiple industries that rely on these products. A disruption in manufacturing has been proven to drive up prices and create a negative workflow ripple worldwide. Using layered security solutions prior to deployment and scanning afterwards will help prevent any shutdown.

### Financial

Financial institutions are still top cyberattacker targets. Monetary apps for banks, credit unions, investment, and retirement firms need the highest cybersecurity measures. Security that prevents cyberattacks should be implemented during development and embedded directly into these applications. Compliance for this industry is only growing with each reported breach.

## Multiple vendors' email content/virus scanners do not adequately check "message/partial" MIME entities

#### Vulnerability Note VU#836088

Original Release Date: 2002-09-13 | Last Revised: 2002-09-18

---

### Overview

Email anti-virus scanners and content filters from multiple vendors do not adequately check messages containing "message/partial" MIME entities (RFC 2046). As a result, viruses, malicious code, or other restricted content may not be detected.

### Description

| Section 5.2.2 of RFC 2046 defines the "message/partial" Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) type:  5.2.2.  Partial Subtype   The "partial" subtype is defined to allow large entities to be   delivered as several separate pieces of mail and automatically   reassembled by a receiving user agent.  (The concept is similar to IP   fragmentation and reassembly in the basic Internet Protocols.)  This   mechanism can be used when intermediate transport agents limit the   size of individual messages that can be sent.  The media type   "message/partial" thus indicates that the body contains a fragment of   a larger entity.Email anti-virus scanners and content filters typically search messages for signatures or patterns that are associated with known viruses, malicious code, or restricted content. Some anti-virus scanners and content filters do not detect patterns that are fragmented across different "message/partial" MIME parts in multiple email messages. For example, an anti-virus scanner that would normally detect a well-known virus in an email message might fail to do so if the virus was sent s a "message/partial" MIME entitiy split across multiple email messages.Note that some products may corrupt messages containing "message/partial" MIME parts such that they cannot be automatically reassembled by mail user agents (MUAs). This behavior provides some protection at the cost of breaking the intended functionality of the "message/partial" MIME type.[Beyond-Security](http://www.beyondsecurity.com/) [SecuriTeam](http://www.securiteam.com/) has released an [advisory](http://www.securiteam.com/securitynews/5YP0A0K8CM.html) that describes this vulnerability in further detail. |
| --- |

### Impact

| Email anti-virus and content filters may not detect viruses, malicious code, or other restricted content that is sent as "message/partial" MIME parts in multiple email messages. Such messages may be automatically reassembled by MUAs, thus delivering the virus, malicious code, or restricted content to users. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply Patch**Apply a patch or upgrade from your vendor. For information about a specific vendor, check the Systems Affected section of this document or contact your vendor directly. |
| --- |

| **Block "message/partial" MIME Types**If possible, configure your mail server, firewall, or other gateway technology to block messages containing "message/partial" MIME parts. Note that this will disable the intended functionality of this MIME type, and users will be unable to send or receive messages containing "message/partial" parts.**Disable Message Reassembly**If possible, configure your MUA to not reassemble fragmented messages automatically. This will prevent your MUA from reassembling any "message/partial" MIME entities, whether or not they are malicious.**Use Desktop Anti-Virus Software**Deploy and maintain updated desktop anti-virus software. |

### [Check Point](#AAMN-5DX8ZJ) Affected

Notified:  September 13, 2002  Updated: September 18, 2002

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

We have not received a statement from the vendor.

### Vendor Information

The vendor has not provided us with any further information regarding this vulnerability.

### Addendum

The following response from Check Point appears in the SecuriTeam [advisory](http://www.securiteam.com/securitynews/5YP0A0K8CM.html):

*Neither the latest 4.1 nor the latest NG versions of FW-1 are vulnerable to this problem. A few details follow:*

*1. FW-1 does not directly analyze the body of attachments. In that respect, the vulnerability is not applicable to FW-1.*

*2. FW-1 has the capability to easily filter these types of messages, by specifying "message/partial" in the "Strip MIME of type:" section of the resource definition.*

*3. FW-1 does serve as a platform for third party vendors to check attachments for viruses via the "CVP" OPSEC mechanism. When defining a CVP server, a message box is presented to the administrator (when approving the resource) that says:*

*"When CVP server is used it is recommended to strip MIME of type 'message/partial'. Do you want to add 'message/partial'?"*

*Pressing "Yes" will automatically add 'message/partial' to the appropriate place in the resource definition.*

*We therefore believe is safe to say that not only are we not vulnerable to this problem ourselves, we also protect 3rd party opsec partners from falling for this pitfall.*

If you have feedback, comments, or additional information about this vulnerability, please send us email.

### [Symantec](#AAMN-5DUTY3) Not Affected

Notified:  September 04, 2002  Updated: September 18, 2002

### Status

Not Affected

### Vendor Statement

Symantec has been aware for some time of the potential malicious use of this email feature. As a result, all currently supported Symantec gateway products, by default, block multi-part MIME messages at the gateway. While this is a configurable feature of Symantec gateway products and can be enabled if multi-part email is required, the rejection of segmented messages should be a part of a company's comprehensive security policy to restrict potentially harmful content from the internal network.

Additionally, should known malicious code be delivered to a client computer in this manner, the Symantec and Norton AntiVirus scanning products will detect it when it is reassembled and downloaded to the client computer and/or during attempted execution on the targeted computer. As always, if previously unknown malicious code is being distributed in this manner, Symantec Security Response will react and send updated virus definitions via LiveUpdate to detect the new threat.

### Vendor Information

The vendor has not provided us with any further information regarding this vulnerability.

### Addendum

Symantec has published this [advisory](http://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/security/Content/2002.09.10.html).
