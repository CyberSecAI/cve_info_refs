      "source": "marc.info_8c5bfffc_20250125_052442.html",
      "root_cause": "The leafnode NNTP server can enter an infinite loop when an article crossposted to multiple groups (one of which is a prefix of another) is requested by its Message-ID.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Infinite loop vulnerability",
        "Improper handling of crossposted articles with newsgroup name prefix conflicts."
      ],
      "impact": "Denial of Service (DoS). The leafnode server process can become unresponsive and consume 100% CPU, potentially requiring the system administrator to terminate the process. Repeated exploitation may lead to multiple leafnode processes consuming excessive resources.",

        "Network",
        "NNTP protocol"
