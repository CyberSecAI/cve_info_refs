Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2002-1123:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- An unchecked buffer exists in the SQL Server 2000 (and MSDE 2000) authentication handling function. Specifically, during the preliminary information exchange before actual authentication, a buffer is vulnerable to being overrun.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** A specially crafted login request with a malformed data packet can cause a buffer overflow in the authentication function. This overflow can overwrite memory within the SQL Server service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By sending random data, an attacker can cause the SQL Server service to crash, resulting in a denial of service.
- **Remote Code Execution:** By sending carefully chosen data, an attacker can overwrite the memory with malicious code and gain full control over the SQL Server. This allows the attacker to add, delete, or modify data; reconfigure SQL Server parameters; or perform any other desired action on the database with the privileges of the SQL Server service account.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially malformed login request to the SQL server.
- The attacker does not need to successfully authenticate to the SQL Server, they only need to initiate the preliminary exchange prior to authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send network packets to the SQL Server port (default is 1433).
- The attacker does not need valid SQL Server credentials or to successfully authenticate.
- If the SQL Server port is blocked by a firewall, the vulnerability cannot be exploited from the Internet.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability only affects SQL Server 2000 and MSDE 2000. SQL Server 7.0 and MSDE 1.0 are not affected.
- The provided NASL script demonstrates the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted packet to port 1433.
- The Microsoft document refers to this vulnerability as "Unchecked buffer in SQL Server 2000 authentication function" and has the identifier CAN-2002-1123.
