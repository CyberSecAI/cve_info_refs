- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Input validation vulnerability in ImageFolio's CGI scripts. Specifically, the `direct` parameter in `imageFolio.cgi` and the `step` parameter in `nph-build.cgi` are not properly sanitized, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the vulnerable parameters. This can be used to steal user's or administrator's authentication cookies, potentially leading to account compromise and further malicious activity on the web application.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting malicious URLs that include JavaScript code in the vulnerable parameters. The provided examples show the `direct` parameter in `imageFolio.cgi` and the `step` parameter in `nph-build.cgi` being exploited.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker only needs to be able to make requests to the affected server and have knowledge of the vulnerable parameters. No special access or privileges are required.
