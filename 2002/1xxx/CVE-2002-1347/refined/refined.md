Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause:**

*   **Problem 1:** Insufficient buffer length checking during user name canonicalization when a default realm is set.
*   **Problem 2:**  Insufficient memory allocation when escaping special characters in usernames and realms during LDAP authentication with `saslauthd`.
*  **Problem 3:** Log writer may not allocate enough memory for the trailing null terminator.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Buffer Overflows (Problem 1):** The code doesn't properly validate the length of the user name before copying it into fixed-size buffers, allowing an attacker to overwrite memory on the heap by crafting a long username combined with the default realm. The overflow affects two buffers `user_buf` and `authid_buf` within the `sasl_conn_t` structure.
*  **Memory Allocation Issue (Problem 2):** The code does not allocate sufficient memory to hold the escaped username/realm strings when LDAP authentication is used, specifically for the characters `*`, `(`, `)`, `\` and `\0`, leading to a heap overflow.
*  **Missing Null Terminator (Problem 3):** The log writing function may not allocate enough space for the null terminator in the log message, potentially causing issues when the log message is used.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution (Problem 1):** By overwriting the heap metadata or other heap-based structures, an attacker may achieve arbitrary code execution on the server.
*  **Heap Corruption (Problem 2):** Heap corruption could lead to application crashes, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution.
*  **Logging Data Manipulation (Problem 3):** While probably difficult to exploit, the issue allows manipulation of logging data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Problem 1:** An attacker can send a specially crafted long username to a server using the Cyrus SASL library when a default realm is configured. This can occur on the client-side as well, though the impact may be limited to applications that handle usernames such as webmails.
*   **Problem 2:**  An attacker can provide a crafted username or realm containing the special characters to a service using LDAP authentication with saslauthd.
*   **Problem 3:** An attacker can send specially crafted data that will be logged by the system, such as during an anonymous authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Problem 1:** An attacker needs to be able to send a username to a vulnerable service, and the service needs to be configured with a default realm.
*   **Problem 2:** The attacker needs to be able to authenticate to a service using LDAP with a crafted username or realm, leveraging the saslauthd.
*   **Problem 3:** The attacker needs to be able to trigger a logging event to inject a crafted message, which can include anonymous authentication.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided patch shows the code changes made to fix the vulnerabilities. These include checks on the user name length before copying, increased buffer allocation for escaped characters and allocation of enough space for the null terminator during logging.
*   The `CANON_BUF_SIZE` constant is relevant to the size of the overflowable buffer and the `out_umax` variable determines maximum size of the output buffer.
* The information mentions that postfix is one of the products that uses the library and uses `$myhostname` as default realm name by default.
* It also mentions other products including OpenLDAP.
* The content provides more details than the typical CVE description, including code snippets, exploitation details and impact on services that use the affected library.

Based on the above, the content is related to the specified CVE.
