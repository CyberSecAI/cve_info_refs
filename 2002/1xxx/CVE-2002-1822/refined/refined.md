Based on the provided content:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The JSP processor 1.1 in IBM HTTP server 1.0 on AS/400 returns a recursive error message when a requested JSP page does not exist.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Information disclosure vulnerability. The error message reveals sensitive information such as:
    - Root paths of the server
    - Versions of servlets running on the server.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can gather information about the server's configuration, potentially aiding further attacks. This information could be used to identify known vulnerabilities in specific servlet versions or understand the server's directory structure.

**Attack vectors:**
- By requesting a non-existent JSP page, an attacker can trigger the error message, leading to the information disclosure.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the server. No specific user privileges are required.
