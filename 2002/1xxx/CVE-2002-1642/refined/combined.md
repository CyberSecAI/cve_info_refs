In order to address a potentially critical bug in the VACUUM code, the
PostgreSQL Global Development Group is releasing v7.2.3 of PostgreSQL.

This release includes a fix for a serious problem that has affected all
7.2.\* releases: if a VACUUM command is run by a non-superuser, it is
sometimes possible for the system to prematurely remove old transaction
log data (pg\_clog files). This can result in data becoming unrecoverable.
All 7.2.\* installations are urged to update to 7.2.3 as soon as possible.

Other changes include;

Prevent non-superuser from increasing most recent vacuum info (Tom)
 Handle pre-1970 date values in newer versions of glibc (Tom)
 Fix possible hang during server shutdown
 Prevent spinlock hangs on SMP PPC machines (Tomoyuki Niijima)
 Fix pg\_dump to properly dump FULL JOIN USING (Tom)

This new release is available on all standard mirrors, or at the main ftp
site of:

[ftp://ftp.postgresql.org/pub/latest](http://ftp://ftp.postgresql.org/pub/latest)

Any bug reports concerning this release should be reported to
pgsql-bugs(at)postgresql(dot)org(dot)
