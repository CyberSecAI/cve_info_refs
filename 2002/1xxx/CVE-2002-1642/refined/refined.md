Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2002-1642:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the `VACUUM` command within PostgreSQL versions prior to 7.2.3. This flaw allows a non-superuser to prematurely remove old transaction log data (pg_clog files).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper access control:  Non-superusers should not have the ability to truncate transaction logs.
- Premature data deletion:  The `VACUUM` command, when improperly used, could remove transaction logs that are still necessary for database recovery.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Data loss: Premature removal of transaction logs can lead to data becoming unrecoverable. This constitutes a significant risk to database integrity.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited through the use of the `VACUUM` command by a non-superuser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a valid user account with the ability to execute the `VACUUM` command on the PostgreSQL database. The user does not need superuser privileges to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects all PostgreSQL versions in the 7.2 series prior to 7.2.3.
- The fix involves preventing non-superusers from increasing the most recent vacuum info, thus preventing them from removing necessary transaction logs.
- Red Hat also acknowledged the vulnerability in their security advisory (RHSA-2003-001), which is referenced in the CERT vulnerability note.
