  "CVE-2002-1372": {
    "Description": "The content describes multiple vulnerabilities in the Common Unix Printing System (CUPS), including file descriptor leaks, which are identified as CVE-2002-1372.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The root cause of the file descriptor leak vulnerability is the lack of proper error checking for return values of file and socket operations within the CUPS software. This leads to unclosed file descriptors.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "File descriptor leaks due to unchecked return values of file and socket operations."
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can launch a Denial of Service (DoS) attack against a system running CUPS by exploiting the file descriptor leak vulnerability.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through repeated file and socket operations that cause the system to run out of available file descriptors, leading to denial of service.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to send requests to the CUPS service, which can be done remotely or locally."
