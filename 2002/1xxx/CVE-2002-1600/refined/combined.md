## Directory-traversal vulnerability in Mike Spice's My Classifieds CGI script

#### Vulnerability Note VU#181907

Original Release Date: 2002-08-01 | Last Revised: 2002-08-01

---

### Overview

Some versions of My Classifieds contain a directory-traversal vulnerability that allows attackers to overwrite files.

### Description

| My Classifieds is a Perl CGI script, maintained by Mike Spice, that produces dynamic ad listings on a web server and allows users to edit their ads remotely. Prior to version 1.3, My Classifieds passed the CGI variable "category" to Perl's open() function without checking the variable for tampering by the client user. |
| --- |

### Impact

| Remote attackers can craft an HTTP request with any path in the "category" variable, allowing the attacker to overwrite any file to which the web server process has access. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Upgrade to version 1.3 of My Classifieds at:  <http://www.fuzzymonkey.org/cgi-bin/download.cgi> |
| --- |
