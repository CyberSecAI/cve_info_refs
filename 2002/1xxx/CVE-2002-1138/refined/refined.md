The provided document describes multiple vulnerabilities addressed by Microsoft Security Bulletin MS02-056. The specific vulnerability related to CVE-2002-1138 is the "Flaw in output file handling for scheduled jobs".

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The SQL Server Agent, when creating an output file for a scheduled job, uses its own privileges instead of the job owner's privileges, or a configured proxy account. This allows an unprivileged user to create files with the SQL Server Agent's privileges.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper privilege management during output file creation in scheduled jobs.
- SQL Server Agent operates with higher privileges than necessary for output file operations within the context of scheduled jobs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Creation of files containing OS commands in startup folders, leading to code execution when another user logs in.
- Overwriting system files, causing system disruption or failure.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker needs to be able to authenticate to an affected SQL server.
- The attacker then creates a scheduled job that creates an output file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to authenticate to an affected SQL Server.
- The attacker does not need any special permissions beyond the ability to create scheduled jobs.
