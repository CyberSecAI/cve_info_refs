| MHonArc Security Advisory: XSS vulnerability with HTML messages2002-12-21 19:20:02      | from [[*Earl Hood*](/archive/cgi-bin/namazu.cgi?query=%2Bfrom%3A"Earl%20Hood"&idxname=mhonarc-users&sort=date%3Alate)] | [[Permanent Link](/archive/cgi-bin/mesg.cgi?a=mhonarc-users&i=200212220120.gBM1K8502180%40mcguire.earlhood.com)] | | --- | --- |   ``` Summary      A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been discovered for     all versions of MHonArc upto, and including, v2.5.13.  A specially     crafted HTML mail message can introduce foreign scripting content     in archives, by-passing MHonArc's HTML script filtering.      Any MHonArc archives that allow HTML mail content are vulnerable.  Details:      At this time, details of the vulnerability are not being disclosed     until MHonArc users have adequate time to apply the Solutions     listed below.      No known exploits of the vulnerability has been reported.     The vulnerability was discovered by the MHonArc development team.  Solutions:      * Upgrade to v2.5.14.      * Or, disable HTML content from archives (something that is       recommended in the MHonArc FAQ for obvious security reasons).       HTML content can be disabled as follows with the following       resource settings:          <MIMEExcs>         text/html         text/x-html         </MIMEExcs>        If running versions prior to 2.4.9 that does not support       MIMEEXCS, then you can do the following:          <MIMEFilters>         text/html;    m2h_text_plain::filter;  mhtxtplain.pl         text/x-html;  m2h_text_plain::filter;  mhtxtplain.pl         </MIMEFilters>        Which causes all HTML data to be treated like text/plain data.       This can be done for later versions also if you do not want       to exclude HTML messages entirely.  Versions Affected:      All versions upto, and including, v2.5.13.     Development snapshots dated 2002-12-21 and earlier.
