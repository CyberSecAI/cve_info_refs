- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An unchecked buffer in the code that generates the warning message when a particular error condition associated with S/MIME digital signatures occurs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer overflow vulnerability in the S/MIME parsing code of Outlook Express.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  An attacker could cause the mail client to crash or, more seriously, execute arbitrary code on the user's machine with the privileges of the user. This could allow the attacker to perform actions such as adding, deleting or modifying data files, communicating with web sites, and more.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specially crafted email containing a malformed S/MIME certificate to a user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious email with a malformed S/MIME certificate and send it to a target using Outlook Express. The attacker doesn't need prior access to the target's machine, simply the ability to send email to them. The user would need to open or preview the email to trigger the vulnerability.
