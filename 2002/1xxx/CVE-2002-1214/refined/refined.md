- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An unchecked buffer in the code that processes PPTP control data within Windows 2000 and Windows XP implementations.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to the lack of proper bounds checking when processing PPTP control data.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can cause a denial of service by sending malformed PPTP control data, which corrupts kernel memory and leads to system failure.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted PPTP control data to a vulnerable server or client. For servers, this typically requires targeting the publicly exposed port 1723. For clients, an active PPTP session is required, making them more difficult to target due to frequently changing IP addresses.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to send data to a Windows 2000 or Windows XP system running the vulnerable PPTP service. For servers, they need to reach the exposed PPTP port (1723). For clients, the attacker needs to know the client's IP address and have an active PPTP session ongoing.
