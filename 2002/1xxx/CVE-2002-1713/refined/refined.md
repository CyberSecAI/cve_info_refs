The provided content describes a behavior of the Mandrake Security (msec) utility in Mandrake Linux, but it explicitly states that this behavior is not considered a security vulnerability. Therefore, it's **UNRELATED** to a CVE.

Specifically, the content explains that:

*   **Root cause of the behavior**: The msec utility is designed to enforce a chosen security level, which includes setting specific file permissions (755 for home directories) and potentially reverting changes made outside of the utility during periodic system audits.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities**: The behavior of the tool may be unexpected for administrators unfamiliar with the documentation, leading to the perception of unexpected system modifications. However, it is a documented and intended function of the tool.
*   **Impact**: System administrators who do not understand how msec operates may find that their manual changes to the system are reverted to the configured security policy.
*   **Attack vectors**: There are no attack vectors discussed, as the behavior is by design.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: There is no mention of attacker capabilities as the behavior is not a vulnerability.

The provided content explicitly states that the CERT/CC does not believe this utility represents a security vulnerability, and therefore it cannot be related to a specific CVE.
