## Multiple vendors' SSH transport layer protocol implementations contain vulnerabilities in key exchange and initialization

#### Vulnerability Note VU#389665

Original Release Date: 2002-12-16 | Last Revised: 2003-06-18

---

### Overview

Secure shell (SSH) transport layer protocol implementations from different vendors contain multiple vulnerabilities in code that handles key exchange and initialization. Both SSH servers and clients are affected. A remote attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the SSH process or cause a denial of service.

### Description

| From the IETF draft [*SSH Transport Layer Protocol*](http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-secsh-transport-15.txt):  SSH is a protocol for secure remote login and other secure network services over an insecure network.This document describes the SSH transport layer protocol which typically runs on top of TCP/IP.  The protocol can be used as a basis for a number of secure network services.  It provides strong encryption, server authentication, and integrity protection.  It may also provide compression.Key exchange method, public key algorithm, symmetric encryption algorithm, message authentication algorithm, and hash algorithm are all negotiated.Rapid7 has developed a suite of test cases (SSHredder) that examine the connection initialization, key exchange, and negotiation phase (KEX, KEXINIT) of the SSH transport layer protocol. The suite tests the way an SSH transport layer implementation handles invalid or incorrect packet and string lengths, padding and padding length, malformed strings, and invalid algorithms.The test suite has demonstrated a number of vulnerabilities in different vendors' SSH products. These vulnerabilities include buffer overflows, and they occur before user authentication takes place. Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ([CVE](http://cve.mitre.org/)) has assigned the following candidate numbers for several classes of tests performed by SSHredder:[CAN-2002-1357](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2002-1357): incorrect length fields, i.e. specified length field does not match the actual length of the input[CAN-2002-1358](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2002-1358): lists with empty elements or multiple separators[CAN-2002-1359](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2002-1359): "classic" buffer overflows (length field, if present, is consistent with the actual length of buffer)[CAN-2002-1360](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2002-1360): null characters in strings (which trigger conflicts between delimiter-based and length-based strings)Rapid7 has posted an advisory ([R7-0009](http://www.rapid7.com/advisories/R7-0009.txt)) and the [SSHredder](http://www.rapid7.com/perl/DownloadRequest.pl?PackageChoice=666) test suite. |
| --- |

### Impact

| The impact will vary for different vulnerabilities, but in some cases remote attackers could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the SSH process. Both SSH servers and clients are affected. On Windows systems, SSH servers commonly run with SYSTEM privileges. SSH daemons on UNIX systems typically run with root privileges. In the case of SSH clients, any attacker-supplied code would run with the privileges of the user who started the client program. Additional privileges may be afforded to an attacker when the SSH client is configured to run with an effective user ID (setuid/setgid) of root. Attackers could also crash a vulnerable SSH process, causing a denial of service.While OpenSSH does not appear to be affected, it is worth noting that [privilege separation](http://www.citi.umich.edu/u/provos/ssh/privsep.html) would greatly reduce the impact of arbitrary code execution during the KEXINIT phase. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade or Apply Patch**Upgrade or apply a patch as specified by your vendor. |
| --- |

| **Restrict Access**Until patches or upgrades are available, it may be possible to limit access to vulnerable SSH clients and servers using the built-in facilities of some SSH implementations, firewalls, packet-filters, [TCP Wrappers](http://ftp.porcupine.org/pub/security/#software), or other similar technology. Note that this workaround will not prevent exploitation of these vulnerabilities, it will only limit the number of potential sources of attacks.**Do Not Trust DNS**SSH clients can reduce the risk of attacks by only connecting to trusted servers by IP address. Again, this will not prevent attacks, but it will remove the ability of an attacker to redirect a client using DNS cache poisoning or by compromising a DNS server. |

### [Alcatel](#AAMN-5GZSUW) Affected

Notified:  December 06, 2002  Updated: May 05, 2003

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

Following CERT advisory CA-2002-36 on security vulnerabilities in the SSH implementations, Alcatel has conducted an immediate assessment to determine any impact this may have on our portfolio. A first analysis showed that various Alcatel products were affected: namely the 6600, 7000 and 8000 OmniSwitches running AOS 5.1.3 and for which corrections had been made available to customers. This issue has now been fixed both in a AOS 5.1.3 maintenance release and in AOS 5.1.4. The security of our customers' networks is of highest priority for Alcatel. Therefore we continue to test our product portfolio against potential SSH security vulnerabilities and will provide updates if necessary.

### Vendor Statement

With SSH Secure Shell the worst case effect of the vulnerability is a denial of service (DoS) for a single child-server (connection). This cannot be exploited to gain access to the host and this does not affect the parent server in any wa nor does it hinder the server's ability to receive new connections - it only affects the child server that is handling connections to the malicious client, or a client application that is connecting to a malicious server. No arbitrary code can be executed.

### Vendor Information

The vendor has not provided us with any further information regarding this vulnerability.

### Addendum

The SSH Communications Security implementation of the SSH transport layer protocol appears to be vulnerable to a null-pointer dereference, which can cause a client or child server process to crash. Existing connections and the ability to make new connections to the server are not affected. The client application terminates. The impact of this vulnerability seems to be limited to denial of service.
