## PC-cillin "pop3trap.exe" vulnerable to buffer overflow via long string of characters

#### Vulnerability Note VU#157961

Original Release Date: 2002-12-18 | Last Revised: 2002-12-18

---

### Overview

A locally exploitable buffer overflow exists in PC-cillin.

### Description

| Trend Micro describes PC-cillin as follows:  Trend Micro PC-cillin provides all-in-one antivirus security, personal firewall, and PDA protection for your PC. The user-friendly interface makes it easy to install and use. It defends your system from viruses, hackers, and other Internet security threats in email, attachments, Internet downloads, and instant messaging.PC-cillin has the capability to scan incoming email for viruses. PC-cillin does this by running a local pop3 proxy daemon (pop3trap.exe). Trend Micro describes pop3trap.exe as follows:Trend Micro's pop3trap.exe is an application level proxy for POP3 defined in RFC 1939. It forwards the local POP3 client requests to a remote server running on a different machine, mostly at the ISP-side. The service is only accessible from the localhost with IP address 127.0.0.1. The pop3trap.exe application runs transparent in the background and scans all mails received by POP3.A buffer overflow in pop3trap.exe may allow a local attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the pop3 proxy. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A local attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the pop3 proxy. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Apply a patch. |

Version(s)     : 2000, 2002 and 2003

Problem:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-
PC-cillin has an unchecked buffer in pop3trap.exe

Description:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-
PC-cillin comes with a mail scanning feature that scans all incoming mail
for
viruses, this is accomplished by connecting the mail client to a local
service
listening on port 110 (pop3). This service is only listening for connections
from the local machine and acts as a proxy. The program running this service
is pop3trap.exe. Connecting to the local port 110 and sending a lot of
characters will crash the program with a direct hit on the EIP, this makes
it
possible to run malicious code. The code will be run using the privileges of
the user owning the pop3trap.exe process.

Example 1: perl -e " print \"a\"x1100" |nc 127.0.0.1 110

Example 2: <http://127.0.0.1:110/>[put 1100 a's here]
