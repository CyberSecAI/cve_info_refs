Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2002-1140:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an improper parameter size check within the Sun RPC library included in the Microsoft Services for UNIX (SFU) 3.0 Interix SDK.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overrun:** The RPC library does not adequately validate the size of incoming client TCP requests that are fragmented. Specifically, the library expects client requests to be broken down into variable-sized fragments, with each fragment indicating whether it is the last fragment and the size of the data to follow. A malformed fragment can cause the library to enter a hung state due to the improper size check.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can send specially crafted, malformed RPC requests to a server using the vulnerable Sun RPC library. This causes the server to become unresponsive, unable to process any further client requests, effectively leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based Attack:** The attacker sends malicious RPC requests over the network to a server application that uses the vulnerable Sun RPC library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the target server.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to be an authenticated user on the target system.
- **Ability to send malformed RPC Requests:** The attacker needs the ability to send custom or crafted RPC requests that contain malformed fragmented packets to exploit the flaw.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is specific to applications or utilities built using the Interix SDK and the Sun RPC library included with Microsoft Services for UNIX (SFU) 3.0.
- The patch for this issue involves proper input validation and checks of the incoming client packets in the RPC library.
- Restarting the affected application typically recovers the service from the hung state, but in some cases a server reboot may be required.
- Blocking TCP port 111 via firewall could prevent remote exploitation.
- The vulnerability is identified as "Improper parameter size check leading to denial of service" and associated with CAN-2002-1140.
