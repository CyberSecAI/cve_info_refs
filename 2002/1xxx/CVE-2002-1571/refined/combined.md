Hi,

while debugging GCC bugreport, I noticed following behaviour of simple

program with no syscalls:

hubicka@nikam:~$ ./a.out

sum of 7 ints: 28

hubicka@nikam:~$ ./a.out

sum of 7 ints: 56

Bad sum (seen with gcc -O -march=pentiumpro -msse)

hubicka@nikam:~$ ./a.out

sum of 7 ints: 84

Bad sum (seen with gcc -O -march=pentiumpro -msse)

hubicka@nikam:~$ ./a.out

sum of 7 ints: 112

Bad sum (seen with gcc -O -march=pentiumpro -msse)

hubicka@nikam:~$ echo

hubicka@nikam:~$ ./a.out

sum of 7 ints: 28

ie it always returns different value, moreover when something else

is run in meantime (verified by loading WWW page served by same machine),

the counter is reinitialized to 28.

I am attaching the source, but it needs to be compiled by cfg-branch GCC

with settings -O2 -march=pentium3 -mfpmath=sse, so I've placed static

binary to <http://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~hubicka/badsum.bin>

The problem appears to be reproducible only on pentium3 and athlon4 systems,

not pentium4 system, where it appears to work as expected. Reproduced on

both 2.4.9-RH and 2.4.16 kernels.

Compiling the asm source with a different compiler will also make it fail.

[ program snipped ]

So there are two different issues at play here. First, the kernel uses

the fninit instruction to initialize the fpu on first use. Nothing in the

Intel manuals says anything about the fninit instruction clearing the mmx

or sse registers, and experimentally we now know for sure that it doesn't.

That means that when the first time your program was ran it left 28 in

register xmm1. The next time the program was run, the fninit did nothing

to clear register xmm1 so it still held 28. Now, the pxor instruction

that is part of the m() function and intended to 0 out the xmm1 register

is an sse2 instruction. It just so happens that it doesn't work on sse

only processors such as P3 CPUs. So, when 28 was left in xmm1, then the

pxor failed to 0 out xmm1, we saved 28 as the starting value for the loop

and then looped through 7 additions until we had, you guessed it, 56. In

fact, if you do a while :;do bad; done loop the it will increment by 28

each time it is run except when something else intervenes. Replacing the

pxor instruction with xorps instead makes it work. So, that's a bug in

gcc I suspect, using sse2 instructions when only called to use sse

instructions. It seems odd to me that the CPU wouldn't generate an

illegal instruction exception, but oh well, it evidently doesn't.

So, we really should change arch/i386/kernel/i387.c something like this:

(WARNING, totally untested and not even compile checked change follows)

+ }

current->used\_math = 1;

}

The rest of the problem is a gcc bug and possibly something that Intel

should make a note of on the p3 processors (that is, that the p3 will

silently fail to execute some sse2 instructions without generating the

expected exception).
