Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a side effect of a Cisco patch for a previous SSH packet injection vulnerability (VU#13877). This patch introduced a new issue where processing large SSH packets could consume excessive CPU resources.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Excessive CPU resource consumption when processing large SSH packets. This can lead to a denial-of-service condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks against affected Cisco devices.
- In some cases, the excessive resource consumption may cause the affected device to reboot.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending large SSH packets to a vulnerable Cisco device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic (specifically crafted SSH packets) to the targeted Cisco device. This implies the attacker needs network connectivity to the device.
- No specific authentication or authorization is mentioned as required.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by attempts to exploit an integer overflow vulnerability described in VU#945216.
- The vulnerability is addressed by a Cisco security advisory, which includes patches.
- The content references other vulnerabilities (VU#13877 and VU#945216) that are related to this issue.
