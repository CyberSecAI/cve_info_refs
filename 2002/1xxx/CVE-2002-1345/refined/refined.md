Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerability lies in FTP clients not properly sanitizing filenames received from a malicious FTP server. Specifically, when the server sends filenames containing directory traversal sequences (e.g., "../", "..\", "/path", "C:", "..."), vulnerable clients blindly use these filenames when saving files, instead of treating them as file paths and ensuring they are within the user's working directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Directory Traversal:** FTP clients are vulnerable to directory traversal attacks when they use server-provided filenames without proper validation. This allows the server to control where the downloaded files are saved on the client's system.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** Vulnerable clients do not validate or sanitize the filenames received from the FTP server. They assume that the server-provided filenames are safe and do not contain malicious path sequences.
- **Blind Trust of Server Data:** The FTP client's behavior indicates that it blindly trusts the data provided by the server when it comes to filenames, leading to the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary File Overwrite/Creation:** A malicious FTP server can overwrite or create arbitrary files on the client's file system, as long as the client process has the necessary permissions.
- **Denial of Service:** By overwriting critical system files, an attacker could potentially cause a denial-of-service condition on the client's system.
- **Privilege Escalation (in some cases):** In some cases, if the client process has higher privileges, a malicious server could overwrite executable files and potentially gain privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious FTP Server:** The attacker must control or have access to a malicious FTP server.
- **LIST/NLST Response Manipulation:** The attacker crafts the responses to LIST or NLST commands to include filenames with malicious directory traversal sequences.
- **Multiple GET Requests:** The client is typically vulnerable when downloading multiple files using wildcards ("mget") where the server supplies the potentially malicious file names.
- **FTP URLs within Web Pages (wget specific):** For some clients like wget, this vulnerability can be triggered if the client follows FTP links within web pages (especially with specific options).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Control of FTP Server:** The attacker needs to control or have the capability to create a malicious FTP server that can return crafted file names.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to convince a user to connect to their malicious FTP server. This can be through tricking the user into using a crafted URL, or by having the user browse to a page with malicious FTP links for web based clients.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability primarily affects non-default configurations of FTP clients, particularly when downloading multiple files.
- Some clients might detect and skip suspicious filenames, which mitigates the attack, although this behavior is inconsistent.
- Some FTP clients might prompt the user before overwriting files, which can also mitigate the vulnerability if the user is aware and cautious.
- Some clients, like wget, were vulnerable depending on their command line options and how they were used (e.g.  following FTP links in web pages with --follow-ftp and -nH).
- Certain FTP clients are not vulnerable because they specify the files to write to, rather than relying on the server to provide this information.

**Products mentioned:**
- Vulnerable: wget 1.8.1, wget 1.7.1, OpenBSD 3.0 FTP client, Solaris 2.6/7 FTP client, SGI FTP client
- Not Vulnerable: Red Hat 7.1 FTP client, Debian 2.4.16 FTP client, NT SP5 command line FTP client, XP command line FTP client (no SP), lftp 2.6.2, NcFTP 3.1.4, Lynx 2.8.1
