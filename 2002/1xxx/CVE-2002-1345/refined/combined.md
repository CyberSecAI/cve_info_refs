___ Summary __________________________________________________________

        Title: Directory Traversal Vulnerabilities in FTP Clients
         Date: December 10, 2002
       Author: Steve Christey (coley@mitre.org)
     Revision: 1.3

      Product: Multiple FTP and web clients
  OS/Platform: Multiple
       Vendor: Multiple
Vendor Status: Vendors informed individually and through CERT/CC
         Risk: Medium.  A malicious server could potentially overwrite
               key files to cause a denial of service or, in some
               cases, gain privileges by modifying executable files.
               The risk is mitigated because non-default
               configurations are primarily affected, and the user
               must be convinced to access the malicious server.
               However, web-based clients may be more easily exploited
               using server-side vulnerabilities such as XSS.

FTP clients, including those that may be embedded in web clients, can
be vulnerable to certain directory traversal attacks by modified FTP
servers.  If successful, the attacks could allow the server to
overwrite or create arbitrary files outside of the client's working
directory, subject to file/directory permissions and the privilege
level of the client.

Multiple clients are affected.  See "Test Results" for the list of
clients.

___ Introduction _____________________________________________________

Inspiration:

  A colleague of mine selected a bunch of files from an "ftp://" URL
  and copied them to a folder en masse.

Realization:

  FTP clients haven't been reported as being vulnerable to directory
  traversal conditions.

Correction based on further investigation:

  In 1997, some FTP clients were reported as being vulnerable to
  directory traversal conditions [[1]](#1).

Theory:

  Some FTP clients are still vulnerable to directory traversal
  conditions.

Verification:

  The task would involve creating a malicious FTP server that would
  send filenames with "../" and other sequences as the result of a
  "LIST" request, or a "multiple GET" request.  The client might then
  download these files into some parent directory.

___ Testing Methodology ______________________________________________

This methodology is a simplification of the PROTOS methodology as
developed by the Oulu University Secure Programming Group [[2]](#2), in
which a test suite is developed for a particular protocol, and the
suite is then used against specific implementations.  The PROTOS
methodology has proven effective in finding large numbers of
vulnerabilities in many different products that implement standard
networking protocols.

For a simple test suite, the "ftp4all" FTP server was modified to
return filenames of various forms that might cause files to be created
outside a client's working directory.  ftp4all was chosen because it
was easy to install and it allowed non-root users to run an FTP server
on a port other than 21.

The files src/ftps/list.c, serverd.c, and transfer.c were changed to
produce modified filenames, and to return the same test file for any
filename that the client requests.

When a client sends a LIST or NLST command, the test server returns
filenames containing the following sequences:

  "../"   - classic traversal
  "/path" - an absolute pathname
  "..\"   - backslash traversal pattern (Windows systems)
  "C:"    - Drive letter traversal (Windows systems)
  "..."   - "triple-dot" (Windows systems, equivalent to ../..)

When downloading a group of files using wildcards, the FTP client
typically performs an "NLST" command, reads the list of files returned
by the server, and uses those filenames to make individual requests.

Note that web clients may also be affected if they can process
"ftp://" URLs.

Demonstration Session
---------------------

Following is a simulated session to demonstrate how a vulnerable
client may behave.

CLIENT> CONNECT server
  220 FTP4ALL FTP server ready. Local time is Tue Oct 01, 2002 20:59.
  Name (server:username): test
  331 Password required for test.
  Password:

  -rw-r-----   0 nobody    nogroup          0 Oct 01 20:11 misc.txt
  226 Directory listing completed.

CLIENT> GET *.txt

  Saving as "FAKEFILE.txt"

  Opening ASCII data connection for ../../FAKEME2.txt...
  Saving as "../../FAKEME2.txt"

  Opening ASCII data connection for /tmp/ftptest/FAKEME6.txt...
  Saving as "/tmp/ftptest/FAKEME6.txt"

  [etc.]

If a client is vulnerable, it saves files outside of the user's
current working directory.

Testing Notes
-------------

For command-line FTP clients, the client was tested in the following
fashion:

  - log onto FTP server
  - set no-interactive prompt
  - perform "mget" (multiple GET) or equivalent command

In some cases, an FTP client would produce an error as soon as it
encountered a suspicious filename, and skip the remaining filenames.
Thus one could not be certain if the client was vulnerable to other
filenames.  If a client demonstrated this behavior, then the server
was modified to send a single suspicious filename at a time, and the
client would be executed multiple times.

Other variants of directory traversal sequences were not tested, as
there were not sufficient resources to conduct such a comprehensive
analysis in a timely fashion.  See [[3]](#3) for examples.

It is possible that web clients may be vulnerable to the same type of
issue from malicious HTTP servers, when the clients are used to
automatically download web pages.  However, this was not tested.

___ Test Results _____________________________________________________

The following products were specifically tested by the author.
Descriptions of this class of problem were reported to CERT/CC and
major vendors.  Most vendors did not report results back to the
author.  Consult your vendor, or the associated CERT vulnerability
note, if your product is not listed here.

Vulnerable:

   Product              ../  ..\    C:   /path    ...
   -------------        ---  ---    ---  -----    ---
   wget 1.8.1           yes   no     no    yes{4}  no
   wget 1.7.1           yes   no     no     no{2}  no

   Solaris 2.6, 7       yes   no     no    yes     no

   The ftp command on SGI systems is also subject to one or more
   flavors of directory traversal attacks.  However, details were not
   available at the time that this advisory was published.

Not Vulnerable:

   Product              ../  ..\    C:   /path    ...
   -------------        ---  ---    ---  -----    ---
   Red Hat 7.1          no{3} no{3}  no{3}  no{3}  no
   Debian 2.4.16        no{3} no{3}  no{3}  no{3}  no
   NT SP5 command line  no    no     no     no     no
   XP command (no SP)   no    no     no     no     no
   lftp 2.6.2           no    no{1}  no{1}  no     no
   NcFTP 3.1.4          no    no     no     no     no
   Lynx 2.8.1           [FTP traversal not available]

Notes:

  {1} installed the file in the current directory

  {2} created subdirectories within the current directory

  {3} generated error message and/or stopped downloading

  {4} only with the -nH option ("Disable host-prefixed directories")

Other notes on wget:

  1) "wget" was tested with the -r (recursive) option.

  2) When provided with an FTP URL on the command line, it is subject
     to "../" traversal

  3) If there's an FTP link within a web page, it will not follow the
     links, and is not subject to traversal

  4) HOWEVER, if the --follow-ftp option is used, it is subject to
     "../" traversal

  5) When both --follow-ftp and -nH are used, wget is also subject to
     "/path" traversal

  6) wget 1.7.1 was not tested for the -nH absolute path issue, or for
     FTP URL's in web pages

___ Patches, Workarounds, and Vendor Statements ______________________

Workarounds:

  Some clients may have one or more of the following features.  If so,
  then enabling these features could notify the user if an attack
  occurs, and allow the user to take defensive action.

  These features may be explicitly disabled if the client is being
  called from a script or other program that does not require user
  intervention.

  1) The user may be able to set the client to prompt the user when an
     existing file is to be overwritten.  This is typically a default
     behavior.

  2) A command such as "runique" may be available to force the client
     to use a different filename instead of overwriting an existing
     file.

Sun FTP client:

   Statement from Sun
   ------------------

   We have investigated this directory traversal issue and do not
   think it is a bug.

   The user has several means of protection against this issue.

   1. By default prompting is turned on, so the user gets a chance to
   decide if they want a file returned by mget before it is
   downloaded. So files will not be overwritten without prompting the
   user.

   2. When running as an ordinary user, Unix access controls will stop
   system files being over written. If a user must run as root, care
   needs to be taken which would include not turning off interactive
   mode.

   3. The user may run the "runique" command to force the Solaris ftp
   client to avoid overwriting files that already exist.

   The Solaris ftp mget behaviour is consistent with other BSD derived
   ftp clients, for example on Linux and FreeBSD.  Changing the
   existing behaviour will cause problems.

SGI FTP client:

  SGI acknowledged the vulnerability via email and is likely to have a
  public acknowledgement near the time of this disclosure.

OpenBSD:

   Vendor statement (Theo de Raadt):

    "I've forwarded the report to the person who copes with that
     stuff.  I do not consider this all that serious."

wget:

  Red Hat Linux has released advisory RHSA-2002:229 at:
  <http://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHSA-2002-229.html>

  The status of other Linux vendors was unknown at the time this
  advisory was published.

## Multiple FTP clients contain directory traversal vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability Note VU#210409

Original Release Date: 2002-12-10 | Last Revised: 2003-03-14

---

### Overview

Multiple File Transfer Protocol (FTP) clients contain directory traversal vulnerabilities that allow a malicious FTP server to overwrite files on the client host.

### Description

| In a typical file transfer operation, one participant (the client) requests a file while a second participant (the server) provides the requested file. Before processing each request, many server implementations will consult an access control policy to determine whether the client should be permitted to read, write, or create a file at the requested location. If the client is able to craft a request that violates the server's access control policy, then the server contains a vulnerability. Since most vulnerabilities of this type involve escaping a restricted set of directories, they are commonly known as "directory traversal" vulnerabilities.  Directory traversal vulnerabilities are most often reported in server implementations, but recent research into the behavior of FTP clients has revealed several vulnerabilities in various FTP client implementations. To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker must convince the FTP client user to access a specific FTP server containing files with crafted filenames. When an affected FTP client attempts to download one of these files, the crafted filename causes the client to write the downloaded files to the location specified by the filename, not by the victim user. In some cases, the attacker must use a modified FTP server to allow the crafted filenames to be passed to the client.For more detailed information regarding this research, please read "[Directory Traversal Vulnerabilities in FTP Clients](http://online.securityfocus.com/archive/1/302956)", written by Steve Christey. |
| --- |

### Impact

| This vulnerability allows an attacker to mislead users of affected FTP clients, convincing the victim to unintentionally create or overwrite files on the client's filesystem. |

### [IBM](#JPLA-5GJUFV) Not Affected

Notified:  December 05, 2002  Updated: December 19, 2002

### Status

Not Affected

### Vendor Statement

IBM's AIX ftp client is not vulnerable to the directory traversal attacks described in CERT Vulnerability Note VU#210409. These attacks require a connection to a malicious ftp server. The AIX ftp client specifies the files that are written to during a ftp session; it does not get this information from the server it is connected to. An attempt by a malicious server to specify a file to be written to will fail.

### Vendor Information

The vendor has not provided us with any further information regarding this vulnerability.

### Addendum

The CERT/CC has no additional comments at this time.

If you have feedback, comments, or additional information about this vulnerability, please send us email.

### [Openwall GNU/\*/Linux](#JPLA-5GJUB3) Not Affected

Notified:  December 05, 2002  Updated: December 09, 2002

### Status

Not Affected

### Vendor Statement

Openwall GNU/\*/Linux is not vulnerable. The "lftp" FTP client that we use will not request files whose names contain a slash ('/') with "mget" and "mirror" commands and will not attempt to create files with such names locally when they're requested by the user explicitly.

### Vendor Information

The vendor has not provided us with any further information regarding this vulnerability.
