### Overview

The [HP Tru64 UNIX](http://www.tru64unix.compaq.com/) implementation of "dtsession" contains a locally exploitable buffer overflow.

### Description

| From the [HP Tru64 UNIX reference pages](http://www.tru64unix.compaq.com/docs/base_doc/DOCUMENTATION/V40G_HTML/MAN/MAN1/INDEX.HTM), the "dtsession" utility "provides ICCCM 1.1 compliant session management functionality during a user's session, the time from login to logout. It launches a window manager and allows for saving a session, restoring a session, locking a session, launching screen savers and allocating colors for desktop compatible clients." A locally exploitable buffer overflow in "dtsession" may permit a local attacker to gain elevated privileges and execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable host. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A local user may be able to gain elevated privileges and execute arbitrary code. |
| --- |
