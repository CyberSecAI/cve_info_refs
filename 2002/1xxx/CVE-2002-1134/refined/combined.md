 SECURITY BULLETIN

 SSRT2362 WEBES Service Tools (HP Tru64 UNIX,
          HP OpenVMS, Windows) Potential File
          Access Vulnerability

 REVISION: 0
 ------------------------------------------------------------
 NOTICE: There are no restrictions for distribution of this
 ======= Bulletin provided that it remains complete and intact.

 RELEASE DATE:  21 September 2002
 ============

 SEVERITY  - High

 SOURCE:  Compaq Computer Corporation,
 =======  a wholly-owned subsidiary of
          Hewlett-Packard Company and
          Hewlett-Packard Company HP Services
          Software Security Response Team

 REFERENCE:  SSRT2362
 ==========

 PROBLEM SUMMARY
 ===============

    SSRT2362 WEBES/ Compaq Analyze  (Severity - High)

    A potential vulnerability has been reported  where,
    under certain circumstances,  a non-privileged user
    may gain unauthorized access to privileged files.
    This may be in the form of local and remote security
    domain risks.

    Compaq Analyze is a Compaq proprietary tool and can be
    installed on customer sites with a hardware warranty,
    hardware service contract, or service obligation.

 VERSIONS IMPACTED
 =================

    WEBES V2.0 through WEBES V4.0 (Service Pack 5)

    Operating Systems affected are:

    HP Tru64 UNIX V4.0d, V4.0e, V4.0f, V4.0g, V5.0a, V5.1, V5.1a

    All versions of HP OpenVMS Alpha V7.1-2 and later.

    Windows NT 4.0, Windows NT for Alpha, Windows 2000, and Windows XP

 RESOLUTION
 ==========

    HP is working to provide a hotfix for this problem as quickly
    as possible, this procedure to disable the Compaq Analyze web
    service is only a temporary workaround until a solution has
    been provided and only affects the web interface. The hotfix
    will be announced at <http://www.compaq.com/support/svctools/webes/>
    early the week of September 23rd.

 1. Checking for installation:

    Use the desta status command to see if the WEBES product
    is installed, and if the director is running.

 2. Disabling the CA Web User Interface:

    This information comes from the CA Users Guide.

    The following procedure describes how to turn off the
    Compaq Analyze web service.

    Stop the Director by entering desta stop at the command prompt.

    If WEBES is installed on a Tru64 UNIX or OpenVMS cluster,
    stop the Director on all nodes of the cluster.  On Tru64 UNIX,
    this can be done from one node using the
    /usr/sbin/webes_install_update utility.

    On OpenVMS, this can be done using SYSMAN with the following commands:

    $ mcr sysman
      SYSMAN> set env /cluster
      SYSMAN> do desta stop
      SYSMAN> exit

 3. To prevent the CA WEB interface from restarting when the
    Director is restarted:

    Edit the ConfigDefaultsCA*.txt file in the config directory.

    Tru64 UNIX -
    edit the following file:
    /usr/opt/compaq/svctools/config/ConfigDefaultsCADUnix.txt

    OpenVMS -
    edit the following file:
    svctools_home:[config]ConfigDefaultsCAOpenVMS.txt

    Windows -
    edit the following file:
    c:\Program Files\Compaq\Svctools\Config\ConfigDefaultsCAWindows.txt

    Put a # in front of the line
    com.compaq.svctools.ca.services.web.CAWebService.

    The contents of the file should look similar to this:

 # ConfigDefaultsCAOpenVMS.txt
 #
 # Compaq Analyze Default Components, ** OpenVMS Version **
 #
 # Default components of Compaq Analyze, to enroll the first time the
 # DESTA Director process is executed, as fully qualified Java class
 # names.
 # After DESTA runs the first time, the file Configuration.dat willbe
 # created, and it will be read on startup instead of ConfigDefaults*.txt.
 #
 # Duplicates are OK, so let's add the CommonDirector even though it's
 # also in ConfigDefaultsDESTA.txt, since we can't run the other
 # services without it.
 #
 com.compaq.svctools.desta.core.CommonDirector
 com.compaq.svctools.ca.services.analysis.EvtAnalyzer
 com.compaq.svctools.ca.services.decomposers.EvtDecomposer
 com.compaq.svctools.ca.services.eventreaders.SwccReader
 com.compaq.svctools.ca.services.web.CAWebService
 # The next line is specific to OpenVMS
 com.compaq.svctools.ca.services.eventreaders.VMSReader
 #
 # Uncomment the next line if operation of the Unanalyzed Event
 # Logging service is desired.
 #com.compaq.svctools.ca.services.analysis.UnanalyzedEventLogger
 com.compaq.svctools.desta.services.notification.ACHSNotification

 4. Delete the configuration.dat file from the following
    directories (assuming you used the default install directory):

    Tru64 UNIX - /usr/opt/compaq/svctools/desta/config

    OpenVMS - svctools_home:[desta.config]

    Windows - C:\Program Files\Compaq\Svctools\desta\config

 5. Restart the Director using the procedures described below:

    HP Tru64 UNIX -
    Enter /usr/sbin/desta start at a shell prompt. The "root"
    superuser must restart the Director because it requires
    root privileges to operate correctly.  If WEBES is installed
    on a Tru64 UNIX cluster, restart the Director on all nodes of
    the cluster. This can be done from one node using
    the /usr/sbin/webes_install_update utility.

    HP OpenVMS -
    Enter desta start at the OpenVMS command line prompt.
    The user that restarts the Director must have all
    privileges set, for the Director to operate correctly.
    If WEBES is installed on an OpenVMS cluster, restart
    the Director on all nodes of the cluster.

    On OpenVMS this can be done using SYSMAN with the
    following commands:

    $ mcr sysman
    SYSMAN> set env /cluster
    SYSMAN> do desta stop
    SYSMAN> exit

    Windows -
    Select Programs | Compaq Service Tools |
    Web-Based Enterprise Service | Start Director
    from the Start menu.

    -or-

    Enter net start DESTA_Service in a Command Prompt window
    to start the DESTA_Service Windows service that starts
    the Director. You also can start DESTA_Service from the
    Services utility in the Control Panel.
