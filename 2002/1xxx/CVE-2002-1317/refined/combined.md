## Solaris X Window Font Service (XFS) daemon contains buffer overflow in Dispatch() function

#### Vulnerability Note VU#312313

Original Release Date: 2002-11-25 | Last Revised: 2003-05-30

---

### Overview

A remotely exploitable buffer overflow has been discovered in the Solaris X Window Font Service (XFS) daemon (fs.auto).

### Description

| ISS X-Force released an [Advisory](http://bvlive01.iss.net/issEn/delivery/xforce/alertdetail.jsp?oid=21541) today regarding a remotely exploitable buffer overflow in XFS. According to ISS, XFS is installed and running by default on the following operating systems and architectures:     + Sun Microsystems Solaris 2.5.1 (Sparc/Intel) + Sun Microsystems Solaris 2.6 (Sparc/Intel) + Sun Microsystems Solaris 7 (Sparc/Intel) + Sun Microsystems Solaris 8 (Sparc/Intel) + Sun Microsystems Solaris 9 (Sparc) + Sun Microsystems Solaris 9 Update 2 (Intel)  According to the ISS Advisory, the buffer overflow exists in the fs.auto Dispatch() function. Because this function accepts user supplied data, an attacker can send overly large XFS queries to the XFS service and either cause it to crash or execute arbitrary code with the same privileges as the XFS service (typically nobody). |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the fs.auto daemon (typically nobody) or cause a denial of service by crashing the service. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Apply a vendor patch when it becomes available. |
| --- |

| Ingress Filtering - It may be possible to limit the scope of this vulnerability by applying ingress filtering (blocking access to TCP port 7100 at your network perimeter). Note: You should carefully consider the impact of blocking services that you may be using.     + Disable XFS Service - To disable the XFS Service, comment out the following line in /etc/inetd.conf (remember to restart inetd after making this change)  fs              stream  tcp     wait nobody /usr/openwin/lib/fs.auto    fs |

PROBLEM: Potential buffer overflow in the X Font Server (xfs)

IMPACT: Potential unauthorized access, denial of service.

PLATFORM: HP 9000 Series 700 and 800 running HP-UX 10.10, 10.20,
          10.24, 11.00, 11.04, 11.11, and 11.22

SOLUTION: Until patches are available manually install the
          appropriate fixed version of xfs.

MANUAL ACTIONS: Yes - NonUpdate
                Install the appropriate fixed xfs.

AVAILABILITY:  This bulletin will be updated when patches are
               available.

 ------------------------------------------------------------------
 A. Background
    CERT Advisory CA-2002-34 reports an remotely exploitable
    buffer overflow in the X Font Server (xfs).  The versions
    of xfs supplied with HP-UX 10.10, 10.20, 10.24, 11.00, 11.04,
    11.11, and 11.22 are potentially vulnerable.

 B. Recommended solution
    Until patches are released download and manually install
    the appropriate fixed version of xfs:

       10.10  xfs.1010
       10.20  xfs.1020
       10.24  xfs.1020
       11.00  xfs.1100
       11.04  xfs.1100
       11.11  xfs.1111
       11.22  xfs.1111

    Download the appropriate files from:

     System:    hprc.external.hp.com  (192.170.19.51)
     Login:     xfs
     Password:  xfs1

     FTP Access: ftp://xfs:xfs1@hprc.external.hp.com/
             or: ftp://xfs:xfs1@192.170.19.51/

      Note: There is an ftp defect in IE5 that may result in
            a browser hang.  To work around this:
      - Select Tools -> Internet Options -> Advanced
      - Un-check the option: [ ] Enable folder view for FTP sites.

     The files are:

        xfs.1010
        xfs.1020
        xfs.1100
        xfs.1111

    The cksum output:

        4146829079 147456 xfs.1010
        2943686322 155648 xfs.1020
        1843422197 163840 xfs.1100
        3420832763 176128 xfs.1111

    The md5 output:

        MD5 (xfs.1010) = ac33c55d5242aadd48fb7485bacea12b
        MD5 (xfs.1020) = 8ca2515aeaf6a6838291bc96ad5b41b2
        MD5 (xfs.1100) = 159c5547d0efd51d12e79c7a35c514c4
        MD5 (xfs.1111) = e0896eab16747df27d7c2262041a66c0

    Note: The md5 source is available in HPSBUX9408-016.

    Set "umask 022" and copy the appropriate files to a
    secure directory, for example /.
    Then:

    1. Save the original xfs.

       cp /usr/bin/X11/xfs /usr/bin/X11/xfs.orig

    2. Determine if xfs is running:

       ps -ef | grep xfs

    3. Stop xfs if it is running.

      /sbin/rc2.d/S620xfs stop

    4. Install the appropriate fixed xfs.

      cp /xfs.1010 /usr/bin/X11/xfs   # for 10.10
        or
      cp /xfs.1020 /usr/bin/X11/xfs   # for 10.20 and 10.24
        or
      cp /xfs.1100 /usr/bin/X11/xfs   # for 11.00 and 11.04
        or
      cp /xfs.1111 /usr/bin/X11/xfs   # for 11.11 and 11.22

    5. If xfs had been stopped in step 3, restart it.

      /sbin/rc2.d/S620xfs start

  <http://bvlive01.iss.net/issEn/delivery/xforce/alertdetail.jsp?oid=21541>

CERT assigned the following CVE candidates to this vulnerability:
<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2002-1317>

SGI has investigated the issue and recommends the following steps for
neutralizing the exposure.  It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that these measures be
implemented on ALL vulnerable SGI systems.

This issue has been corrected in IRIX 6.5.14 and later versions.

- --------------
- --- Impact ---
- --------------

The /usr/bin/X11/xfs binary is installed by default on IRIX 6.5 systems as
part of x\_eoe.sw.Server.

To determine the version of IRIX you are running, execute the following
command:

  # /bin/uname -R

That will return a result similar to the following:

  # 6.5 6.5.16f

The first number ("6.5") is the release name, the second ("6.5.16f" in this
case) is the extended release name.  The extended release name is the
"version" we refer to throughout this document.

This vulnerability can be exploited by a remote user (no account on the
local machine is required), and can result in the remote user gaining root
access.

- ----------------------------
- --- Temporary Workaround ---
- ----------------------------

SGI understands that there are times when upgrading the operating system or
installing patches are inconvenient or not possible.  In those instances, we
recommend the following workaround:

   # chkconfig fontserver off

   # /etc/init.d/fontserver stop

Of course, you will no longer have the services of the font server available
after doing this.

SGI recommends upgrading to IRIX 6.5.14 or later as a permanent fix for this
problem.

- ----------------
- --- Solution ---
- ----------------

SGI has not provided patches for this vulnerability. Our recommendation is
to upgrade to IRIX 6.5.14 or later.

## History

The CERT Division is the birthplace of cybersecurity. For nearly 30 years, the CERT Division of the SEI has partnered with government, industry, law enforcement, and academia to advance cybersecurity and improve the security and resilience of computer systems and networks.

Originally focused on incident response, we have expanded into cybersecurity areas such as network situational awareness, malicious code analysis, secure coding, resilience management, insider threats, digital investigations and intelligence, workforce development, DevOps, forensics, software assurance, vulnerability discovery and analysis, and risk management.

## Former Director Richard Pethia

[Richard Pethia](/about/leadership/display.cfm?customel_datapageid_2623=3545) was founding director of the SEI's CERT Division. Pethia, who served as director of CERT from 1988 to 2016, guided the organization through tremendous growth and change. Under Pethia's leadership, the unit expanded and evolved from the CERT Coordination Center—a small group focused on computer incident response—to a research organization of more than 200 professionals dedicated to solving problems with widespread cybersecurity implications.
