Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in Novell iManager's eMFrame component.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability occurs when a Distinguished Name (DN) longer than 255 characters is provided as a user login name.
- The eMFrame application does not properly validate the length of the DN before processing it, leading to a buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exploiting this vulnerability causes the eMFrame application to terminate.
- This can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the login process of iManager's eMFrame component.
- An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by providing a specially crafted, overly long Distinguished Name during login.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to attempt a login to iManager's eMFrame interface.
- The attacker must know or be able to construct a Distinguished Name longer than 255 characters.

**Additional Details:**
- The maximum length for the DN attribute in eDirectory 8.6 and above is 256 characters.
- The vulnerability affects iManager (eMFrame) versions prior to 1.5.
- A patch was released to address the issue. However, it is not recommended to apply the patch if iManager 1.5 has been previously installed.
