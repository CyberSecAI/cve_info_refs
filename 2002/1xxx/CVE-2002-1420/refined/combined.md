## OpenBSD contains buffer overflow in "select" call

#### Vulnerability Note VU#259787

Original Release Date: 2002-08-15 | Last Revised: 2002-12-13

---

### Overview

A locally exploitable buffer overflow exists in all versions of [OpenBSD](http://www.openbsd.org/).

### Description

| The buffer overflow exists in the [select(2) system call](http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=select&sektion=2). The overflow occurs if select is supplied with arbitrary negative values. |
| --- |

### Impact

| Local users can gain system privileges and execute code in the context of the kernel. |
| --- |

### Solution

| From the [OpenBSD Security Advisory](http://online.securityfocus.com/advisories/4374): "Apply one of the supplied kernel patches or update to 3.0-stable or 3.1-stable from 2002-08-11 17:00 EDT or later." |

### [Openwall GNU/\*/Linux](#IAFY-5DTGRF) Not Affected

Updated:  September 09, 2002

### Status

Not Affected

### Vendor Statement

Openwall GNU/\*/Linux is not vulnerable. In fact, none of Linux 2.0, 2.2, and 2.4 are. As the corresponding limits are configurable on 2.2 and 2.4 and in order to be safe in case of future code changes, we're, however, also adding redundant defensive hard-coded limits right into both select(2) and poll(2).

More detail:

Linux 2.0 only has select(2) and a hard-coded limit.

Linux 2.2 and 2.4 have both calls and configurable limits, but expand\_fd\_array() and expand\_fdset() wouldn't let files->max\_fds and files->max\_fdset grow beyond a defensive hard-coded limit, even if a higher limit has been set via procfs or sysctl. And it's precisely files->max\_fds and files->max\_fdset which are used by select(2) and poll(2).

### Vendor Information

The vendor has not provided us with any further information regarding this vulnerability.

### Addendum

The CERT/CC has no additional comments at this time.

If you have feedback, comments, or additional information about this vulnerability, please send us email.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

OpenBSD Security Advisory (adv.select)
Original Release Date: 2002-08-11

1. Systems affected:

        All versions of OpenBSD.

2. Overview:

	Insufficient boundary checks in the select call allow an
	attacker to overwrite kernel memory and execute arbitrary code
	in kernel context.

	Traditionally, the size parameter for the select system call
	is a signed integer.  As a result, the kernel evaluates the
	upper boundary checks in a signed context, so that an attacker
	can circumvent when using certain negative values.

	When the kernel copies the data for the select system call
	from userland the size is used as an unsigned integer which
	causes kernel memory to be overwritten with arbitrary data.

2. Impact:

        Local users can obtain complete system privileges and
        circumvent the extra security measures provided by the
        securelevel system.

3. Solution:

        Apply one of the supplied kernel patches or update to
        3.0-stable or 3.1-stable from 2002-08-11 17:00 EDT or later.

4. Patch:
