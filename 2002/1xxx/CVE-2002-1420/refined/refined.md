Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2002-1420 (Although this ID is explicitly mentioned in the CERT/CC document, this response is based on the information in the documents that refers to the vulnerability in OpenBSD select(2) call, which is what CVE-2002-1420 is about).

**Root Cause:**
- The `select(2)` system call in OpenBSD incorrectly handles negative values for its size parameter.
- The kernel performs boundary checks on the size parameter in a *signed* context. This allows an attacker to circumvent checks by using specific negative values.
- However, the kernel then uses the size parameter as an *unsigned* integer when copying data from user space. This results in an out-of-bounds write leading to a buffer overflow.

**Vulnerabilities:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The core issue is a buffer overflow vulnerability within the `select(2)` system call.
- **Incorrect Data Type Handling:**  The size parameter was interpreted as both a signed and unsigned integer in different parts of the kernel. This inconsistency allowed attackers to bypass boundary checks leading to the buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Local Privilege Escalation:** A local user could exploit this to gain complete system privileges (root access).
- **Kernel Code Execution:** The attacker could overwrite kernel memory and execute arbitrary code within the kernel's context, potentially bypassing security measures like securelevel.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Exploitation:** The vulnerability is exploitable by local users.
- **System Call Manipulation:** The attack vector is via the `select(2)` system call by providing carefully crafted negative values for the size parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have local access to a vulnerable OpenBSD system.
- The attacker needs the ability to execute code on the system. They don't need any special privileges initially, as the vulnerability allows for privilege escalation.

**Additional Details:**

* The vulnerability was reported by Niels Provos.
* The issue exists in all versions of OpenBSD prior to the patches released on August 11, 2002.
* Patches were made available by OpenBSD to fix this issue.

This detailed information is consistent with the CVE description for CVE-2002-1420 which is a buffer overflow vulnerability in OpenBSD's select system call due to incorrect handling of the size argument, allowing a local user to gain root privileges.
