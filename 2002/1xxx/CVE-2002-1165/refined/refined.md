Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability lies in how Sendmail's Restricted Shell (SMRSH) parses and validates commands, specifically within the `smrsh.c` code. Two methods were identified:

*   **Method One:** Exploits the `||` command implementation. SMRSH checks for a valid path (`.`) before the `||` but doesn't validate the path after it, allowing execution of arbitrary commands.
*   **Method Two:**  A parsing flaw where specific command sequences (like `/ command`, `../ command`, `./ command`, `././ command`) are internally converted to a space, bypassing filters, while still being executed by `/bin/sh -c`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** SMRSH lacks proper validation of command sequences, allowing specially crafted input to bypass restrictions.
*   **Logical Flaws in Command Parsing:** The handling of the `||` operator and path resolution logic is flawed, leading to the bypass.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the target system with the privileges of the user running sendmail.
*   **Local Privilege Escalation:** On systems with restricted shell access, this vulnerability allows users to elevate their privileges by executing commands that would otherwise be prohibited.
*  **Bypassing SMRSH restrictions:** The core purpose of SMRSH is to restrict the commands that sendmail can execute. This vulnerability completely undermines that.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **`.forward` File Modification:** Attackers can insert malicious command sequences into their `.forward` file, which will be processed by Sendmail through SMRSH when emails are routed for that user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Account:** Attackers must have a valid local user account on the system.
*   **File Creation (for Method One):** Attackers must be able to create files in order to use the first method of attack.
*   **`.forward` File Modification:** The attacker must be able to modify their own .forward file

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in smrsh versions packaged with Sendmail 8.12.6 and Sendmail 8.11.6-15 (default install of Redhat 7.3).
*   Older versions of SMRSH (8.11 5/19/1998) and the version available at `ftp://ftp.uu.net/pub/security/smrsh` are not vulnerable.
*   A patch addressing the issue is available at `http://www.sendmail.org/patches/smrsh-20020924.patch`.
