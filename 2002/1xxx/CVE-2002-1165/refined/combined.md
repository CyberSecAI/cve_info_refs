# Sendmail Open Source

## Email Security and Threat Protection

---

The sendmail Sentrion platform is specifically designed for large, complex environments, but we make a subset of that solution available as an open-source offering. Sentrion is not for everyone, but if you are using open source email for a large complex environment and need an enterprise platform that will enable your messaging roadmap for years to come (virtualization, consolidation, cloud migration, etc.), [speak with a specialist](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/contact) to see if Sendmail Sentrion is right for you.

[Frequently Asked Questions](/us/sendmail/faq)

### Current Sendmail Open Source Release

Sendmail [8.18.1](https://ftp.sendmail.org/sendmail.8.18.1.tar.gz) is available from [ftp.sendmail.org](https://ftp.sendmail.org/). The release has a [gzipped tar](https://ftp.sendmail.org/sendmail.8.18.1.tar.gz) file and a [PGP signature](https://ftp.sendmail.org/sendmail.8.18.1.tar.gz.sig) file. The compressed/gzipped tar files are [signed](#Signing_Keys) by the [2024 signing key](https://www.proofpoint.com/sites/default/files/signing-keys/sendmail2024.asc). See the Security and PGP Signing Keys section for more information about how releases are signed.

### Signing Keys

Security advisories are issued by The Computer Emergency Response Team [CERT](http://www.cert.org/). Sendmail server related security problems should be sent to:

**sendmail-security-*YYYY*@support.sendmail.org**

Replace YYYY with the current year, e.g., 2015. This address is only for reporting security problems in sendmail. When reporting security problems, please use PGP-the public key is available in the file PGPKEYS of the sendmail distribution.

**Please do not use this address to report problems that are not related to the security of the sendmail server.**Questions about [avoiding spam risk](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-reference/spam), how to set up your own certificate authorities, etc. should be posted in comp.mail.sendmail, and Unix-related security in the comp.security.unix newsgroup.

All sendmail distributions are signed with a PGP key named "Sendmail Signing Key/*YYYY*" where *YYYY* is the year of release.

### Contact Us

These addresses are for contributing patches or reporting problems about V8 sendmail. The members of these lists do not have the resources to support vendor versions. Before sending to any of these addresses, please check the [FAQ](/us/sendmail/faq "Sendmail FAQ") and the files README, sendmail/README (on this web-site as Compiling Sendmail) and cf/README (on this web-site as the Configuration README pages) to see if they are already answered; about half of the questions received can be answered in this way.

**Notes**

* Do not send us mail in HTML format, use plain text only (even multipart/alternative with an HTML part will be classified as spam by some of our members and hence an answer will most likely be delayed).
* Do not use 8bit characters in the Subject: nor use some encoding, e.g., =?GB2312?B?, but only plain 7bit ASCII without any charset encoding.
* If you send e-mail to sendmail.org, the answer will most likely not come from a system in the sendmail.org domain. If you use some anti-spam techniques (e.g., challenge-response systems) or you block hosts that are connected via DSL then please do not expect an answer. More and more often replies are blocked which is very annoying. Do not block this address or make sure that your system accepts at least STARTTLS secured mail. A list of IPs is available in the sendmail.org SPF record.
* If you use a challenge/response system, make sure that it does NOT send us a challenge when we reply to your question or when you receive mail from the announce list. We will not reply to those annoying mails.
* If you are using the blacklist from spamlist.org then please do not send us e-mail, the reply of the sendmail maintainer will not reach you.
* Do not send us mail in proprietary formats.
* The mailservers for support.sendmail.org now (2004-11-24) use the following DNSBLs:
  + sbl-xbl.spamhaus.org
  + dnsbl.sorbs.net
  + list.dsbl.org
  + bl.spamcop.net
* The mailserver for support.sendmail.org performs strict RFC checks, for example, it does not accept mail if the domain part has an [MX record](/us/threat-reference/mx-record "MX Record") that points to an IP address (instead of hostname as required).

If you have a question about sendmail, then please post it to the Usenet group comp.mail.sendmail. This newsgroup is dedicated to sendmail. Please make sure you check the usual resources before posting and follow the netiquette.

E-mail addresses to contact sendmail.org are (do *not* send questions about sendmail to these addresses, see above instead; replace YYYY with the current year, e.g., 2006, in all of these addresses):

* sendmail-YYYY@support.sendmail.org for contributing patches, feature requests, and general comments but not questions how to use, install, or configure sendmail;
* sendmail-bugs-YYYY@support.sendmail.org to report implementation bugs;
* sendmail-faq-YYYY@support.sendmail.org only for comments / questions about the FAQ. Please mark your mail clearly with "FAQ: item" where item is the entry in the faq to which you are referring. If it is a general comment about the FAQ, use "FAQ: general", if it is an addition, use "FAQ: new".
* sendmail-security-YYYY@support.sendmail.org (use this only to report related bugs or problems in sendmail). Please do not use this to ask about problems with your configuration, including how to stop spam, how to set up your own certificate authority, how to make sendmail work with S/MIME, etc. All such questions should be asked in comp.mail.sendmail. Also, please do not tell us that you were able to forge mail by using telnet to connect to port 25; this is fundamental to the Internet design for [SMTP](/us/threat-reference/smtp-relay "SMTP Relay"), and not a sendmail bug. Please use encryption to send mail to this address.
* sendmail-mirror-YYYY@support.sendmail.org for updates about a mirror (e.g., a new mirror or an address change).
* webmaster-YYYY@support.sendmail.org for comments about the website.

These are not open lists, meaning that subscription is by invitation only.

### DKIM

The [Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM)](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/corporate-blog/post/what-is-dkim) Internet standard enables email senders to digitally sign their messages so that receivers can verify that those messages have not been forged. The DKIM sender authentication scheme allows the recipient of a message to confirm a message originated with the sender’s domain and that the message content has not been altered. A cryptography-based solution, DKIM provides businesses an industry-standard method for mitigating [email fraud](/us/products/email-protection/email-fraud-defense "Email Fraud Defense") and [protecting an organization’s brand](/us/solutions/digital-risk/digital-brand-protection "Digital Brand Protection") and reputation at a relatively low implementation cost.

DKIM has been approved by the IETF as a draft standard (RFC 4871). The protocol was developed through the cooperation of Sendmail, Cisco Systems and Yahoo!

Since being approved by the IETF, a new open source project was started. The OpenDKIM Project is a community effort to develop and maintain a C library for producing DKIM-aware applications and an open source milter for providing DKIM service.

The project started from a code fork of version 2.8.3 of the open source [dkim-milter](http://sourceforge.net/projects/dkim-milter/) package developed and maintained by Sendmail, Inc.

The Sendmail [Sentrion Message Processing Engine](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/products/email-protection/open-source-email-solution) comes standard with OpenDKIM. More information is available at [opendkim.org](http://opendkim.org/) and [dkim.org](http://dkim.org/)

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

iDEFENSE Security Advisory 10.01.02
Sendmail smrsh bypass vulnerabilities

DESCRIPTION

It is possible for an attacker to bypass the restrictions imposed by
The Sendmail Consortiums Restricted Shell (SMRSH) and execute a
binary of his choosing by inserting a special character sequence into
his .forward file.  SMRSH is an application intended as a replacement
for sh for use in Sendmail. There are two attack methods both of
which are detailed below.

METHOD ONE
This method takes advantage of the application's implementation of
the
'||' command. The process is best explained with an example:

$ echo "echo unauthorized execute" > /tmp/unauth
$ smrsh -c ". || . /tmp/unauth || ."
  /bin/sh: /etc/smrsh/.: is a directory
  unauthorized execute

/tmp/unauth is executed despite the fact that it is not located in
the SMRSH restricted directory /etc/smrsh. This happens because SMRSH
first checks for '.', which exists, and does no further verification
on the files listed after '||'. The same attack would look like the
following in the attackers .forward file:

"| . \|| . /tmp/unauth \|| ."

METHOD TWO
This method takes advantage of the following routine from smrsh.c:

    /* search backwards for last / (allow for 0200 bit) */
    while (cmd > q)
    {
            if ((*--cmd & 0177) == '/')
            {
                    cmd++;
                    break;
            }
    }

It is possible to feed SMRSH a command line that will be internally
converted to a space thereby bypassing all filters, yet will still
execute. Examples of these include:

    smrsh -c "/ command"
    smrsh -c "../ command"
    smrsh -c "./ command"
    smrsh -c "././ command"

The listed routine will convert any of the above examples to a space.
However, when the following execle() call is reached:

(void) execle("/bin/sh", "/bin/sh", "-c", newcmdbuf, NULL, newenv);

SMRSH will execute:

/bin/sh -c  command

Notice that despite the double space command will still execute.
The .forward variation of this attack works the same way.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name CAN-2002-1165 to this issue.

ANALYSIS

The following are required conditions for successful and meaningful
exploitation of this vulnerability:

- - -	The target system must be utilizing SMRSH.
- - -	The attacker must have a valid local account on the system.
- - -	In method one the attacker must be able to create files.

While this exploit obviously removes the restrictions imposed by
SMRSH it also allows users to execute programs on systems that they
do not have shell access to. Utilizing either of the above-described
methods, an attacker who can modify his own .forward file can execute
arbitrary commands on the target system with the privileges of his
own account. Systems that forbid shell access generally do not have
tightened local security, the ability to execute arbitrary commands
through the SMRSH vulnerablity opens the target system to local
privilege escalation attacks that otherwise would not be possible.

DETECTION
The latest versions of SMRSH are vulnerable. Including the version
packaged with Sendmail 8.12.6 and Sendmail 8.11.6-15 (default install
of Redhat 7.3). Older versions of SMRSH do not appear to be
vulnerable (8.11 5/19/1998). The version of SMRSH available at
ftp://ftp.uu.net/pub/security/smrsh is also not vulnerable.

WORKAROUND
Sendmail.org has provided a patch addressing the above-described
issues.
The patch is available for download at
<http://www.sendmail.org/patches/smrsh-20020924.patch>.

VENDOR FIX/RESPONSE

Sendmail.org's official comment:

"We would like to thank iDEFENSE, zen-parse, and Pedram Amini for
bringing these problems to our attention.

If you actually use a vulnerable smrsh version (which can be tested
according to the descriptions given before), please apply the patch
that has been made available. To figure out whether your
configuration
uses smrsh, check your sendmail.mc file, i.e., look for

FEATURE(`smrsh')

and check your sendmail.cf file (usually located in /etc/mail or
/etc):

grep '^Mprog.*smrsh' sendmail.cf

Also consider whether you actually need this feature, e.g., if you
make procmail available to your users then smrsh is basically
useless."
