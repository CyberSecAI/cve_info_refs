The content is related to the vulnerability described in CVE-2002-1338.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `Load` method of the Microsoft Office Web Components (OWC) Chart component opens files specified by a Uniform Resource Index (URI) without proper validation. It attempts to open local files specified in the URI.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of URI validation in the `Load` method of the OWC Chart component.
- The method does not return an error if a file exists on the specified path, but returns one if the file does not exist. This behavior can be abused to test for file existence.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A malicious script can determine the existence of arbitrary files on the client's filesystem by testing if the `Load` method returns an error or not. This allows the attacker to learn about the victim's file system. This can also include accessible network drives.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious webpage containing a script that utilizes the OWC Chart component.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a webpage with malicious javascript that is visited by the victim.
- The victim must have Microsoft Office Web Components installed and enabled for scripting in their browser.
