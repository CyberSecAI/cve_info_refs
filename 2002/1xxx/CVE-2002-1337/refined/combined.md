GENTOO LINUX SECURITY ANNOUNCEMENT 200303-4
- - ---------------------------------------------------------------------

          PACKAGE : sendmail
          SUMMARY : remote root exploit
             DATE : 2003-03-04 10:12 UTC
          EXPLOIT : remote
VERSIONS AFFECTED : <8.12.8
    FIXED VERSION : =>8.12.8
              CVE : CAN-2002-1337

- - ---------------------------------------------------------------------

- From advisory:

"Attackers may remotely exploit this vulnerability to gain "root" or
superuser control of any vulnerable Sendmail server. Sendmail and all
other email servers are typically exposed to the Internet in order to
send and receive Internet email. Vulnerable Sendmail servers will not be
protected by legacy security devices such as firewalls and/or packet
filters. This vulnerability is especially dangerous because the exploit
can be delivered within an email message and the attacker doesn't need
any specific knowledge of the target to launch a successful attack."

Read the full advisory at:
<http://www.iss.net/issEn/delivery/xforce/alertdetail.jsp?oid=21950>

SOLUTION

It is recommended that all Gentoo Linux users who are running
net-mail/sendmail upgrade to sendmail-8.12.8 as follows:

emerge sync
emerge -u sendmail
emerge clean

     Make a backup copy of the existing sendmail:

        cd /usr/sbin
        cp sendmail sendmail.original

     Note the permissions for reference:

        ls -lia /usr/sbin/sendmail

     Install the new sendmail:

        cp sendmail.xxx.yy.zz sendmail

     For example, on 11.22:

        cp sendmail.811.11.22 sendmail

 -----------------------------------------------------------------
NOTICE: There are no restrictions for distribution of this Bulletin
provided that it remains complete and intact.

The information in the following Security Bulletin should be
acted upon as soon as possible.  Hewlett-Packard Company will
not be liable for any consequences to any customer resulting
from customer's failure to fully implement instructions in this

 ------------------------------------------------------------------
PROBLEM: Potential buffer overflow in XDR library.

IMPACT: Potential unauthorized access, denial of service.

    PLATFORM: HP 9000 Series 700 and 800 10.20, 10.24, 11.00,
              11.04, 11.11, and 11.22

 **REVISED 04**
SOLUTION: Until patches are available manually install the
          appropriate fixed libraries.
          Install PHCO_27882 for 10.24.
 -->>     Install PHNE_28102 for 11.00.
 -->>     Install PHNE_28103 for 11.11.

MANUAL ACTIONS: Yes - NonUpdate
                Install the appropriate fixed libraries.
                Install PHCO_27882 for 10.24.
 -->>           Install PHNE_28102 for 11.00.
 -->>           Install PHNE_28103 for 11.11.
                Relink any archived programs that call
                xdr_array().

AVAILABILITY:  This bulletin will be updated when patches are
               available.

CHANGE SUMMARY: Rev.01 - corrected "strings" to "strings -a"
                Rev.02 - added 10.24 and 11.04, also added libc.1
                         for 11.00, 11.11, and 11.22.
                Rev.03 - corrected scripts
                Rev.04 - patches are available for 11.00 and 11.11.
 ------------------------------------------------------------------
 A. Background
    CERT Advisory CA-2002-25 reports an integer overflow in
    certain implementations of XDR libraries.  Libraries supplied
    with HP-UX 10.20, 10.24, 11,00, 11.04, 11.11, and 11.22 are
    potentially vulnerable.

    In addition, cross-reference:
    HP Tru64 UNIX: Case id: SSRT2309 rpc XDR_ARRAY
       A solution is available as noted in the recent
       security bulletin SSSRT2275 at
       <http://thenew.hp.com/country/us/eng/support.html>
       Use the SEARCH IN feature box, enter SSRT2275 in the
       search window.

 B. Recommended solution
    Until patches are released, download and manually install
    the appropriate libraries.

    Note:  It will be necessary to relink any programs that
    call xdr_array() and are linked with archived libraries.
    There are no known programs supplied by HP which need to
    be relinked.  To test an archived program:

       strings -a suspect_program | grep xdr_array:

    If the command above returns "xdr_array: out of memory"
    the suspect_program will need to the relinked with a
    fixed library.

    Download the appropriate files from:

     System:    hprc.external.hp.com  (192.170.19.51)
     Login:     xdr
     Password:  xdr1

     FTP Access: ftp://xdr:xdr1@hprc.external.hp.com/
             or: ftp://xdr:xdr1@192.170.19.51/

      Note: There is an ftp defect in IE5 that may result in
            a browser hang.  To work around this:
      - Select Tools -> Internet Options -> Advanced
      - Un-check the option: [ ] Enable folder view for FTP sites.

     The files are:

        PHCO_26152.depot.gz

        libc.1.gz
        libc.1.PHCO_27882.gz

        libnsl.1.32_11.00.gz
        libnsl.a.32_11.00.gz
        libnsl.1.64_11.00.gz

        libnsl.so.1.32_11.22.IA.gz
        libnsl.so.1.64_11.22.IA.gz

    The cksum output:

        2238979170 9676800 PHCO_26152.depot
        3415580416 1867776 libc.1
        1011129778 1814528 libc.1.PHCO_27882

        3064646304 679936 libnsl.1.32_11.00
        498505157 817544 libnsl.a.32_11.00
        2630827583 648296 libnsl.1.64_11.00
        2205456871 1454504 libnsl.a.64_11.00

        2227616066 1490048 libnsl.so.1.32_11.22.IA
        3162410426 1564768 libnsl.so.1.64_11.22.IA

      Note:  The patches which supply the libc and libnsl
             libraries require that the system be rebooted.
             It would be best to carry out the manual
             installation below in init state 2 followed
             by a reboot.  Otherwise programs which were
             running when the libraries were changed would
             continue to use the old version of the libraries.

      Copy the appropriate files to a secure directory,
      for example /.  Then,

      For 10.20
      ====================================
      Install PHCO_26152.depot:
      swinstall -x autoreboot=true -x match_target=true \
                        -s /PHCO_26152.depot

      Any applications that use the RPC/XDR APIs in libc.a
      must be relinked and restarted.

      For 10.24
      ====================================
      Install PHCO_27882.  This patch is available from
      the itrc.

**REVISED 04**
      For 11.00
      ====================================
 -->> Install PHCO_28102.  This patch is available from

**REVISED 04**
      For 11.11
      ====================================

## History

The CERT Division is the birthplace of cybersecurity. For nearly 30 years, the CERT Division of the SEI has partnered with government, industry, law enforcement, and academia to advance cybersecurity and improve the security and resilience of computer systems and networks.

Originally focused on incident response, we have expanded into cybersecurity areas such as network situational awareness, malicious code analysis, secure coding, resilience management, insider threats, digital investigations and intelligence, workforce development, DevOps, forensics, software assurance, vulnerability discovery and analysis, and risk management.

## Former Director Richard Pethia

[Richard Pethia](/about/leadership/display.cfm?customel_datapageid_2623=3545) was founding director of the SEI's CERT Division. Pethia, who served as director of CERT from 1988 to 2016, guided the organization through tremendous growth and change. Under Pethia's leadership, the unit expanded and evolved from the CERT Coordination Center—a small group focused on computer incident response—to a research organization of more than 200 professionals dedicated to solving problems with widespread cybersecurity implications.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

Sendmail, Inc., and the Sendmail Consortium announce the availability
of sendmail 8.12.8.  It contains a fix for a critical security
problem discovered by Mark Dowd of ISS X-Force; we thank ISS X-Force
for bringing this problem to our attention.  Sendmail urges all users to
either upgrade to sendmail 8.12.8 or apply the patch for 8.12 that
is part of this announcement.  Patches for older versions can be
downloaded from ftp.sendmail.org, see <http://www.sendmail.org/> for
details.  Remember to check the PGP signatures of patches or releases
obtained.  For those not running the open source version, check
with your vendor for a patch.  There is a bug fix for ident parsing
in 8.12.8.  While this is not believed to be exploitable, if you
are not upgrading to 8.12.8, you may want to turn off ident checking
by adding this to your .mc file:

define(`confTO_IDENT', `0s')

For a complete list of changes see the release notes down below.

Please send bug reports to sendmail-bugs@sendmail.org as usual.

Note: We have changed the way we digitally sign the source code
distributions to simplify verification: in contrast to earlier
versions two .sig files are provided, one each for the gzip'ed
version and the compressed version. That is, instead of signing the
tar file, we sign the compressed/gzip'ed files, so you do not need
to uncompress the file before checking the signature.

This version can be found at

ftp://ftp.sendmail.org/pub/sendmail/sendmail.8.12.8.tar.gz
ftp://ftp.sendmail.org/pub/sendmail/sendmail.8.12.8.tar.gz.sig
ftp://ftp.sendmail.org/pub/sendmail/sendmail.8.12.8.tar.Z
ftp://ftp.sendmail.org/pub/sendmail/sendmail.8.12.8.tar.Z.sig

and the usual mirror sites.

MD5 signatures:

71b4ce8276536b82d4acdf6ec8be306a sendmail.8.12.8.tar.gz
2ecf7890c2ff5035aed8d342473d85a5 sendmail.8.12.8.tar.gz.sig
b06953b5fd11f9cd63b1eb89625ad881 sendmail.8.12.8.tar.Z
b505fc5b36fbba5b3af2afecb4d587b3 sendmail.8.12.8.tar.Z.sig

You either need the first two files or the third and fourth, i.e.,
the gzip'ed version or the compressed version and the corresponding
.sig file.  The PGP signature was created using the Sendmail Signing
Key/2003, available on the web site (<http://www.sendmail.org/>) or
on the public key servers.

Since sendmail 8.11 and later includes hooks to cryptography, the
following information from OpenSSL applies to sendmail as well.

   PLEASE REMEMBER THAT EXPORT/IMPORT AND/OR USE OF STRONG CRYPTOGRAPHY
   SOFTWARE, PROVIDING CRYPTOGRAPHY HOOKS OR EVEN JUST COMMUNICATING
   TECHNICAL DETAILS ABOUT CRYPTOGRAPHY SOFTWARE IS ILLEGAL IN SOME
   PARTS OF THE WORLD.  SO, WHEN YOU IMPORT THIS PACKAGE TO YOUR
   COUNTRY, RE-DISTRIBUTE IT FROM THERE OR EVEN JUST EMAIL TECHNICAL
   SUGGESTIONS OR EVEN SOURCE PATCHES TO THE AUTHOR OR OTHER PEOPLE
   YOU ARE STRONGLY ADVISED TO PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO ANY EXPORT/IMPORT
   AND/OR USE LAWS WHICH APPLY TO YOU. THE AUTHORS ARE NOT LIABLE FOR
   ANY VIOLATIONS YOU MAKE HERE. SO BE CAREFUL, IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY.

			SENDMAIL RELEASE NOTES
      $Id: RELEASE_NOTES,v 8.1340.2.113 2003/02/11 19:17:41 gshapiro Exp $

This listing shows the version of the sendmail binary, the version
of the sendmail configuration files, the date of release, and a
summary of the changes in that release.

8.12.8/8.12.8	2003/02/11
	SECURITY: Fix a remote buffer overflow in header parsing by
		dropping sender and recipient header comments if the
		comments are too long.  Problem noted by Mark Dowd
		of ISS X-Force.
	Fix a potential non-exploitable buffer overflow in parsing the
		.cf queue settings and potential buffer underflow in
		parsing ident responses.  Problem noted by Yichen Xie of
		Stanford University Compilation Group.
	Fix ETRN #queuegroup command: actually start a queue run for
		the selected queue group.  Problem noted by Jos Vos.
	If MaxMimeHeaderLength is set and a malformed MIME header is fixed,
		log the fixup as "Fixed MIME header" instead of "Truncated
		MIME header".  Problem noted by Ian J Hart.
	CONFIG: Fix regression bug in proto.m4 that caused a bogus
		error message: "FEATURE() should be before MAILER()".
	MAIL.LOCAL: Be more explicit in some error cases, i.e., whether
		a mailbox has more than one link or whether it is not
		a regular file.  Patch from John Beck of Sun Microsystems.

Instructions to extract and apply patch for sendmail 8.12:

The data below is a uuencoded, gzip'ed tar file.  Store the data
between "========= begin patch ========" and "========= end patch
==========" into a file called "patch.sm" and apply the following
command:

uudecode -p < patch.sm | gunzip -c | tar -xf -

This will give you two files:

sendmail.8.12.security.cr.patch
sendmail.8.12.security.cr.patch.sig

Check the integrity of the patch file using PGP or GPG, e.g.,

gpg --verify sendmail.8.12.security.cr.patch.sig sendmail.8.12.security.cr.patch

Then apply the patch to the sendmail source code:

cd sendmail-8.12.7
patch -p0 < sendmail.8.12.security.cr.patch

recompile sendmail, and install the new binary.

========= begin patch ========

# Sendmail Open Source

## Email Security and Threat Protection

---

The sendmail Sentrion platform is specifically designed for large, complex environments, but we make a subset of that solution available as an open-source offering. Sentrion is not for everyone, but if you are using open source email for a large complex environment and need an enterprise platform that will enable your messaging roadmap for years to come (virtualization, consolidation, cloud migration, etc.), [speak with a specialist](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/contact) to see if Sendmail Sentrion is right for you.

[Frequently Asked Questions](/us/sendmail/faq)

### Current Sendmail Open Source Release

Sendmail [8.18.1](https://ftp.sendmail.org/sendmail.8.18.1.tar.gz) is available from [ftp.sendmail.org](https://ftp.sendmail.org/). The release has a [gzipped tar](https://ftp.sendmail.org/sendmail.8.18.1.tar.gz) file and a [PGP signature](https://ftp.sendmail.org/sendmail.8.18.1.tar.gz.sig) file. The compressed/gzipped tar files are [signed](#Signing_Keys) by the [2024 signing key](https://www.proofpoint.com/sites/default/files/signing-keys/sendmail2024.asc). See the Security and PGP Signing Keys section for more information about how releases are signed.

### Signing Keys

Security advisories are issued by The Computer Emergency Response Team [CERT](http://www.cert.org/). Sendmail server related security problems should be sent to:

**sendmail-security-*YYYY*@support.sendmail.org**

Replace YYYY with the current year, e.g., 2015. This address is only for reporting security problems in sendmail. When reporting security problems, please use PGP-the public key is available in the file PGPKEYS of the sendmail distribution.

**Please do not use this address to report problems that are not related to the security of the sendmail server.**Questions about [avoiding spam risk](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-reference/spam), how to set up your own certificate authorities, etc. should be posted in comp.mail.sendmail, and Unix-related security in the comp.security.unix newsgroup.

All sendmail distributions are signed with a PGP key named "Sendmail Signing Key/*YYYY*" where *YYYY* is the year of release.

### Contact Us

These addresses are for contributing patches or reporting problems about V8 sendmail. The members of these lists do not have the resources to support vendor versions. Before sending to any of these addresses, please check the [FAQ](/us/sendmail/faq "Sendmail FAQ") and the files README, sendmail/README (on this web-site as Compiling Sendmail) and cf/README (on this web-site as the Configuration README pages) to see if they are already answered; about half of the questions received can be answered in this way.

**Notes**

* Do not send us mail in HTML format, use plain text only (even multipart/alternative with an HTML part will be classified as spam by some of our members and hence an answer will most likely be delayed).
* Do not use 8bit characters in the Subject: nor use some encoding, e.g., =?GB2312?B?, but only plain 7bit ASCII without any charset encoding.
* If you send e-mail to sendmail.org, the answer will most likely not come from a system in the sendmail.org domain. If you use some anti-spam techniques (e.g., challenge-response systems) or you block hosts that are connected via DSL then please do not expect an answer. More and more often replies are blocked which is very annoying. Do not block this address or make sure that your system accepts at least STARTTLS secured mail. A list of IPs is available in the sendmail.org SPF record.
* If you use a challenge/response system, make sure that it does NOT send us a challenge when we reply to your question or when you receive mail from the announce list. We will not reply to those annoying mails.
* If you are using the blacklist from spamlist.org then please do not send us e-mail, the reply of the sendmail maintainer will not reach you.
* Do not send us mail in proprietary formats.
* The mailservers for support.sendmail.org now (2004-11-24) use the following DNSBLs:
  + sbl-xbl.spamhaus.org
  + dnsbl.sorbs.net
  + list.dsbl.org
  + bl.spamcop.net
* The mailserver for support.sendmail.org performs strict RFC checks, for example, it does not accept mail if the domain part has an [MX record](/us/threat-reference/mx-record "MX Record") that points to an IP address (instead of hostname as required).

If you have a question about sendmail, then please post it to the Usenet group comp.mail.sendmail. This newsgroup is dedicated to sendmail. Please make sure you check the usual resources before posting and follow the netiquette.

E-mail addresses to contact sendmail.org are (do *not* send questions about sendmail to these addresses, see above instead; replace YYYY with the current year, e.g., 2006, in all of these addresses):

* sendmail-YYYY@support.sendmail.org for contributing patches, feature requests, and general comments but not questions how to use, install, or configure sendmail;
* sendmail-bugs-YYYY@support.sendmail.org to report implementation bugs;
* sendmail-faq-YYYY@support.sendmail.org only for comments / questions about the FAQ. Please mark your mail clearly with "FAQ: item" where item is the entry in the faq to which you are referring. If it is a general comment about the FAQ, use "FAQ: general", if it is an addition, use "FAQ: new".
* sendmail-security-YYYY@support.sendmail.org (use this only to report related bugs or problems in sendmail). Please do not use this to ask about problems with your configuration, including how to stop spam, how to set up your own certificate authority, how to make sendmail work with S/MIME, etc. All such questions should be asked in comp.mail.sendmail. Also, please do not tell us that you were able to forge mail by using telnet to connect to port 25; this is fundamental to the Internet design for [SMTP](/us/threat-reference/smtp-relay "SMTP Relay"), and not a sendmail bug. Please use encryption to send mail to this address.
* sendmail-mirror-YYYY@support.sendmail.org for updates about a mirror (e.g., a new mirror or an address change).
* webmaster-YYYY@support.sendmail.org for comments about the website.

These are not open lists, meaning that subscription is by invitation only.

### DKIM

The [Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM)](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/corporate-blog/post/what-is-dkim) Internet standard enables email senders to digitally sign their messages so that receivers can verify that those messages have not been forged. The DKIM sender authentication scheme allows the recipient of a message to confirm a message originated with the sender’s domain and that the message content has not been altered. A cryptography-based solution, DKIM provides businesses an industry-standard method for mitigating [email fraud](/us/products/email-protection/email-fraud-defense "Email Fraud Defense") and [protecting an organization’s brand](/us/solutions/digital-risk/digital-brand-protection "Digital Brand Protection") and reputation at a relatively low implementation cost.

DKIM has been approved by the IETF as a draft standard (RFC 4871). The protocol was developed through the cooperation of Sendmail, Cisco Systems and Yahoo!

Since being approved by the IETF, a new open source project was started. The OpenDKIM Project is a community effort to develop and maintain a C library for producing DKIM-aware applications and an open source milter for providing DKIM service.

The project started from a code fork of version 2.8.3 of the open source [dkim-milter](http://sourceforge.net/projects/dkim-milter/) package developed and maintained by Sendmail, Inc.

The Sendmail [Sentrion Message Processing Engine](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/products/email-protection/open-source-email-solution) comes standard with OpenDKIM. More information is available at [opendkim.org](http://opendkim.org/) and [dkim.org](http://dkim.org/)

Hello,

We have done some brief analysis of the potential remote Sendmail vulnerability
that has been reported lately. Below you can read about our findings with regard
to this isse. We reserve the right not to be correct in whatever we write below.
This is mainly due to the fact that we did not perform full analysis of this
issue. If this is the case, please correct any statements done by us in this
post.

TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION
The vulnerability is within the crackaddr(char* addr) function defined in the
headers.c file. By properly constructing the from address string and passing it
to the crackaddr function it is possible to overrun the static char buf defined
within this function. This overrun is possible due to the incorrect handling of
the <> brackets chars in the from address string. Whenever the closing > bracket
is encountered in the address string, the value of the buflim pointer (denoting
the end of the buf buffer above which no write should be allowed) is incremented
by 1. But, in the corresponding situation, whenever the opening < bracket is
detected, the buflim value is not changed, although it should be decremented.
And this is where the actual origin of the discussed security vulnerability
lies.

Because every closing bracket must be preceded by the opening one (this is
assured by the anglelev value), we cannot just simply issue the sequence of N
repeated < chars in order to increase the buflim value by N. Unfortunately,
the <> two character sequence must be always used in order to increment the
value of buflim by 1. This simply leads to the following equation which can be
used for calculating the maximum x value by which the value of the buflim
pointer can be incremented above the size of the buf buffer:

        (2 * x) <= (MAXNAME + 1 - 7) + x
        x <= (MAXNAME + 1 - 7)

From the above, it can be seen that the buflim value can go beyond the buf buffer
at maximum by one times of its size (which is 250).

EXPLOITATION
Due to the nature of the overflowed buffer declaration (static), exploitation
of this issue is highly dependant on the way compiler orders the static data in
the data segment. In other words, there must be some usable static data immediately
following our static buf, which when overflowed can disrupt the execution flow of
the sendmail process in such a way thay program counter value can be fully \
controlled.

We have inspected this issue a bit more, and found out that on most Unix systems
the buf buffer is not followed by such data. We base this conclusion upon the
simple fact that we didn't manage to crash sendmail by feeding it with 250
sequences of <> chars in the from address string. This means that this issue does
not seam to be exploitable on them. The following table presents a summary of
our findings:

(p) - patched box

From the table above, you can see that there are however some systems that could
be potentially exploitable. These are RedHat and Slackware Linux. We inspected
the reason of the sendmail crashes on these systems and we have found out that
they were due to the invalid value of the MciCache pointer defined in mci.c
file. We investigated this issue a bit more and managed to successfully exploit
this static buf overrun on Linux Slackware 8.0 systems. We achieved that by properly
constructing the MciCache pointer value and some other pointer values as well.
Specifically, we had to patch:

- static MCI **MciCache pointer value to point to our struct mailer_con_info
  entry,
- struct mailer *mci_mailer pointer value from our MCI entry,
- char *mci_host pointer value from our MCI entry,
- FILE *mci_out pointer value from our MCI entry,

By doing the above patching, we could reach the following execution point in
the sendmail process:

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x400ee94a in _IO_vfprintf (s=0xaabbccdd, format=0x809b773 "%s%s",

    rtld_fini=0x4000ae60 <_dl_fini>, stack_end=0xbffffbdc)
    at ../sysdeps/generic/libc-start.c:92

As you can see, we managed to reach the point where fprintf function call was
done with our value of a FILE* stream pointer.

From this point, we had to do a bit more patching in order to finally seize
control over the sendmail process. Specifically, we used the fact that the
_IO_FILE (or FILE) object is followed by a pointer to a jump table (of pointers
to functions) in GNU libc. This simply lead us to the following patching scheme:

- pointer value of a stream parameter passed to the fprintf call was patched, so
  that it pointed to our FILE object,
- int _flags field from the FILE object, was patched so that its 0x08 bit was
  cleared,
- signed char _vtable_offset value was patched, so that along with the
  struct _IO_jump_t *vtable it caused that our jump table was accesssed for file
  IO operations,
- _IO_xsputn_t __xsputn function pointer value was patched, so that it contained
  the value which we wanted to have in program counter register.

By doing this additional FILE object related patching, we were able to reach the
following execution point in the sendmail process:

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0xaabbccdd in ?? ()
(gdb) where
#0  0xaabbccdd in ?? ()
#1  0x400f7047 in fprintf (stream=0xbfffa260, format=0x809b773 "%s%s")
    at fprintf.c:32
#2  0x8084ff8 in smtpmessage ()
#3  0x80847ac in smtpquit ()
#4  0x8069e89 in mci_uncache ()
#5  0x8069f14 in mci_flush ()
#6  0x804e0b9 in finis ()
#7  0x8073042 in dowork ()
#8  0x807f9bc in smtp ()
#9  0x804da8e in main ()
#10 0x400c19cb in __libc_start_main (main=0x804ac00 <main>, argc=3,
    argv=0xbffffbe4, init=0x804a07c <_init>, fini=0x808918c <_fini>,
    rtld_fini=0x4000ae60 <_dl_fini>, stack_end=0xbffffbdc)
    at ../sysdeps/generic/libc-start.c:92

In a result, we were able to redirect sendmail program execution to any arbitrary
location (our code in particular).

We wrote simple proof of concept code for Linux Slackware 8.0 that does all
of the above. It can be found at the end of this post. The code was written in
such a way so that all of the patching is done almost automatically. The user
does not explixitly specify the locations within the patching buffer - they
are found on the fly upon the knowledge about the beginning location of the patched
buffer and its structure (free/occupied slots). We decided to do the patching in
such a way in order to avoid dealing with illegal characters in the patching
pointers. We also wanted to extend the chance of hitting the table of pointers
to our MCI entries (we wanted to have as many of them as possible in the
patching buf, and all of them in one continuous area). By doing this, we could
reduce the need to brute force the MciCache pointer value several times (from
4-10).

As for some other issues regarding the sendmail vulnerability exploitation, it
should be mentioned that the user provided from address string can trigger the
overrun in two cases. The first one is when this string is provided directly
in a MAIL FROM smtp command, the second one is when it is provided in the
message body (as the extended From: header field). However, this second way of
triggering the overflow seem to be more adventageous, as there is much more room
available for the from address string contained in the message body than the
smtp command (about 2k contrary to 256 bytes). There are also some restrictions
imposed on the from address string when it is provided in the smtp command in
sendmail 8.12.x and above, which cannot be simply avoided (in order to pass our
arbitrary characters in the from address string, we enclose them in the comment
() paranthesis).

One more issue with regard to the exploitation is related to the code that can
be executed after successfull exploitation. Because the target process does not
have any active TCP connections open at the time when we can seize its execution
we cannot use findsckcode variant in it. The use of bindsckcode does not also
seem to be usable in the case of sendmail, as mail servers are usually tightly
firewalled and do not allow any incoming connections to be established. They
however must always allow outgoing connections to other mail servers, this is
why the connect code could be very adventageous in this case and this is why we
use it in our POC.

TESTING ENVIROMENT
Our test box was running Linux Slackware 8.0 distribution
(ftp.slackware.org/slackware/slackware-8.0-iso/install.iso) with patched sendmail
binary (ftp.slackware.org/slackware/slackware-8.0/patches/packages/sendmail.tgz).
The applied patch upgraded sendmail from version 8.11.4 to 8.11.6.

Below you can find the example usage of our proof of concept code:

IMPACT
Due to the nature of the discussed sendmail vulnerability it seems that it is
unexploitable on most of commercially available UNIX systems. It also doesn't seem
to be exploitable on most of the default SMTP installations of x86 based open-source
systems. This leads to the conclusion that the overall impact of the vulnerability
is rather limited and not so significant as it might be thought.

Hovever, we cannot exclude that there does not exist another execution path in the
sendmail code, that could lead to the program counter overwrite.

## Remote Buffer Overflow in Sendmail

#### Vulnerability Note VU#398025

Original Release Date: 2003-03-03 | Last Revised: 2003-09-15

---

### Overview

There is a vulnerability in sendmail that may allow remote attackers to gain the privileges of the sendmail daemon, typically root.

### Description

| Researchers at [Internet Security Systems](http://www.iss.net/) (ISS) have discovered a remotely exploitable vulnerability in sendmail. This vulnerability could allow an intruder to gain control of a vulnerable sendmail server.Most organizations have a variety of mail transfer agents (MTAs) at various locations within their network, with at least one exposed to the Internet. Since sendmail is the most popular MTA, most medium-sized to large organizations are likely to have at least one vulnerable sendmail server. In addition, many UNIX and Linux workstations provide a sendmail implementation that is enabled and running by default.This vulnerability is message-oriented as opposed to connection-oriented. That means that the vulnerability is triggered by the contents of a specially-crafted email message rather than by lower-level network traffic. This is important because an MTA that does not contain the vulnerability will pass the malicious message along to other MTAs that may be protected at the network level. In other words, vulnerable sendmail servers on the interior of a network are still at risk, even if the site's border MTA uses software other than sendmail. Also, messages capable of exploiting this vulnerability may pass undetected through many common packet filters or firewalls.Sendmail has indicated to the CERT/CC that this vulnerability has been successfully exploited in a laboratory environment. We do not believe that this exploit is available to the public. However, this vulnerability is likely to draw significant attention from the intruder community, so the probability of a public exploit is high.A successful attack against an unpatched sendmail system will not leave any messages in the system log. However, on a patched system, an attempt to exploit this vulnerability will leave the following log message:  Dropped invalid comments from header addressAlthough this does not represent conclusive evidence of an attack, it may be useful as an indicator.A patched sendmail server will drop invalid headers, thus preventing downstream servers from receiving them. |
| --- |

### Impact

| Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may allow an attacker to gain the privileges of the sendmail daemon, typically root. Even vulnerable sendmail servers on the interior of a given network may be at risk since the vulnerability is triggered from the contents of a malicious email message. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply a patch from Sendmail**Sendmail has produced patches for versions 8.9, 8.10, 8.11, and 8.12. However, the vulnerability also exists in earlier versions of the code; therefore, site administrators using an earlier version are encouraged to upgrade to 8.12.8.
