Following the normal W3C conventions, there were two different
kind of releases of **Jigsaw**. Member release are provided
to W3C members, a month in advance of the Public
Release. Depending on their status the member release may get a
different release number then the public release. On this page,
you will find the release notes for the different versions of
**Jigsaw** (which don't necessarily coincide with member
release). From the beginning of 1998, the releases are only
public ones, we still add the word "public" to avoid any
confusion.

NOTE! The odd number in the
middle state that this is NOT a stable release, not that it is unstable,
but it means that not all the features are present, and that some more
testing is needed until it gets its even middle number.

## Jigsaw 2.2.6

**A public release, made on April 10th, 2007.**

This version is a bugfix and optimized version of 2.2.5. It may be
the latest using jdk1.2 only code.

### New Features

Support for more XML Parsers in the Resources deserialization code

* Added support for connection reuse policies in the
  Client stack.
* Added a default policy to reuse the same connection when the
  thread matches (in HttpBasicConnection)
* Added a socket timeout on request
  parsing, to avoid having it linked to request timeout
* The Servlet runner thread now use the server
  timeout mechanism to interrupt the running thread when the server
  is closing the request on timeout.
* Added a method to print Dates in ISO 8601 format without
  milliseconds
* Added a "detach" method to HttpBasicConnection to remove a
  connection from the list of used client connections but without
  closing the socket immediately (used when the client hits a
  HTTP/1.0 server that doesn't send Content-Length).

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed cookie parsing bug, if the cookie value contains a '='
* Fixed SAX parsing of stores and remote resource description (allow multiple 'characters' call for one value)
* Removed an unneeded synchronization point in HTTPFrame.getURL()
* Added an extra SP when exporting auth headers with different components
* Fixed source code to remove 'enum' as it is now a keywork starting with JDK 1.5
* Fixed client connection deletion in connection reuse, it was leading to a leak in the client hashtable (and to lots of connections in CLOSE\_WAIT).
* Fixed bug in DateParser (wrong timezone offset) thanks to Menno Jonkers
* Optimized a bit Digest Auth (the RFC2069 one) and implemented Digest Auth with qop="auth" per RFC2617 (available with SecurityLevel set to 2), See DigestQopAuthPrincipal
* Fixed a few WebDAV properties that were using wrong formats
* HeaderFilter now sets the relevant headers even when the reply is sent via the exception mechanism.
* More SSL and servlet related patches from Thomas Kopp.
* ActiveStream patch, under some condition, the same data
  could be re-read a data chunk (thanks to Doug Borland)
* The servlet parameter decoding now uses the right charset.
* Fixed error when file timestamp was not modified but the file was actually modified.
* Fixed deadlock during store change notification when the sweeper is running (very rare)
* Fixed server client count when load is raising from LIGHT to DEAD
* Fixed Segment information unpickle, as the segment start and size were not properly parsed, leading to an infinite loop
* More SSL patches from Thomas Kopp, see [changelog](http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/java/classes/org/w3c/jigsaw/https/SSLAdapter.java?rev=1.7&content-type=text/x-cvsweb-markup) for more details.
* Fixed connection count when MimeParser did not started and connection was new.
* Client stack now reuses the
  connection timeout parameter.

## Jigsaw 2.2.5

**A public release, made on June 8th, 2005.**

This version is a bugfix and optimized version of 2.2.4.
It contains an updated version of the SSL code (that may require
the use of jdk1.4).

### New Features

New Digest Authentication code has been added.
It now conforms to
[RFC2617](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2617.txt).
The old code was implementing only the
[RFC2069](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2069.txt)
version of the Digest Authentication.

WebDAV support has been improved, interoperating with most WebDAV
clients now.

### Bug Fixes

* Added a "detach" method to HttpBasicConnection to remove a connection from the list of used client connections but without closing the socket immediately (used when the client hits a HTTP/1.0 server that doesn't send Content-Length).
* Fixed client connection deletion in connection reuse, it was leading to a leak in the client hashtable (and to lots of connections in CLOSE\_WAIT).
* Fixed bug in DateParser (wrong timezone offset) thanks to Menno Jonkers
* Optimized a bit Digest Auth (the RFC2069 one) and implemented Digest Auth with qop="auth" per RFC2617 (available with SecurityLevel set to 2), See DigestQopAuthPrincipal

* Added a method to print Dates in ISO 8601 format without milliseconds
* HeaderFilter now sets the relevant headers even when the reply is sent via the exception mechanism.
* ActiveStream patch, under some condition, the same data
  could be re-read a data chunk (thanks to Doug Borland)
* The servlet parameter decoding now uses the right charset.
* The Servlet runner thread now use the server
  timeout mechanism to interrupt the running thread when the server
  is closing the request on timeout.
* Fixed error when file timestamp was not modified but the file was actually modified.
* Fixed deadlock during store change notification when the sweeper is running.
* Fixed server client count when load is raising from LIGHT to DEAD
* Fixed Segment information unpickle, as the segment start and size were not properly parsed, leading to an infinite loop
* More SSL patches from Thomas Kopp, see [changelog](http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/java/classes/org/w3c/jigsaw/https/SSLAdapter.java?rev=1.7&content-type=text/x-cvsweb-markup) for more details.
* Fixed connection count when MimeParser did not started and connection was new.

### Improvements

* Added a socket timeout on request
  parsing, to avoid having it linked to request timeout
* Added a default policy to reuse the same connection when the thread matches (in HttpBasicConnection)
* Added support for connection reuse policies in the Client stack.
* Client stack now reuses the connection timeout parameter.

## Jigsaw 2.2.4

**A public release, made on February 18th, 2004.**

This version is a bugfix and optimized version of 2.2.3.
It contains an updated version of the SSL code (that may require
the use of jdk1.4). It contains a **security fix**, so
you are encouraged to update as soon as possible.

### New Features

The HTTP Client stack has been completely reworked to be
faster and to avoid keeping information on too many remote servers.
The client stack now also has a timeout on connect.

### Bug Fixes

* Fix in the client stack persistent connection handler. It now closes the socket and mark the connection free when a "Connection: close" header is in the reply.
* SSL patches from Thomas Kopp.
* URI components now generate an exception when a separator is found
* Memory usage optimization of the serialization of a resource.
* Read/write of stores is now more fault tolerant.
* Fixed the client stack use of connections, also the global server knowledge hastable is now trimmed the right way.
* Fixed StatisticsFrame to use less StringBuffers
* Added a configurable timeout on connect, for the HTTP client stack. `org.w3c.www.protocol.http.connections.connTimeout` (defaulting to 1000ms)
* Fixed ContainerResource check for
  duplicate key, the "new key" algorithm is now more random
  (ie it uses the
  whole scale instead of the object serial mask), as it was leading to
  infinite loops on huge sites.

## Jigsaw 2.2.3

**A public release, made on November 27th, 2003.**

This version is a bugfix and optimized version of 2.2.2.
It also includes Jigedit with WebDAV support, a package with
a specific WebDAV configuration will follow, and a tutorial to do the

  case of a SSL server
* Added the underlying exception in the
  HttpManager to distinguish between errors in the client stack.
* Fixed ContainerResource check for
  duplicate key, the "new key" algorithm is now more random (ie it uses the
  whole scale instead of the object serial mask), as it was leading to
  infinite loops on huge sites.

  both in admin server and ResourceStoreManager now force UTF-8 encoding
  (as XML is declared to be UTF-8)

## Jigsaw 2.2.1

**A public release, made on April 8th, 2002.**

This version fixes bugs, especially a security bug of version 2.2.0
It also includes Jigedit with WebDAV support, a package with
a specific WebDAV configuration will follow, and a tutorial to do the
[WebDAV setup](Doc/User/webdav.html) is already online.
It is also the first release Carine
Bournez worked on.

### New Features

* [JigShell](Doc/User/jigshell.html), a small utility* WebDAV enabled JigEdit
  * Implementation of [Apache](http://httpd.apache.org/)
    [mod\_asis](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_asis.html).
  * PushCache package, contributed by
    Paul Henshaw from
    The Fantastic Corporation.
  * TidyPutFilter, a filter to validate automatically the
    [XHTML](https://www.w3.org/MarkUp/#xhtml1) or
    [HTML](https://www.w3.org/MarkUp/#previous) sent via the
    PUT method, using
    [JTidy](http://sourceforge.net/projects/jtidy).

### Bug Fixes

* Previously uncaught error (ie: non Protocol ones) during lookup
  are now resoved by sending a 400 Bad
  Request
* Fixed the way exception filters are called in httpd. Side
  effect, ErrorFilter works again
* Fixed a bug in TE Filter that was compressiong twice the stream
  (need to figure out why it was called
  twice though)
* Fixed semantic of ; in the URI, with the right info given
  during lookup
* SECURITY FIX: Fixed security bug regarding URI parsing
* Added a flag to remove the URI from default error pages as well
  as the proxy module (SECURITY FIX: avoiding cross
  scripting attacks)
* Fixed ServletMapper to do redirect the right way (host parsing).
  It was interacting with new jdk1.4
  ipv6 scan
* Merged patches from
  Thomas Kopp
  concerning servlets:
  servlet loading, behaviour of
  SingleThreadModel
* Reverted 1.3 API calls to 1.2, or used reflection to use
  jdk1.3 only methods in the push package
* Added a specific frame to handle MKCOL and other
  collection-related WebDAV methods in Jigedit
* Fixed WebDAV implementation, it now sends all the requested
  properties in a PROPFIND, with the
  right statuds for the undefined ones.
* Modified AclFilter to take benefit of skipBody
* Added skipBody in Request, it allows a filter to skip an eventual
  body in a better way than error
  recovery.
* Fixed bug when Content-Type was not set (it was set but the value
  of the HttpMimeType was null,
  defeating the usual check)
* Fixed If-None-Match during the creation of a FileResource
* Fixed trailing / for negotiated resources, it was ignored,
  resulting in bad relative links
* Fixed If-None-Match in HTTPFrame, it now handles \*
* ResourceStoreManager will issue a warning when a store raise an
  exception during save, the general
  save will continue (it was not the case before)
* In CvsFileFrame, cvs update is performed also prior to a PUT.
* Added stronger synchronization for log rotation.
* Fixed indexer so that fake file resource can be created, as it
  may be dangerous for directories, it is still
  forbidden on those.
* Fixed deadlock in DirectoryListerFrame, a lock was not done
  resulting in locks done in the wrong order
  in concurrent access
* Fix NewStoreEntry, hashtable of loaded ResourceReference is now
  cleared when the store is
  unloaded.
* Fix in EditableSlider, now a textfield can resize the boundaries
  of the slider, a non-extensible mode is
  also available
* Fixed RedirectedFrame to add Content-Location after the internal
  redirect, and Referer is kept.
* Fixed NegotiatedFrame to gather filters from the selected
  resource, collected during the lookup,
  instead of the perform. However perform may select the resource if
  the state is lost because of another filter.
* Fixed error replies for JigEdit on a 412
* Added synchronization fo class loading in servlet's class
  loader

### Improvements

  the reply
* Logger can now log the original URL during an internal redirect* Fixed Digest Auth bug (well update of the spec) regarding unquoted

## Jigsaw 2.1.0

**A public release, made on September the 9th, 1999.**

This release is the first release using the new serialization scheme.
It allows you to change the way the serialization is done.
As an exemple, and to provide an easier access to the configuration.

### New Features

* New serialization scheme, the current version uses XML, see
  [the JXML format](Doc/Programmer/JigXML.html) for more
  information on how to read the serialized files.
* New admin exchange format, using
  [JXML](Doc/Programmer/JigXML.html), it allows you to
  create administration scripts.
* A new upgrader will convert automatically the old Jigsaw stores
  to the new format, the old stores are kept in a backup directory.

### Bug Fixes

* more HttpRange can now be created: "-500","500-", by using -1 as
  the default value
* The request parser now skip the body if sent directly by the client
  when an error occured.
* Servlet are destroyed only if all the connections are closed
* Lister in Jigedit now defines the ACTION in the FORM
* Servlet bug fixed in getResource(), thanks to James Clark.

### Improvements

* Directory listing now ends the URI of the containers with a "/",
  preventing an extra redirect
* Logger now has a property to define the logging directory

### Limitations

* The jdbmResourceStore has not yet been ported, a consequence is
  the lack of CacheFilter in the proxy, but it will be replaced soon
  by a completely new cache.

##

## Jigsaw 2.0.3

**A public release, made on July the 27th, 1999.**

This release is a bugfix version of the 2.0.2, while 2.1.0 will add
new feature and will completely change the way the resources are
serialized).
Meanwhile, there are new functionalities, like the new Acl api, which
replaces the old auth schemes.

### New Features

* new Acl API, more flexible than the previous auth scheme.
* Redirecter Frame now handles PATH\_INFO.
* Charset and language dialects negotiation.
* Added MimeTypeArray and other basic attributes arrays.

### Bug Fixes

* Bad request handling is better, previously, HTTP/1.1 without a
  Host: header or a full URI was just closing the connection.
* Servlet indexer can now index servlets with full package name
* Bad permission on a file now fires an exception, rather than
  (possibly) hanging.
* MimeAttribute null balue is now handled in jigadm
* Cache is now sending the right size for null documents
* Servlet's getReader now takes care of the encoding.
* ServletRequest now merges URI parameters and body parameters.
* Fixed ResourceEvent bug (unloaded resources are no longer receiving
  events)
* Cache is no longer blocking for non-sized multipart documents.
* Fixed loop in proxy when the proxy was on port 80 (fixed also if
  it is the default https port)
* Fixed timestamp problem when a file has been modified in the past
  (clock skew is a pain)
* Fixed max-connection and notification of waiting threads during the
  deletion of an old kept-alive connection
* Cached VaryResource are now checking ETag the right way, no more
  304 replies when it was just a cache revalidation.
* Multiple cookies are now sent using multiple headers (ugly but
  cookies ARE ugly).
* Fixed ResourceStoreManager initialization, when another root
  resource was set, it may end up in resource duplication and
  problems while attaching frames/filters, also it was causing
  deletion loops. WARNING! You may have to redo your configuration if
  you changed the root resource!
* Fixed servlet timeout unit
* SSI Frame and servlet interaction fixed (no more chunking in that
  case)
* Logger and port can be changed while the server is running.
* The "No logger" warning is more explicit

### Improvements

* Servlet timeout can be disabled
* Servlet cookie maxage can now be -1 (unlimited)
* Language negotiation has been redone, it now check dialects
  also
* Content negotiation now takes the order into account
* Realms now have a real feeder (administration tool)
* Added bind address so that multiple interfaces can be bound.
* Client garbage collection scheme has been redone, allowing smoother
  handling of clients when load goes up (it means also better
  performances)
* MirrorFrame now tweaks also temporary redirects
* Md5 constructor now allows an encoding string.

(jigadmin, v2). Along with that, numerous improvement over the old
version, like servlet API 2.1 support.

* Per servlet timeout is possible
* JNI port of LibUnix, thanks to Roland Mainz
* New logger ExtendedCommonLogger, doing log rotation and using ECLF
  format

  avoid automatic conversion of jdk1.2
* When indexing a file with multiple extensions, frames attirbutes
  are now aggregated. **It requires the use of the new default
  indexer** provided in the distribution, as the Content-Type
  for modifiers (like .fr) is now
  set to \*none\*
* VirtualHost now remove automatically the ":80" added by some
  robots.
* Extension matching process now does "perfect" match, then case
  insensitive match if desired.

  type definitions.
* ThreadCache behaviour near the limit is now the right one, also
  there is a feature to wait for all the thread of the cache.

and the client to do administration.

---

## Jigsaw 2.0alpha1

**A public release, made on January the 31th, 1998.**

This 2.0 release is the first release of the new [internal design](Doc/Programmer/design.html) of Jigsaw.

### Bug Fixes

This version as all the bug fixes of the 1.0beta2 about protocol issues.
Other bug fixes have no meaning here as the internals of Jigsaw have been
reworked.

### Incompatibles changes

* The name of the classes are now org.w3c... instead of
  w3c...
* The resources are no longer linked with the protocol, protocole frames
  are added to the raw resources
* The resources are limited, DirectoryResource, FileResource,
  PassDirectory, FramedResource, ContainerResource and
  ExternalContainer.
* The new frames are:
  + [ProtocolFrame](http://jigsaw.w3.org/Doc/Programmer/api/org/w3c/tools/resources/ProtocolFrame.html)
  + [HTTPFrame](http://jigsaw.w3.org/Doc/Programmer/api/org/w3c/jigsaw/frames/HTTPFrame.html)
  + [ResourceFrame](http://jigsaw.w3.org/Doc/Programmer/api/org/w3c/tools/resources/ResourceFrame.html)
  + [NegotiatedFrame](http://jigsaw.w3.org/Doc/Programmer/api/org/w3c/jigsaw/frames/NegotiatedFrame.html)
  + [RelocateFrame](http://jigsaw.w3.org/Doc/Programmer/api/org/w3c/jigsaw/frames/RelocateFrame.html)
  + [SSIFrame](http://jigsaw.w3.org/Doc/Programmer/api/org/w3c/jigsaw/ssi/SSIFrame.html)
  + [ServletDirectoryFrame](http://jigsaw.w3.org/Doc/Programmer/api/org/w3c/jigsaw/servlet/ServletDirectoryFrame.html)
  + [ServletWrapperFrame](http://jigsaw.w3.org/Doc/Programmer/api/org/w3c/jigsaw/servlet/ServletWrapperFrame.html)
  + [AuthFilter](http://jigsaw.w3.org/Doc/Programmer/api/org/w3c/jigsaw/auth/AuthFilter.html)
  + [GenericAuthFilter](http://jigsaw.w3.org/Doc/Programmer/api/org/w3c/jigsaw/auth/GenericAuthFilter.html)
* The filters are no longer placed on the resource, but on the protocol
  frame.
* The admin server has been reworked to support framed frames.
* Support for active Resources through listeners. (bean-like event
  model).
* Modification of the **JigAdmin** configuration tool to support
  protocol frames and framed frames.
* The root store of the distribution is no longer needed to start a new
  server, it creates its own store if none are present.
* The ResourceStoreManager has been completely modified, so the old
  configurations for the 1.0beta serie will no longer work. You will have to
  reconfigure your server entirely!
* The form-based configuration is invalid now and has been removed. You
  MUST use the administration server to configure **Jigsaw**

### New Features

* True reindexing now exists (This is real reindexing rather than deleting
  the resource).
* **Jigsaw** will create the root store if not present.
* Installation program that modifies the property files of the servers
  according to your configuration.
* Partial draft of the [new documentation](Doc/), the next
  release will have a completely new documentation.

---

## Jigsaw 1.0beta2

* Fixed default adds of HTTP headers that were wrong.
* debug of the classloader for servlets
* Bug fix in the jdbm enumerator.

### Enhancements

* The indexers can now create "ghost" resources to allow more fancy uses
  of Jigsaw, like shadow icon directories.
* Added the TRACE method of HTTP/1.1
* Added the possibility of templates in the indexers
* the GrepPutFilter forbid a PUT of a document containing a specified
  string. Very useful when you edit your website from one server and you
  doesn'y want to allow links to this server.
* Added a DateThread, if you want to speed up Jigsaw a bit (~10% by
  switching loggers).

## Jigsaw 1.0beta1

**A public release, made on September the 1st, 1997.**

This is just a bug fix release of the latest member beta release.

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed a bug in Content-Length in case of Chunked encoding.
* Added more feedback when a configuration error occurs while using
  **JigAdmin**.
* Fixed bug in the CacheFilter

### Enhancements

* Added a new Resource, DirectoryLister, acting like when you access to a
  directory, useful to make a small index.

---

## Jigsaw 1.0beta

**A member specific release, made on August the 1st, 1997.**
### Bug Fixes

* FileResource now supports the HTTP/1.1 If-Range header, and a
  slight bug was fixed in the emitted Content-Range header
* The HTTP client side cache filter has been fixed (jdbmResourceStore
  enumration was buggy)
* The Caught Exception trace in errlog has been removed (*The trace was
  the bug* - tm)
* Fixed a bug in ICP message parsing (will now correctly handle message of
  length exceeding 255 bytes)
* If it manages a shared cache, the CacheFilter will no longer cache
  documents retreive through a request that has an Authorization
  header.
* Fixed a bug in HTTP Date parsing (one of the three date format wasn't
  parsed properly)
* Fixed a bug in ContentLengthInputStream (wrong size after an error on a
  read)
* Fixed a bug in ActiveStream which was the source of empty documents
  feeded by the proxy.

### Enhancements

* Added a property in the [ICPFilter](User/Reference/w3c.www.protocol.http.icp.ICPFilter.html#w3c.www.protocol.http.icp.disable-cache)
  to disable caching of documents retreived through ICP
* JSDK/1.0 FCS servlet API support
* Powerful JDBC access through server side include.

  This new feature allow you to querty any JDBC compliant database and embed
  the result within your HTML page. Check the [SSIResource api](User/api/w3c.jigsaw.ssi.SSIResource.html).
* PICS & JDBC.

  A new LabelBureau implementation is available. It relies on any JDBC
  compliant database as the storage mechanism for PICS labels, which makes
  it more scaleable than the previous filesystem based approach.
* Servlet support has been upgraded to 1.0FCS; Support for automatic
  servlet reloading has also been implemented (Jigsaw will detect that the
  servlet class files have changed and will reload them automatically).

### New Features

* Added a companion server to do the remote configuration.

  The protocol used to communicate with the Admin servlet hasn't been
  specified yet, and will probably change in the next releases of Jigsaw.
  The client part of the API ([w3c.jigsaw.jigadm.RemoteResource](User/api/w3c.jigsaw.admin.RemoteResource.html))
  is unlikely to change though.
* A new graphical tool is available to do the configuration of Jigsaw.
  Currently, this allows you to do everything the form based editor could
  do.
* Support for the [SAP](User/api/Package-w3c.www.sap.html)
  protocol has been included, as the starting point for multicast
  proxy-to-proxy support. SAP is the Session Announcement Protocol (an
  Internet draft)
* The [ProxyDirectory](User/Reference/w3c.jigsaw.proxy.ProxyDirectory.html)
  resource now supports ftp tunneling (it won't do caching until someone
  tells me how ftp results can be cached)
* Support for a light multicasted version of ICP now available in the
  proxy, turn your hundreds of useless 5Mo caches into a usefull 50Mo
  collaborative proxy: *the net is the computer* ! Check the [MICPFilter](User/Reference/w3c.www.protocol.http.micp.MICPFilter.html)
  client side filter.
* Resource can now be extended through the use of [ResourceFrame](User/api/w3c.tools.store.ResourceFrame.html);

  The notion of HTTP filters has proven usefull enough to be extended for
  non HTTP resources. You can now attach *frames* to resources that
  describe users for example (such as the w3c.jigsaw.auth.AuthUser).

### Incompatible API changes

* The [FormResource](User/api/w3c.jigsaw.forms.FormResource.html)
  constructor now takes a ResourceContext instead of a httpd instance
* The indexing model haa changed quite a bit.

  A new indexing model has been designed: each directory can declare how it
  indexes its content through thew use of its own indexer. The indexer API
  is defined in w3c.jigsaw.indexer.

### Incompatible Configuration Changes

* Filters pickling as attributes

  Filters pickling has changed: filters are now just a special resource
  attribute, and follow the general pickling format. They used to be
  special, and that caused lots of troubles.

  *Don't redefine the pickle method !!*
* Cache directory hierarchy

  The cache directory hierarchy has been made multi-directory: cached
  entries are stored in a tree of directories instead of within a single
  directory (lessen the load on the file system by decreasing the acche
  directory size)

---

## Jigsaw 1.0alpha5

**A public release made on February the 13th, 1997.**
### Incompatible changes

* The [AttributeHolder](User/api/w3c.tools.store.AttributeHolder.html)
  [unpickle](User/api/w3c.tools.store.AttributeHolder.html#unpickle)
  and [unpickleInstance](User/api/w3c.tools.store.AttributeHolder.html#unpickleInstance)
  methods, now take a third boolean parameter, that indicates if the
  resource is to be initialized after unpickling. **Warning** if you have
  written an 1.0alpha3 resource that redefines this method, you should make
  sure to define the new format for this method (since it's the one that
  gets called by the unpickling engine)
* The [HttpReplyMessage](User/api/w3c.www.http.HttpReplyMessage.html) [setLocation](User/api/w3c.www.http.HttpReplyMessage.html#setLocation)
  method now takes an URL, to reflect the fact that HTTP/1.1 specification
  requires an absolute URL here.
* The getURL method of [HTTPResource](User/api/w3c.jigsaw.resources.HTTPResource.html)
  has now been splitted into two diferent methods:
  String [getURLPath](User/api/w3c.jigsaw.resources.HTTPResource.html#getURLPath)()
  Returns the path of the URL of the resource (as a String)
  URL [getURL](User/api/w3c.jigsaw.resources.HTTPResource.html#getURL)(request)
  Retuns the full URL of the resource. With virtual hosting support,
  it may happen that a resource has differnt URLs according to the
  incomming requests, that's one of the reason for that split.
* [AttributeHolderAttribute](User/api/w3c.tools.store.AttributeHolderAttribute.html)
  semantics has slightly changed: it is up to resources using that kind of
  attribute to initialize the value (if any) of that attribute, by calling
  their [initialize](User/api/w3c.tools.store.AttributeHolder.html#initialize)
  method with appropriate default values.
* Resources can now refuse unloading, through the new [acceptUnload](User/api/w3c.tools.store.Resource.html#acceptUnload)
  method. This allows to *lock* a resource in memory, whatever happens.
  This should be use only with great care.
* The [ResourceStoreHolder](User/api/w3c.tools.store.ResourceStoreHolder.html)
  interface has changed in the following ways:
  notifyStoreUnload
  Has been renamed to [acceptStoreUnload](User/api/w3c.tools.store.ResourceStoreHolder.html#acceptUnload),
  and returns a boolean that indicates wether the store holder is
  willing to get rid of any of its references to the store. If any of
  that store holders return **false** the store will not ne
  unloaded.
  [notifyStoreShutdown](User/api/w3c.tools.store.ResourceStoreHolder.html#notifyStoreShutdown)
  and [notifyStoreStabilize](User/api/w3c.tools.store.ResourceStoreHolder.html#notifyStoreStabilize)
  Semantics has been slightly changed: it is nolonger up to the
  store holder to perform the job. The first method is the one in
  which the holder should get rid of all its references to the store
  (by nullifying them), and the second one is just a
  notification.
* The [ContainerResource](User/api/w3c.jigsaw.resources.ContainerResource.html)
  [lookupStore](User/api/w3c.jigsaw.resources.ContainerResource.html#lookupStore)
  method now throws an [InvalidResourceException](User/api/w3c.jigsaw.resources.InvalidResourceException.html)
  if the resource exists in its store but cannot be restored. In such a
  case, the [DirectoryResource](User/api/w3c.jigsaw.resources.DirectoryResource.html)
  will emit an appropriate error message.
* The [ServerHandler](User/api/w3c.jigsaw.daemon.ServerHandler.html)
  interface [initialize](User/api/w3c.jigsaw.daemon.ServerHandler.html#initialize)
  and [clone](User/api/w3c.jigsaw.daemon.ServerHandler.html#clone)
  methods now provide a pointer to the [ServerHandlerManager](User/api/w3c.jigsaw.daemon.ServerHandlerManager.html)
  as a first parameter.
* The resource and resource store APIs have been moved outside of
  **Jigsaw**. After a year of experimentation, this code has proven
  usefull outside the scope of the server itself, that's why we decided to
  move it to a newly created package [w3c.tools.store](User/api/Package-w3c.tools.store.html). If you
  have written some resources, the only change for you will be to import
  that new package in your class files. The precise list of classes that has
  moved is:
  + Attribute.java
  + AttributeHolder.java
  + AttributeHolderAttribute.java
  + AttributeRegistry.java
  + BooleanAttribute.java
  + ClassAttribute.java
  + DateAttribute.java
  + DoubleAttribute.java
  + FileAttribute.java
  + FilenameAttribute.java
  + HolderInitException.java
  + IllegalAttributeAccess.java
  + IntegerArrayAttribute.java
  + IntegerAttribute.java
  + InvalidResourceAttribute.java
  + LongAttribute.java
  + ObjectAttribute.java
  + PropertiesAttribute.java
  + Resource.java
  + ResourceLocker.java
  + ResourceShadower.java
  + ResourceStore.java
  + ResourceStoreHolder.java
  + ResourceStoreManager.java
  + SimpleResourceStore.java
  + StringArrayAttribute.java
  + StringAttribute.java
  + UnknownResourceException.java
* The [ResourceStoreManager](User/api/w3c.tools.store.ResourceStoreManager.html)
  [unpickleProlog](User/api/w3c.tools.store.ResourceStoreManager.html#unpickleProlog)
  method no longer returns a boolean. Instead it throws one of:
  [NotAStoreException](User/api/w3c.tools.store.NotAStoreException.html)
  If the file preambule doesn't match the store cookie.
  [InvalidStoreClassException](User/api/w3c.tools.store.InvalidStoreClassException.html)
  If the class willing to load that repository doesn't match the
  class that saved it.
  [InvalidStoreVersionException](User/api/w3c.tools.store.InvalidStoreVersionException.html)
  If the repository version doesn't match the loading class
  version.

### Compatible changes

* HTTPResource defines a new [verify](User/api/w3c.jigsaw.resources.HTTPResource.html#verify)
  method, that might be called by a resource store salvager to check the
  consistency of the resource.For example, file system based resources will
  use that method to check that the file or directory they wrap still exist,
  and delete themselves if not.
* [DirectoryResource](User/api/w3c.jigsaw.resources.DirectoryResource.html)
  listing now emits HTML3.2 compliant documents, along with a link to the
  container (when possible)
* The realms catalog no longer uses absolute pathes, it will not however
  upgrade all realms catalog to not using absolute path. Relative path are
  relative to the server's auth directory (typically
  config/auth)
* The w3c.jigsaw.space property is no longer settable through the
  Admin properties editor. This was an oversight. The only way to set the
  *space* for a server, is through the -space commandline
  toggle (check the [command line
  page](User/Administration/cmdline.html) for more details)

### New features

* A new [SalvagerResource](User/Reference/w3c.jigsaw.contrib.SalvagerResource.html)
  has been written. This resource will walk through the entire resource
  space, to check for:
  + Cycles in resource stores (due to **Jigsaw** bugs)
  + Unused resource stores (it garbage collects the stores)
  + Synchronize resources with the file system, by calling the [verify](User/api/w3c.jigsaw.resources.HTTPResource.html#verify)
    method of all resources.
* A new [ResourceWalker](User/api/w3c.tools.store.ResourceWalker.html)
  interface is available, along with a [WalkerEngine](User/api/w3c.tools.store.WalkerEngine.html). These
  two classes provide respectively an interface to handle the walk, and an
  *engine* that will trigger call to implementors of previous interface
  while walking through a resource space.

### Bug fixes

Numerous bug fixes have been omitted from the list, that list only the main
ones:

* The [ResourceStoreManager](User/api/w3c.tools.store.ResourceStoreManager.html)
  had numerous bugs, most of them should now be fixed.
* The [ICPFilter](User/api/w3c.www.protocol.http.icp.ICPFilter.html)
  HTTP client side filter that implements the Internet Cache Protocol should
  now be compatible with Squid implementations
* CVS has been fixed in numerous ways; the PutList resource should now be
  usable.
* The basic class [AuthFilter](User/Reference/w3c.jigsaw.auth.AuthFilter.html) now
  performs authentication during lookup, rather then at
  ingoingFilter's time.

---

## Jigsaw 1.0alpha4

**A member specific release, made on January the 13th, 1997.**
### Incompatible changes

* Properties are no longer saved in a single file, each [ServerHandler](User/api/w3c.jigsaw.daemon.ServerHandler.html) has
  to manage its own property file. The file is designated through the server
  *identifier*. This means that older httpd.props file should
  be changed by:
  + Renaming them to http-server.props (the default server
    identifier)
  + All properties prefix should be removed (ie all http-server
    prefixes)
* The AttributeHolder pickling format has changed:
  + The FilteredResource pickling method had a bug (it didn't conform to
    the general format)
  + Before being dumped, attribute values are prefixed by theire pickled
    length. This allows the unpickleInstance method to skip unknown (ie
    deleted) attributes.
* The [DaemonProperty](User/api/w3c.jigsaw.daemon.DaemonProperties.html)
  class is now only used as a property loader. It implements a catalog of
  property sets; each [ServerHandler](User/api/w3c.jigsaw.daemon.ServerHandler.html)
  instance is responsible for managing its own [ObservableProperties](User/api/w3c.util.ObservableProperties.html)
  instance.
* The [getURL](User/api/w3c.jigsaw.resources.HTTPResource.html#getURL)
  method of User [HTTPResource](User/api/w3c.jigsaw.resources.HTTPResource.html)
  instances now return the full path of the resource within any of the
  server contexts (it used to return the full URL).
* The abstract [Attribute](User/api/w3c.jigsaw.resources.Attribute.html) class
  now defines a new [getPickleLength](User/api/w3c.jigsaw.resources.Attribute.html#getPickleLength)
  abstract method (that has to be defined by sub-classes). This method is
  used for the new pickling format of resources, to allow the unpickle
  method to skip unknown attribute values.
* The [ResourceStore](User/api/w3c.jigsaw.resources.ResourceStore.html)
  API has changed (for ResourceStore implementers only). The [getVersion](User/api/w3c.jigsaw.resources.ResourceStore.html#getVersion)
  method has been added, and must return the version of the class that
  implements the store.

  The [initialize](User/api/w3c.jigsaw.resources.ResourceStore.html#initialize)
  method has a new opaque *token* parameter, to be used by the store
  when calling back the resource store manager (eg when calling the
  markModified method). The *token* can be thought of as the identity,
  for the resource store manager, of the store.
* The [HttpManager](User/api/w3c.www.protocol.http.HttpManager.html) can
  now be instantiated several times within the same process. This allows for
  different context for the HTTP client side API. More precisely, the new
  method [getManager(Properties
  props)](User/api/w3c.www.protocol.http.HttpManager.html#getManager(Properties)) will create a new manager if no other manager has been created
  with that exact property set.

### Bug fixes

* The [CommonLogger](User/api/w3c.jigsaw.http.CommonLogger.html) now
  initializes its buffer size properly from properties.
* Several fixes in the [CacheFilter](User/api/w3c.www.protocol.http.cache.CacheFilter.html)
  (protocol implementation errors)
* Bug fixes in the server-side [Request](User/api/w3c.jigsaw.http.Request.html) object, wouldn't
  allow for non persistent connections.
* The new [SocketClientFactory](User/api/w3c.jigsaw.http.socket.SocketClientFactory.html)
  now properly deletes old clients if needed (old clients would otherwise
  tend to be priviledged wr to newer ones).

### New features

* Created the [w3c.jigsaw.contrib.PasswordEditor](User/Reference/w3c.jigsaw.contrib.PasswordEditor.html)
  resource, that allows web site users to change their own password within a
  given realm.
* Created the [w3c.jigsaw.contrib.CheckpointResource](User/Reference/w3c.jigsaw.contrib.CheckpointResource.html)
  that will backup **Jigsaw** configuration every once in a while.
* Created the [w3c.jigsaw.contrib.LogFilter](User/Reference/w3c.jigsaw.contrib.LogFilter.html)
  filter, that allows for very flexible monitoring of an URL sub-space.
* Added UNIX specific command line options, to be able to run
  **Jigsaw** on port 80, as any user, under any groups. Support also
  provided for chroot'ing **Jigsaw** under UNIX, check [the FAQ entry](User/FAQ.html#chroot).
* The proxy now provides minimal support for ICP, through the [ICPFilter](User/api/w3c.www.protocol.http.proxy.ICPFilter.html).
* Sun's servlet API is now supported, servlets can be downloaded from the
  net ! Check the [ServletWrapper](User/api/w3c.jigsaw.servlet.ServletWrapper.html)
  and [RemoteServletWrapper](User/api/w3c.jigsaw.servlet.RemoteServletWrapper.html)
  resources.

### Compatible API Changes

* the [Client](User/api/w3c.jigsaw.http.Client.html) [getOutputStream](User/api/w3c.jigsaw.http.Client.html#getOutputStream)
  method now returns a DataOutputStream.
* Revamped ClientPool, Client into abstract classes, etc. Check the new [Client](User/api/w3c.jigsaw.http.Client.html) and [ClientFactory](User/api/w3c.jigsaw.http.ClientFactory.html) APIs.
  This dos *not* affect any of the resources, but a set of properties
  did change in this process. All properties starting with
  w3c.jigsaw.ClientPool are now changed, check the [SocketConnectionProp](User/Reference/w3c.jigsaw.http.socket.SocketConnectionProp.html)
  resource for more infos.
* The [httpd](User/api/w3c.jigsaw.http.httpd.html) class now
  has an a new errlog method, to signal error in a homogeneous way from
  resources (it takes a resource and a message as a paragmeter):

  errlog(HTTPResource resource, String msg)
* The [Logger](User/api/w3c.jigsaw.http.Logger.html#sync)
  interface now define a sync method for asking the loggers to
  flush whatever they have back to disk.
* The [Resource](User/api/w3c.jigsaw.resources.Resource.html)
  object defines a new **store-entry** attribute, to be used by the store
  of that resource as a closure (typically caching resource stores have an
  entry for each loaded resource to keep track of lockers, etc). The
  ResourceStore interface has been changed to reflect this: all methods that
  used to take a resource identifier as a parametr can now take the resource
  instead, and find up the entry through that new attribute.
* The [DirectoryResource](User/api/w3c.jigsaw.resources.DirectoryResource.html)
  class functionalities has been splitted into two sub-classes:
  [StoreContainer](User/api/w3c.jigsaw.resources.StoreContainer.html)
  Defines a basic resource container, that keeps track of its
  children through a resource store. It doesn't know nothing about a
  file system
  [DirectoryResource](User/api/w3c.jigsaw.resources.DirectoryResource.html)
  Now extends the StoreContainer, and knows how to serve files from
  a file-system.
* The [ContainerResource](User/api/w3c.jigsaw.resources.ContainerResource.html)
  for registering children, [registerResource](User/api/w3c.jigsaw.resources.ContainerResource.html#registerResource),
  now take as a parameter an HTTPResource instead of a Resource.
* The [HTTPResource](User/api/w3c.jigsaw.resources.HTTPResource.html#perform)
  perform method has been splitted into three separate stages, to allow for
  more flexible customization of the process of performing a request:
  [filterIn](User/api/w3c.jigsaw.resources.HTTPResource.html#filterIn)
  Applies all the filters on the way in, before the request gets
  processed. If this method returns a non-null Reply, it is assumed
  that some filter knew how to generate a reply on behalf of the
  target resource (eg a RAMCacheFilter)
  [dispatch](User/api/w3c.jigsaw.resources.HTTPResource.html#dispatch)
  Dispatches the well-known HTTP methods (ie GET, POST, PUT, etc) to
  the appropaite Java methods (ie get, post, put...)
  [filterOut](User/api/w3c.jigsaw.resources.HTTPResource.html#filterOut)
  Applies all filters on the way out. If this method returns a
  non-null reply, it is assumed to subsume the original reply (as
  obtained by calling dispatch).

---

## Jigsaw 1.0alpha3

**A public release, made on October 7th, 1996.**

This release is mainly a bug fix release with regard to the [1.0alpha2](#1.0alpha2) release.

### Bug fixes

Main bug fixes are:

* The HTTP client side code has been reworked. This shouldn't affect users
  of that package, since it is mainly a rewritting of the internals of the
  HttpManager. The main problem was the managing of persistent connections,
  which is now much enhanced. The code was also cleaned up in that
  process.
* The cache garbage collector really works now ! The 1.0alpha2 cache
  garbage collector was just a proof of concept. The new garbage collector
  works by *chunking* the flow of data being cache through generation
  numbers, which allows for a much more precise garbage collections.

### New features

A small set of enhancements has been made too:

* Virtual hosts capabilities have been added, this feature supports only
  the Host based version of that feature (which doesn't consume IP
  addresses). More documentation is available [here](User/Reference/w3c.jigsaw.resources.VirtualHostResource.html).
* The [ContainerResource](User/api/w3c.jigsaw.resources.ContainerResource.html)
  is now an abstract class, much more suitable for sub-classing then the [DirectoryResource](User/api/w3c.jigsaw.resources.DirectoryResource.html).
* The [ProxyDirectory](User/Reference/w3c.jigsaw.proxy.ProxyDirectory.html)
  now has a *disconnected* mode, which allows you to connect your
  laptop from the net, get any numbers of document, disconnect from the net
  to later browse while on a trip. Check it !
* A new [MirrorDirectory](User/Reference/w3c.jigsaw.proxy.MirrorDirectory.html)
  resource has been added, that allows you to *mirror* any web site.
  This resources is a nifty subclass of the newly created [ForwardDirectory](User/Reference/w3c.jigsaw.proxy.ForwardDirectory.html)
  resource.

## Jigsaw 1.0alpha2

**A member specific release, made on September 7th, 1996.**

This member release of **Jigsaw**, version **1.0a2** is a snapshot of
what will be **Jigsaw 1.0a3**, the next public release. It has lots of
improvements, and lots of new features that you should check out:

HTTP/1.1
The server is now fully HTTP/1.1 compliant, it will still be
compatible with older, HTTP/1.0 clients.
Caching proxy
This new release includes a caching proxy module, also fully HTTP/1.1
compliant. The HTTP client side API that is used by this proxy can be
used as a replacement for the default HTTP Java handler. See the FAQ for
more infos.
New resources
A set of new resources and filters have been added to the core
distibution:
SSIResource
The server side include resource will handle standard server
side include commands. It is easily extensible in Java (make sure
you check our tutorial on how to extend it). This resource is
extremely powerfull and flexible and also impresively efficient,
we urge you to have a look at it !
Image maps
A new image map resource has been included in the release. This
adds image map support within the server in a very efficient
way.
ErrorFilter
Allows you to redefine all the error messages leaving the
server, by using internal redirection.

Enhancements
A lots of enhancements has been made to **Jigsaw** since release
**1.0a1**. Among which:
Performance tuning
Although not fully tuned yet, this release deal with some of the
bottlenecks found in older release. Inparticular, the new client
pool class allows **Jigsaw** to handle gracefully an increased
number of simultaneous connections.
Configuration
Has been enhanced in several ways. Check the /Admin directory to
see them !
CgiResource
The new support for CGI scripts is much more easy to configure
and use. It also has imrpoved a lot in terms of robustness. It has
been tested on both UNIX and Windows.
PICS support
The PICS module of **Jigsaw** has been updated to reflect the
PICS 1.1 specification.
