The provided content relates to CVE-2002-1575.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization in the `cgiemail` application. Specifically, the application fails to filter newline characters (`%0a`) within user-provided input, which is then used to construct email headers.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insufficient input validation: The application does not adequately validate user-supplied data, particularly when constructing email headers.
- Header injection:  By injecting newline characters (`%0a`), attackers can add arbitrary email header fields such as `CC:` or `BCC:`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Email spamming: Attackers can send emails to a large number of recipients without their knowledge.
- Email spoofing: By manipulating the "From:" header, attackers can make emails appear to originate from legitimate sources.
- Information disclosure: If the injected headers contain sensitive information it might leak.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request:  Attackers send malicious input via an HTTP POST request to the cgiemail application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable `cgiemail` application.
- The attacker must understand how to URL-encode a newline character (`%0a`).
- No special privileges are needed.
