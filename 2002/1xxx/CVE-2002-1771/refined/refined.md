The provided content is a README file for the FormMail script, which includes a history section detailing various changes and security fixes. Here's a breakdown of the relevant information related to CVE-2002-1771 and other vulnerabilities:

**CVE-2002-1771 Relevance**

While the CVE description is a placeholder, the provided content strongly suggests that the vulnerability fixed in version 1.91 of FormMail is related to the issues described in the advisory located at: `http://www.monkeys.com/anti-spam/formmail-advisory.pdf`. This advisory details vulnerabilities including header injection via newline characters and the use of the % character for various exploits.

**Vulnerabilities and Fixes**

*   **Header Injection via Newline Characters (Fixed in v1.91):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The script allowed newline characters in the `subject`, `email`, and `realname` form fields, which are used in the email headers.
    *   **Weakness:**  Lack of sanitization of user input used to construct email headers.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers could inject arbitrary email headers, leading to spam, spoofing, or other malicious actions by manipulating the message headers, such as setting `BCC` or `CC` fields to send messages to unintended recipients.
    *   **Attack Vector:** By including newline characters (`\n` or `\r`) within the form data for the `subject`, `email`, or `realname` fields.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to submit a crafted web form with the malicious characters in these specific form fields.

*   **Weak Regular Expression Checking (Fixed in v1.91):**
    *   **Root Cause:** In previous versions, recipient validation could be bypassed with techniques like the `%` hack, which could trick the regex to allow sending emails to unintended addresses.
    *   **Weakness:** The @recipients array could be circumvented using characters like %, <, >, (, ) or newlines.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers could use the script to send emails to arbitrary recipients, bypassing intended security measures.
    *   **Attack Vector:** By crafting recipient addresses that include the `%` character, allowing for injecting additional email addresses.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to submit crafted web forms with malicious recipient addresses.

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Fixed in v1.92):**
    *   **Root Cause:** Script displayed user supplied input on a webpage without proper sanitization.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of output encoding on the rendered form results page.
    *   **Impact:**  Attackers could inject malicious scripts into the form, which would then execute in the browsers of users viewing the form results page.
    *   **Attack Vector:** By embedding HTML markup or javascript into form field data.
    *    **Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to submit crafted web form data including HTML markup or javascript

*   **Header Injection/HTTP Response Splitting (Fixed in v1.93):**
    *  **Root Cause**: The script did not properly sanitize input in the `redirect` and `return_link_url` fields.
     * **Weakness**: Lack of sanitization of URLs.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers could manipulate HTTP response headers, leading to malicious actions such as page redirection to attacker controlled pages.
    *   **Attack Vector:** By inserting crafted values with newline characters into the `redirect` and `return_link_url` fields.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to submit crafted web form data with malicious URLs.

*   **Null Byte Injection (Fixed in v1.92):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The script didn't remove null bytes from user input.
    *   **Weakness:** Improper input sanitization.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers could use null bytes to truncate strings, potentially bypassing security checks or corrupting data.
    *   **Attack Vector:** By embedding null bytes (`\0`) in form input.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to submit crafted web form with malicious character.

**Key Points:**

*   The primary focus of the fixes is on input sanitization and validation, especially for fields used in email headers and redirect URLs.
*   The script developers gradually strengthened their regular expression checks to prevent exploitation using special characters.
*   Multiple updates were necessary to address various attack vectors, reflecting the evolving understanding of security vulnerabilities.
*   The fix for header injection involves removing newline characters from the relevant form fields.
*   The fix for the XSS vulnerability involves encoding certain characters in the output displayed on the form results page.
*   The fix for header injection in redirect and return url fields involves sanitizing special characters in URLs.

This detailed breakdown of the README file provides comprehensive insights into the vulnerabilities addressed in various FormMail versions, particularly those related to CVE-2002-1771's description if it were to be a header injection.
