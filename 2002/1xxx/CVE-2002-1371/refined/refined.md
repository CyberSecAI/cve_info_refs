Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2002-1371:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause lies in the improper handling of zero-width images within the `filters/image-gif.c` file of the CUPS (Common Unix Printing System) software.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Specifically, the vulnerability stems from a flaw in how CUPS checks for zero-width images. The check for reaching the line width is performed *after* incrementing the `xpos` variable, which allows attackers to manipulate chunk headers leading to exploitable conditions.
- The vulnerable code is in the `ImagePutRow` function where memory is allocated based on `img->xsize`.

```c
  bpp       = ImageGetDepth(img);
  pixels    = calloc(bpp, img->xsize);
...
            xpos ++;
    temp += bpp;
    if (xpos == img->xsize)
    {
      ImagePutRow(img, 0, ypos, img->xsize, pixels); ...
```

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution. The provided example shows the execution of `/tmp/sh`, indicating the ability to run attacker-controlled code.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves sending a specially crafted GIF image to the CUPS server via a printing job, where the image is processed by the vulnerable `image-gif.c` filter. The attacker has to control the image data in such a way as to exploit the zero-width check.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to submit print jobs to the CUPS server. This could be a local user or a remote attacker if the CUPS service is exposed over the network.
- It may be required to modify the exploit code slightly, depending on the specific CUPS version.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in CUPS versions up to at least 1.1.17
- The advisory mentions that the `imageto*` filters are affected. Specifically the `imagetops` filter was used in the exploit example
- An exploit named `nogif` is mentioned to trigger the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is related to image processing within the filter subsystem of CUPS, specifically when handling GIF images.

This vulnerability is listed as issue #6 in the iDEFENSE advisory, and it has been assigned the CVE ID CAN-2002-1371.
