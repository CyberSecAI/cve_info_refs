```
WS_FTP Server 4.0.3 - 4.0.5

Vulnerability : Directory Traversal
Risk          : High

Vendor        : Ipswitch
URL           : http://www.ipswitch.com

Description   : It is possible to traverse directories outside of the user's
                FTP root directory, and view or download any files on the system.
                The problem is caused by a vulnerability in the way .. characters
                are handled within the URL.

                A URL of the form :
                http://target/../../../../../../../../../../../../boot.ini
                will cause the file "boot.ini" from the system's root to be downloaded.

Fix           : Ipswitch has released WS_FTP Server 4.0.6 which corrects
                this vulnerability.
```

Based on this information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Improper handling of ".." characters within the URL, allowing directory traversal outside the user's FTP root.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Directory traversal vulnerability due to insufficient input validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server by traversing the directory structure beyond the intended FTP root directory. This could expose sensitive system files like "boot.ini".

**Attack Vectors:** Attacker crafts a malicious URL with multiple ".." sequences to navigate out of the user's directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the WS_FTP Server (presumably via a web interface). No specific user credentials are required, as the vulnerability exists within the processing of directory paths, not based on user privileges.
