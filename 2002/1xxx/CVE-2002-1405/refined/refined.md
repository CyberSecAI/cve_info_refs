Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2002-1405:

**Vulnerability:** CRLF Injection in Lynx

**Root Cause:**
- The Lynx web browser does not properly sanitize or encode special characters like space, tab, carriage return (CR), and line feed (LF) when constructing HTTP queries from a URL provided on the command line or in the `WWW_HOME` environment variable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **CRLF Injection:** The lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTTP headers by inserting a space, "HTTP/1.0", CRLF sequences, and then desired headers.
- **Bypassing Restrictions:**  Attackers can bypass Lynx's realm restrictions and `useragent` restrictions.
- **Abuse of Other Protocols:**  The vulnerability extends beyond HTTP, enabling attackers to interact with other server types such as mail (SMTP) and POP3 servers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Virtual Host Spoofing:** An attacker can manipulate the Host header in an HTTP request, potentially causing a web server to serve content from a different virtual host than intended.
- **Data Injection:** Attackers can inject arbitrary headers to modify requests. This includes injecting custom cookies, user agents, and referers.
- **Mail Server Abuse:** Send emails using injected SMTP commands, and potentially extract email data from POP3 servers.
- **Bypassing Security Restrictions:** Circumventing Lynx's intended security features, including realm restrictions and user agent restrictions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Command Line Arguments:**  A malicious URL containing injected CRLF sequences is passed to Lynx as a command line argument.
- **`WWW_HOME` Environment Variable:**  The `WWW_HOME` variable is set with a malicious URL containing injected CRLF sequences.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to influence the URL used by Lynx, either through command-line parameters or environment variables.
- If the attack is targeting a web server with virtual hosts, the attacker needs to know other valid virtual hosts that share the same IP as the intended target.

**Technical Details:**
- The injected CRLF sequence terminates the intended headers, which causes the web server to disregard any headers that are included by Lynx.
- The injected header can be used to specify a different host to the web server, if multiple hosts are configured.
- It is also possible to inject headers to interact with other types of servers (e.g., mail servers).

**Additional Information from the provided content:**

- A patch for the vulnerability is available.
- The vulnerability affects Lynx versions prior to 2.8.4rel.1, if all patches are not applied. Specifically mentioned vulnerable versions include 2.8.4rel.1, 2.8.5dev.8, 2.8.3rel.1, 2.8.2rel.1.

**Example Exploits:**
- Perl exploit is provided to demonstrate manipulating the Host header.
- Bash command line exploit also demonstrates manipulating the Host header.
- Examples for sending arbitrary User-Agent, Referer and Cookies are provided.
- Examples for sending emails using SMTP and reading emails from POP3 are also provided.
