Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2002-1394:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises from the interaction between the invoker servlet and the default servlet in Apache Tomcat 4.0.x and 4.1.x. When used together, a specially crafted URL can bypass security checks and allow access to unprocessed JSP source code or static resources.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **JSP Source Code Disclosure:** The primary weakness is the ability to retrieve the raw, unprocessed source code of JSP pages.
*   **Bypassing Security Constraints:**  Under certain circumstances, static resources protected by security constraints could be accessed without proper authentication.
*   **Invoker Servlet Misuse:** The invoker servlet, when enabled, allows the execution of servlets by name, and the default servlet name, when used in this way, does not have the same security controls applied as when called directly via its servlet mapping.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** Attackers can gain access to sensitive application logic and potentially configuration details embedded in JSP files.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers may be able to access static resources intended to be protected, potentially leading to further information disclosure or other security issues.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Specially Crafted URLs:** The attack is triggered by sending a specially crafted URL to the vulnerable Tomcat server.
*   **Invoker Servlet:** The invoker servlet needs to be enabled for the vulnerability to be exploited using the default servlet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Tomcat server.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any prior authentication.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable URL Structure:** The attacker needs to know how to construct the malicious URL.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Tomcat 4.0.x (including 4.0.5) and 4.1.x prior to 4.1.12, unless the invoker servlet is disabled. Tomcat 4.1.12 is also vulnerable if the invoker servlet has been enabled.
*   The fix involves either disabling the invoker servlet, or applying a patch, or upgrading to Tomcat 4.0.6 or later (for 4.0.x).
*   The original fix only blocked access via class names and failed to block access via servlet names, so an attacker could invoke the default servlet via its name instead of its class name.
