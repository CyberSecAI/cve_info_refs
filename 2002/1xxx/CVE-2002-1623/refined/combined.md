## Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocol discloses identity when Aggressive Mode shared secret authentication is used

#### Vulnerability Note VU#886601

Original Release Date: 2002-09-12 | Last Revised: 2003-04-04

---

### Overview

The Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocol discloses username information when Aggressive Mode is used for shared secret authentication.

### Description

| The Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocol provides a negotiation mechanism that allows an initiator to establish an encrypted session with a responder. Many firewall and Virtual Private Network (VPN) products use IKE; check your product documentation to determine which modes and authentication methods are used by your product.  By design, the IKE protocol does not encrypt the identities of the initiator or responder when performing shared secret authentication in Aggressive Mode. Depending upon your site configuration and need for identity protection, this design choice may represent a vulnerability to your organization. |
| --- |

### Impact

| Devices that implement this protocol as specified will leak username information while negotiating IKE sessions. This information may be useful for conducting reconnaissance on networks containing an affected device. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Use an alternative mode and authentication method**The IKE protocol provides many options for both connection mode and authentication method; several combinations provide identity protection. For example, both Main Mode with shared secret authentication and Aggressive Mode with public key authentication provide identity protection. |

### [Apple Computer Inc.](#JPLA-5E4NF3) Affected

Notified:  September 17, 2002  Updated: September 20, 2002

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

Mac OS X 10.2 (Jaguar) supports the IKE protocol. IKE is turned off by default, and there is no easy way to enable its operation in our default system configuration. There are no components in Mac OS X that make use of IKE. The Aggressive Mode negotiation mode of IKE is a protocol that certain users may wish to use in certain circumstances, and we do not at this time plan to remove this standard protocol from Mac OS X.

### Vendor Information

The vendor has not provided us with any further information regarding this vulnerability.

### [Check Point](#JPLA-5DMNVY) Affected

Check Point Statement on use of IKE Aggressive Mode

A document has recently been published alleging vulnerabilities in the Check Point VPN-1/FireWall-1 product, involving the use of SecuRemote/SecureClient and IKE Aggressive mode. Check Point does not recommend the use of IKE Aggressive Mode, because of many well-known limitations in the protocol, and the Check Point products offer much more secure alternatives.

In the vulnerability claim document, two issues were presented:
 1) usernames are passed in cleartext using IKE Aggressive Mode
 2) usernames are susceptible to brute-force guessing when using IKE Aggressive Mode

The first item is merely an accurate description of the IKE protocol. Check Point has no bug or vulnerability, but has correctly implemented the IKE standard for Aggressive Mode. The passing of usernames in cleartext is common to any vendors of IKE products who support Aggressive Mode. The claim of a vulnerability is incorrect.

Because of such well-known weaknesses in the IKE Aggressive Mode standard, Check Point authored and published an extension called Hybrid Mode which allows the secure use of all supported authentication schemes (e.g., RADIUS or TACACS) without sending usernames in cleartext. This extension has been incorporated in the product since the 4.1 SP1 release (February 2000), with
hybrid mode recommended over Aggressive Mode for enhanced security.

The second item exists only in VPN-1/FireWall-1 v4.1 modules which are still configured to support SecuRemote/SecureClient connections using IKE Aggressive Mode, despite the availability of more secure options in the product. Note, again, that the guessable usernames in this scenario are, by design of the IKE protocol, sent in cleartext. By default, Aggressive Mode is not enabled in NG. In 4.1, the recommended configuration is to disable Aggressive Mode and use Hybrid Mode instead (which involves no change to the user experience).

### [KAME Project](#JPLA-5EQRD2) Affected

Notified:  September 24, 2002  Updated: October 15, 2002

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

Though it is true that, with aggressive mode, identification data will be transmitted in clear, identification data can be anything - it is just a string. It doesn't necessarily reflect any of user accounts on a system.

For our implementation, the identification data is just a string, and has no relationship whatsoever with UNIX accounts or other sensitive data. Also, the shared secret used for shared secret authentication is totally separate from UNIX passwords. (of course, if a user chooses to configure identification string/shared secret to be equal to UNIX account name/password, it can be done)

So the severity really depends on how a user configures our program.

## **Vulnerability Management for a Variety of Industries**

Nearly every industry relies on applications and networks to conduct business, though some have more stringent security requirements than others. Organizations in the aviation, automotive, healthcare, and financial sectors have some of the strongest security regulations. Layers of security during software and application development as well as after product deployment are necessary to keep consumers safe and organizations compliant.

![airplane icon](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilitiesaviation.png)

### [Aviation](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guides/aviation-software-testing-guide)

Cybersecurity is crucial to the aviation industry. Travelers in the sky need to be protected from any attacks that can prevent airlines from operating normally. Those same customers need to have their payment and sensitive data protected when purchasing a ticket.

### [Automotive](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guide/how-fuzz-testing-helps-secure-automotive-industry)

Wireless connectivity is becoming commonplace inside of new vehicles. Automotive connectivity to WIFI and Bluetooth are making vehicles a bigger target for cybercriminals. One vulnerability can take down any vehicle with that technology. DAST, Black Box Fuzzing, and SAST during development are a solid foundation of security to prevent these attacks.

![](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-automative.png)

![heartbeat](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-healthcare.png)

### [Healthcare and Medical](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guides/security-testing-for-networked-medical-devices)

Wireless technology and application software are being used more in medical devices to automate and monitor individual healthcare needs. Device security is the utmost priority, preventing risks that can directly endanger lives. Application security is needed to prevent cyber attackers from tampering with devices and stealing private healthcare data. SAST and DAST during development can help find vulnerabilities that can compromise these devices.

### Critical Infrastructure and Industrial Facilities

Water, power, and gas are some prime targets for large scale attacks. The best way to keep cyberattackers from taking down an entire city’s water supply is to create a layered cybersecurity portfolio. From the start, vulnerabilities need to be identified, remediated, and constantly monitored to prevent a mass standstill of public utilities.

![factory](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-manufactures.png)

### Discrete Manufacturers

Manufacturing industries keep building and assembling essential pieces for everyday life. Any attack on that automation would create a bottleneck in multiple industries that rely on these products. A disruption in manufacturing has been proven to drive up prices and create a negative workflow ripple worldwide. Using layered security solutions prior to deployment and scanning afterwards will help prevent any shutdown.

### Financial

Financial institutions are still top cyberattacker targets. Monetary apps for banks, credit unions, investment, and retirement firms need the highest cybersecurity measures. Security that prevents cyberattacks should be implemented during development and embedded directly into these applications. Compliance for this industry is only growing with each reported breach.

Subject:    [RE: SecuRemote usernames can be guessed or sniffed using IKE](?t=103106975200016&r=1&w=2)
From:       [Roy Hills <Roy.Hills () nta-monitor ! com>](?a=90367132600011&r=1&w=2)
Date:       [2002-09-11 11:16:13](?l=bugtraq&r=1&w=2&b=200209)
[Download RAW [message](?l=bugtraq&m=103176164729351&q=mbox) or [body](?l=bugtraq&m=103176164729351&q=raw)]

Here's my response to Checkpoint's statement on this IKE username
sniffing and guessing issue:

Regarding the usernames en clair issue, I agree that the problem is at least
partly a limitation in IKE aggressive mode as was stated in the original
article at <http://www.nta-monitor.com/news/checkpoint.htm>.  However, the
fact that the issue is due to the underlying protocol rather than the
implementation does not mean that there is no vulnerability.

The problem here is mainly one of user awareness - how many people were
aware that the SecuRemote usernames were passed in the clear if IKE was
used with shared secrets? This doesn't seem to be mentioned in the NG FP2
Checkpoint Desktop Security Guide which covers Firewall configuration for
SecuRemote, and the management client GUI dialogs don't mention it either.

Does anyone know if this is mentioned in the Checkpoint documentation
anywhere?  Perhaps I missed it.

If the product supports a method of operation which has known security issues,
then I think that this should be pointed out to the user so that they can make
an informed decision.

Regarding the username guessing issue, this is also partly a user awareness
issue - Checkpoint rightly say that there are more secure options available,
but if this is not pointed out then people won't know to use these more secure
options.  The fact that aggressive mode (and therefore IKE with shared secret
auth) is disabled by default in NG FP1 and FP2 is a good move, although I have
found many customers who are running NG FP2 with this enabled - presumably
because they were using IKE with shared secret auth before and found that they
needed to turn this on to "get it working".

Although IKE Hybrid mode addresses the username en clair issue discussed
above, I'm not sure if it also addresses the username guessing issue or not.
The fact that the authentication details are encrypted with Hybrid mode
doesn't by itself protect it from guessing attacks because the exploit code
could easily do the necessary encryption in the same way the
SecuRemote client does.

Note that aggressive mode is _not_ disabled by default in Firewall-1 NG
(build 50046) but it _is_ disabled by default in NG FP2 and I suspect it is
also disabled by default in NG FP1.  Also, although v4.1 has an "allow
aggressive mode" checkbox which is enabled by default, it's not possible
to disable it - even if you disable aggressive mode on v4.1 and re-install
the policy, the Firewall still responds to aggressive mode requests.

In addition to the user awareness issue, there are also some product design
issues which could help to reduce the impact of the username guessing issue
and also other similar authentication issues which may be discovered in the
future. In all the items below, I'm talking mainly about IKE usernames (IDs)
and passwords (shared secrets), although many of the items are also
applicable to other authentication methods such as Firewall-1 password.

1.  For username/password auth, don't respond with an "OK/Not OK" message
until the user has submitted the password as well as the username, and then
don't tell the user which one was wrong - just give a generic authentication
failure message.

Sure, this will require some resources on the Firewall, but not much, and if
resources get tight you could always drop those half-completed authentications
where the username was invalid rather than valid authentication attempts.

Note that, judging from the significant CPU resources used on the Firewall with
invalid user authentication attempts (95% CPU on an 800MHz AMD CPU with a
packet rate of about 67 per second) suggests that the Firewall is doing some
expensive operations anyway - probably the Diffie Hellman exponentiation - so
continuing with the authentication process wouldn't make this any worse.

2.  Limit the rate of authentication attempts from any given IP address.
Sure, this won't stop DoS attacks that try to exhaust CPU or other resources,
but it would make guessing much less fruitful.  At the moment, there appears to
be no rate limit - I've observed over 450 guesses per second over an Ethernet
link with a fast Firewall CPU.  I suspect that this lack of rate limiting
applies to passwords as well as usernames, although I've only checked
username guessing.

3.  Enforce user-configurable password strength checks with reasonable defaults
E.g. allow specification of minimum password length and other password strength
factors such as preventing letters only, numbers only, password = username,
dictionary word Etc.  Most OSes let you do this.  Firewall-1 allows you to put
anything in the IKE secret (password) e.g. a single letter or the same as the
username.

Enforcing good password practice would greatly reduce the chance of a
successful password guess once the username was guessed.  You'd be
surprised (or maybe not) on how many passwords we find the same as the
username during our security tests.

4.  Allow user-configurable password aging
I guess this would need some client password change mechanism, but forcing
the client to regularly change passwords would limit the impact of guessed
usernames and passwords somewhat.  This is standard practice in most
modern OSes and is often set somewhere between 30 and 90 days.

5.  Allow account lockout after a number of failed attempts
Firewall-1 does not seem to allow account lockout - it's possible to fail
authentication many times and still have a chance to successfully authenticate
on the next attempt.  Having account lockout configured would make
password guessing pretty much worthless for an attacker.

This account lockout is also standard practice in most modern OSes.  A
value of around 5 for this is fairly common.

Check Point Statement on use of IKE Aggressive Mode:

A document has recently been published alleging vulnerabilities in the Check
Point VPN-1/FireWall-1 product, involving the use of SecuRemote/SecureClient
and IKE Aggressive mode.  Check Point does not recommend the use of IKE
Aggressive Mode, because of many well-known limitations in the protocol, and
the Check Point products offer much more secure alternatives.

In the vulnerability claim document, two issues were presented:
  1) usernames are passed in cleartext using IKE Aggressive Mode
  2) usernames are susceptible to brute-force guessing when using IKE
Aggressive Mode

The first item is merely an accurate description of the IKE protocol. Check
Point has no bug or vulnerability, but has correctly implemented the IKE
standard for Aggressive Mode.  The passing of usernames in cleartext is
common to any vendors of IKE products who support Aggressive Mode.  The
claim of a vulnerability is incorrect.

Because of such well-known weaknesses in the IKE Aggressive Mode standard,
Check Point authored and published an extension called Hybrid Mode which
allows the secure use of all supported authentication schemes (e.g., RADIUS
or TACACS) without sending usernames in cleartext.  This extension has been
incorporated in the product since the 4.1 SP1 release (February 2000), with
hybrid mode recommended over Aggressive Mode for enhanced security.

The second item exists only in VPN-1/FireWall-1 v4.1 modules which are still
configured to support SecuRemote/SecureClient connections using IKE
Aggressive Mode, despite the availability of more secure options in the
product.  Note, again, that the guessable usernames in this scenario are, by
design of the IKE protocol, sent in cleartext.  By default, Aggressive Mode
is not enabled in NG.  In 4.1, the recommended configuration is to disable
Aggressive Mode and use Hybrid Mode instead (which involves no change to the
user experience).

This information, and any subsequent updates, will be posted to
[www.checkpoint.com/techsupport/alerts](http://www.checkpoint.com/techsupport/alerts) .

> SecuRemote usernames can be guessed or sniffed using IKE exchange
>
> Introduction:
> -------------
>
> While performing a VPN security analysis for one of our
> customers, I discovered
> a potential issue with Firewall-1 SecuRemote IKE which can allow
> usernames
> to be guessed.
> I also observed the related issue that the SecuRemote IKE usernames are
> passed in the clear
> which allows them to be discovered by network sniffing.
>
> Full details of this issue are available at:
>
> <http://www.nta-monitor.com/news/checkpoint.htm>
>
> Issue summary:
> --------------
>
> Firewall-1 versions 4.0 SP 7, 4.1 SP2, 4.1 SP6, NG Base, NG FP1
> and NG FP2
> allow
> username guessing using IKE aggressive mode.  I have only tested against
> the specific
> versions shown but I suspect that the issue affects all versions from 4.0
> to NG FP2.
>
> Note that 4.1 SP2 and NG FP1 are ITsec E3 certified versions of
> Firewall-1
> when used in
> the appropriate configuration.
>
> When presented with a username in an appropriately formatted IKE
> aggressive
> mode packet,
> the Firewall will respond differently depending on whether the
> username is
> valid or not.  This
> allows usernames to be guessed using a dictionary attack.  Versions up to
> NG base also provide
> additional information about accounts that exist but are not
> valid for IKE
> for some reason; NG
> FP1 and FP2 do not provide this extra information although they still
> indicate if the user is valid
> or not.
>
> Checkpoint and CERT have been informed of this issue.
>
>
> Configuration:
> --------------
>
> Firewall is Firewall-1 v4.1 SP6 VPN+DES+STRONG on Windows NT
> Server 4.0 SP6a
> using local user database (not using LDAP; no "generic*" user).
>
> I have also confirmed the issue on Firewall-1 4.0 SP7, NG Base,
> NG FP1 and
> NG FP2.  All
> running on Windows NT.
>
> Client is Debian Linux 3.0 ("woody") with 2.4.18 kernel running
> proprietary
> IKE username guessing
> program which was written in C.
>
>
> Issue Details:
> --------------
>
> If we send an IKE Phase-1 aggressive mode packet with the
> following payloads:
>
> a) ISAKMP Header
> b) SA - Containing one proposal with four transforms
> c) Key Exchange - DH Group 2
> d) Nonce
> e) Identification - Type ID_USER_FQDN, Value is SecuRemote username
>
> The Firewall will either send back an IKE notification message indicating
> that the user is not
> valid in some way, or it will respond with an aggressive mode packet
> indicating that the user
> exists and is valid.  This is contrary to accepted security
> practice not to
> indicate if
> credentials are valid until all credentials have been supplied,
> and in the
> event that credentials
> are not valid, not to indicate which credentials are in error.
>
> Below is the usage message from the program that was used to generate the
> examples
> so you can understand the options being used:
>
> rsh@radon$ fw1-ike-userguess --help
> Usage: fw1-ike-userguess [options] <hostname>
>
> <hostname> is name or IP address of Firewall.
>
> Options:
>
> --file=<fn> or -f <fn>  Read usernames from file <fn>, one per line.
> --help or -h            Display this help message and exit.
> --id=<id> or -i <id>    Use string <id> as SecuRemote username.
> --sport=<p> or -s <p>   Set UDP source port to <p>.  Default 500.
>  0=random.
> --dport=<p> or -d <p>   Set UDP dest. port to <p>.  Default 500.
> --timeout=<n> or -t <n> Set timeout to <n> ms.  Default 2000.
> --random=<n> or -r <n>  Set random seed to <n>.  Default is based on time
>                          Used to generate key exchange and nonce data.
> --version or -V         Display program version and exit.
> --idtype=n or -y n      Use identification type <n>.  Default 3
> (ID_USER_FQDN)
>                          For Checkpoint SecuRemote VPN, this must
> be set to 3.
> --dhgroup=n or -g n     Use Diffie Hellman Group <n>.  Default 2
>                          Acceptable values are 1,2 and 5 (MODP only).
