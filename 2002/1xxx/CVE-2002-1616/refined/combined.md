### Overview

The HP Tru64 Unix operating system contains multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities.

### Description

| A vulnerability exists in the way in which the libc libraries handle environment variables in the [HP Tru64 UNIX](http://www.tru64unix.compaq.com/) operating system. As a result, local attackers may be able to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges, using several different binaries that make use of the vulnerable library. For more information, please see [SSRT2257](http://ftp.support.compaq.com/patches/public/Readmes/unix/duv40fb18-c0067403-14947-es-20020730.README). |
| --- |

### Impact

| Local attackers can execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Apply a patch. You may also wish to see the following douments.
