The provided content is related to CVE-2002-1166.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in WN Server due to insufficient bounds checking when handling long GET requests.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Buffer overflow in the handling of GET requests
- Lack of proper input validation, specifically for the length of the URI in the GET request.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the targeted server.
- Potential for further privilege escalation.
- Server crashes (which is a less severe result)

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a specially crafted GET request with an excessively long URI

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to send network requests to the vulnerable WN server
- Requires crafting shellcode to bypass URI character filters

**Additional Information:**
- The advisory provides a method to test if an implementation of WN is vulnerable.
- The advisory indicates that the vulnerability exists in WN Server versions 1.18.2 through 2.0.0
- The vendor released a patched version, WN Server 2.4.4.
- The vulnerability is triggered by a long GET request.
- The content provides more details than the description in the CVE record, including a test method, exploit example, vulnerable versions, and patch version.
