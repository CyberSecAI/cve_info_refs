- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A classic stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists within the Oracle iSQL*Plus web application.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the iSQL*Plus web application. The application fails to properly validate the length of the user ID parameter submitted during login, which allows a user to overwrite the return address on the stack.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the security context of the web server. On most systems, this would be the "oracle" user and on Windows, the "SYSTEM" user, granting significant control over the system. This allows for further attacks against the database server.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the iSQL*Plus web application interface, specifically when logging in. By sending an overly long user ID parameter, an attacker can trigger the overflow.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to access the iSQL*Plus login page, typically by knowing the URL "/isqlplus". They don't need valid user credentials to trigger the vulnerability.
