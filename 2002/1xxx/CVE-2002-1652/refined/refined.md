Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2002-1652 (Note: the provided content from CERT does not list this CVE ID, but the vulnerability described matches CVE-2002-1652)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a buffer overflow in the `cgicso.c` component of the `cgiemail` web-based email system. The program does not adequately validate user input when processing data submitted through web forms, leading to the overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a buffer overflow. This occurs because the application doesn't properly check the length of user-supplied data before copying it into a fixed-size buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the web server. This code runs with the privileges of the web server process.
- **Complete System Compromise:**  Because the attacker can run arbitrary code, they may take complete control of the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability is triggered via HTTP requests to the web server, where the attacker provides the malicious input through web forms.
- **Web forms:** The cgiemail application processes data from web forms submitted by HTTP clients, making it a direct attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server running the vulnerable `cgiemail` application.
- **Basic HTTP knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand how to construct HTTP requests and submit data through web forms.
- **Ability to Craft Malicious Input:** The attacker needs to create a payload that exceeds the buffer size of the `cgicso.c` component to cause the buffer overflow.

**Additional Notes:**
- The CERT advisory states there is "no practical solution to this problem" except to remove the vulnerable software.
- The vulnerability was reported by Security Tracker.

**Summary:**

The `cgiemail` web-based email system is vulnerable to a buffer overflow in its `cgicso.c` component due to inadequate input validation. This vulnerability can be exploited by sending malicious data through web forms via HTTP requests, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the web server with the privileges of the web server process. The only practical solution recommended by CERT is to remove the vulnerable application.
