- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper bounds checking on HTTP headers.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of proper bounds checking for HTTP header fields, specifically when processing the 'Host' header field or other HTTP fields with large sizes.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can cause the webserver to crash by sending a specially crafted HTTP request with a large header.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a malformed HTTP request with a large header field, specifically the "Host" header field with 796 characters or more, or other HTTP fields with sizes of 4K or more.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker can be remote and needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
