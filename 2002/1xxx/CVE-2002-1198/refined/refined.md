The provided content relates to CVE-2002-1198.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of apostrophes in email addresses during account creation in Bugzilla. Specifically, when a user includes an apostrophe in their email address, it is not correctly escaped in the SQL query used to store the email. This can cause issues with user authentication and prevent the user from receiving email notifications.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection. Because the apostrophe is not properly escaped, an attacker can potentially inject malicious SQL code by including a specially crafted email address containing an apostrophe.
- **Improper Input Handling:** The vulnerability arises from incorrect input validation and handling of special characters in user-provided email addresses.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data Manipulation**: An attacker could potentially use SQL injection to manipulate data in the Bugzilla database.
- **Account Hijacking:** While not explicitly stated, the bug report suggests this vulnerability could have been used for account hijacking, which was the original intention of the vulnerable code.
- **Denial of Service**: While not mentioned, the possibility of exploiting the vulnerability to cause a denial of service also exists.
- **Loss of email functionality:** The immediate issue presented is that users with apostrophes in their email addresses will not receive email notifications from Bugzilla.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the account creation form. A malicious user can provide a specially crafted email address containing an apostrophe, which would then be processed by the vulnerable SQL query.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to access the account creation form of the vulnerable Bugzilla instance.
- No special privileges are required, as the attack is performed on a public facing service.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was fixed in Bugzilla versions 2.16.1 and 2.14.4.
- The fix involves properly escaping or handling the apostrophe when building the SQL query.
- The vulnerability is related to a previous change to enable users to change email addresses, and caused a regression.
