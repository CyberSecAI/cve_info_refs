## GNU screen contains buffer overflow

#### Vulnerability Note VU#524227

Original Release Date: 2003-05-30 | Last Revised: 2003-07-14

---

### Overview

A locally exploitable buffer overflow exists in GNU screen. An exploit is publicly available for this vulnerability.

### Description

| The Free Software Foundation [describes](http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/screen.html) GNU Screen as follows:  Screen is a full-screen window manager that multiplexes a physical terminal between several processes, typically interactive shells. Each virtual terminal provides the functions of the DEC VT100 terminal and, in addition, several control functions from the ANSI X3.64 (ISO 6429) and ISO 2022 standards (e.g., insert/delete line and support for multiple character sets). There is a scrollback history buffer for each virtual terminal and a copy-and-paste mechanism that allows the user to move text regions between windows. When screen is called, it creates a single window with a shell in it (or the specified command) and then gets out of your way so that you can use the program as you normally would. Then, at any time, you can create new (full-screen) windows with other programs in them (including more shells), kill the current window, view a list of the active windows, turn output logging on and off, copy text between windows, view the scrollback history, switch between windows, etc. All windows run their programs completely independent of each other. Programs continue to run when their window is currently not visible and even when the whole screen session is detached from the users terminal.The buffer overflow exists in GNU Screen's braille module. [According to the GNU Screen maintainers](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/gnu-screen/message/981), this buffer overflow is only exploitable if HAVE\_BRAILLE is defined in config.h. |
