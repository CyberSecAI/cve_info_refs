The provided content is a link to a PDF document. Without analyzing the document, it is impossible to determine if it is related to CVE-2002-1636. However, the link has a URL parameter `fp=-3`, which suggests the document might be related to some kind of file processing or filter bypass. 

Since I cannot analyze the PDF document, I will respond with NOINFO.
