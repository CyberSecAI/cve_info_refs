ISC is aware of several bugs which can result in serious vulnerabilities in
BIND as distributed by ISC.  More information about these vulnerabilities
can be found here:

<http://www.isc.org/products/BIND/bind-security.html>

Upgrading to BIND version 9.2.1 is strongly recommended.  However, patches
are available from ISC and new BIND 4 & 8 releases will be forthcoming.

Questions on obtaining the patches should be directed to the Executive
Director of ISC <Lynda_McGinley@isc.org>.

## Overly large OPT record assertion

#### Vulnerability Note VU#229595

Original Release Date: 2002-11-13 | Last Revised: 2003-05-30

---

### Overview

A remotely exploitable denial-of-service vulnerability exists in BIND. Based on recent reports, we believe this vulnerability is being actively exploited.

### Description

| A remotely exploitable denial-of-service vulnerability exists in BIND 8.3.0 - 8.3.3. ISC's [description](http://www.isc.org/products/BIND/bind-security.html) of this vulnerability states:  When constucting [sic] a response a NXDOMAIN response to a ENDS query with a large UDP size it is possible to trigger an assertion. |
| --- |

### Impact

| The BIND daemon will shut down. As a result, clients will not be able to connect to the service to resolve queries. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Apply a patch from your vendor. In the absence of a patch, you may wish to consider ISC's recommendation, which is upgrading to "BIND 4.9.11, BIND 8.2.7, BIND 8.3.4 or preferably BIND 9." Additionally, ISC indicates, "BIND 4 is officially deprecated. Only security fixes will be issued for BIND 4." |
| --- |

| Disable recursion if possible. |

Older releases (6.2, 7.0) of Red Hat Linux shipped with versions of BIND which may be vulnerable to these issues however a Red Hat security advisory in July 2002 upgraded all our supported distributions to BIND 9.2.1 which is not vulnerable to these issues.

All users who have BIND installed should ensure that they are running these updated versions of BIND.

Package:             bind, bind8
Vulnerability:       denial of service, arbitrary code execution
OpenPKG Specific:    no

OpenPKG CURRENT      <= bind8-8.3.3-2002082 >= bind8-8.3.3-20021114

Description:
  The Internet Software Consortium (ISC) [1] has discovered or has been
  notified of several bugs which can result in vulnerabilities of varying
  levels of severity in BIND [2][3]. These problems include buffer overflows,
  stack revealing, divide by zero, null pointer dereferencing, and more [4].
  A subset of these vulnerabilities exist in the BIND packages distributed by
  OpenPKG.

  Please check whether you are affected by running "<prefix>/bin/rpm -qa |
  grep bind". If you have an affected version of the "bind" or "bind8" package
  (see above), upgrade it according to the solution below.

Workaround:
  Because disabling recursion or disabling DNSSEC is a workaround to only a
  subset of the aforementioned problems, it is not a recommended aproach.

Solution:
  Since these vulnerabilities do not exist in BIND version 9.2.1, one solution
  simply involves upgrading to it. The packages bind-9.2.1-1.1.0 in OpenPKG
  1.1 [5], and bind-9.2.1-20021111 in OpenPKG CURRENT [6] are both candidates
  in this respect. Be warned that although such later versions of BIND are
  stable, there exist large differences between BIND 8 and BIND 9 software.

  A lighter approach involves updating existing packages to newly patched
  versions of BIND 8. Select the updated source RPM appropriate
  for your OpenPKG release [7][8][9], and fetch it from the OpenPKG FTP service
  or a mirror location. Verify its integrity [10], build a corresponding
  binary RPM from it and update your OpenPKG installation by applying the
  binary RPM [11]. For the latest OpenPKG 1.1 release, perform the following
  operations to permanently fix the security problem (for other releases
  adjust accordingly).

  $ ftp ftp.openpkg.org
  ftp> bin
  ftp> cd release/1.1/UPD
  ftp> get bind8-8.3.3-1.1.1.src.rpm
  ftp> bye
  $ <prefix>/bin/rpm -v --checksig bind8-8.3.3-1.1.1.src.rpm
  $ <prefix>/bin/rpm --rebuild bind8-8.3.3-1.1.1.src.rpm
  $ su -

  ISS X-Force has found a number of problems in all BIND 8 series up to
  and including 8.2.6 and 8.3.3.  Two of these can cause BIND to crash
  causing a denial of service attack, whereas the last can be used to
  execute arbitary code on the victim.

Action:
  We recommend that all systems with this package installed be upgraded.
  Please note that if you do not need the functionality provided by this

Trustix Secure Linux Security Advisory #2002-0076

Package name:      bind
Summary:           Remote exploit
Date:              2002-11-15
Affected versions: TSL 1.1, 1.2, 1.5

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
Package description:
  BIND (Berkeley Internet Name Domain) is an implementation of the DNS
  (Domain Name System) protocols. BIND includes a DNS server (named),
  which resolves host names to IP addresses, and a resolver library
  (routines for applications to use when interfacing with DNS).

Problem description:
  ISS X-Force has found a number of problems in all BIND 8 series up to
  and including 8.2.6 and 8.3.3.  Two of these can cause BIND to crash
  causing a denial of service attack, whereas the last can be used to
  execute arbitary code on the victim.

Action:
  We recommend that all systems with this package installed be upgraded.
  Please note that if you do not need the functionality provided by this
  package, you may want to remove it from your system.

Location:
  All TSL updates are available from
  <URI:<http://www.trustix.net/pub/Trustix/updates/>>
  <URI:ftp://ftp.trustix.net/pub/Trustix/updates/>

About Trustix Secure Linux:
  Trustix Secure Linux is a small Linux distribution for servers. With focus on
  security and stability, the system is painlessly kept safe and up to date
  from day one using swup, the automated software updater.

  installed using 'swup --upgrade'.

  Get SWUP from:
  <URI:ftp://ftp.trustix.net/pub/Trustix/software/swup/>

Public testing:
  These packages have been available for public testing for some time.
  If you want to contribute by testing the various packages in the
  testing tree, please feel free to share your findings on the
  tsl-discuss mailinglist.

## History

The CERT Division is the birthplace of cybersecurity. For nearly 30 years, the CERT Division of the SEI has partnered with government, industry, law enforcement, and academia to advance cybersecurity and improve the security and resilience of computer systems and networks.

Originally focused on incident response, we have expanded into cybersecurity areas such as network situational awareness, malicious code analysis, secure coding, resilience management, insider threats, digital investigations and intelligence, workforce development, DevOps, forensics, software assurance, vulnerability discovery and analysis, and risk management.

## Former Director Richard Pethia

[Richard Pethia](/about/leadership/display.cfm?customel_datapageid_2623=3545) was founding director of the SEI's CERT Division. Pethia, who served as director of CERT from 1988 to 2016, guided the organization through tremendous growth and change. Under Pethia's leadership, the unit expanded and evolved from the CERT Coordination Center—a small group focused on computer incident response—to a research organization of more than 200 professionals dedicated to solving problems with widespread cybersecurity implications.
