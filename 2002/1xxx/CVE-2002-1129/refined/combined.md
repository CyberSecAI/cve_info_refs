I did send an non-formal release of the information in which did go into
explicit detail.... <http://online.securityfocus.com/archive/1/290115> if
you did not open the .tar file contained within I will paste the
important information below...

I certainly stand corrected on the -xrm and -s long strings to uucp and
dxterm...

Also for those of you not aware the exploits are available on our web
site...
