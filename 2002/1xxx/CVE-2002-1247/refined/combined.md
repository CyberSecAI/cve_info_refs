KDE Security Advisory: resLISa / LISa Vulnerabilities
Original Release Date: 2002-11-11
URL: <http://www.kde.org/info/security/advisory-20021111-2.txt>

0. References

        iDEFENSE Security Advisory 11.11.02
        (<http://www.idefense.com/advisory/11.11.02.txt>).

1. Systems affected:

        All KDE 2 releases from KDE 2.1 and all KDE 3 releases (up to
        3.0.4 and 3.1rc3).

2. Overview:

        The kdenetwork module of KDE contains a LAN browsing implementation
        known as LISa, which is used to identify CIFS and other servers on
        the local network.  LISa consists of two main modules, "lisa", a
        network daemon, and "reslisa", a restricted version of the lisa
        daemon.  LISa can be accessed in KDE using the URL type "lan://",
        and resLISa using the URL type "rlan://".

        LISA will obtain information on the local network by looking for an
        existing LISA server on other local hosts, and if there is one,
        retrieves the list of servers from it.  If there is no other LISA
        server, it will scan the network and create as server list.

        The browser daemon 'lisa' is typically configured to start as a
        system service at system boot time.

        resLISa is a restricted version of LISa which uses a configuration
        file to identify hosts on the network rather than scanning for
        them.  resLISa is typically installed SUID root and started by a user
        to browse the confitured network servers.  However, it does not
        directly communicate with servers on the network.

3. Impact:

        The resLISa daemon contains a buffer overflow vulnerability which
        potentially enables any local user to obtain access to a raw socket
        if 'reslisa' is installed SUID root.  This vulnerability was
        discovered by the iDEFENSE security team and Texonet.

        The lisa daemon contains a buffer overflow vulnerability which
        potentially enables any local user, as well any any remote attacker
        on the LAN who is able to gain control of the LISa port (7741 by
        default), to obtain root privileges.

        In addition, a remote attacker potentially may be able to gain
        access to a victim's account by using an "lan://" URL in an HTML
        page or via another KDE application.  These vulnerabilities were
        discovered by Olaf Kirch at SuSE Linux AG.

4. Solution:

        The vulnerabilities have been fixed in KDE 3.0.5 and patches
        are available for those using KDE 3.0.4.  We recommend either
        upgrading to KDE 3.0.5, applying the patches or disabling the
        resLISa and LISa services.

        The resLISa vulnerability can be disabled by unsetting the SUID bit
        on resLISa.  Typically this is accomplished by executing the command:

          chmod a-s `which reslisa`

        Note that this will prevent users from using the resLISa service.

        The first LISa vulnerability can be disabled by disabling the LISa
        service.  Typically this is accomplished by executing the commands:

          /etc/init.d/lisa stop
          rm /etc/init.d/lisa `which lisa`

        or

          rpm -e kdenetwork-lisa

        However, the appropriate commands depend on your vendor's OS and how
        the various components of kdenetwork were packaged.

        The second LISa vulnerability can be disabled by deleting any
        lan.protocol and rlan.protocol files on the system and restarting
        the active KDE sessions.  The files are usually installed in
        [kdeprefix]/share/services/lan.protocol and
        [kdeprefix]/share/services/rlan.protocol  ([kdeprefix] is typically
        /opt/kde3 or /usr), but copies may exist elsewhere, such as in
        users' [kdehome]/share/services directory ([kdehome] is typically
        the .kde directory in a user's home directory).

        kdenetwork-3.0.5 can be downloaded from
        <http://download.kde.org/stable/3.0.5/src/> :

         504032bceeef0dfa9ff02aed0faf795d   kdenetwork-3.0.5.tar.bz2

        Some vendors are building binary packages of kdenetwork-3.0.5.
        Please check your vendors website and the KDE 3.0.5 information page
        (<http://ww.kde.org/info/3.0.5.html>) periodically for availability.

Buffer Overflow in KDE resLISa
November 11, 2002

I. BACKGROUND

KDE is a popular open source graphical desktop environment for Unix
workstations. Its kdenetwork module contains a LAN browsing
implementation known as LISa, which is used to identify CIFS and
other servers on the local network. LISa consists of two main
modules: "lisa", a network daemon, and "resLISa", a restricted
version of the lisa daemon created by Alexander Neundorf. LISa's lisa
module can be accessed in KDE using the URL type "lan://"; the
resLISa module can be accessed using the URL type "rlan://".

II. DESCRIPTION

Local exploitation of a buffer overflow within the resLISa module
could allow an attacker to gain elevated privileges. The overflow
exists in the parsing of the LOGNAME environment variable; an overly
long value will overwrite the instruction pointer, thereby allowing
an attacker to seize control of the executable. The following is a
snapshot of the exploit in action:

farmer@debian30:~$ ./reslisa_bof
farmer@debian30:~$ NetManager::prepare: listen failed
sh-2.05a$ id
uid=1000(farmer) gid=1000(farmer) groups=1000(farmer)

While the attacker's privileges have not been escalated, the
following shows the creation of a raw socket that is accessible by
the attacker:

farmer@debian30:~$ lsof | grep raw
sh 1413 farmer 3u raw 1432 00000000:0001->00000000:0000 st=07

farmer@debian30:~$ cd /proc/1413/fd/
farmer@debian30:/proc/1413/fd$ ls -l
total 0
lrwx------ 1 farmer farmer 64 Oct 11 02:47 0 -> /dev/pts/3
lrwx------ 1 farmer farmer 64 Oct 11 02:47 1 -> /dev/pts/3
lrwx------ 1 farmer farmer 64 Oct 11 02:47 2 -> /dev/pts/3
lrwx------ 1 farmer farmer 64 Oct 11 02:47 255 -> /dev/pts/3
lrwx------ 1 farmer farmer 64 Oct 11 02:47 3 -> socket:[1432]
l-wx------ 1 farmer farmer 64 Oct 11 02:47 4 -> /dev/null
lrwx------ 1 farmer farmer 64 Oct 11 02:47 5 -> socket:[1433]

III. ANALYSIS

Local attackers can use access to a raw socket to sniff network
traffic and generate malicious traffic (such as network scans, ARP
redirects, DNS poisoning). This can lead to further compromise of the
target system as well as other neighboring systems, depending on
network trust relationships.

IV. DETECTION

This vulnerability exists in all versions of resLISa included within
kdenetwork packages found in versions of KDE before 3.0.5. To
determine if a specific implementation is vulnerable issue the
following commands:

$ LOGNAME=`perl -e 'print "A"x5000'`
$ `which reslisa` -c .

If the application exits, printing "signal caught: 11, exiting", then
it is vulnerable.  The above example was performed on resLISa version
0.1.1 which is packaged and distributed with Debian 3.0r0.

V. VENDOR FIX

KDE 3.0.5 fixes this vulnerability, as well as a remotely exploitable
buffer overflow found in LISa by Olaf Kirch of SuSE Linux AG. More
information about the fix is available at
<http://www.kde.org/info/security>. Individual Unix vendors should be
providing updated KDE distributions on their appropriate download
sites.

Lisa 0.2.2, which also fixes these issues and compiles independent of
KDE, can be downloaded at
<http://lisa-home.sourceforge.net/download.html>.

VI. CVE INFORMATION

The Mitre Corp.'s Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) Project
assigned the identification number CAN-2002-1247 to this issue.

GENTOO LINUX SECURITY ANNOUNCEMENT 200211-004
- - --------------------------------------------------------------------

PACKAGE : kdelibs
SUMMARY : rlogin.protocol and telnet.protocol URL KIO Vulnerability
          resLISa / LISa Vulnerabilities
DATE    : DATUM
EXPLOIT : local & remote

- - --------------------------------------------------------------------

from KDE advisory 20021111-1 :

The implementation of the rlogin protocol in all of the affected
systems, and the implementation of the telnet protocol in affected
KDE 2 systems, allows a carefully crafted URL in an HTML page,
HTML email or other KIO-enabled application to execute arbitrary
commands on the system using the victim's account on the
vulnerable machine.

The vulnerability potentially enables local or remote attackers
to compromise a victim's account and execute arbitrary commands
on the local system with the victim's privileges, such as erasing
files, accessing data or installing trojans.

<http://www.kde.org/info/security/advisory-20021111-1.txt>

from KDE advisory 20021111-2 :

The resLISa daemon contains a buffer overflow vulnerability which
potentially enables any local user to obtain access to a raw socket
if 'reslisa' is installed SUID root.  This vulnerability was
discovered by the iDEFENSE security team and Texonet.

The lisa daemon contains a buffer overflow vulnerability which
potentially enables any local user, as well any any remote attacker
on the LAN who is able to gain control of the LISa port (7741 by
default), to obtain root privileges.

In addition, a remote attacker potentially may be able to gain
access to a victim's account by using an "lan://" URL in an HTML
page or via another KDE application.  These vulnerabilities were
discovered by Olaf Kirch at SuSE Linux AG.
