    "Root cause": "A read buffer overflow vulnerability exists in DNS stub resolver libraries. A buffer size value smaller than the maximum potential DNS response is passed to functions performing DNS resolution. If a response exceeds this allocated buffer, it is truncated and the required buffer size is returned. The calling function may use this size to read beyond the actual DNS response.",

      "Buffer Overflow",

        "Sending crafted DNS responses to a vulnerable system"
      ],
