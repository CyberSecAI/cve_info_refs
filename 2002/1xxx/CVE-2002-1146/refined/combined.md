## Domain Name System (DNS) resolver libraries vulnerable to read buffer overflow

#### Vulnerability Note VU#738331

Original Release Date: 2002-10-01 | Last Revised: 2003-04-15

---

### Overview

DNS stub resolvers from multiple vendors contain a buffer overflow vulnerability. The impact of this vulnerability appears to be limited to denial of service.

### Description

| A read buffer overflow vulnerability exists in BIND 4 and BIND 8.2.x stub resolver libraries. Other resolver libraries derived from BIND 4 are also affected, including BSD libc, GNU/Linux glibc, and System 5 UNIX libresolv. This vulnerability is similar in scope to [VU#803539](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/803539) and [VU#542971](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/542971), which are referenced by CERT Advisory [CA-2002-19](http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2002-19.html).  The name server itself, named, is not affected. The vulnerability exists in DNS stub resolver libraries that are used by network applications to obtain host or network information, typically host names and IP addresses. For example, when a web browser attempts to access <http://www.cert.org/>, it calls functions in a DNS stub resolver library in order to determine an IP address for www.cert.org.Within the DNS resolver library, a buffer size value that is smaller than the maximum size of a potential DNS response is passed to the functions that perform DNS resolution. If a response is encountered that is larger than the allocated buffer, the response is truncated and returned to the calling function, along with the amount of buffer space that would be required to handle the entire response. The calling function may use this value for the size of the buffer and read beyond the end of the actual DNS response. In some cases, unmapped memory may be read, which typically causes the calling application to crash. In other cases, mapped memory may be read, and the contents included in the DNS response, which the calling application typically handles as a malformed response.Applications that call DNS resolution functions directly may also be vulnerable, depending on how those applications handle the returned buffer size value. MIT Kerberos 5, KTH Heimdal Kerberos, nss\_ldap, and fetchmail are known to be affected.Quoting from the ISC advisory:*When looking up address (gethostbyname(), gethostbyaddr() etc.) a less than maximum sized buffer is passed to res\_search() / res\_query(). If the answer is too large to fit in the buffer the size of buffer required is returned along with the part of the message that will fit. This value is not checked and is passed to getanswer which then may read past the end of the buffer depending up the contents in the answer section**.* |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker who is able to send DNS responses to a vulnerable system could cause a denial of service, crashing the application that made calls to a vulnerable resolver library. It does not appear that this vulnerability can be leveraged to execute arbitrary code. There may be some risk of information disclosure if a vulnerable system returns the contents of memory adjacent to a DNS response. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Patch or Upgrade**Apply a patch or upgrade as specified by your vendor. In the case of statically linked binaries, it is necessary to recompile using the patched version of the DNS stub resolver libraries. ISC has provided the following guidance for applications that call DNS resolution functions directly:*For application writers. Use a maximum sized buffer (64k), be prepared to redo the calls res\_search(), res\_query(), res\_send(), res\_nsearch(), res\_nquery() and res\_send() with a bigger buffer or take the minimum of the answer buffer size and the value returned by these calls and be aware that the answer is truncated.* |
| --- |

| **Local Caching DNS Server Not Effective**A local caching DNS server will not prevent malicious responses from reaching vulnerable client resolvers. |

### [ISC](#AAMN-5D287U) Affected

Updated:  October 16, 2002

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

Internet Software Consortium Security Advisary.
LIBBIND/LIBRESOLV: Denial of Service.
8 August 2002

Versions affected:
BIND 4 prior to 4.9.10
BIND 8 prior to 8.2.5
Severity: SERIOUS
Exploitable: Remotely
Type: Denial of service

Description:

When looking up address (gethostbyname(), gethostbyaddr()
etc.) a less than maximum sized buffer is passed to
res\_search() / res\_query().  If the answer is too large
to fit in the buffer the size of buffer required is
returned along with the part of the message that will fit.
This value is not checked and is passed to getanswer which
then may read past the end of the buffer depending up the
contents in the answer section.

THIS DOES NOT AFFECT THE NAMESERVER.

THIS CAN BE TRANSMITTED THROUGH CACHES.

BIND 9 is NOT affected.
BIND 8.3.x is NOT affected.

This bug may exist in other applications that call the
DNS directly.

Workarounds:

None.  Upgrade and re-linking required.

Impact:

Applications linked against vulnerable versions of the
libraries may die with segmentation violations /
bus errors.

Fix:

Upgrade to BIND 4.9.10 or preferably BIND 8.3.3.

BIND 4 is officially deprecated.  Only security
fixes will be issued for BIND 4.

<http://www.isc.org/products/BIND>

For application writers.  Use a maximum sized buffer (64k),
be prepared to redo the calls res\_search(), res\_query(),
res\_send(), res\_nsearch(), res\_nquery() and res\_send()
with a bigger buffer or take the minimum of the answer
buffer size and the value returned by these calls and
be aware that the answer is truncated.

### [MIT Kerberos Development Team](#AAMN-5DB7SV) Affected

Notified:  August 23, 2002  Updated: October 16, 2002

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

We don't ship a resolver implementation as part of MIT krb5. Our code does call res\_search() in a potentially unsafe manner, but seems to only result in a read overrun. Also, it is primarily client-side code that calls res\_search(), so denial of service attacks against servers are unlikely.

This will be fixed in an upcoming release of MIT krb5. The MIT Kerberos Team is not issuing a patch at this time, as we believe that the vulnerability is limited to a client-side denial of service.

### Vendor Information

The vendor has not provided us with any further information regarding this vulnerability.

### Addendum

The CERT/CC has no additional comments at this time.

### [Openwall GNU/\*/Linux](#AAMN-5DAQC9) Affected

Notified:  August 15, 2002  Updated: October 16, 2002

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

Openwall GNU/\*/Linux's glibc package was affected. As a workaround, we have applied the patch by Olaf Kirch of SuSE which limits the return value from res\_send(3) to be no greater than the provided answer buffer size. This approach has the advantage of reducing the problem for poorly written third-party applications, including those which aren't a part of our distribution. At the same time, checks have also been added to avoid some potential reads beyond end of undersized DNS responses as pointed out by Dmitry V. Levin of ALT Linux. This change will be documented in the system-wide change log:

<http://www.openwall.com/Owl/CHANGES.shtml>

The BIND 4.9.x Openwall patch (which adds a number of security-related features) has been updated to the upcoming 4.9.10 release and will be made available at:

Updated:  October 16, 2002

### Status

Not Affected

### Vendor Statement

SIDEWINDER(tm) FIREWALL & VPN (all releases including SIDEWINDER APPLIANCE)

Not Vulnerable

As part of Sidewinder(tm)'s defense in depth architecture, DNS queries are sandboxed by SecureOS(tm)'s patented Type Enforcement technology. Faults in the resolver library cannot cause a comprimise of the Sidewinder(tm). However, since a Bind 8 caching server can still pass this attack along to vulnerable resolvers, Sidewinder(tm) users who wish to protect vulnerable resolvers behind their firewall from attack should upgrade to version 5.2.1.05, which replaces Bind 8 with Bind 9.

Customers should contact Customer Service to obtain version 5.2.1.05.

Gauntlet and e-ppliance

Both Gauntlet Software and Gauntlet e-ppliance utilize the Bind version that ships with Solaris 8. Please see Solaris 8 response to this vulnerability to assess applicability of any potential DOS risk. Secure Computing will test and make recommendations to customers regarding any potential software changes, if any, published by Sun Microsystems.
