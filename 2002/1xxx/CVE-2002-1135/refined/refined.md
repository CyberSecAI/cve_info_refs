- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `modsecurity.php` file in phpWebSite includes a file specified by the `inc_prefix` parameter without proper sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Remote File Inclusion (RFI). The application does not validate the `inc_prefix` parameter, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary remote files.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary PHP code by including a malicious file from a remote server. This can lead to complete compromise of the server, including the ability to execute arbitrary commands, access sensitive data, and modify web content.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is via a crafted HTTP request to `modsecurity.php` that includes a malicious URL in the `inc_prefix` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. They also need access to a server where they can host a malicious PHP file that will be included by the vulnerable server.
