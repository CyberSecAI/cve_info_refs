### Overview

The Secure Command Shell service on NetScreen firewall products contains a remotely exploitable denial-of-service vulnerability.

### Description

| Firewall products from NetScreen Technologies, Inc. include a Secure Shell version 1 (SSHv1) implementation called Secure Command Shell (SCS). The SCS service contains a remotely exploitable denial-of-service vulnerability which can cause affected units to crash. According to the original reporter, programs which attempt to exploit [VU#945216](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/945216) trigger the vulnerability and cause the unit to crash. NetScreen has confirmed this, but has stated that this vulnerability is not the same as [VU#945216](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/945216). |
