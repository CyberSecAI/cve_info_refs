- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A flaw in the way Microsoft Outlook 2002 processes email header information. Specifically, it fails to correctly process certain types of invalid data within a header field during the POP3-to-MAPI conversion.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper handling of malformed email headers in Outlook 2002.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Denial of Service. An attacker can send a specially crafted email that will cause the Outlook 2002 client to fail and become unusable until the malicious email is removed.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a specially crafted email message to a user who accesses their email via POP3, IMAP, or WebDAV protocols.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft and send a malformed email to a targeted Outlook 2002 user.
