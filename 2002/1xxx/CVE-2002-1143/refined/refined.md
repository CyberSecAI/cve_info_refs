Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2002-1143:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way Microsoft Word and Excel handle field codes and external updates. These features allow for the dynamic inclusion of data from other sources into a document. The vulnerability arises because these updates can be triggered automatically without the user's explicit knowledge or consent, particularly when a document is opened or saved. This behavior is due to a flaw in how these features are implemented.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unintended Information Disclosure:** Maliciously crafted field codes or external updates can be used to extract sensitive information from a user's computer. This is achieved by embedding a field that includes the content of a local file into the document.
*   **Automatic Updates:** The automatic updating of fields without user awareness is the core vulnerability. Attackers can leverage this to silently include file contents or trigger network requests when a document is opened.
*   **Lack of User Control:** Users have limited control over the automatic updates of field codes and external updates and limited awareness to hidden fields. 
*   **URL support in INCLUDEPICTURE:** The `INCLUDEPICTURE` field can accept URLs allowing an attacker to send information to a remote server when a document is opened.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Theft:** Attackers can steal sensitive data from local files on a victim's machine. This information could include documents, configuration files, or any data that the attacker specifies in the malicious field code.
*   **Privacy Violation:** The attacker could potentially obtain user-specific information, including usernames, user addresses, and document paths, possibly through network requests triggered by the `INCLUDEPICTURE` field.
*   **Circumvention of Digital Signatures:** While not a direct forgery, the vulnerability could be used to present a digitally signed document with a different displayed content than what was originally signed.
*   **Tracking:**  The `INCLUDEPICTURE` field can be used to track who is opening or printing a document by sending user-specific data to a remote server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Documents:** Attackers create specially crafted Word or Excel documents containing malicious field codes or external updates.
*   **Delivery Methods:** The malicious documents can be delivered to victims through various means, such as email attachments, file-sharing platforms or compromised websites.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker must entice the victim to open the malicious document.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of Field Codes:** The attacker must have a thorough understanding of Word and Excel field codes and external updates.
*   **Ability to Craft Documents:** The attacker needs to be able to create documents containing specific field codes that exploit the vulnerability.
*   **File Path Knowledge (for local file theft):** The attacker must know the path to a local file they want to steal, but can potentially use techniques to determine this path.
*   **Web Server Access (for web-based attacks):** If using `INCLUDEPICTURE` to send information to a remote server, the attacker needs access to a server to receive the data.
*  **Ability to Deliver the Malicious Document:** The attacker must be able to get the crafted document to the victim.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in multiple versions of Microsoft Word and Excel.
*   Patches are available to address this vulnerability, which modifies the default behavior to prevent automatic updates of external data without user consent.
*   The stolen information can be viewed by exposing and inspecting the field codes.
*   The attacker may obscure the stolen content, but can not hide it entirely.

This detailed breakdown, which incorporates the information from multiple sources, offers a comprehensive understanding of the CVE-2002-1143 vulnerability.
