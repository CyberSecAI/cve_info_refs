- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The firmware handling the URL "http://<IP ADDRESS>/sw2/cgi/device_reset?" allows the "device_reset?" command to be executed on member switches without first checking to see if the source of the command is authenticated.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Lack of authentication for the device reset command via HTTP.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can arbitrarily and repeatedly deny access to all switched ports of the stack member, effectively causing a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable URL: "http://<IP ADDRESS>/sw2/cgi/device_reset?". The IP address is the address of the "commander" switch, and "2" denotes the stack member number.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to know the IP address of the "commander" switch and the stack member number. They must also be able to send HTTP requests to this switch.
