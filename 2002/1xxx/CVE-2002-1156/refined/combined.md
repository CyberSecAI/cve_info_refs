## Apache discloses source code via POST requests to a location with WebDAV and CGI enabled

#### Vulnerability Note VU#910713

Original Release Date: 2002-10-29 | Last Revised: 2002-11-19

---

### Overview

There is an information leakage in Apache that results from an interaction between WebDAV and CGI.

### Description

| Apache version 2.0.42 allows remote attackers to obtain the source code of CGI scripts that are stored in locations for which both CGI and WebDAV are enabled. When a POST request is sent to a CGI script on an affected server, this vulnerability will cause the source code of the script to be returned to the attacker. |
| --- |

### Impact

| Remote attackers can obtain the source code of CGI scripts located on affected servers. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply a patch from your vendor**  This vulnerability was addressed in Apache version 2.0.43, available at <http://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi>. For vendor-specific information regarding this issue, please see the Systems Affected section of this document. |

          Fix the exposure of CGI source when a POST request is sent
          to a location where both DAV and CGI are enabled.
          (CERT Vul. Note VU#910713 and CVE CAN-2002-1156)

IMPACT:   Potential for increased privilege, denial of service (DoS),
          or execution of arbitrary code.

PLATFORM: HP9000 Servers running HP-UX release 11.00, 11.11, 11.20,
          and 11.22 with versions 1.3.26.05 or 2.0.39.05 and earlier,
          of the HP Apache product installed are affected.

SOLUTION: For HP-UX releases 11.00, 11.11, 11.20 and 11.22 as well
          as release 11.11 running IPv6, download new HP Apache
          product (1.3.27.00 or 2.0.43.00 or later) from
          <http://www.software.hp.com>.

MANUAL ACTIONS: Yes - Update
                       Install repaired binary upgrading to
                       Apache 2.0.43.00 or Apache 1.3.27.00.

AVAILABILITY: Complete product bundles are available now on
              <http://www.software.hp.com>.

 ------------------------------------------------------------------
A. Background
   The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
   has identified multiple vulnerabilities in the Apache HTTP
   Server.  It affects the following HP product numbers:

     B9415AA Apache 1.3.x  HP-UX releases 11.00 and 11.11
     B9416AA Apache 2.x    HP-UX releases 11.00 and 11.11
     B9415AA Apache 1.3.x  HP-UX releases 11.20 and 11.22
     B9416AA Apache 2.x    HP-UX releases 11.20 and 11.22
     B9416BA Apache 2.x    IPv6 HP-UX release 11.11

   With this release HP has upgraded to Apache 2.0.43 and
   Apache 1.3.27, and fixes certain known vulnerabilities in the
   Apache HTTP Server.
   The release incorporates fix for the following problems:
     CAN-2002-0839 : Apache 1.3.26
     CAN-2002-0840 : Apache 1.3.26 and Apache 2.0.39
     CAN-2002-0843 : Apache 1.3.26 and Apache 2.0.39
     CAN-2002-1156 : Apache 2.0.39
   More details on this information can be found at
   <http://www.apache.org>.
   The CVE issues can be found at <http://cve.mitre.org>

   The Apache Group has released Apache 2.0.43 and Apache
   1.3.27 as the best known version that fixes the problems
   identified in the above mentioned CVE issues.

   Before updating, make sure to stop any previous HP Apache binary.
   Otherwise, the previous binary will continue running, preventing
   the new one from automatically starting, although the
   installation would be successful.

    The command to stop the HP Apache binary is:
        for 1.3.26:
            /opt/apache/bin/apachectl stop
        for 2.0.39:
            /opt/hpapache2/bin/apachectl stop

    HP Apache automatically starts upon installation if port 80
    is available.

    Installation of this new version of HP Apache over an existing
    HP Apache installation is supported, while installation over a
    non-HP Apache is NOT supported.

 B. Fixing the problem
    The fixes for all HP-UX versions are in the form of new product
    bundles, instead of patches.  To retrieve them, go to
        <http://www.software.hp.com/ISS_products_list.html>

    Install HP Apache versions 1.3.27.00 or 2.0.43.00 or later.

    Note: OpenView Network Node Manager (NNM) customers should not
          install these versions.  The version of Apache delivered
          with NNM is under investigation.  This bulletin will be
          updated when more information is available.

This issue does not affect Apache 2.0.   [CAN-2002-0839](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2002-0839)  In order to exploit this vulnerability a remote attacker would have to   use some other vulnerability to be able to run arbitrary commands   as the uid of the Apache server. Access to the uid of the Apache   server is also available to anyone who has the   authority   to create scripts that can be run by the server (such as PHP or CGI).  This issue was reported to the ASF by zen-parse through iDefense * A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in the default   error page. The issue could only be exploited if the directive   `UseCanonicalName` is set to `Off`   and a server is being run at a domain that uses wildcard DNS.   The default setting has been `Off` in 2.0 since 2   .0.33; 1.3 has   always had it `On`, so is not vulnerable by default, but is   vulnerable if you set `UseCanonicalName` to   `Off`. This issue   affects Apache 2.0 all versions including 2.0.42 and   1.3 all versions up to and including 1.3.26.   [CAN-2002-0840](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2002-0840)  Wildcard   DNS allows a server administrator to set up a host to respond to any   particular hostname in the domain. For example with a DNS entry of   `*.apacheweek.com` any domain that is looked up in the   apacheweek.com domain would resolve. Wildcard DNS is not particularly   common so this vulnerability will not affect many sites.  This issue was reported to the ASF by Matthew Murphy * Buffer overflows in the ApacheBench utility, ab, used for benchmarking   sites can be exploited if it is run against a malicious server.   [CAN-2002-0843](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2002-0843)  As a work-around, administrators could simply   remove the ApacheBench utility or not   run it against untrusted servers.  This issue was reported to the ASF by David Wagner * In Apache 2.0.42, for a location where both WebDAV and CGI were   enabled, a `POST` request to a CGI script would reveal the   CGI source to a remote user. This issue does not affect any versions   of Apache 2.0 other than 2.0.42, and does not affect Apache 1.3   servers running `mod_dav` 1.0.   [CAN-2002-1156](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2002-1156)   These issues have all been fixed in Apache 1.3.27 and Apache 2.0.43 which are now available.   ---  Apache 1.3.27 Released Apache 1.3.27 was released on 3rd October 2002 and is now the latest version of the Apache 1.3 server. The previous release was 1.3.26, released on the 18th June 2002. [See what was new in Apache 1.3.26](http://www.apacheweek.com/issues/02-06-21#apache1325).  Apache 1.3.27 is available in source form for compiling on Unix or Windows, for download from the [main Apache site](http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/) or from any [mirror download site](http://www.apache.org/mirrors/).  This is a security, bug fix and minor upgrade release. Due to security issues, any sites using versions prior to Apache 1.3.27 should upgrade to Apache 1.3.27. [Read more about the other security issues that affect Apache 1.3](http://www.apacheweek.com/features/security-13).   Security issues  * Fix the security vulnerability   regarding ownership permissions of System V shared memory based   scoreboards. The fix resulted in the new   `ShmemUIDisUser` directive.   [CAN-2002-0839](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2002-0839) * Fix the security vulnerability   regarding a cross-site scripting vulnerability in the default error   page when using wildcard DNS.   [CAN-2002-0840](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2002-0840) * Fix the security vulnerability   regarding some possible overflows in ab.c which could be exploited by   a malicious server.   [CAN-2002-0843](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2002-0843)   New features The main new features in 1.3.27 (compared to 1.3.26) are:   * A new directive, `ErrorHeader` has been added.   This allows headers (such as cookies)   to be specified that will accompany any   error pages or redirects * Configuration file globbing can now use simple pattern   matching which can stop backup and other files getting   included [BZ#12712](http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=12712) * `Include` directives may now have wildcards   in the final part of the path. * A new directive, `ProtocolReqCheck` has been   added which determines if Apache will   check for a valid protocol string in the request (such as    `HTTP/1.1`)   and return `HTTP_BAD_REQUEST` if not valid.   Versions of Apache   prior to 1.3.26 would silently ignore bad protocol strings, but   1.3.26 included a more strict check. This   directive makes it runtime   configurable. * Added support for Berkeley-DB/4.x to `mod_auth_db`. * Support Caldera OpenUNIX 8.   Bugs fixed The following bugs were found in Apache 1.3.26 and have been fixed in Apache 1.3.27:   * Some fixes to `mod_proxy`.   The cache was incorrectly updating the `Content-Length`   from 304 responses when doing validation.   Also fix a problem where headers from other modules were   added to the response headers when this was done in the   core already. * In 1.3.26, a null or all-blank `Content-Length`   triggers an error although previous versions would silently ignore   it and assume 0 length. 1.3.27 restores this previous behaviour. * Fix a one byte null overflow in ap\_get\_win32\_interpreter used   on Win32 platforms   triggered when the initial `#!` line in a CGI script did not   contain a \r or \n character in the first 1023 bytes.  ---  Apache 2.0.43 Released Apache 2.0.43 was released on 3rd October 2002 and is now the latest version of the Apache 2.0 server. The previous release was 2.0.42, released on the 24th September 2002. [See what was new in Apache 2.0.42](http://www.apacheweek.com/issues/02-06-21#apache2042).  Apache 2.0.43 is available in source form for compiling on Unix or Windows, for download from the [main Apache site](http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/) or from any [mirror download site](http://www.apache.org/mirrors/).  This is a security, bug fix and minor upgrade release. Due to security issues, any sites using versions prior to Apache 2.0.43 should upgrade to Apache 2.0.43.

[CAN-2002-1156](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2002-1156) * Fix the security vulnerability regarding some possible   overflows in ab.c which could be exploited by a malicious server.   [CAN-2002-0843](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2002-0843)   Bugs fixed The following bugs were found in Apache 2.0.42 and have been fixed in Apache 2.0.43:   * The `UserDir` directive has been fixed   to again take a list of user names to enable userdir access for,   as per 1.3. * Flushing behaviour has been improved, to ensure that available   response output is flushed when no new output is pending; helping   streaming CGIs and other dynamically-generated content * `mod_auth_ldap` has been fixed to retry   connections to the LDAP server if it becomes unavailable. * Fix for a locking problem in `mod_ssl`'s session   cache code which could cause infinite loops on some platforms * Fixes for `mod_cache` to prevent a segfault   when attempting to cache some combinations of content (for instance,   when using SSI tags which execute CGI scripts), and to correct   the `CacheMaxStreamingBuffer` directive   for virtual hosts * The default server root directory in `suexec` has   been fixed to match the default install root * `mod_proxy` was fixed to not strip   `WWW-Authenticate` headers on 4xx error responses which   prevented server authentication to be performed via the proxy   New features  * A new module, `mod_logio`, has been added which   allows logging of the number of bytes sent and received by the server. * A `-p` option has been added to `apxs`   to allow programs to be be compiled using this tool.  ---  In the news  ApacheCon early-bird extended If you are reading this issue on Friday the 4th October 2002 then you may still have a few hours to get the US$200 discount on [registration for ApacheCon](http://www.apachecon.com/).

Covalent founder breaks bond to form new Apache startup An article this week in ZDNet News, [Apache chief scouts a new direction](http://zdnet.com.com/2100-1104-960566.html), follows the resignation of  [Randy Terbush](http://httpd.apache.org/contributors/#terbush) from Covalent. Randy has started up a new company focusing on Apache services rather than products. He is joined by another former Covalent employee and ASF director [Dirk-Willem van Gulik](http://httpd.apache.org/contributors/#vangulik). Covalent received a lot of press attention back at the 2000 ApacheCon when they announced they were assembling a [dream team](http://linuxpr.com/releases/1410.html) of Apache developers. However with the [reported recent departure](http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=apache-cvs&m=102947008010433&q=raw)of lead Apache 2.0 contributor  [Ryan Bloom](http://httpd.apache.org/contributors/#bloom), only one of the original five remains. Even so, Covalent report having "their best quarters ever ... with double-digit growth". | | --- | | ---   This issue brought to you by: Mark J Cox, Joe Orton | |  |
