      "details": "A race condition exists in the creation of /etc/cups/certs/<pid>. This allows a local attacker to create or overwrite any file as root. A prerequisite to launching this attack is 'lp' user privileges, which can be gained through successful exploitation of ISSUE 1.",

      "details": "Printers can remotely be added to CUPS by sending a specially crafted UDP packet. The added printer can contain a tainted name that, when clicked on or referenced through other means, can exploit ISSUE 1. The exploit does not have to be locally launched as shellcode can be modified to connect back to a system controlled by the attacker. Additionally, a local attacker can exploit a design flaw to gain root privileges by adding a printer, configuring it to run on a high-numbered port, and then obtaining the local root certificate used by the HTTP backend.",
