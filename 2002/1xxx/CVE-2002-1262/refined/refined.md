Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2002-1262:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in Internet Explorer's cross-domain security model. Specifically, the security checks performed when object caching techniques are used in web pages are incomplete. This allows attackers to bypass the intended security restrictions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incomplete Cross-Domain Security Checks:** The core weakness lies in the insufficient security checks during object caching, leading to cross-domain security bypass.
- **External Object Caching:** The vulnerability specifically exploits how Internet Explorer handles cached objects.
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Due to the flawed security checks, attackers can execute commands on a user's system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the local computer.
- **Local File Access:** Attackers can read files on the user's system, regardless of whether they can be rendered in the browser.
- **Malicious Executable Loading:** Attackers can load and execute malicious programs on the victim's machine.
- **Parameter Passing to Executables:** Attackers could pass parameters to executables.
- **Full System Compromise:** The vulnerability allows for a complete system compromise, giving the attacker the same level of access as the user.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Web-based Attack:** Attackers can host a malicious web page that exploits the object caching vulnerability, and when the user visits the page, it triggers the exploit.
- **HTML Email Attack:** Attackers can send a malicious HTML email. When the user opens or previews the email, the exploit can be triggered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Knowledge of Exploit:** Attackers need knowledge of the specific object caching techniques in Internet Explorer that cause the security bypass.
- **Ability to Host Content:** Attackers need a way to deliver the exploit either via a web server or through email.
- **Social Engineering:** To lure users to visit the attacker-controlled website or open malicious email (in web based or email based attack).
- **(Optional) Knowledge of local system:** To invoke an executable the attacker would need to know the name and location of any executable on the system.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was initially downplayed by Microsoft, with incorrect statements about its impact and mitigating factors. They initially claimed attackers could only read certain file types, could not load executables, and could not pass parameters.
- The initial severity rating was "Moderate," but this was later revised to "Critical" after it was demonstrated that arbitrary code execution was possible.
- The vulnerability can be mitigated by applying the patch provided in MS02-068, and additionally disabling shortcuts in HTML Help, as described in Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 810687.
- The issue was originally reported as part of vulnerabilities fixed in MS02-066, but was not properly addressed until MS02-068.
- This vulnerability impacts Internet Explorer 5.5 and 6.0, but not 5.01.
