Title: Flood ACK packets cause AIX DoS.

Released: 9th Oct 2002
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Vulnerable:
===========
- AIX version 4.3.3 with any ML
- AIX 5

Overview:
=========
	AIX is a unix operating sistem developed by IBM distributed with
a wide models of IBM hardware.

There exists an stack problem with malformed TCP packets that can lead AIX
to a DoS condition. To reach this condition a big band width is require.

Details:
========
AIX has a pool of memory buffers known as mbuf, this buffers are used to manage
the incoming and outbound network traffic.  A flood of TCP packets with all flags
off makes the AIX to fail in releasing the mbufs, an result in a 100% of CPU
consume or even crash the system.
To reach the DoS condition the flood must be over 2.8 Mbps, so this is more a
DDoS attack.
