## ypxfrd daemon fails to properly validate user supplied arguments in "getdbm" procedure

#### Vulnerability Note VU#538033

Original Release Date: 2002-10-10 | Last Revised: 2003-04-09

---

### Overview

A vulnerability in the ypxfrd daemon may allow a local attacker to read arbitrary files on the vulnerable system.

### Description

| Janusz Niewiadomski, of [iSEC](http://isec.pl/about.html), discovered this vulnerability and produced the following [advisory](http://isec.pl/vulnerabilities/0006.txt).  Issue:======Improper arguments validation in ypxfrd may allow local attacker to read any file on the system.Description:============ypxfrd daemon is used for speed up the distribution of large NIS maps from NIS master to NIS slave servers.Details:========When getdbm procedure is called, ypxfrd daemon creates a path to the /var/yp/domain/map file (where domain and map are arguments provided in the request). Unfortunately it fails to check if both arguments contains slash or dot characters, thus making databases outside /var/yp directory accessible. A symlink done can override .pag / .dir file extension limitation, allowing local attacker to read any file on the system.Impact:=======When ypxfrd is configured and running, local attacker is able to read any file on the system. It is also possible to remotely read database outside /var/yp directory, depending on the securenets configuration. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A local attacker my be able to read any file on the vulnerable system. This may lead to privilege escalation. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Apply a patch. |
