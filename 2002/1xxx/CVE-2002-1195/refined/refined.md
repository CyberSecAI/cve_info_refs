Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the security vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2002-1195

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of server headers, specifically the "Server:" header, before displaying them in the PHP interface of ht://Check.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The PHP interface of ht://Check is vulnerable to XSS attacks. It does not remove HTML tags from the "Server:" headers and other information of crawled web servers before displaying them in the web interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution in Intranet:** An attacker who controls a crawled web server can inject malicious HTML tags into the "Server:" header. When a legitimate user within the intranet views the results of the crawl, the injected HTML/JavaScript can be executed in their browser, potentially redirecting the user to a malicious script within the intranet or performing other unwanted actions. This allows an external attacker to perform actions within the Intranet.
- **Session Hijacking/Stealing:** It's implied that the XSS could be used for other attacks beyond the specific one described such as stealing session cookies.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker needs to control a web server that is crawled by ht://Check.
- The attacker injects malicious HTML or Javascript code into the server's "Server:" header, which is then stored by ht://Check.
- When a user accesses the ht://Check PHP interface to view results, the malicious code is displayed and executed by their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control a web server that ht://Check will crawl.
- They don't need direct access to the intranet where the ht://Check instance or the users reside.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability is present in version 1.1 and possibly others, and has been fixed in the CVS repository, but no new stable version has been released.
- The vendor was contacted on July 1st and a fix has been implemented in CVS, however a new version hasn't been released yet.
