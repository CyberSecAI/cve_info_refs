ht://Check XSS

PROGRAM: ht://Check
VENDOR: Gabriele Bartolini <angusgb@users.sourceforge.net> et al.
HOMEPAGE: <http://htcheck.sourceforge.net/>
VULNERABLE VERSIONS: 1.1, possibly others
IMMUNE VERSIONS: latest CVS
SEVERITY: medium

DESCRIPTION:

"ht://Check is a link checker derived from ht://Dig. It can retrieve
information through HTTP/1.1 and store it in a MySQL database so
that after a "crawl", ht://Check can return broken links, anchors
not found, content-types, and HTTP status codes summaries. A PHP
interface lets the user to query and view the results directly via
the web."

(direct quote from the program's project page at Freshmeat)

ht://Check is written in C++ and PHP, and it is published under
the terms of the GNU General Public License.

SUMMARY:

ht://Check's PHP interface has got some Cross-Site Scripting
problems. It doesn't remove HTML tags before displaying the crawled
web servers' "Server:" headers and other information.

This hole is particularly serious if the PHP interface is used as
a part of some company's Intranet, and if some attackers control
one of the crawled web servers. In that case, the attackers may
be able to perform actions in the Intranet even if they don't have
access to it. They can do that by putting HTML tags in the "Server:"
header that redirects a legitimate Intranet user's web browser to
some script in the Intranet that does something.

COMMUNICATION WITH VENDOR:

The vendor was contacted on the 1st of July. This problem has been
fixed in the program's CVS repository, but no new stable version
has been released yet.
