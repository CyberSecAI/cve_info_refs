{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A flaw in the way IIS 5.0 and 5.1 allocate memory for WebDAV requests. If a WebDAV request were malformed in a particular way, IIS would allocate an extremely large amount of memory on the server.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper memory allocation for WebDAV requests."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could cause the server to fail by sending several malformed WebDAV requests, leading to a denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending specially crafted WebDAV requests to the server."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send a WebDAV request to the targeted server. This can be achieved through the same port (port 80) used for HTTP, therefore, any user that can establish a connection with the server could attempt to exploit this vulnerability."
