iDEFENSE Security Advisory 10.31.02a:
<http://www.idefense.com/advisory/10.31.02a.txt>
Denial of Service Vulnerability in Linksys BEFSR41 EtherFast
Cable/DSL Router
October 31, 2002

I. BACKGROUND

Linksys Group Inc.s EtherFast Cable/DSL Router with 4-Port Switch
is the perfect option to connect multiple PCs to a high-speed
Broadband Internet connection or to an Ethernet back-bone. Allowing
up to 253 users, the built-in NAT technology acts as a firewall
protecting your internal network." More information about it is
available at
<http://www.linksys.com/products/product.asp?prid> &grid#.

II. DESCRIPTION

The BEFSR41 crashes if a remote and/or local attacker accesses the
script Gozila.cgi using the routers IP address with no arguments.
Remote exploitation requires that the router's remote management be
enabled. A sample exploit looks as follows:

[http://192.168.1.1/Gozila.cgi?](http://192.168.1.1/Gozila.cgi)

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation may be particularly dangerous, especially if the
routers remote management capability is enabled. An attacker can
trivially crash the router by directing the URL above to its external
interface. In general, little reason exists to allow the web
management feature to be accessible on the external interface of the
router. It is feasible that this type of vulnerability exists in
older firmware versions in other Linksys hardware.

IV. DETECTION

This vulnerability affects the BEFSR41 EtherFast Cable/DSL router
with firmware earlier than version 1.42.7.

V. RECOVERY

Pressing the reset button on the back of the router should restore
normal functionality.

VI. WORKAROUND

Ensure the remote web management feature is disabled, if unnecessary.

VII. VENDOR FIX

Firmware version 1.42.7 and later fix this problem. Version 1.43,
which is the latest available version, can be found at
<http://www.linksys.com/download/firmware.asp?fwid=1>.

VIII. CVE INFORMATION

The Mitre Corp.'s Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) Project
has assigned the identification number CAN-2002-1236 to this issue.

IX. DISCLOSURE TIMELINE
