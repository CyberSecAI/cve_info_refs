        "root_cause": "Multiple vulnerabilities in MySQL client and server",
         "weaknesses": [
            "Signed Integer Vulnerability in COM_TABLE_DUMP: When handling the COM_TABLE_DUMP package, MySQL < 4.x casts two chars from the packet directly to unsigned integers and uses them as length parameters for memcpy. Negative values will result in very large unsigned numbers, leading to a heap-to-heap copy operation with no memory allocation.",
            "Password Length Vulnerability in COM_CHANGE_USER: The check for the response length was not implemented for the COM_CHANGE_USER command, allowing an attacker to use short passwords or cause a stack buffer overflow by sending oversized responses, which overwrites the saved instruction pointer.",
            "Heap Overflow in libmysqlclient read_rows: The client library copies answer rows from the server into another buffer without checking if the stored field sizes are within the destination buffer boundaries. Additionally, a '\\0' is added at the end without checking space leading to overflow.",
           "Memory Overwrite in libmysqlclient read_one_row: The client library loops through the fields of a row to remember pointers to field values and then zero-terminates the previous field. An attacker can supply arbitrary field sizes to overwrite memory with a '\\0'."
