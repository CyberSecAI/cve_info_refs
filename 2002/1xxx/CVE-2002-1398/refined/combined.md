PostgreSQL 7.2.1 has a buffer overflow bug in the date parser (which
is invoked each time a string is converted to a datetime object).  If
a frontend does not perform proper date checking and rejects overlong
date strings, a buffer is overwritten by parser.  The string has to
pass some checks of the parser, so it is not immediately obvious that
this can be exploited.  Denial of service is possible, though,
especially if the frontend does not automatically reestablish the
database connection. (All connections are affected, not just the one
that is issueing the query.)

To my knowledge, the PostgreSQL developers do not think this warrants
an additional 7.2.x release.  They expect that users do not trust the
PostgreSQL parsers and write input validation checks.  That gives me
the creeps---how can I trust a database which manipulates complex
in-memory and on-disk data structures to keep my data, if its
developers say I shouldn't rely on a simple thing they wrote, such as
a date parser?

A different problem: "select cash_out(2);".  Known for ages, no fix in
sight (seems to be a design problem which is not easy to resolve).

*sigh*

Due to recent security vulnerabilities reported on BugTraq, concerning
several buffer overruns found in PostgreSQL, the PostgreSQL Global
Development Team today released v7.2.2 of PostgreSQL that fixes these
vulnerabilities.

The following buffer overruns have been identified and addressed:

... in handling long datetime input
 ... in repeat()
 ... in lpad() and rpad() with multibyte
 ... in SET TIME ZONE and TZ env var

Although v7.2.2 is a purely plug-n-play upgrade from v7.2.1, requiring no
dump-n-reload of the database, it should be noted that these
vulnerabilities are only critical on "open" or "shared" systems, as they
require the ability to be able to connect to the database before they can
be exploited.

The latest release is available at:

[ftp://ftp.postgresql.org/pub/sources/v7.2.2](http://ftp://ftp.postgresql.org/pub/sources/v7.2.2)

As well as at appropriate mirror sites.

Please report any bugs/problems with this release to:

pgsql-bugs(at)postgresql(dot)org

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: [GENERAL] PostgreSQL 7.2.2: Security Release
Date: Sat, 24 Aug 2002 00:22:17 -0300 (ADT)
From: "Marc G. Fournier" <scrappy@hub.org>
To: pgsql-announce@postgresql.org
Cc: freebsd-databases@freebsd.org, <pgsql-general@postgresql.org>, Vince
Vielhaber <vev@michvhf.com>

Due to recent security vulnerabilities reported on BugTraq, concerning
several buffer overruns found in PostgreSQL, the PostgreSQL Global
Development Team today released v7.2.2 of PostgreSQL that fixes these
vulnerabilities.

The following buffer overruns have been identified and addressed:

		... in handling long datetime input
		... in repeat()
		... in lpad() and rpad() with multibyte
		... in SET TIME ZONE and TZ env var

Although v7.2.2 is a purely plug-n-play upgrade from v7.2.1, requiring no
dump-n-reload of the database, it should be noted that these
vulnerabilities are only critical on "open" or "shared" systems, as they
require the ability to be able to connect to the database before they can
be exploited.

The latest release is available at:

	ftp://ftp.postgresql.org/pub/sources/v7.2.2

As well as at appropriate mirror sites.

Please report any bugs/problems with this release to:

		pgsql-bugs@postgresql.org

SOLUTION

It is recommended that all Gentoo Linux users who are running
dev-db/postgresql-7.2.1-r2 and earlier update their systems
as follows:

emerge rsync
emerge postgresql
emerge clean

postgresql-7.2.2 is currently only available for x86. Sparc and ppc will
be available when it's been tested on these archs.
