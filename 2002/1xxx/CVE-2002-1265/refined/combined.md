## Multiple Sun RPC-based libc implementations fails to provide time-out mechanism when reading data from TCP connections

#### Vulnerability Note VU#266817

Original Release Date: 2002-11-04 | Last Revised: 2003-04-09

---

### Overview

A denial-of-service vulnerability exists in multiple vendor Sun RPC-based libc implementations.

### Description

| Multiple vendor Sun RPC-based libc implementations fail to properly read data from TCP connections. As a result, a remote attacker can deny service to system daemons. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker can connect to a vulnerable service and cause the service to hang. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Apply a vendor patch when available. |
| --- |

Title    : Potential Denial of Service Vulnerability in RPC-based libc
Number   : 20021103-01-P
Date     : November 7, 2002
Reference: CERT VU#266817
Reference: CVE CAN-2002-1265
Reference: SGI BUGS 852333 and 871325
Fixed in : IRIX 6.5.18

- -----------------------
- --- Issue Specifics ---
- -----------------------

It's been reported that SGI IRIX's Sun RPC-based libc implementation fails
to provide an adequate time-out mechanism when reading data from TCP
connections.  As a result, a remote attacker can deny service to system
daemons.

See <http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/266817> for additional details.

This vulnerability has been assigned the following CVE:
<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2002-1265>

SGI has investigated the issue and recommends the following steps for
neutralizing the exposure.  It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that these measures be
implemented on ALL vulnerable SGI systems.

These issues have been corrected with patches and in IRIX 6.5.18.

- --------------
- --- Impact ---
- --------------

The libc library is installed by default on IRIX 6.5 systems as part of
eoe.sw.base.

To determine the version of IRIX you are running, execute the following
command:

  # /bin/uname -R

That will return a result similar to the following:

  # 6.5 6.5.16f

The first number ("6.5") is the release name, the second ("6.5.16f" in this
case) is the extended release name.  The extended release name is the
"version" we refer to throughout this document.

- ----------------------------
- --- Temporary Workaround ---
- ----------------------------

Apart from not running Sun RPC services, there is no effective workaround
available for this vulnerability.  SGI recommends either upgrading to IRIX
6.5.18 or later, or installing the appropriate patch from the listing below.

- ----------------
- --- Solution ---
- ----------------

SGI has provided a series of patches for these vulnerabilities. Our
recommendation is to upgrade to IRIX 6.5.18 or later, or install the
appropriate patch.
