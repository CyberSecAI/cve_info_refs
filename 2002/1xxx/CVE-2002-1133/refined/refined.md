- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to improper handling of URL-encoded characters representing directory traversal sequences ("/" and "\").
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Directory traversal vulnerability, where the webserver fails to properly sanitize user input within URLs.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can view and retrieve any file on the same logical drive as the web application by traversing directories.
- **Attack vectors:** Attacker crafts a URL containing URL-encoded directory traversal characters (%2f for /, and potentially %5c for \) to access files outside the intended webroot. Example: `http://$host/%2f..%2f..%2f..$directory$file`
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Dino's Webserver instance.
