## Sun Solaris lockd(1M) daemon vulnerable to DoS

#### Vulnerability Note VU#855635

Original Release Date: 2003-02-05 | Last Revised: 2003-02-06

---

### Overview

A remotely exploitable denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the [Solaris lockd(1M) daemon](http://docs.sun.com/db/doc/805-8067/6j7j82mod?a=view). Exploitation of this vulnerability may kill the lockd process.

### Description

| Sun Microsystems [describes](http://docs.sun.com/db/doc/805-8067/6j7j82mod?a=view) the lockd(1M) daemon as follows:  *The lockd utility is part of the NFS lock manager, which supports record locking operations on NFS files. The lock manager provides two functions:*       - *it forwards fcntl(2) locking requests for NFS mounted file systems to the lock manager on the NFS server* - *it generates local file locking operations in response to requests forwarded from lock managers running on NFS client machines*  A vulnerability in the lockd(1M) daemon may allow a remote attacker to terminate the lockd(1M) process. A tool to exploit this vulnerability is publicly available. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker can terminate the lockd(1M) daemon. |

Hello all,

Today, Sun released an advisory (47815) about how the lockd can be used to
cause a DoS of NFS. However they did not provide any details about how the
lockd can be killed to trigger this. See
<http://sunsolve.sun.com/pub-cgi/retrieve.pl?doc=fsalert%2F47815&zone_32=category%3Asecurity>

Does anyone know if this security issue is somehow related to the Bugtraq
posting from Mike Murray  about lockd and nfs on Linux from  June 2000, see:
<http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/bugtraq/2000-06/0073.html>

I currently don't have a Sun box available to test it myself, so perhaps
someone else can verify this or provide me information about this.

Grtx Mike G. (not Mike Murray)
