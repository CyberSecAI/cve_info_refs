Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2002-1188:

**Verification:**
The provided content directly references CVE-2002-1188, which is described as the "Temporary Internet Files folder Name Reading" vulnerability. This confirms the content's relevance to the specified CVE.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is that Internet Explorer does not perform adequate security checks when using the `<OBJECT>` tag in certain scenarios. This allows an attacker to bypass security restrictions and obtain the path to the Temporary Internet Files (TIF) folder.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **Inadequate Security Checks:** The primary weakness lies in the insufficient security checks performed by Internet Explorer when handling the `<OBJECT>` tag. Specifically, under certain circumstances, the browser fails to validate parameters properly, allowing unauthorized access to the TIF folder's path.
-   **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability allows for the disclosure of the TIF folder path, which can be used to uncover sensitive information about the user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can discover the TIF folder path, which can lead to the disclosure of:
    -   The logged-on user's username.
    -   Information stored in cookies (if they have predictable names) within the TIF folder.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Malicious Web Page:** An attacker crafts a web page that leverages the `<OBJECT>` tag in a specific manner.
-   **User Interaction:** The user must visit the malicious web page, which then triggers a second page to be opened. The attacker uses a script in the second page to exploit the vulnerability and obtain the TIF folder's path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Host a Malicious Website:** The attacker must host a website containing the specially crafted web page designed to exploit the vulnerability.
-   **Lure User:** The attacker needs to entice the user to visit the malicious website.
-   **Knowledge of Exploit:** The attacker requires knowledge of how to use the `<OBJECT>` tag to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details from the provided content:**
- The vulnerability is rated as "Low" severity by Microsoft for IE 5.01, 5.5 and 6.0 Gold, but is not present in IE 6.0 SP1.
- The vulnerability is described as allowing an attacker to obtain the name of the Temporary Internet Files folder on the user's local machine. The vulnerability would not allow an attacker to read or modify any files on the user's local system. Knowledge of the name of the Temporary Internet Files folder could allow an attacker to identify the username of the logged-on user and read other information in the Temporary Internet Files folder such as cookies.
- The attacker would need to have a user visit a malicious web site and then follow a malformed link on this malicious web site to a second web site that the user trusted.
- A second document on marc.info provides a technical breakdown of how the TIF folder can be enumerated, how to read binary files and also shows how the issues still exist after SP1 although some of the original exploits have been changed or blocked.
- The document suggests that Microsoft should drop the index.dat file to fix the problem and enforce XML on the XMLHTTP component to prevent reading binary files.

In summary, CVE-2002-1188 allows attackers to discover the location of the TIF folder and related sensitive information by exploiting a flaw in how Internet Explorer processes the `<OBJECT>` tag.
