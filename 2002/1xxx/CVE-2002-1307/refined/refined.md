{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the lack of proper sanitization of message header field labels when processing email messages. Specifically, when the '-extra-' option is used in the FIELDORDER resource, it allows arbitrary text, including script tags, to be inserted into the message headers.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the message headers, which can then be executed in the context of the user's browser when the converted message page is viewed. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as session hijacking, stealing sensitive information, and defacing the web page.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector involves crafting a malicious email message with specially crafted message header field labels containing JavaScript code. This crafted email is then processed by MHonArc. The vulnerability is triggered when MHonArc converts the email message to HTML and includes the unsanitized malicious header labels.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send emails that will be processed by MHonArc. The attacker needs the ability to craft email messages with specific header labels that inject malicious javascript code."
  },
  "affected_versions": [
    "MHonArc versions 2.5.12 and earlier"
  ],
  "solution": "Upgrade to MHonArc version 2.5.13 or later. Alternatively, remove the use of '-extra-' in the FIELDORDER resource."
