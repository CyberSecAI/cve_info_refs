## iPlanet Web Server Enterprise Edition and Netscape Enterprise Server Web Publisher command exposes server to brute force attack

#### Vulnerability Note VU#985347

Original Release Date: 2002-01-08 | Last Revised: 2002-01-08

---

### Overview

A vulnerability exists in iPlanet Web Server Enterprise Edition and Netscape Enterprise Server that allows an attacker to make repeated authentication attempts if a server is configured to use HTTP basic authentication. While the risk is not greater than any other brute force attack using HTTP basic authentication, this vulnerability may represent an unexpected avenue of attack.

### Description

| [ProCheckup](http://www.procheckup.com/) has reported a vulnerability in [iPlanet Web Server, Enterprise Edition](http://www.iplanet.com/products/iplanet_web_enterprise/home_2_1_1m.html) and [Netscape Enterprise Server](http://enterprise.netscape.com/products/contentsvcs/enterprise.html) running on Windows NT based operating systems. The iPlanet and NES servers provide a feature called [Web Publisher](http://developer.netscape.com/docs/manuals/enterprise/40/ag/eswebpub.htm). According to NES documentation:  Netscape Enterprise Server 4.0 clients can use Web Publisher to collaborate on projects by directly accessing, editing, and managing file on remote servers. Web Publisher provides sophisticated features for server clients, such as file management, editing and publishing, and access control.The Web Publisher wp-force-auth command initiates an HTTP Basic Authentication dialog. An attacker may make repeated calls to wp-force-auth in an attempt to guess valid user credentials. Well-known user credentials, such as Administrator or Guest on Windows systems, or root or nobody on Unix/Linux systems, may be subjected to brute-force attacks. While the exposure created by this vulnerability is no greater than that of any other brute force attack, this vulnerability may represent an unexpected avenue of attack. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An unauthenticated remote attacker may make repeated attempts to guess valid user credentials. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Disable Web Publishing**iPlanet recommends disabling Web Publisher and Directory Indexing on external servers: <http://developer.netscape.com/docs/manuals/enterprise/40/ag/esapuirf.htm#1005372> Another method for disabling Web Publisher is to use a Netscape Server Application Programming Interface (NSAPI) Server Application Functions (SAF): <http://knowledgebase.iplanet.com/ikb/kb/articles/7761.html> |

| Filter HTTP TrafficIt may be possible to use an application layer filter to detect and block HTTP requests containing the ?wp-force-auth command. |

## **Vulnerability Management for a Variety of Industries**

Nearly every industry relies on applications and networks to conduct business, though some have more stringent security requirements than others. Organizations in the aviation, automotive, healthcare, and financial sectors have some of the strongest security regulations. Layers of security during software and application development as well as after product deployment are necessary to keep consumers safe and organizations compliant.

![airplane icon](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilitiesaviation.png)

### [Aviation](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guides/aviation-software-testing-guide)

Cybersecurity is crucial to the aviation industry. Travelers in the sky need to be protected from any attacks that can prevent airlines from operating normally. Those same customers need to have their payment and sensitive data protected when purchasing a ticket.

### [Automotive](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guide/how-fuzz-testing-helps-secure-automotive-industry)

Wireless connectivity is becoming commonplace inside of new vehicles. Automotive connectivity to WIFI and Bluetooth are making vehicles a bigger target for cybercriminals. One vulnerability can take down any vehicle with that technology. DAST, Black Box Fuzzing, and SAST during development are a solid foundation of security to prevent these attacks.

![](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-automative.png)

![heartbeat](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-healthcare.png)

### [Healthcare and Medical](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guides/security-testing-for-networked-medical-devices)

Wireless technology and application software are being used more in medical devices to automate and monitor individual healthcare needs. Device security is the utmost priority, preventing risks that can directly endanger lives. Application security is needed to prevent cyber attackers from tampering with devices and stealing private healthcare data. SAST and DAST during development can help find vulnerabilities that can compromise these devices.

### Critical Infrastructure and Industrial Facilities

Water, power, and gas are some prime targets for large scale attacks. The best way to keep cyberattackers from taking down an entire city’s water supply is to create a layered cybersecurity portfolio. From the start, vulnerabilities need to be identified, remediated, and constantly monitored to prevent a mass standstill of public utilities.

![lightning bolt icon](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-critical-industries.png)

![factory](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-manufactures.png)

### Discrete Manufacturers

Manufacturing industries keep building and assembling essential pieces for everyday life. Any attack on that automation would create a bottleneck in multiple industries that rely on these products. A disruption in manufacturing has been proven to drive up prices and create a negative workflow ripple worldwide. Using layered security solutions prior to deployment and scanning afterwards will help prevent any shutdown.

### Financial

Financial institutions are still top cyberattacker targets. Monetary apps for banks, credit unions, investment, and retirement firms need the highest cybersecurity measures. Security that prevents cyberattacks should be implemented during development and embedded directly into these applications. Compliance for this industry is only growing with each reported breach.
