Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2002-1158:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:**
    *   **Heap Overflow:** A heap overflow vulnerability exists in the `irw_through` function within the Canna server.
    *   **Lack of Input Validation:** Missing input validation for requests processed by the Canna server.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**:
    *   **Heap Overflow:** The `irw_through` function is susceptible to a heap overflow, indicating a buffer overflow vulnerability on the heap. This occurs when a program writes beyond the allocated memory space for a buffer on the heap.
    *   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The Canna server doesn't adequately validate incoming requests, allowing for potentially malicious data to be processed. This is a common vulnerability that can lead to various exploits.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Remote Exploitation:** The advisory states that the vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
    *   **Unspecified Impact:** The provided text does not specify the exact impact of successful exploitation, however heap overflows often allow for arbitrary code execution and thus could have a significant impact.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Remote:** The vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely, which likely means that an attacker can send malicious requests to the Canna server over a network.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker would require network access to the vulnerable Canna server.
    *   **Knowledge of Protocol/Request Format:** To exploit the lack of input validation, the attacker would need to craft malicious requests that exploit this lack of validation or trigger the heap overflow.

**Additional Notes:**
* The advisory references a full advisory at `http://canna.sourceforge.jp/sec/Canna-2002-01.txt`, which would contain more details.
* The affected versions include Canna 3.6 and earlier.
* A fix is available via an emerge command for Gentoo Linux users.
