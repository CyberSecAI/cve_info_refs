## ISC BIND 8 fails to properly dereference cache SIG RR elements with invalid expiry times from the internal database

#### Vulnerability Note VU#581682

Original Release Date: 2002-11-13 | Last Revised: 2003-02-25

---

### Overview

A remotely exploitable denial-of-service vulnerability exists in BIND.

### Description

| A remotely exploitable denial-of-service vulnerability exists in BIND 8.2 - 8.2.6 and BIND 8.3.0 - 8.3.3. ISC's [description](http://www.isc.org/products/BIND/bind-security.html) of this vulnerability states:  It is possible to de-reference a NULL pointer for certian [sic] signature expire values. |
| --- |

### Impact

| The BIND daemon will shut down. As a result, clients will not be able to connect to the service to resolve queries. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Apply a patch from your vendor. In the absence of a patch, you may wish to consider ISC's recommendation, which is upgrading to "BIND 4.9.11, BIND 8.2.7, BIND 8.3.4 or preferably BIND 9." Additionally, ISC indicates, "BIND 4 is officially deprecated. Only security fixes will be issued for BIND 4." |
| --- |

| Disable recursion if possible. |

Trustix Secure Linux Security Advisory #2002-0076

Package name:      bind
Summary:           Remote exploit
Date:              2002-11-15
Affected versions: TSL 1.1, 1.2, 1.5

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
Package description:
  BIND (Berkeley Internet Name Domain) is an implementation of the DNS
  (Domain Name System) protocols. BIND includes a DNS server (named),
  which resolves host names to IP addresses, and a resolver library
  (routines for applications to use when interfacing with DNS).

Problem description:
  ISS X-Force has found a number of problems in all BIND 8 series up to
  and including 8.2.6 and 8.3.3.  Two of these can cause BIND to crash
  causing a denial of service attack, whereas the last can be used to
  execute arbitary code on the victim.

Action:
  We recommend that all systems with this package installed be upgraded.
  Please note that if you do not need the functionality provided by this
  package, you may want to remove it from your system.

Location:
  All TSL updates are available from
  <URI:<http://www.trustix.net/pub/Trustix/updates/>>

## History

The CERT Division is the birthplace of cybersecurity. For nearly 30 years, the CERT Division of the SEI has partnered with government, industry, law enforcement, and academia to advance cybersecurity and improve the security and resilience of computer systems and networks.

Originally focused on incident response, we have expanded into cybersecurity areas such as network situational awareness, malicious code analysis, secure coding, resilience management, insider threats, digital investigations and intelligence, workforce development, DevOps, forensics, software assurance, vulnerability discovery and analysis, and risk management.

## Former Director Richard Pethia

[Richard Pethia](/about/leadership/display.cfm?customel_datapageid_2623=3545) was founding director of the SEI's CERT Division. Pethia, who served as director of CERT from 1988 to 2016, guided the organization through tremendous growth and change. Under Pethia's leadership, the unit expanded and evolved from the CERT Coordination Center—a small group focused on computer incident response—to a research organization of more than 200 professionals dedicated to solving problems with widespread cybersecurity implications.
