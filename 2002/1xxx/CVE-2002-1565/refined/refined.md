Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2002-1565:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   Insufficient input sanitization of FTP server responses in `wget`.
*   A buffer overflow vulnerability in `wget` triggered by long URLs.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Input Sanitization Failure:** `wget` does not properly sanitize responses from FTP servers.
*   **Buffer Overflow:** `wget` is susceptible to a buffer overflow when processing long URLs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **File Overwrite:** A malicious FTP server could exploit the input sanitization issue to overwrite arbitrary files if the `wget` process has the required permissions.
*  **Denial of Service:** The buffer overflow can cause `wget` to crash (segfault), potentially leading to a denial-of-service.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Malicious FTP server:** An attacker could host a malicious FTP server designed to send crafted responses to the wget client to trigger the file overwrite vulnerability.
*   **Long URLs:** An attacker can trigger the buffer overflow vulnerability by supplying a long URL to `wget`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Malicious FTP Server:** The attacker needs to control an FTP server to exploit the sanitization issue.
*   **Ability to Supply Long URL:** To trigger the buffer overflow, the attacker needs to supply a long URL to a vulnerable `wget` process, for example via a user providing the url as a parameter, or embedding it in another file.
