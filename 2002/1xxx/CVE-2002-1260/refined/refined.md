The content is related to CVE-2002-1260.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Microsoft VM does not properly regulate access to the Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) APIs, allowing untrusted Java applets to call them.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper access control for the JDBC APIs within the Microsoft VM. These APIs provide methods for accessing and manipulating databases. Untrusted Java applets are able to bypass the security checks and utilize these APIs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to databases that the user has access to. This could result in the attacker being able to read, add, change, or delete data within those databases, depending on the user's permissions.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability could be exploited through a web page or an HTML email containing a malicious Java applet. The attacker would need to convince the user to load and run the malicious Java applet.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious Java applet that exploits the lack of access control on JDBC APIs. Additionally, the attacker needs to be able to host the applet on a web page or send it via email to a victim. The attacker would also need to know (or be able to guess) the names of the databases they wish to access, which could require insider knowledge of the target's environment.
