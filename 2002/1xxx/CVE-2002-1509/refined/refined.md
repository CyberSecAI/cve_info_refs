  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `useradd` command in shadow-utils creates mailspool files with group read/write permissions (0660), which allows members of a user's primary group to read and potentially modify their mail.",

      "Incorrect file permissions for mailspool files",
      "Group-writable file access",
      "Information disclosure of email content to unauthorized group members"

    "impact": "Unauthorized access to user emails by other members of the user's primary group, potentially leading to information disclosure or tampering.",

      "Local access by a user who is a member of the same group as the victim user"
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be a member of the same primary group as the target user. No specific privileges are needed besides this."
