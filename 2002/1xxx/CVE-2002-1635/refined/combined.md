## Oracle 9iAS allows access to CGI script source code within CGI-BIN directory

#### Vulnerability Note VU#936507

Original Release Date: 2002-02-27 | Last Revised: 2002-03-05

---

### Overview

Oracle 9i Application Server (9iAS) allows remote anonymous users to view source code in CGI scripts stored in the Apache cgi-bin. Attackers may analyze these scripts to discover usernames, passwords, or other proprietary data or methods.

### Description

| The default Apache configuration file in Oracle 9iAS provides a Location alias from "/perl" to "/cgi-bin". Because this alias is not defined as a ScriptAlias, documents accessed through the "/perl" alias are not interpreted as scripts should be. Instead, the server simply outputs the contents of the document. |
| --- |

### Impact

| Attackers may read the source code of CGI scripts by requesting them through the "/perl" alias. Attackers may analyze source code to discover usernames, passwords, or other proprietary data or methods. |
| --- |

### Solution

| The CERT/CC is currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem. |
| --- |

| Edit the "httpd.conf" file to change the "/perl" alias into a ScriptAlias. |
