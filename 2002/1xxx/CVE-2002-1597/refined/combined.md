 should contact that support organization for assistance with the
 upgrade, which should be free of charge.

 Customers who purchase direct from Cisco but who do not hold a Cisco
 service contract and customers who purchase through third party
 vendors but are unsuccessful at obtaining fixed software through their
 point of sale should get their upgrades by contacting the Cisco
 Technical Assistance Center (TAC). TAC contacts are as follows:
