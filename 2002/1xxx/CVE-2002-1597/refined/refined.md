Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2002-1597 (although the provided text doesn't explicitly mention this CVE ID, it's related to the vulnerability described)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the Cisco SN 5420 Storage Router's improper handling of fragmented packets received over its Gigabit interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of fragmented packets on the Gigabit interface. This vulnerability exists in software versions 1.1(5) and earlier.
- A separate vulnerability, detailed as CSCdv24925, allows unauthorized reading of stored configuration files.
- Another vulnerability, detailed as CSCdu32533, allows a denial of service attack by sending a HTTP request with huge headers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By sending a specially crafted fragmented packet, an attacker can cause the Cisco SN 5420 Storage Router to halt or crash, resulting in a denial of service (CSCdu45417).
- **Unauthorized Configuration Access:** An attacker could gain access to the router's stored configuration, potentially allowing unauthorized access to storage spaces (CSCdv24925).
- **Denial of Service (HTTP header):** Sending a malformed HTTP request with an exceptionally large header can crash the router leading to denial of service (CSCdu32533).

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending a specially crafted fragmented packet over the Gigabit interface.
- Sending a malformed HTTP request with an exceptionally large header.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send network packets to the vulnerable Cisco SN 5420 Storage Router.
- No authentication or special access is needed to trigger this vulnerability.
- It's assumed that the attacker has a network path to the device.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Cisco SN 5420 Storage Routers running software versions up to and including 1.1(5). Version 1.1(6) was never released.
- The issue was discovered internally during Cisco product testing.
- Cisco has addressed the vulnerability in software version 1.1(7).
- Free software upgrades are provided by Cisco for affected customers.
- There is no workaround for the fragmented packet denial-of-service or the HTTP header DoS vulnerabilities. A workaround exists for the configuration disclosure vulnerability, involving blocking network edge access and using hard to guess names for saved configurations.
