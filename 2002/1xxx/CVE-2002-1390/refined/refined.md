Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2002-1390 (based on the content referencing a security hole fix in GeneWeb 4.09 from December 30, 2002)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a security hole in the GeneWeb server or CGI component (gwd), that existed for a long time and was fixed in version 4.09. The specific vulnerability is not described but relates to filtering of HTML tags.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The vulnerability lies in how GeneWeb handled HTML tags within the application. Version 4.08 changed the filtering mechanism to accept only a few tags and reject the rest. Version 4.09 reverted to the previous behaviour where only specific tags were rejected, and the rest were accepted except for the forum section which maintains the new behavior. This suggests a potential vulnerability related to HTML injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
The content does not explicitly describe the impact of the vulnerability, but given the HTML filtering issue, it could potentially lead to:
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** An attacker could inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code through input fields, leading to execution of arbitrary code in the victim's browser.
*   **Other injection attacks:** Potential for injection of arbitrary HTML that could modify page content or layout.
*   **Data manipulation:** If input is not properly sanitized, other kinds of injection attacks may also be possible.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through the GeneWeb server (gwd) or CGI interface, which implies:
*   **User input:** The attacker would need to provide malicious HTML input to the GeneWeb server, possibly via forms or URL parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker would need the ability to interact with the GeneWeb application, possibly as a user or through a public facing part of the application.
*   An understanding of where user input is processed and how HTML tags are handled by the application.

**Additional Notes:**
The content suggests that the vulnerability existed for "a long time" before being fixed in version 4.09, but it doesn't specify exactly how long. The fix involved reverting the HTML tag filtering mechanism except for the forum section. The content mentions a specific date (December 30, 2002) for the fix being released.
