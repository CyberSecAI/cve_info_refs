- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Microsoft Virtual Machine (Microsoft VM) incorrectly parses URLs if they contain a colon used to indicate the port number. This leads to the VM incorrectly determining the domain from which a Java applet was loaded.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper URL parsing, specifically regarding the handling of colons within the domain portion of the URL. This leads to a domain spoofing issue.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious Java applet from an attacker's site can be loaded and executed within the security context of a legitimate site. This allows the malicious applet to potentially:
    - Access cookies of the legitimate site.
    - Send information solicited from the user to the attacker instead of the intended site.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - The crafted URL can be hosted on an attacker's website.
    - The crafted URL can be delivered to the user via HTML email.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious applet on a server or send it via email.
    - The attacker needs to craft a URL that exploits the Microsoft VM vulnerability.
    - The victim needs to have a vulnerable version of the Microsoft VM and be induced to access the crafted URL.
