{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Firewalls and other systems that inspect FTP application layer traffic may not adequately maintain the state of FTP commands and responses.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Inadequate state management of FTP commands and responses by firewalls.",
      "Creation of dynamic firewall rules based on potentially illegitimate PASV response strings.",
      "Vulnerability to TCP partial acknowledgement attacks."
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker may be able to access TCP ports on an FTP server or client that is behind a vulnerable firewall system, which could expose other network services to attack.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Exploiting FTP commands that echo arguments to inject a forged PASV response.",
      "Using partial TCP acknowledgment to force retransmission of a crafted PASV response.",
      "Using a URL with a padded FTP command in an HTML email or web page.",
      "Using other FTP commands like STAT to echo PORT or PASV responses.",
      "Using TCP MSS to control/lower TCP packet size.",
       "Uploading a file or creating a directory with a crafted name containing FTP commands then using 'ls' to echo them."

    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to log into an FTP server behind a vulnerable firewall. Additionally, the attacker needs the ability to craft and send TCP packets with spoofed IP addresses using a separate TCP/IP stack.",
        "more_information": "The vulnerability can also be used with the PORT command by malicious FTP servers to open connections to active FTP clients behind a vulnerable firewall."
