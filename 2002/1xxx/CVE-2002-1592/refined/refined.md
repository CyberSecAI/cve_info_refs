  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `ap_log_rerror()` function in Apache 2.0 through 2.0.35 incorrectly sent warning messages to the client that could contain the full path to a CGI script or other file.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Information disclosure",
      "The `ap_log_rerror()` function's default behavior of sending warning messages to the client."

    "impact": "Disclosure of sensitive information, specifically the full server path to CGI scripts or other files.",
    "attack_vectors": "A faulty CGI script causes the server to send a warning message to the client which contains the full path to the CGI script or other file. An attacker could potentially craft requests or exploit errors in CGI scripts to elicit this warning message.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to trigger an error within a CGI script running on the vulnerable Apache server in order for the server to return the full path in the warning message."
