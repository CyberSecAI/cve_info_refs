## x\_news allows unauthorized users to access administrative menu

#### Vulnerability Note VU#162723

Original Release Date: 2002-09-16 | Last Revised: 2002-12-10

---

### Overview

x\_news allows a user to authenticate without supplying the user's plaintext password.

### Description

| x\_news is a system for managing news. When a user logs in to x\_news version 1.1 using a plaintext password, x\_news hashes the password with MD5 and compares it to user's hash stored in the file named "db/users.txt". If they match, x\_news sets a cookie that contains the username and the hashed password. On subsequent transactions, x\_news will accept this cookie as valid authentication.  As a result, an attacker does not need to know a user's plaintext password. All that is needed is the user's MD5-hashed password, which can be found in the db/users.txt file. |
| --- |

### Impact

| Attackers can gain access to a user's account by using password data stored in a file, bypassing proper authentication by plaintext password. |
| --- |

### Solution

| The CERT/CC is currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem. |
