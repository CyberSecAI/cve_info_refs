Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `x_news` application uses a flawed authentication mechanism that relies solely on MD5-hashed passwords stored in a file (`db/users.txt`). Instead of requiring the user's plaintext password for login, the application accepts a cookie containing the username and the already-hashed password.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Authentication:** The system authenticates users based on a cookie containing a hashed password, rather than requiring a plaintext password during login.
*   **Password Storage:** The MD5 hashes of user passwords are stored in a file (`db/users.txt`) accessible to an attacker.
*   **Lack of Salt:** The description suggests that the application uses MD5 without salting the passwords, making them vulnerable to rainbow table attacks if an attacker obtains the hash database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can gain access to user accounts by obtaining the MD5 hash of a user's password from the `db/users.txt` file and using it to generate a valid authentication cookie. This bypasses the need to know the user's actual plaintext password.
*   **Account Takeover:** Attackers can fully control the affected user accounts.
*   **Administrative Access:** Based on the title "x_news allows unauthorized users to access administrative menu", it is possible that compromised accounts have elevated privileges, allowing further exploitation of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File System Access:** Attackers need to gain access to the `db/users.txt` file to obtain the MD5-hashed passwords. This could be achieved through various means, such as exploiting other vulnerabilities on the system, social engineering, or having direct access to the file system.
*   **Cookie Manipulation:** Once the attacker has the hashed password, they can create a cookie with this data and use it to authenticate as the compromised user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to `db/users.txt`:**  The attacker must be able to read the `db/users.txt` file containing the MD5 hashes of the passwords.
*   **Knowledge of Cookie Structure:** The attacker needs to understand how the cookie is structured so they can create a valid authentication cookie.
