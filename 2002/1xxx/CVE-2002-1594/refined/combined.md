## Buffer overflow vulnerability in grpck command line utility

#### Vulnerability Note VU#121891

Original Release Date: 2002-01-04 | Last Revised: 2002-07-05

---

### Overview

The CERT/CC has received a public report of a local buffer overflow vulnerability in the grpck utility.

### Description

| The grpck utility performs syntax checking of /etc/group and /etc/gshadow group information files. This utility contains a buffer overflow vulnerability in the section of code that parses command line arguments. By sending a command line argument string of approximately 3000 characters, it is possible to cause this utility to generate a segmentation fault. On systems where this utility is installed with setuid root privileges, it may be possible for local users to exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code with superuser privileges.  This vulnerability has been reported to affect systems running IRIX and Linux, but other operating systems that include this setuid root utility are likely to be affected. |
| --- |

### Impact

| This vulnerability may allow a local user to execute arbitrary code with superuser privileges. |
| --- |

### Solution

| The CERT/CC is currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem. |
| --- |

| **Clear the setuid bit of affected binaries**As a workaround, it is possible to limit the scope of this vulnerability by clearing the setuid bit of affected binaries with the chmod utility. |
