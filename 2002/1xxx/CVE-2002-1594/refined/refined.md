    "description": "The grpck utility performs syntax checking of /etc/group and /etc/gshadow group information files. This utility contains a buffer overflow vulnerability in the section of code that parses command line arguments. By sending a command line argument string of approximately 3000 characters, it is possible to cause this utility to generate a segmentation fault. On systems where this utility is installed with setuid root privileges, it may be possible for local users to exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code with superuser privileges.",
