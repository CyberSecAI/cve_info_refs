Please download and unpack <http://www.roaringpenguin.com/segfault.tar.bz2>  You need to have PostgreSQL and create a specific database with specific data in it.  Here's the README file from the tarball:  SUMMARY: PHP segfaults for PHP versions > 4.1.2 -----------------------------------------------  THE SOURCE FILES IN THIS ARCHIVE ARE PROPRIETARY COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE. PLEASE USE THEM ONLY TO DEBUG PHP PROBLEMS.  System: Red Hat Linux 8.0  PostgreSQL: 7.2.2, as supplied with Red Hat Linux 8.0  Apache: 1.3.27, configured as follows: 	./configure --with-layout=Apache --enable-shared=max \                     --enable-rule=SHARED_CORE  PHP: Tried 4.2.2, 4.2.3 and 4.3.0RC2, all configured as follows:  	./configure  --with-pgsql=shared \ 		     --with-gnu-ld \                      --with-apxs=/usr/local/apache/bin/apxs    HOW TO REPRODUCE: -----------------  1) Install Apache 1.3.27 and PHP 4.2.2, 4.2.3 or 4.3.0RC2 from source. Configure PostgreSQL 7.2.2 to trust local connections.  That is, in /var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf, make the local line read thus:  		local   all     trust  2) Create and populate the database:  	createdb -U postgres spam 	psql -U postgres -d spam < spam-database-dump   3) Copy the PHP files to your document root somewhere convenient.  4) Browse <http://your_server/these_php_files/index.php>  5) Log in as "admin", password "foo"  6) Click on "Pending Messages" - Apache will segfault.  However: Using PHP 4.1.2, configured as above, it works fine.  Extensive investigation shows that it's segfaulting inside libpq, inside PQexec, but the function which segfaults is "malloc" which leads me to believe there's memory corruption going on.   ``` PatchesPull RequestsHistoryAllCommentsChangesGit/SVN commitsRelated reports  **[2002-12-11 00:59 UTC] [sniper@php.net](//people.php.net/sniper)** ``` Thank you for this bug report.

For a list of more appropriate places to ask for help using PHP, please visit <http://www.php.net/support.php> as this bug system is not the appropriate forum for asking support questions.   Thank you for your interest in PHP.  The crash is the fault of PostgreSQL and not that of PHP.  ``` **[2002-12-11 09:55 UTC] dfs at roaringpenguin dot com** ``` I disagree.  The bug *IS* in PHP, not libpq.  The reason I assert this is as follows:  - I tried Apache 1.3.27, 2.0.40 and 2.0.43 with libraries from PostgreSQL 7.2.2, 7.2.3 and 7.3, and PHP 4.2.2, 4.2.3 and PHP 4.3.0RC2.  ALL combinations crashed reliably.  With PHP 4.1.2, I am *unable* to get a crash.  Something in PHP is corrupting memory, and later on, malloc() is failing.  I use the same libpq library with Perl and Tcl, and have never yet had a segfault.  For more info, here's a stack trace for Red Hat 8.0 with Red Hat's version of Apache (2.0.40) and Red Hat's PHP (4.2.2).  Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

The PSQL lib ist most probably not thread safe.  ``` **[2002-12-11 10:34 UTC] dfs at roaringpenguin dot com** ``` Then how do you explain the crash in Apache 1.3.27?  It is a PHP bug for sure, because changing PHP versions is the only thing which makes it go away.  ``` **[2002-12-11 10:35 UTC] [sesser@php.net](//people.php.net/sesser)** ``` Uhmm I should read better...  What versions of libpq do you use with 4.1.2 and 4.2.x?   ``` **[2002-12-11 10:36 UTC] dfs at roaringpenguin dot com** ``` Hi,  I've tried the following versions of libpq:  7.2.2 7.2.3 7.3.0  They all exhibit the same behaviour.  The default version that comes with RH8.0 is 7.2.2.  Thanks,  David.  ``` **[2002-12-11 12:38 UTC] dfs at roaringpenguin dot com** ``` More info:  Under Solaris 8 on SPARC, Apache 1.3.27 and PHP 4.2.3, it works fine.  Probably, Solaris's libc has different malloc strategy so the bug is not triggered.  I recompiled Apache, PHP and libpq so everything was statically linked in a single http executable.  Segfaulted.  Ran it under valgrind (<http://developer.kde.org/~sewardj/>) and it worked perfectly. :-(  Next, converted the script to a CGI, and installed stand-alone versions of php-4.2.3 and php-4.1.2.  The cgi crashed with php-4.2.3, but worked fine with php-4.1.2.  (Same Apache server in each case.)  Therefore, I believe this is a hard-to-find memory corruption bug. :-(  (To do the CGI test, copy showtrap.php to showtrap.cgi and add the appropriate #! line at the beginning, fix permissions, etc.)  ``` **[2002-12-11 12:57 UTC] dfs at roaringpenguin dot com** ``` More insight, and something very useful:  The bug is in the "wordwrap" function.  Please see <http://www.roaringpenguin.com/segfault2.tar.bz2> There are two PHP scripts:  One crashes PHP when run from the command line, and the other works fine.  The only difference between the two is a change in the argument to wordwrap().  Also, I ran valgrind on the standalone PHP executable, and here is its report.  Hope all of this helps!

Unfortunately, under PHP 4.1.2, which works correctly, the length of the final string is 138 characters long, and you have a buffer overflow. :-)  Test it if you don't believe me. The problem seems to be that the break string itself is being counted to determine whether or not to break the line.  Here's the output from 4.1.2 (hard to see clearly...)  ADV:CLAIM YOURCANITBREAKFOOFORTUNE NOW !!MAKECANITBREAKFOOxxxxxxxxxxHUNDREDSCANITBREAKFOOOFCANITBREAKFOOTHOUSANDSxxxxxxxxxxxCANITBREAKFOOx  Note the two breaks very close together around the word "OF"?  This yielded 5 breaks instead of the maximum 4 which the code assumes, and the break string was long enough to frustrate the "10% overhead" method.  You really need to be extremely conservative when allocating space; assume that there can be as many breaks added as there are characters in the original string.  For most cases, with short break strings, this won't lead to too much over-allocation, and it will fix the problem.  -- David.  ``` **[2002-12-11 14:37 UTC] dfs at roaringpenguin dot com** ``` One more thing and then I'll shut up. :-)  Rather than allocating space to begin with, why not use something like Tcl's Dynamic Strings, which let you grow the buffer as required?  Then you can just call dstring_append and not worry about space.  Regards,  David.  ``` **[2002-12-11 14:38 UTC] [derick@php.net](//people.php.net/derick)** ``` I still can't get it to crash here though, even with your configure line and scripts. Valgrind doesn't report anything either.   ``` **[2002-12-11 14:43 UTC] dfs at roaringpenguin dot com** ``` Are you running on Red Hat 8.0?  I consistently get a crash.  It's also obvious that the buffer allocated is 135 bytes, and the length of the wrapped string is 138.  So if you're not getting a crash, it's just luck.  Try this script instead:  <?php $x = "ADV:CLAIM YOUR FORTUNE NOW !!MAKE"; $x .= " xxxxxxxxxxHUNDREDS OF THOUSANDSxxxxxxxxxxxx"; $b = "CANITBREAKFOO"; for ($i=0; $i<1000; $i++) {   $y = wordwrap($x, 20, $b, 1); } ?>  That should exercise malloc() a lot more.  ``` **[2002-12-11 14:52 UTC] [derick@php.net](//people.php.net/derick)** ``` I'm running RedHat 7.1, and the last script still doesn't crash for me, and no output from valgrind at all...  gcc = 2.96 (stock redhat 7.1)  What is your gcc version?  Derick  ``` **[2002-12-11 15:01 UTC] dfs at roaringpenguin dot com** ``` Ah, the bug might not show up on Red Hat 7.1, probably because of glibc differences.  Anyway, here's my system:  $ gcc -v Reading specs from /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i386-redhat-linux/3.2/specs Configured with: ../configure --prefix=/usr --mandir=/usr/share/man --infodir=/usr/share/info --enable-shared --enable-threads=posix --disable-checking --host=i386-redhat-linux --with-system-zlib --enable-__cxa_atexit Thread model: posix gcc version 3.2 20020903 (Red Hat Linux 8.0 3.2-7)  $ ldd /usr/local/bin/php         libcrypt.so.1 => /lib/libcrypt.so.1 (0x4002f000)         libresolv.so.2 => /lib/libresolv.so.2 (0x4005d000)         libm.so.6 => /lib/i686/libm.so.6 (0x4006f000)         libdl.so.2 => /lib/libdl.so.2 (0x40091000)         libnsl.so.1 => /lib/libnsl.so.1 (0x40094000)         libc.so.6 => /lib/i686/libc.so.6 (0x42000000)         /lib/ld-linux.so.2 => /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0x40000000)  $ rpm -q glibc glibc-2.2.93-5  Regards,  David.  ``` **[2002-12-11 20:15 UTC] dfs at roaringpenguin dot com** ``` A more dramatic example:  The following script, under PHP 4.1.2, prints:  Length of original string:  130 Length of break string:     11264 Length of wrapped string:   214127 Size allocated by 4.3.0RC2: 173596 BUFFER OVERFLOW by 40531 bytes!  With 4.3.0RC2, it segfaults.  -- David.  <?php $part = "1234567890 X "; $string = ""; for ($i=0; $i<10; $i++) {     $string .= $part; }  $break = "a-very-long-break-string-to-clobber-the-heap"; for ($i=0; $i<8; $i++) {     $break .= $break; }  $linelength = 10; $wrapped = wordwrap($string, $linelength, $break, 1);  $textlen = strlen($string); print("Length of original string:  $textlen\n"); $breakcharlen = strlen($break); print("Length of break string:     $breakcharlen\n"); $newtextlen = strlen($wrapped); print("Length of wrapped string:   $newtextlen\n");  $buffer = $textlen +           intval(($textlen/$linelength + 1) * $breakcharlen * 1.1) + 1;  print("Size allocated by 4.3.0RC2: $buffer\n"); $overflow = $newtextlen - $buffer; if ($overflow > 0) {     print ("BUFFER OVERFLOW by $overflow bytes!\n"); }  ?>  ``` **[2002-12-12 00:24 UTC] [derick@php.net](//people.php.net/derick)** ``` Okay, now I could verify this (with 4.3.0RC3). Going to fix this soonish.  ``` **[2002-12-12 07:47 UTC] [iliaa@php.net](//people.php.net/iliaa)** ``` This bug has been fixed in CVS.  In case this was a PHP problem, snapshots of the sources are packaged every three hours; this change will be in the next snapshot. You can grab the snapshot at <http://snaps.php.net/>.   In case this was a documentation problem, the fix will show up soon at <http://www.php.net/manual/>.  In case this was a PHP.net website problem, the change will show up on the PHP.net site and on the mirror sites in short time.   Thank you for the report, and for helping us make PHP better.    ``` |

Subject:    Buffer overflow in PHP "wordwrap" function
From:       ["David F. Skoll" <dfs () roaringpenguin ! com>](?a=94449578300001&r=1&w=2)
Date:       [2002-12-27 21:43:44](?l=bugtraq&r=1&w=2&b=200212)
[Download RAW [message](?l=bugtraq&m=104102689503192&q=mbox) or [body](?l=bugtraq&m=104102689503192&q=raw)]

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

There is a buffer overflow in PHP's built-in "wordwrap" function
for PHP versions greater than 4.1.2 and less than 4.3.0.

Please see <http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=20927> for details.

If you use the wordwrap() function on user-supplied input, a
specially-crafted input can overflow the allocated buffer and
overwrite the heap.  Exploit looks very difficult, but still
theoretically possible.

Status:

Bug cause discovered: 10 Dec 2002
PHP team notified:    10 Dec 2002
Bug fixed in CVS:     12 Dec 2002
PHP 4.3.0 released:   27 Dec 2002

Kudos to the PHP team for their extremely rapid reaction.

Recommendations:

Don't upgrade from 4.1.2 if you are certain there are no security problems
with your 4.1.2 setup and you may be vulnerable to the wordwrap() bug.

Otherwise, upgrade to 4.3.0
