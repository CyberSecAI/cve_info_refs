The provided content relates to CVE-2002-1603.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The GoAhead WebServer improperly handles file requests, specifically failing to adequately filter user-supplied input when requesting .asp files. This allows for source code disclosure of server-side scripts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Input validation vulnerability: The webserver doesn't properly sanitize URLs, allowing an attacker to append special characters.
- Information disclosure:  The vulnerability allows viewing of source code for ASP files, including sensitive information that should not be exposed.
- Authentication bypass:  A related vulnerability allows bypassing authentication for protected files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can access sensitive information by viewing the source code of ASP files. This may include usernames, passwords, and other confidential data.
- Attackers can bypass authentication mechanisms, potentially gaining unauthorized access to protected resources.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending specially crafted URLs to the web server, including specific characters like `%00`, `%2f`, `%5c`, `/` and `\` after the file name.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Remote attacker
- Ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable webserver.
