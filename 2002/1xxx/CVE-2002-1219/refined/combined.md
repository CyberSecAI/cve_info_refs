## Cached malformed SIG record buffer overflow

#### Vulnerability Note VU#852283

Original Release Date: 2002-11-13 | Last Revised: 2004-10-18

---

### Overview

A vulnerability in BIND allows remote attackers to execute code with the privileges of the process running *named*. This vulnerability is resolved in BIND versions 4.9.11, 8.2.7, 8.3.4, and BIND 9.

### Description

| A remotely exploitable buffer overflow exists in *named*. An attacker using malformed SIG records can exploit this vulnerability against a nameserver with recursion enabled. The overflow occurs when the nameserver constructs responses to recursive requests using the malformed SIG records, leading to arbitrary code execution as the *named* uid, typically root. As was the case with a previous issue affecting *named* and NXT records ([CA-1999-14](http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-1999-14.html), [VU#16532](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/16532)), a malicious server must reply to a forwarded request from a recursive nameserver in order to exploit the vulnerability. However, as with the NXT record exploit, a full-service nameserver is not required, only a service replying to a legitimate victim nameserver request.  The following versions of BIND are affected: - BIND versions 4.9.5 to 4.9.10- BIND versions 8.1, 8.2 to 8.2.6, and 8.3.0 to 8.3.3 |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker could execute arbitrary code on the nameserver with the privileges of the *named* uid, typically root. |
| --- |

### Solution

| [Upgrade](http://www.isc.org/products/BIND) to BIND 4.9.11, BIND 8.2.7, BIND 8.3.4, or BIND 9. |
| --- |

| One interim workaround is to disable recursion on vulnerable servers. |

CONECTIVA LINUX SECURITY ANNOUNCEMENT
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

PACKAGE   : bind
SUMMARY   : Remote vulnerabilities in the BIND DNS server
DATE      : 2002-11-14 15:36:00
ID        : CLA-2002:546
RELEVANT
RELEASES  : 6.0

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

DESCRIPTION
 "bind" is probably the most used DNS server on the internet.

 ISS reported[7] buffer overflow and denial of service vulnerabilities
 in some versions of the BIND software. The most dangerous one, the
 buffer overflow, could be used by remote attacker to execute
 arbitrary code on the server with the privileges of the user running
 the "named" process.

 The vulnerabilities explained below affect BIND as shipped with
 Conectiva Linux 6.0. Conectiva Linux 7.0 and 8 already ship BIND 9.x,
 which is not vulnerable to the problems reported by ISS.

 1) Buffer overflow (CAN-2002-1219) [5]
 An attacker who can make a vulnerable BIND server make recursive
 queries to a domain that he (the attacker) controls can exploit this
 vulnerability and execute arbitrary code on the server with the same
 privileges as the "named" process. The BIND packages in Conectiva
 Linux run the "named" process with an unprivileged user, and not
 root, which mitigates the impact of this vulnerability somewhat,
 requiring that the attacker take further steps to obtain root access.
 Additionally, there is the bind-chroot package which, if used, runs
 the server in a chroot area under /var/named which imposes an
 additional restriction on the actions a potential intruder can take.

 2) Denial of service (CAN-2002-1221) [6]
 The BIND server can be triggered into attempting a NULL pointer
 dereference which will terminate the service. This can be caused by a
 remote attacker who controls a DNS server authoritative for some
 domain queried by the vulnerable BIND server.

 The packages available through this advisory were built with patches
 that were made publicly available[3] by ISC less than 24 hours ago.
 Conectiva Linux and the majority of other GNU/Linux distributions
 were notified about this vulnerability (but with not enough details
 to produce a patch) about 12 hours before ISS made it public[7]. We
 are worried about the way in which this whole incident has been
 handled, specially when considering that DNS is part of the internet
 infrastructure and thus a vital service.

 We, and many vendors, do believe in what is commonly called
 "responsible full disclosure"[8], where all details about a
 vulnerability are made public after all vendors were notified in
 advance and have had a reasonable amount of time to prepare and test
 updated packages. We believe this to be the most secure and
 responsible method for disclosing vulnerabilities.

SOLUTION
 All BIND users should upgrade immediately. After the upgrade, the
 named service will be automatically restarted if needed.

 If it is not possible to upgrade the packages immediately, users
 should disable recursive queries or restrict them. Disabling
 recursive queries can be done by the "recursion no;" parameter in the
 options section of the named.conf configuration file. Restricting
 access to such queries can be accomplished via the "allow-recursion"
 directive in the same configuration file.

  EnGarde Secure Linux is a secure distribution of Linux that features
  improved access control, host and network intrusion detection, Web
  based secure remote management, e-commerce, and integrated open source
  security tools.

OVERVIEW
- --------
  Several vulnerabilities were found in the BIND nameserver.  The
  vulnerabilities, discovered by ISS, range from buffer overflows to
  denial of service (DoS) attacks.

  The summaries below are from the ISS advisory which may be found at:

    <http://bvlive01.iss.net/issEn/delivery/xforce/alertdetail.jsp?oid=21469>

  \* CAN-2002-1219 -- BIND SIG Cached RR Overflow Vulnerability

    "A buffer overflow exists in BIND 4 and 8 that may lead to remote
     compromise of vulnerable DNS servers. An attacker who controls any
     authoritative DNS server may cause BIND to cache DNS information
     within its internal database, if recursion is enabled. Recursion is
     enabled by default unless explicitly disabled via command line
     options or in the BIND configuration file. Attackers must either
     create their own name server that is authoritative for any domain,
     or compromise any other authoritative server with the same criteria.
     Cached information is retrieved when requested by a DNS client. There
     is a flaw in the formation of DNS responses containing SIG resource
     records (RR) that can lead to buffer overflow and execution of
     arbitrary code."

  \* CAN-2002-1220 -- BIND OPT DoS

    "Recursive BIND 8 servers can be caused to abruptly terminate due to
     an assertion failure. A client requesting a DNS lookup on a
     nonexistent sub- domain of a valid domain name may cause BIND 8 to
     terminate by attaching an OPT resource record with a large UDP
     payload size. This DoS may also be triggered for queries on domains
     whose authoritative DNS servers are unreachable."

  \* CAN-2002-1221 -- BIND SIG Expiry Time DoS

    "Recursive BIND 8 servers can be caused to abruptly terminate due to a
     null pointer dereference. An attacker who controls any authoritative
     name server may cause vulnerable BIND 8 servers to attempt to cache
     SIG RR elements with invalid expiry times. These are removed from the
     BIND internal database, but later improperly referenced, leading to a
     DoS condition."

  All users should upgrade as soon as possible.

SOLUTION
- --------
  Users of the EnGarde Professional edition can use the Guardian Digital
  Secure Network to update their systems automatically.

  EnGarde Community users should upgrade to the most recent version
  as outlined in this advisory.  Updates may be obtained from:

    ftp://ftp.engardelinux.org/pub/engarde/stable/updates/
    <http://ftp.engardelinux.org/pub/engarde/stable/updates/>

  Before upgrading the package, the machine must either:

    a) be booted into a "standard" kernel; or
    b) have LIDS disabled.

  To disable LIDS, execute the command:

    # /sbin/lidsadm -S -- -LIDS\_GLOBAL

  To install the updated package, execute the command:

    # rpm -Uvh files

  You must now update the LIDS configuration by executing the command:

    # /usr/sbin/config\_lids.pl

  To re-enable LIDS (if it was disabled), execute the command:

    # /sbin/lidsadm -S -- +LIDS\_GLOBAL

  To verify the signatures of the updated packages, execute the command:

    # rpm -Kv files

                Mandrake Linux Security Update Advisory
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Package name:           bind
Advisory ID:            MDKSA-2002:077
Date:                   November 14th, 2002

Affected versions:      7.2, Single Network Firewall 7.2
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Problem Description:

 Several vulnerabilities were discovered in the BIND8 DNS server by ISS
 (Internet Security Services), including a remotely exploitable buffer
 overflow.  The first vulnerability is how named handles SIG records;
 this buffer overflow can be exploited to obtain access to the victim
 host with the privilege of the user the named process is running as.
 By default, Mandrake Linux is configured to run the named process as
 the named user.  To successfully exploit this vulnerability, the
 attacker must control an existing DNS domain and must be allowed to
 perform a recursive query.

 A possible work-around is to restrict recursive requests, however
 MandrakeSoft encourages all users to upgrade to the provided BIND9
 packages.  You can also completely disable recursion by adding
 "recursion no;" to the options section of /etc/named.conf.

 Several Denial of Service problems also exist in BIND8 that allow
 attackers to terminate the named process.  At least one of these
 vulnerabilities seems to be exploitable even when the attacker is
 not permitted to perform recursive queries, so the work-around noted
 above is not effective against this DoS.

 Both problems are not reported to effect BIND9.  As Linux-Mandrake
 7.2 and Single Network Firewall 7.2 are the only supported distributions
 to still ship BIND8, we have elected to upgrade to both a patched
 version of BIND8 and BIND9.  The BIND8 packages contain the patch
 ISC made available late on the 13th, contrary to their original
 advisory which called for them to be made available next week.  Despite
 this, however, MandrakeSoft encourages everyone who is able to upgrade
 to BIND9 rather than BIND8.

 The MandrakeSoft security team wishes to apologize to MandrakeSoft
 customers for not being able to provide timely fixes for this problem,
 and regrets the inability of the ISC to work with the Internet community
 at large to provide adequate protection to users of BIND.

Affected

### Vendor Statement

BIND 4.9.10-OW2 includes the patch provided by ISC and thus has the two vulnerabilities affecting BIND 4 fixed. Previous versions of BIND 4.9.x-OW patches, if used properly, significantly reduced the impact of the "named" vulnerability. The patches are available at their usual location:

<http://www.openwall.com/bind/>

A patch against BIND 4.9.11 will appear as soon as this version is officially released, although it will likely be effectively the same as the currently available 4.9.10-OW2.

It hasn't been fully researched whether the resolver code in glibc,and in particular on Openwall GNU/\*/Linux, shares any of the newly discovered BIND 4 resolver library vulnerabilities. Analysis is in progress.

1)  problem description, brief discussion, solution, upgrade information

    The security research company ISS (Internet Security Services)
    has discovered several vulnerabilities in the BIND8 name server,
    including a remotely exploitable buffer overflow.

    Circumstancial evidence suggests that the Internet Software
    Consortium (maintainer of BIND) has been made aware of these issues
    in mid-October. Distributors of Open Source operating systems,
    including SuSE, were notified of these vulnerabilities via CERT
    approximately 12 hours before the release of the advisories by ISS
    and ISC on Tue, Nov 12. This notification did not include any details
    that allowed us to identify the vulnerable code, much less prepare
    a fix. Mails to ISC went unanswered for 36 hours.

    The SuSE security team regrets that the Internet Software Consortium
    has withheld vital information from the Internet community for so long,
    putting the majority of BIND users at risk. We would like to express
    our concern that the approach chosen by ISC and ISS is likely to
    erode trust in the security community if it becomes a model for dealing
    with security issues.

    We apologize to SuSE customers for not being able to provide timely
    fixes for this problem.

    The advisories by ISS and ISC mention the following problems
    in detail:

     1.There is a buffer overflow in the way named handles
        SIG records. This buffer overflow can be exploited to
        obtain access to the victim host under the account
        the named process is running with.

In order to exploit this problem, the attacker must
control an existing DNS domain, and must be allowed
to perform a recursive query.

The impact of this vulnerability is serious.

In all SuSE products, named is configured to run as user "named"
by default, so a potential attacker or virus/worm does not get
immediate root access. However, this is merely an additional
obstacle the attacker faces. It may be possible for the attacker
to exploit other, unpatched local vulnerabilities such as the
recently announced traceroute hole to obtain root privilege. It
may also be possible for an attacker to obtain increased privilege
by manipulating the DNS zones served by the victim BIND server.

We recommend to upgrade to the provided packages. If this is
not possible, we recommend to restrict recursive requests as a
workaround. This can be done by adding a statement such as the
following to /etc/named.conf:

options {
... existing options ...

# Restrict recursive queries to 192.168.1.\*,
# except 192.168.1.254.
# Order does matter.
allow-recursion {
!192.168.1.254;
192.168.1/24;
};
};

Alternatively, you can add "recursion no;" to the options
section to turn off recursion completely.

     2.There are several Denial Of Service problems in BIND8
        that allow remote attackers to terminate the name server
        process.

At least one of these vulnerabilities seems to be exploitable
even when the attacker is not allowed to perform recursive
queries, so that the workaround suggested above is not
effective against this bug.

    Both vulnerabilities are addressed by this update, using patches
    originating from ISC.

    Due to the severity of this issue, we will provide update packages
    for SuSE Linux 7.0, even though support for this product has officially
    been discontinued.

    Please download the update package for your distribution and verify its
    integrity by the methods listed in section 3) of this announcement.
    Then, install the packages using the command "rpm -Fhv file.rpm" to apply
    the update. After updating, make sure to restart the name server
    process by issuing the following command as root:

    rcnamed restart

    Our maintenance customers are being notified individually. The packages
    are being offered to install from the maintenance web.

2)  Pending vulnerabilities in SuSE Distributions and Workarounds:

    BIND4
In addition to the vulnerabilities in BIND8 discussed above, ISS
report several vulnerabilities in BIND4. As stated previously,
SuSE has discontinued support for BIND4 and recommends that
users upgrade to BIND8 as soon as possible.

    Trojaned libpcap/tcpdump
    There have been reports that the source packages of tcpdump and
libpcap available from several FTP servers have been modified to
include a trojan. We have checked our source packages for this
and found them to be clean.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

3)  standard appendix: authenticity verification, additional information

  - Package authenticity verification:

    SuSE update packages are available on many mirror ftp servers all over
    the world. While this service is being considered valuable and important
    to the free and open source software community, many users wish to be
    sure about the origin of the package and its content before installing
    the package. There are two verification methods that can be used
    independently from each other to prove the authenticity of a downloaded
    file or rpm package:
    1) md5sums as provided in the (cryptographically signed) announcement.
    2) using the internal gpg signatures of the rpm package.

    1) execute the command
        md5sum <name-of-the-file.rpm>
       after you downloaded the file from a SuSE ftp server or its mirrors.
       Then, compare the resulting md5sum with the one that is listed in the
       announcement. Since the announcement containing the checksums is
       cryptographically signed (usually using the key security@suse.de),
       the checksums show proof of the authenticity of the package.
       We disrecommend to subscribe to security lists which cause the
       email message containing the announcement to be modified so that
       the signature does not match after transport through the mailing
       list software.
       Downsides: You must be able to verify the authenticity of the
       announcement in the first place. If RPM packages are being rebuilt
       and a new version of a package is published on the ftp server, all
       md5 sums for the files are useless.

    2) rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the authenticity
       of an rpm package. Use the command
        rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
       to verify the signature of the package, where <file.rpm> is the
       filename of the rpm package that you have downloaded. Of course,
       package authenticity verification can only target an un-installed rpm
       package file.
       Prerequisites:
        a) gpg is installed
        b) The package is signed using a certain key. The public part of this
           key must be installed by the gpg program in the directory
           ~/.gnupg/ under the user's home directory who performs the
           signature verification (usually root). You can import the key
           that is used by SuSE in rpm packages for SuSE Linux by saving
           this announcement to a file ("announcement.txt") and
           running the command (do "su -" to be root):
            gpg --batch; gpg < announcement.txt | gpg --import
           SuSE Linux distributions version 7.1 and thereafter install the
           key "build@suse.de" upon installation or upgrade, provided that
           the package gpg is installed. The file containing the public key
           is placed at the top-level directory of the first CD (pubring.gpg)
           and at ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/suse/pubring.gpg-build.suse.de .

  - SuSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
    subscribe:

    suse-security@suse.com
        -   general/linux/SuSE security discussion.
            All SuSE security announcements are sent to this list.
            To subscribe, send an email to
                <suse-security-subscribe@suse.com>.

    suse-security-announce@suse.com
        -   SuSE's announce-only mailing list.
            Only SuSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
            To subscribe, send an email to
                <suse-security-announce-subscribe@suse.com>.

    For general information or the frequently asked questions (faq)
    send mail to:
        <suse-security-info@suse.com> or
        <suse-security-faq@suse.com> respectively.

    =====================================================================
    SuSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

## History

The CERT Division is the birthplace of cybersecurity. For nearly 30 years, the CERT Division of the SEI has partnered with government, industry, law enforcement, and academia to advance cybersecurity and improve the security and resilience of computer systems and networks.

Originally focused on incident response, we have expanded into cybersecurity areas such as network situational awareness, malicious code analysis, secure coding, resilience management, insider threats, digital investigations and intelligence, workforce development, DevOps, forensics, software assurance, vulnerability discovery and analysis, and risk management.

## Former Director Richard Pethia

[Richard Pethia](/about/leadership/display.cfm?customel_datapageid_2623=3545) was founding director of the SEI's CERT Division. Pethia, who served as director of CERT from 1988 to 2016, guided the organization through tremendous growth and change. Under Pethia's leadership, the unit expanded and evolved from the CERT Coordination Center—a small group focused on computer incident response—to a research organization of more than 200 professionals dedicated to solving problems with widespread cybersecurity implications.
