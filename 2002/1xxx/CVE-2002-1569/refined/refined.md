- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `gv` program uses the `system()` function to execute commands based on the filename of the input file. Specifically, when handling PDF or GZip files, it constructs commands that include the filename without proper sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command injection vulnerability via unsanitized filenames used in `system()` calls.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can craft a malicious filename that, when opened by a victim using `gv`, executes arbitrary shell commands with the victim's privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker would need to distribute a file with a crafted filename.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to create a file with a malicious filename and trick a user into opening it with `gv`. The attacker does not need to have any prior access to the system.
