  "CVE-2002-1235": {
    "description": "A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the Kerberos v4 compatibility administration daemon (kadmind4) within MIT krb5 distributions. The vulnerability arises from a lack of proper bounds checking on a length field within a network request, allowing an attacker to cause a buffer overflow on the stack.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The `kadm_ser_in()` function in `kadm_ser_wrap.c` reads a length field from a network request without proper validation. This length field is then used in a `memcpy()` operation, leading to a stack buffer overflow if the length is manipulated by an attacker to be larger than the buffer `authent.dat`.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow",
        "CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound"
      ],
      "impact": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running kadmind4 (usually root). This can lead to compromise of the Kerberos database and the KDC (Key Distribution Center) host.",
      "attack_vectors": "A malicious network request is sent to the kadmind4 daemon. The request includes an oversized length value which causes a stack buffer overflow when the request data is copied to the `authent.dat` buffer.",
       "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker can send a crafted network request to the vulnerable `kadmind4` service. No authentication is required."
