		 MIT krb5 Security Advisory 2002-002

2002-10-22

Topic: Buffer overflow in kadmind4

Severity: CRITICAL - Remote user can gain root access to KDC host.

SUMMARY
=======

A stack buffer overflow in the implementation of the Kerberos v4
compatibility administration daemon (kadmind4) in the MIT krb5
distribution can be exploited to gain unauthorized root access to a
KDC host.  The attacker does not need to authenticate to the daemon to
successfully perform this attack.  At least one exploit is known to
exist in the wild.

The kadmind4 supplied with MIT krb5 is intended for use in sites that
require compatibility with legacy administrative clients; sites that
do not have this requirement are not likely to be running this daemon.

IMPACT
======

A remote attacker can execute arbitrary code on the KDC with the
privileges of the user running kadmind4 (usually root).  This can lead
to compromise of the Kerberos database.

AFFECTED SOFTWARE
=================

* All releases of MIT Kerberos 5, up to and including krb5-1.2.6.

* All Kerberos 4 implementations derived from MIT Kerberos 4,
  including Cygnus Network Security (CNS).

FIXES
=====

Apply the following patch to src/kadmin/v4server/kadm_ser_wrap.c:

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
===============

Thanks to Johan Danielsson and Love Hornquist-Astrand for alerting us
to this problem and providing us with an initial patch.

Thanks to Assar Westerlund for further assistance in developing the
patch.

DETAILS
=======

The function kadm_ser_in() is passed an allocated buffer (containing a
request read from the network) and its length.  From this buffer, it
reads an 8-byte version string followed by a 4-byte length.  This
length field is not checked; an attacker can construct a request that
will cause authent.length to become negative or to become greater than
sizeof(authent.dat).  Both cases can cause the following call to
memcpy() to overflow authent.dat, which is a buffer on the stack.

## Kerberos administration daemon vulnerable to buffer overflow

#### Vulnerability Note VU#875073

Original Release Date: 2002-10-23 | Last Revised: 2003-02-26

---

### Overview

Multiple Kerberos distributions contain a remotely exploitable buffer overflow in the Kerberos administration daemon. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain root privileges on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| A remotely exploitable buffer overflow exists in the Kerberos administration daemon in both the MIT and KTH Kerberos implementations. The administration daemon handles requests for changes to the Kerberos database and runs on the master Key Distribution Center (KDC) system of a Kerberos realm. The master KDC contains the authoritative copy of the Kerberos database, thus it is a critical part of a site's Kerberos infrastructure. The buffer overflow can be triggered when the daemon parses an un-checked length value contained in an administrative request read from the network. An attacker does not have to authenticate in order to exploit this vulnerability, and the Kerberos administration daemon runs with root privileges.  Further information is available in [MIT krb5 Security Advisory 2002-002](http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/www/advisories/MITKRB5-SA-2002-002-kadm4.txt). MIT has also provided a [description](http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/www/advisories/2002-002-kadm4_attacksig.txt) of the attack signature against kadmind4.In the MIT Kerberos 5 distribution, kadmind4 is included to provide legacy support for Kerberos 4 administrative clients. In the KTH Kerberos 5 (Heimdal) distribution, kadmind can be compiled with Kerberos 4 support. Therefore, sites using Kerberos 5 may be running vulnerable Kerberos administration daemon. Other implementations derived from MIT Kerberos 4 are likely to be affected, and many operating systems include Kerberos code from MIT or KTH. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An unauthenticated, remote attacker could execute arbitrary code with root privileges. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Patch or Upgrade**Apply the appropriate patch or upgrade as specified by your vendor. |
| --- |

| **Disable Vulnerable Service**If it is not needed, disable Kerberos 4 support. In MIT Kerberos 5, disable kadmin4. In KTH Heimdal, compile kadmind without Kerberos 4 support. This will prevent Kerberos 4 administrative clients from accessing the Kerberos database.**Block or Restrict Access**Block access to the Kerberos administration server from untrusted networks such as the Internet. Furthermore, only allow access to the server from trusted administrative hosts. The assigned port for the Kerberos 4 administrative protocol is 751/tcp and 751/udp; however, this may be configured differently. It may also be necessary to block access to Kerberos 5 administration daemons that support the Kerberos 4 administration protocol. The assigned port for the Kerberos 5 administrative protocol is 749/tcp and 749/udp. Again, this may be configured differently. Note that this workaround will not prevent exploitation, but it will limit the possible sources of attacks. |

Hi!

About the KTH Heimdal remote root exploit I can say it is really serious!

About a week ago a hacker stole over 10'000 passwords from Stockholm University in \
Sweden for all students and staff by trapping the stack buffer overflow in kadmind4. \
You can imagine what problems this caused and what this will cost.

As we at our place have learned it is important to protect the KDC server by a \
firewall to not allow the rest of the world to reach it. Since this happened a week \
ago exploits for this are floating around.

Also we've heard people talking after examining the Heimdal code more carefully that \
there is a few more parts in it which needs to be rewritten. So if you run a KDC, \
please protect it carefully! There will probably be new realeases of Heimdal out in a \
week or so.

Please upgrade your systems ASAP becase this is a really serios problem!

## History

The CERT Division is the birthplace of cybersecurity. For nearly 30 years, the CERT Division of the SEI has partnered with government, industry, law enforcement, and academia to advance cybersecurity and improve the security and resilience of computer systems and networks.

Originally focused on incident response, we have expanded into cybersecurity areas such as network situational awareness, malicious code analysis, secure coding, resilience management, insider threats, digital investigations and intelligence, workforce development, DevOps, forensics, software assurance, vulnerability discovery and analysis, and risk management.

## Former Director Richard Pethia

[Richard Pethia](/about/leadership/display.cfm?customel_datapageid_2623=3545) was founding director of the SEI's CERT Division. Pethia, who served as director of CERT from 1988 to 2016, guided the organization through tremendous growth and change. Under Pethia's leadership, the unit expanded and evolved from the CERT Coordination Center—a small group focused on computer incident response—to a research organization of more than 200 professionals dedicated to solving problems with widespread cybersecurity implications.

	    MIT krb5 Security Advisory 2002-002 [updated]

2002-10-25 [updated; revision history at end]

Original Release Date: 2002-10-22

Topic: Buffer overflow in kadmind4

Severity: CRITICAL - Remote user can gain root access to KDC host.

SUMMARY
=======

A stack buffer overflow in the implementation of the Kerberos v4
compatibility administration daemon (kadmind4) in the MIT krb5
distribution can be exploited to gain unauthorized root access to a
KDC host.  The attacker does not need to authenticate to the daemon to
successfully perform this attack.  At least one exploit is known to
exist in the wild, and at least one attacker is reasonably competent
at cleaning up traces of intrusion.

The kadmind4 supplied with MIT krb5 is intended for use in sites that
require compatibility with legacy administrative clients; sites that
do not have this requirement are not likely to be running this daemon.

IMPACT
======

A remote attacker can execute arbitrary code on the KDC with the
privileges of the user running kadmind4 (usually root).  This can lead
to compromise of the Kerberos database.

AFFECTED SOFTWARE
=================

* All releases of MIT Kerberos 5, up to and including krb5-1.2.6.

* All Kerberos 4 implementations derived from MIT Kerberos 4,
  including Cygnus Network Security (CNS).  This includes KTH Kerberos
  4 (eBones).  See CERT advisory CA-2002-29.

* KTH Heimdal has a similar vulnerability, if Kerberos 4 compatibility
  is compiled.  See CERT advisory CA-2002-29.

FIXES
=====

Apply the following patch to src/kadmin/v4server/kadm_ser_wrap.c:

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
===============

Thanks to Johan Danielsson and Love Hornquist-Astrand for alerting us
to this problem and providing us with an initial patch.

Thanks to Assar Westerlund for further assistance in developing the
patch.

DETAILS
=======

The function kadm_ser_in() is passed an allocated buffer (containing a
request read from the network) and its length.  From this buffer, it
reads an 8-byte version string followed by a 4-byte length.  This
length field is not checked; an attacker can construct a request that
will cause authent.length to become negative or to become greater than
sizeof(authent.dat).  Both cases can cause the following call to
memcpy() to overflow authent.dat, which is a buffer on the stack.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Description of kadmind4 Attack Signature
These notes are probably only applicable to code significantly similar
to the MIT kadmind4 implementation (both the krb5 compatibility daemon
and the original krb4 implementation), though Heimdal's code paths
seem like they may result in the same effects.
Note: It is believed that at least one attacker is reasonably
competent at cleaning up traces of intrusion. A successful attack may
not result in \*any\* discernible evidence on the compromised host
itself.
An attempted attack on kadmind4 can result in several types of log
messages. Most of these are logged by kadm\_ser\_in() as it is
performing an error return. Since in the normal operation of
kadmind4, kadm\_ser\_in() is called within a child process, any abnormal
process termination will be noticed and logged by the parent. For
example:
Oct 23 00:18:29 kadmind4[15508]: [ID 895325 local6.error] child 15514: termsig 11, retcode 0
Attack attempts that do not result in abnormal child termination may
cause the logging of other errors. The exact form of these log
messages may vary depending on the particular kadmind4 implementation;
note in particular that the kadmind4 included with MIT krb5 does not
initialize the "krb" error table, so these errors will appear as
"unknown error krb ###".
Error conditions encountered in kadm\_ser\_in() result in an error
packet being generated (but not sent), and an error code being
returned. The caller of kadm\_ser\_in(), which is process\_client() in
admin\_server.c, is responsible for logging the error code returned
from kadm\_ser\_in(), as well as transmitting the error packet to the
client. An attack attempt that results in a successful return from
kadm\_ser\_in(), i.e. one that probably does not result in the execution
of attacker-chosen code or that does not crash the child process, will
cause kadmind4 to both send an error packet to the client and log an
error message.
One possible way to distinguish between attempted attacks and
legitimate requests encountering error conditions is to time-correlate
requests for tickets for the "changepw.kerberos" service with the
error messages in question. This of course does not help in cases
where the attacker happens to request "changepw.kerberos" tickets
prior to making an attack. Note that some skew must be accommodated
when doing this time correlation, since a real user may delay somewhat
between typing an old password and entering the new one twice.
An actual attack signature might produce a few child process crashes
and/or a few error logs, followed by the actual successful exploit,
which may not result in any error logs at all. This progression may
occur as the attacker adjusts parameters of the attack for the stack
pointer and stack layout of a particular instance of kadmind4.
If the attacker tunes the initial attack to avoid a segmentation fault
inside memcpy(), there may not be any crashes preceding the error
logs, especially on architectures such as SPARC that use register
windows. The reason would be that if the return address of
kadm\_ser\_in() is in a window that has not been written to the stack
frame due to a window spill trap by the call to memcpy(), then the
overflow of the on-stack buffer would not be able to modify the return
address of kadm\_ser\_in().
The following is a list of likely errors returned from kadm\_ser\_in()
during the course of an attempted attack. It is not an exhaustive
list. The errors are listed by their krb.h CPP macros, and also
include text that may be logged by kadmind4. Note that some of these
might be produced by legitimate requests under certain conditions, and
that the actual text may vary from one implementation to another.
RD\_AP\_UNDEC
"unknown error krb 31" or
"Kerberos error: Can't decode authenticator"
\* decomp\_tkt() fails -- note: this hasn't been seen in any
logs we've looked at.
RD\_AP\_VERSION
"unknown error krb 39" or
"Kerberos protocol version mismatch"
\* example:
Oct 22 16:05:08 kadmind4[13767]: [ID 692406 local6.error] processing request: Unknown code krb 39
\* logged if rd\_req() gets wrong first byte -- this is quite
likely in an exploit attempt unless the attacker forces the
correct first byte
RD\_AP\_MSG\_TYPE
"unknown error krb 40" or
"Kerberos error: invalid msg type"
\* rd\_req() -- note: this hasn't been seen in any logs we've
looked at.
RD\_AP\_MODIFIED
"unknown error krb 41"
"Kerberos error: message stream modified"
\* example:
Oct 22 15:56:35 kadmind4[13725]: [ID 692406 local6.error] processing request: Unknown code krb 41
\* rd\_req()
\* len <= 0 -- unlikely; an attack that causes there to
be a negative value of authent.length will likely
cause mempcy() to fault, and is thus likely to fail
while logging a segmentation fault similar (at least
on a system where the process memory limit is
small).
\* realm too long -- rather likely in an exploit
attempt, but assumes that the attacker is attempting
to make something that looks like a krb4 ticket,
which isn't strictly necessary in order to exploit
this vulnerability.
\* many other places in this function can produce this
error.
\* rd\_priv()
Note that here, the likely cause is a user behind a
NAT making a legitimate request to kadmind4.

MIT krb5 Security Advisory 2002-002 [updated]
2002-10-25 [updated; revision history at end]
Original Release Date: 2002-10-22
Topic: Buffer overflow in kadmind4
Severity: CRITICAL - Remote user can gain root access to KDC host.
SUMMARY
=======
A stack buffer overflow in the implementation of the Kerberos v4
compatibility administration daemon (kadmind4) in the MIT krb5
distribution can be exploited to gain unauthorized root access to a
KDC host. The attacker does not need to authenticate to the daemon to
successfully perform this attack. At least one exploit is known to
exist in the wild, and at least one attacker is reasonably competent
at cleaning up traces of intrusion.
The kadmind4 supplied with MIT krb5 is intended for use in sites that
require compatibility with legacy administrative clients; sites that
do not have this requirement are not likely to be running this daemon.
IMPACT
======
A remote attacker can execute arbitrary code on the KDC with the
privileges of the user running kadmind4 (usually root). This can lead
to compromise of the Kerberos database.
AFFECTED SOFTWARE
=================
\* All releases of MIT Kerberos 5, up to and including krb5-1.2.6.
\* All Kerberos 4 implementations derived from MIT Kerberos 4,
including Cygnus Network Security (CNS). This includes KTH Kerberos
4 (eBones). See CERT advisory CA-2002-29.
\* KTH Heimdal has a similar vulnerability, if Kerberos 4 compatibility
is compiled. See CERT advisory CA-2002-29.
FIXES
=====
Apply the following patch to src/kadmin/v4server/kadm\_ser\_wrap.c:

===============
Thanks to Johan Danielsson and Love Hornquist-Astrand for alerting us
to this problem and providing us with an initial patch.
Thanks to Assar Westerlund for further assistance in developing the
patch.
DETAILS
=======
The function kadm\_ser\_in() is passed an allocated buffer (containing a
request read from the network) and its length. From this buffer, it
reads an 8-byte version string followed by a 4-byte length. This
length field is not checked; an attacker can construct a request that
will cause authent.length to become negative or to become greater than
sizeof(authent.dat). Both cases can cause the following call to
memcpy() to overflow authent.dat, which is a buffer on the stack.
