{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `faxgetty` program due to insufficient bounds checking when processing received fax data.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer overflow vulnerability in `faxd/CopyQuality.c++`",
        "Improper handling of scan line lengths exceeding a limit"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code on the host system by exploiting the buffer overflow. Since `faxgetty` is often run as root, this could lead to complete system compromise.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted fax with overly long scan lines during fax session negotiation. This requires an attacker to either have control over the sending fax machine or to exploit misconfigurations to inject malicious fax data.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to send faxes to a vulnerable system. They must have a basic understanding of Class 2 fax protocol and buffer overflow exploitation techniques. They also need to be able to cause incorrect fax session negotiation, either through hardware or software misconfiguration or by malicious manipulation of fax data."
