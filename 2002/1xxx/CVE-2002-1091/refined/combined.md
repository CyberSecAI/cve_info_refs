Graphics: ImageLib
▾

Core :: Graphics: ImageLib
ImageLib decodes GIF, JPEG and PNG images, and provides the decoded data to the Compositor for display. If Firefox or Seamonkey can display an image when loaded separately from the page, ImageLib is working, and the actual imaging bug exists elsewhere within Firefox or Seamonkey.

Examples of appropriate bugs: PNG gAMA chunk ignored; Crashes on GIF w/corrupted frame(merr-01.gif); or PNGs and JPEGs aren't displayed on FreeBSD.

Product: Netscape 6.x
Operating system: Unix: x86 Linux
OS version: redhat 7.0
Issue summary: a "0 width" GIF image: exploitable heap overwrite.
Issue details:
A specially formed gif image with width 0 can be
used to overwrite 'chunk' information and other
heap based information.
By overwriting a function pointer with an
address containing user supplied data, it is
possible to execute arbitary code.

Attached patch

[stop memory overwrite](attachment.cgi?id=91974&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=91974&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=157989&attachment=91974)

Firstly, gifcom is dead :) It's been moved to /modules/libpr0n/decoders/gif/
which still contains a lot of the old gifcom code.
I talked it over with tor, and stopping the 0 width before the memory
allocation seemed to be the best solution. And this is the patch.
The memory overwrite actually happens later on during do\_lzw, which first
writes one byte, incrememnts the pointer, then checks whether it hit the end of
the buffer. I looked into fixing the problem there, but it just caused
problems in other areas (namely in BeginGIF(), which will never initialize
mImageContainer if the width or height is 0.. which trickles down to assertion
errors)
I've also plugged the memory overwrite hole in do\_lzw. In theory, the width
check part of the patch should stop do\_lzw from ever being called when the
buffer is 0 in length, but it's better to check anyway.

This doesn't do anything malicious, however, it does crash Mozilla. I took a
14x14 GIF with one frame, and edited the image header and frame header so that
it says 0x0.

Zero width GIF file can cause exploitable heap corruption.
(Or: "Why not to use a graphical browser")

Vendor contacted:		17 Jul 2002
Internally patched:		19 Jul 2002 (according to changelog)
Received notification of patch: 29 Aug 2002 (via email)

<http://crash.ihug.co.nz/~Sneuro/zerogif/>

Contains an example exploit for malformed GIFs under Netscape 6.2.3
Also affects a number of other browsers, including Mozilla (of course) and
manages to kill Opera.

Example exploit (when it works properly) should create ~/.mashrc with
a sample replacement for ~/.bashrc.

Certain values in 'generic.c' and possibly other files will need changing
depending on library addresses.

Comments in pngshellcode.c are related to another exploit for Netscape
6.2.3... once I found one way to get data into known locations, I kept it.

Certain utilities (pnmtopng and ppmtogif) called by these programs are in
the netpbm-progs package.

$ make pngshellcode; ./pngshellcode
$ make enc; ./enc >mapfile.ppm ; make generic; ./generic

These commands will make the shellcode and the gif file.

This exploit is extremely "Proof of Concept" code. Sorry about the
system() calls.

This issue is patched in Netscape 7.0 and latest version of Mozilla.

There are a few other exploitable issues patched in Netscape 6.2.3
relating to other image formats.

I expect (hope for?) an advisory from Netscape at some point soon for this
and the other patched issues.
