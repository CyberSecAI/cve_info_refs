{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Adobe PhotoDeluxe installs Java code for its 'Connectables' feature and adds the directory containing this code to the CLASSPATH environment variable. This grants the Java code privileged access to the local system.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The installed Java code is given privileged access due to its location being included in the CLASSPATH environment variable.",
      "Java applets loaded from the local file system are not subject to the same security restrictions as those loaded over the network, granting them broader permissions including file access, library loading, process execution, and bypassing bytecode verification."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can exploit the privileged access granted to the PhotoDeluxe Java code to:\n\n*   Obtain directory listings on the local system through crafted web pages or HTML email messages viewed with Internet Explorer.\n*   Download and execute arbitrary code on the local system, particularly if Internet Explorer is launched via a 'Link' button within PhotoDeluxe.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Malicious web pages or HTML email messages viewed with Microsoft Internet Explorer can trigger the vulnerable Java code.",
      "If Internet Explorer is launched from within PhotoDeluxe, the PhotoDeluxe Java code can be leveraged to download and execute malicious Java archives."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious web page or HTML email that can interact with the privileged Java code. If the attack involves arbitrary code execution, the attacker would need to leverage the Java code to download a malicious Java archive and execute it. Control over DNS could allow subversion of the Connectables feature without user knowledge."
