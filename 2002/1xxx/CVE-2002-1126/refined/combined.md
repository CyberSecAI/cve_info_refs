Subject:    Privacy leak in mozilla
From:       [Sven Neuhaus <sn () neopoly ! com>](?a=97941592200003&r=1&w=2)
Date:       [2002-09-11 12:51:12](?l=bugtraq&r=1&w=2&b=200209)
[Download RAW [message](?l=bugtraq&m=103176760004720&q=mbox) or [body](?l=bugtraq&m=103176760004720&q=raw)]

There is a serious privacy leak in Mozilla that reveals the URL of the
page you are visiting to the web server of the page you visited last.
The leak not only occurs for links followed on the page (that wouldn't
be particularly serious) but also for URLs entered manually or picked
from the bookmarks.

The bug affects Mozilla 1.0, 1.0.1, 1.1 and probably older versions as
well. It also affects Mozilla-based browers such as Netscape 7 and
Galeon.

The problem is that HTTP requests that are launched from a page's
"onunload" handler have the wrong referer (sic): They get the referer of
the next page the user is about to visit.

Demonstration URL:
<http://members.ping.de/~sven/mozbug/refcook.html>

This is bug 145579 from the bugzilla database. It's a couple of months
old now so I'm disclosing this vulnerability to hopefully initiate the
fixing process.

Workaround: Disable Javascript.

Best,
-Sven Neuhaus

If a new url is entered into the address bar (and enter or go is pressed) the
browser starts to look up this address.
When a javascript script loads a new image by a setTimeout-triggered event on
the current page while the browser is looking up the new address, the image has
a document referer of <http://new> page/ instead of <http://current> page/
Reproducable: always, easier on slow connections or when the server on the other
end is down.
Platform/OS/build: tested on PC/win98/1.0rc2
Refers to: [bug 61660](/show_bug.cgi?id=61660 "RESOLVED INCOMPLETE - [meta] HTTP_REFERER Bugs (referrer)")
---
code example:
<html>
<head>
<script type="text/javascript">
function load\_image
{
document.images["bla"].src="bla2.jpg";
}
</script>
</head>
<body onload="setTimeout('load\_image()',10000)">
<img name="bla" src="bla.jpg">
</body>
</html>
For bla2.jpg I used a php-generated image that shows the document referer as the
image.
---
How to reproduce using the above code and by replacing bla2 with an image that
shows the document referer:
- load the html page
- within the 10 second timeout enter a new url (preferably an unreachable server
that would cause a timeout) in your address bar and press enter
- while Mozilla tries to load the new url the javascript is triggered
- the javascript loads bla2.jpg using 'new url' as a document referer.
- Mozilla gives an error: 'new url' not reachable (or if you used a server that
does work it continues loading 'new url'

This is a SERIOUS PRIVACY ISSUE.
It is also (reliably!) triggered on pages that load images using the
window.onunload handler. This bug lets a webmaster find out what page you
visited next (including pages who's URLs were entered manually).
I.e.: Add a window.onunload handler to the page. Your handler loads an image.
The referer for the image in your access\_log will be the NEW page that gets
loaded over the current one!!
example for handler that loads an image on unload:
======================================8<==========================
<script>
function good\_bye() {
var x = new Image();
x.src="pixel.gif";
}
window.onunload = good\_bye;
</script>
======================================8<==========================
When you visit this page, then go to another URL your HTTP server log will show
the request for "pixel.gif" with the referer of the other URL you visited after
this page.
I noticed this bug when I looked in my http server logfile. The user visiting
was using mozilla 1.0
I reproduced the bug with galeon 1.2.3 (mozilla 1.0rc3) on Linux - I don't have
mozilla 1.0 installed yet because of galeon issues.
FWIW, MS IE 6.0 doesn't seem to have this bug.
Please get this bug fixed before 1.0.1 ships.

I found a good workaround in a comment at Mozillazine:
Add the line
user\_pref("capability.policy.default.Window.onunload", "noAccess");
to your user.js file.
For information about the user.js file, read the documentation at
<http://www.mozilla.org/start/1.0/faq/general.html#1.5>
Other workaround: use a proxy that filters the http referer header.Alias: future\_refererTarget Milestone: mozilla1.0.1 → mozilla1.0.2

It seems the problem is that imgLoader::LoadImage uses the load group as the
source for the Referer, but nsDocShell recycles the same load group for all the
documents loaded in a given docshell.
(Is the document URL really the correct thing to send as the referrer if the
image is loaded from script that lives in a separate file? Shouldn't we send
the URL of the script? The HTTP spec (RFC 2616) says the referer should be "the
address (URI) of the resource from which the Request-URI was obtained". We
probably have the same bug with stylesheets (and probably others, for imported
stylesheets).)

> Is the document URL really the correct thing to send as the referrer if the
> image is loaded from script that lives in a separate file?
I think the document URL is the correct referrer for images loaded by scripts.
It's often possible for a page to trick an external script into doing something
it wasn't intended to do, so the page should take responsibility for whatever
the script does. Someone looking at the page can figure out why it loaded a
given image, while someone looking at just the script can't. If script urls
were sent as referrers, site A could mask its referrer to site B by loading a
script from site C and messing with the script (getters/setters, etc).

user\_pref("network.http.sendRefererHeader", 0);
seems to be a valid workaround.

As a commercial web site owner, I urge you to stress that the workaround listed
in [comment #14](/show_bug.cgi?id=145579#c14 "VERIFIED FIXED - Website can see url of page visited after it (document referer used when loading images with javascript is incorrect while loading a new page)") is the preferred workaround.
Where visitors go after they leave us is none of our business. Knowing who
referred them to us helps us focus our advertising budget on people who are
actually interested in our products, and bug the other folks less. :)
Thanks!

As a follow-up to [comment #19](/show_bug.cgi?id=145579#c19 "VERIFIED FIXED - Website can see url of page visited after it (document referer used when loading images with javascript is incorrect while loading a new page)"), is it possible to put the line in user.js as
defined in [Comment #14](/show_bug.cgi?id=145579#c14 "VERIFIED FIXED - Website can see url of page visited after it (document referer used when loading images with javascript is incorrect while loading a new page)") as a temporary measure until a proper fix is implemented?
By temp measure, I mean, put the patch in for tomorrows nightlies, and then fix
it properly for 1.2b. I say this because it is a privacy issue, and even a temp
fix would hold off any negative press.

I'm very surprised that this bug has been open for this long to be thwarted. Our
last publicly announced bug < [bug 141061](/show_bug.cgi?id=141061 "VERIFIED FIXED - XMLHttpRequest allows reading of local files") and
<http://www.mozillazine.org/talkback.html?article=2201> > only took 2 days to
patch. What gives here?

The workaround from commant 14 does not work (checked with the testcase) as the
pref is not registered (checked with the about:config). Probably adding it to
all.js would work.
However, the workaround from [comment 19](/show_bug.cgi?id=145579#c19 "VERIFIED FIXED - Website can see url of page visited after it (document referer used when loading images with javascript is incorrect while loading a new page)") does work when applied to user.js
(testcase proven).

patch to explicitly provide a referring URI when loading images...

this looks great. everything else that sets a referrer (e.g., CSS, JS,
xmlHttpRequest) seem to likewise get the referrer from the document, but this
should of course be double checked ;)

I did some more testing as requested in Darin's commment 26 with a nightly build
("Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.2b) Gecko/20020922").
Results:
\* CSS loaded by setting the href property of a HTMLLinkElement yields the
correct referer. Yay!
\* A XMLHTTPRequest gets no referer at all (this is a bug, isn't it?)
\* Setting the src property of a HTMLScriptElement does not trigger a HTTP
Request - what's the correct way to do this?

Sven, you need to create the whole script tag dynamically and attach it to the
document (this was changed some time back to avoid multiple loads).

OK. Did that and it triggers a request.
It seems the referer for the <script> was already ok in 1.1 (without the fix).
Code used for testing:
...
<HEAD ID="dh1">
...
<SCRIPT>
function good\_bye () {
var sc = document.createElement("script");
sc.src="refcook.cgi";
document.getElementById("dh1").appendChild(sc);
}
window.onunload = good\_bye;
</SCRIPT>
...
Is it worth it testing frames loading also perhaps?
