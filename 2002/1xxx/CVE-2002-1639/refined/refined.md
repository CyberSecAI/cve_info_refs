{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Oracle Configurator servlet component 'oracle.apps.cz.servlet.UiServlet' discloses sensitive information due to improper handling of the 'test' CGI variable.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Information disclosure vulnerability. The servlet returns sensitive build and schema information when 'test' is set to 'version' and host information when 'test' is set to 'host'.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers can learn sensitive information about an Oracle installation, including version, schema, hostname, and port of the web server, which could assist in further attacks.",
  "Attack vectors": "Crafted HTTP requests to the Oracle Configurator servlet with the 'test' CGI variable set to either 'version' or 'host'.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker only needs to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable servlet. No prior authentication is required."
