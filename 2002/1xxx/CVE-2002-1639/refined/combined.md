#### Vulnerability Note VU#158323

### Overview

A servlet component of Oracle Configurator may post sensitive version and host information to any Web user that makes a crafted request to the server.

### Description

| Oracle Configurator is an Internet application used to configure Oracle Application and Database Servers.  If a user sends a request to the Oracle Configurator servlet component named "oracle.apps.cz.servlet.UiServlet" with CGI variable "test" set to "version", the servlet returns sensitive build and schema information. If a user sends a request with CGI variable "test" set to "host", the servlet returns the hostname and the port on which the Oracle Apache web server is running. |
