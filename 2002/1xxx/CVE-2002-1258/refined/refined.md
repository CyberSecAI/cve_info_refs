- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Two vulnerabilities allow an attacker to spoof the location specified in the CODEBASE parameter of an APPLET tag.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The Microsoft VM does not properly validate the CODEBASE parameter, allowing an attacker to misrepresent the location of a Java applet. This allows the applet to be loaded from one location while being treated as if it originated from another.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can read files from the user's system and network shares that the user has access to.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Web-based: The attacker hosts a malicious Java applet on a webpage.
    - Email-based: The attacker sends an HTML email containing the malicious applet.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to create a malicious Java applet and either host it on a web server or embed it within an HTML email. The user needs to either visit the attacker's website or open the attacker's email.
