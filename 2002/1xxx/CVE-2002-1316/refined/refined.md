Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the combination of two weaknesses in iPlanet WebServer 4.* up to SP11: insecure `open()` calls in Admin Server Perl scripts and a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
1.  **Insecure `open()` calls:** Perl scripts within the iPlanet Admin Server use `open()` in a way that allows command injection.
2.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The iPlanet Admin Server is vulnerable to XSS when an administrator views error logs. This allows for the injection of malicious JavaScript.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server, typically with root privileges.
*   The attacker can completely compromise the web server.
*   The provided example demonstrates the attacker gaining an xterm.

**Attack Vectors:**
1.  **XSS Injection:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the iPlanet WebServer's error logs.
2.  **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick an administrator into viewing the manipulated error logs via the iPlanet Admin Server. The XSS payload is triggered once the administrator views this log.
3.  **Command Injection:**  The XSS payload redirects the administrator's browser to a specific URL that exploits the insecure `open()` call within a perl script (specifically `/https-admserv/bin/perl/importInfo`) and executes arbitrary commands by injecting them into the URL parameter. Since the administrator is already authenticated the authentication is bypassed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs the ability to inject data into the web server's error logs that will be reviewed by an administrator.
*   The attacker needs to use social engineering to make the administrator review the manipulated logs within the Admin Server.
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the iPlanet Web Server to trigger the vulnerability. The XSS vulnerability is used to bypass the authentication of the vulnerable perl script.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is identified as NGSEC-2002-4.
*   The issue affects iPlanet WebServer 4.* up to SP11 on both Unix and Windows platforms.
*   iPlanet WebServer 6.* is not affected as the XSS vulnerability was fixed.
*   NGSecureWeb(r) protected iPlanet Web Servers are not vulnerable.
