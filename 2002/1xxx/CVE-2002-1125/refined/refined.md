- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The FreeBSD ports `asmon`, `ascpu`, `bubblemon`, `wmmon`, and `wmnet2` are installed with setgid kmem permissions. They drop kmem privileges before executing user-specified commands, but the file descriptors to `/dev/mem` and `/dev/kmem` remain open.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The programs leave open file descriptors to `/dev/mem` and `/dev/kmem` after dropping kmem privileges. This allows an attacker to access kernel memory directly.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can leverage the open file descriptors to potentially gain root privileges on the target host. One mentioned exploit includes replacing `getch()` in `strings(1)` to read directly from the open `/dev/mem` descriptor, enabling access to sensitive information like the master password file in kernel memory.
- **Attack vectors:** Local exploitation. An attacker can execute one of the vulnerable programs and supply specially crafted commands/arguments to maintain access to the file descriptors for `/dev/mem` and `/dev/kmem`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have local access to execute the vulnerable programs and have the ability to provide the crafted command.
