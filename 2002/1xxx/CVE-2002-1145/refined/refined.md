Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2002-1145:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a combination of factors:
    - Improper permissions on the `xp_runwebtask` stored procedure, allowing it to be executed by `PUBLIC` (all users) instead of only privileged users.
    - Weak permissions on the `msdb.dbo.mswebtasks` table, allowing `PUBLIC` to `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, and `SELECT` web task data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Permissions:** The `xp_runwebtask` stored procedure should not be executable by all users, and `msdb.dbo.mswebtasks` table should not allow insert, update, and delete to all users.
- **Privilege Escalation:** These weak permissions create a path for privilege escalation, allowing a low-privileged user to potentially execute actions with higher privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker who authenticates to the SQL server can:
    - Run existing web tasks in the context of the web task creator, which usually has higher privileges like the SQL Server Agent service account.
    - Modify, delete, or insert web tasks created by other users, gaining the ability to potentially execute arbitrary SQL code with higher privileges.
    - Escalation of privileges to the level of the SQL Server service account.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **SQL Injection:** An authenticated attacker connects to the SQL server and directly executes the vulnerable stored procedure, `xp_runwebtask`.
- The attacker can also manipulate web tasks and run the modified task with higher privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have a valid SQL server login account and be able to authenticate to the SQL server.
- They do not need to be an administrator or have any special privileges in SQL server to exploit this vulnerability.
- Web tasks must already exist on the SQL server.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects Microsoft SQL Server 7.0 and 2000, including MSDE versions.
- Microsoft released a patch to address this vulnerability. It was initially released on October 16, 2002 and re-released on January 26, 2003.
- The re-released patch for SQL Server 2000 included a fix for a separate issue that could interfere with SQL Server operation.
- The patch changes the permission on the stored procedure and on the table that store the web task.
