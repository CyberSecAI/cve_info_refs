VNC authentication weakness
---------------------------

VNC uses a DES-encrypted challenge-response system to avoid passing passwords
over the wire in plaintext.

However, it seems that a weakness in the way the challenge is generated by
some servers would make this useless.

The following program attempts to repeatedly connect to a vnc server and
prints the challenge string.

Against tightvnc-1.2.1_unixsrc, you'll see output like
$ python pvc.py somehost:1
4b24fbab355452b55729d630fcf73d43
b3acdf3fab422b7aa49b8d786f93def3
b3acdf3fab422b7aa49b8d786f93def3
b3acdf3fab422b7aa49b8d786f93def3
b3acdf3fab422b7aa49b8d786f93def3
88e37f1677c4e4f56eb2fa00a2804ded
88e37f1677c4e4f56eb2fa00a2804ded
88e37f1677c4e4f56eb2fa00a2804ded
88e37f1677c4e4f56eb2fa00a2804ded
[...]
each time the same string is printed twice in a row the server has
repeated a challenge.

WinVNC version 3.3.3R9 will display output more like
$ python pvc.py otherhost:0
Server declined connection
Server declined connection
91ff701f7dce8c6eebbc6062ffebcc6a
Server declined connection
Server declined connection
[...]
It appears that connects are rate-limited, even if the connects come
from two distinct machines.  This appears to foil the below attack on
VNC authentication.  (Whether this means there is a good DoS opportunity
against WinVNC is a separate question)

If your server will give the same challenge repeatedly, and you can
sniff somebody else's challenge and response, it appears that you could
authenticate without knowing the password simply by connecting within
the 1-second window to get the same challenge, and then send the same
response as the legitimate client.

Another weakness in the challenge is that it uses 'random()%256'.  Many
implementations of random() have highly predictable low bits.  It's not
clear that this leads to as easy a compromise as the repeated challenge
problem, but it's something that warrants consideration..

On systems with /dev/urandom, the following function will give challenge
strings which should be immune to the problems discussed:

void
vncRandomBytes(unsigned char *bytes)
{
    int f;

    f = open("/dev/urandom", O_RDONLY);
    while(read(f, bytes, 16) != 16) ;
    close(f);
}

#------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   pvc.py -- check for weak vnc challenges
#------------------------------------------------------------------------
import socket, sys, time

def print_vnc_challenge(host, port):
    s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    s.connect((host, port))
    f = s.makefile("r+")
    banner = f.readline()
    f.write("RFB 003.003\n")
    response = f.read(20)
    if response[:4] != "\0\0\0\2":
	print "Server declined connection"
	return
    challenge = response[4:]
    print "".join(map(lambda x: "%02x" % ord(x), challenge))

if len(sys.argv) > 1:
    host_port = sys.argv[[1]](#1)
    if ":" in host_port:
	host, port = host_port.split(":")
	port = int(port) + 5900
    else:
	host, port = host_port, 5900
else:
    host, port = "", 5900

for x in range(20):
    print_vnc_challenge(host, port)

=== Content from www.tightvnc.com_87d4d14b_20250125_224532.html ===
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| This is a brief summary of changes introduced in each TightVNC release. |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
\* TightVNC 2.8.85
- Server for Windows: Fixed connection issues in Windows XP that were introduced by the previous
version.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
\* TightVNC 2.8.84
- Server for Windows: Disabled the ability to connect to the control pipe via a network
connection (bug #1629).
- Server for Windows: Disabled the transmission of passwords through the pipe from the server to
the control application.
- Server for Windows: The server now only accepts control connections from processes launched
from the same path as the server itself (Windows Vista and later).
----------------------------------------------------------------------
\* TightVNC 2.8.81
- Server for Windows: Support for the third-party ExtendedDesktopSize pseudo-encoding has been
removed due to incompatibility issues, complexity, and error-proneness. It has been replaced
with a similar TightVNC-specific protocol extension, the new DesktopConfiguration
pseudo-encoding, which allows users to choose a specific monitor in the viewer when a remote
host has multiple monitors connected. Multi-monitor handling will be implemented in next
versions of MightyViewer and Remote Ripple.
- Server for Windows: Fixed an issue with disabled file transfers in RDP connections.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
\* TightVNC 2.8.79
- Server for Windows: Fixed an issue with file transfers that prevented them from working
correctly on Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows 7 when using TightVNC versions from 2.8.75 to
2.8.78.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
\* TightVNC 2.8.78
- Server for Windows: Added handling of the SetDesktopSize command, as lack of its support caused
TigerVNC viewer to crash.

caused flickering when working with TigerVNC server.
- Server for Windows: Fixed slow performance of the Direct3D screen grabber.
- Server and Viewer for Windows: Updated the zlib library to the latest version 1.2.13.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
\* TightVNC 2.8.75
- Server and Viewer for Windows: Updated zlib and libjpeg libraries to their latest versions.
Note that older versions of zlib may have security flaws, so this may be an important reason
to upgrade TightVNC.
- Server for Windows: Added server-side support for special protocol extension allowing to
display individual monitors in multi-monitor systems. Multi-monitor handling will be
implemented in next versions of MightyViewer and Remote Ripple.
- Server for Windows: Fixed a bug causing the server to crash repeatedly (bug #1597).

desktops simultaneously.
- Server for Windows Installer: The installer now will not insist on setting an Administrative
Password.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
\* TightVNC 2.8.63
- Server for Windows: Improved techniques of fast screen grabbing enabled in Windows 8 and later
versions of Windows.
- Server for Windows: Improved stability of sharing RDP sessions.
- Server for Windows: Fixed encoding of color cursors, which worked incorrectly for certain
cursor formats and shapes.
- Server for Windows: Fixed erroneous generation of extra character in Greek keyboard layout.
- Viewer for Windows: Fixed a security problem which could allow a specially crafted "evil"
server execute code on the viewer machine. Technically, the security issue was caused by a
buffer overrun in ZRLE decoder.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
\* TightVNC 2.8.59
- Server for Windows: Fixed remote desktop updating problems with -sharedisplay and -sharerect
options. If the shared area was changed but its size remained the same, update did not happen.
- Server and Viewer for Windows: Details in EXE and DLL file properties have been updated. This
does not affect functionality in any way (bug #1539).
----------------------------------------------------------------------
\* TightVNC 2.8.57 (limited distribution release)
- Server for Windows: Fixed a bug arising on certain video hardware configurations that might
cause the server to crash on accepting new connections (bug #1535).
- Server for Windows: Fixed a problem with restoring custom wallpaper after all viewers
disconnect, when using the option "Hide desktop wallpaper" (bugs #1505, #1100).
- Server for Windows: Made minor user interface improvements (almost not noticeable to a normal
user).
- Installer for Windows: Fixed a problem with a configuration form shown during installation
which could not be closed properly via the Task Manager.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
\* TightVNC 2.8.55
- Server and Viewer for Windows: Reverted recent changes in processing keyboard events that
caused keyboard-related problems in version 2.8.53 (bugs #1530, #1531, #1532, #1533).
- Server and Viewer for Windows: Fixed a build problem that caused compatibility problems with
certain versions of VNC software, due to using wrong protocol extension (bug #1534).
- Server and Viewer for Windows: Improved text labels and layout of elements in a number of
screen forms.
- Server for Windows: Connecting to RDP sessions is now disabled by default and should be enabled
explicitly, as sharing some virtual session instead of the main screen is probably not
something a user would expect by default.
- Server for Windows: Fixed a minor resource leak (although it did not seem to cause any problems
during normal operation).
----------------------------------------------------------------------
\* TightVNC 2.8.53
- Server and Viewer for Windows: Added support for Unicode clipboard transfers (UTF-8). The
latest public version of the standard RFB protocol (3.8) does not support Unicode text, so we
implemented this via a new TightVNC protocol extension. This feature will work when supported
at both ends of the connection.
- Server for Windows: Added support for Echo messages to let viewer software check responsiveness
of a server. This may be used for detecting network failures faster when there is no other
traffic between Server and Viewer, and will work only with viewers that support and use this
new protocol extension. Echo messages will be supported in our latest SDKs but normal TightVNC
Viewer does not use them yet.
- Server for Windows: Protection against brute-force attacks has been improved. Previously, the
server allowed no more than 10 authentication failures per 30 seconds from the same IP address.
Now the algorithm is more complicated: 1-second timeouts after 2 attempts, 1-minute timeouts
after 8 attempts, and 1-hour timeouts after 14 attempts. In other words, it would allow no more
than 38 authentication attempts within 24 hours per one IP address.
- Server for Windows: Now it's possible to connect to an active RDP session.
- Server for Windows: Performance has been improved in modern Windows systems (starting with
Windows 8). Dragging windows over the desktop should render many times faster, due to the added
support of CopyRect encoding with Direct3D and Desktop Duplication APIs.
- Server for Windows: Performance of file transfers has been improved. In particular, listing
contents of large folders should become much faster.
- Server for Windows: Fixed a crash in server running in application mode that could happen when
Windows shows UAC (User Account Control) pop-up prompts. This problem is specific to reverse
server-to-client connections (bug #1507).
- Server for Windows: Fixed clipboard transfers. In certain cases, the server did not send
clipboard contents to viewers since it wrongly decided there were no clipboard updates for
those particular viewers (bug #1403).
- Server for Windows: Fixed crash for large displays, with total resolution over 134 millions of
pixels, e.g. 16384 х 8192 and more.
- Server for Windows: Potentially fixed incorrect handling of mouse cursors on certain Matrox
video cards.
- Server for Windows: Fixed a memory leak (rather a potential one which would not show up during
normal operation).
- Installer for Windows: New "ServiceOnly" configuration option has been added, to prevent
TightVNC Server from starting in application mode.
- Viewer for Windows: Fixed AltGr handling for Korean keyboard layout.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

certain national keyboard layouts, e.g. when pressing "3" in Turkish layout
and "6" in Portugese Brazilian ABNT2 layout (bugs #1482, #1458).
- Server for Windows: Fixed problem with sending black screen when a viewer
requests 16-bit or 8-bit colors with big-endian byte order (bug #1473).
- Server for Windows: Fixed an issue with mouse cursor jumping to the top
left corner of the screen on requesting full screen update.
- Viewer for Windows: Added support of Romanian diacritical marks.
- Viewer for Windows: Fixed a problem of adding extra null character when
transferring text data from clipboard (bug #1485).

notably increase update speed and optimize CPU usage.
- Viewer for Windows: Fixed a problem that might cause the viewer to
continue sending keyboard events even after minimizing a full-screen
window (bug #1433).
- Viewer for Windows: Fixed an incorrect calculation in keyboard handling,
which unlikely caused any problems though (bug #1422).
- Source Code for Windows (Server and Viewer): Migrated to Visual Studio
2015 and MSBuild tool set as the primary build environment.

- Server for Windows: Fixed server crash on some Windows 7 systems. Finally,
the bug introduced in version 2.8.2 is fixed for all Windows 7 computers.
- Server for Windows: Fixed a bug that could make the server crash after a
client has disconnected.
- Source Code for Windows (Server and Viewer): Changed output directory
structure in internal build scripts (the changes do not affect distribution
packages).
----------------------------------------------------------------------
\* TightVNC 2.8.3 (limited release)
- Server for Windows: Fixed server crash on Windows 7 introduced in version
2.8.2.
- Java Viewer: Fixed a problem when the viewer did not start in applet mode
(bug #1390).
----------------------------------------------------------------------
\* TightVNC 2.8.2
- Server for Windows: Added support for "IdleTimeout" registry key which
specifies how many seconds to wait for mouse or keyboard events. If there
was no activity from a client during the specified timeout, the
corresponding client will be disconnected. The value 0 (DWORD) stands for
no timeout at all (stay connected forever), and that's the default setting.
This setting is not configurable from the user interface.

#1303, #1302).
- Server for Windows: Fixed built-in HTTP server crash on Windows XP and
Windows 7 when the request URL includes parameters (bug #1344).
- Server for Windows: Fixed a rare problem triggered when a server shares one
display in multi-monitor configuration, with more than one viewer
connected. If a user on the server changed the focus to other display, the
viewers could see the active windows from the other display on top of the
shared display and everything became messy.
- Server for Windows: Fixed server-side clipboard handling. After receiving
clipboard contents from a client, the server could return the same
clipboard data back to the same client, and clipboard could be damaged on
the viewer side (bug #1255).
- Server and Viewer for Windows: Fixed a bug with truncating data from
clipboard, due to an error in calculating text length in Unicode/ANSI
conversions (bug #1337).
- Viewer for Windows: Fixed possible memory access violation caused by
incorrect calculation of buffer size in the StringStorage object
(bug #1356).
- Viewer for Windows: Fixed a bug with deleting random characters from the
host:port string. The bug was caused by incorrect calculation of the number
of Unicode characters (bug #1349).
- Viewer for Windows: Fixed problems with Shift, Alt and Ctrl keys getting
locked in the pressed state on switching from the viewer window to other
applications (bugs #1360, #1329, #1174).
- Viewer for Windows: Fixed a problem which prevented from connecting to a
Dispatcher using big ID numbers (ID >= 2147483648).
- Viewer for Windows: A typo has been fixed in the warning window shown on
entering the full-screen mode (bug #1270).
- Server and Viewer for Windows: Removed libjpeg-turbo library in favor of
the standard libjpeg. The accelerated library did not show major
performance improvements in typical situations but introduced questionable
requirements on the hardware and the compiler. The codebase goes
cross-platform, so we chose to get rid of such dependencies.
- Java Viewer: Added new -showConnectionDialog command-line option. Set to
"No" if you do not want to show initial connection dialog. Default: "Yes".
- Java Viewer: Fixed an issue that resulted in error message "Value too long"
(bug #1379).

resolves bugs #1366, #1339, #1335 as well).
- Server for Windows: Fixed a bug with running on Windows Server 2003, where
TightVNC Server could stop accepting connections until the system is
rebooted.
- Server for Windows: Added an option to specify a list of rectangles to be
treated as video and sent to viewers with minimal delays. Rectangles are
specified by their screen coordinates in the Video tab in the TightVNC
Server's Configuration window. Normally, this option is not very useful,
it's rather for using TightVNC in specialized environments.
- Server for Windows: When sharing just one application (-shareapp
command-line option), do not pass remote keyboard input to other apps.
- Server for Windows: Documented the -shareapp command-line option in the
tvnserver /? output.
- Server and Viewer for Windows: Implemented support for Dispatcher (it acts
as a proxy between servers and viewers and allows connecting to servers not
directly accessible from the Internet). Dispatcher is available separately,
under commercial licenses only.
- Java Viewer: Switched to a different library for supporting SSH tunneling
(now using Trilead SSH-2 instead of JSch).
- Java Viewer API: Introducing several APIs and corresponding JAR libraries
for using parts of the viewer as an SDK (software development kit).
- Java Viewer API: Generating Javadoc documentation for the SDK APIs.
- Java Viewer API: Added an simple example on using the SDK APIs.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

settings (by default, they are accessible once the server is running). It
is required to enter an administrative password to make any changes when
"Ask password for each operation" is checked in the Administration tab.
- Server for Windows: Added ZRLE and RRE encoding support.
- Server for Windows: Fixed issues when Extra Ports are used: now clients can
safely establish connection to a server.
- Server for Windows: When a client has disconnected, pressed key states are
reset on the server side.

- Server for Windows: Fixed a bug with desktop size after the screen DPI is
changed.
- Server for Windows: Invalid JPG data now leads to error throwing rather
than crashing.
- Server for Windows: Fixed a bug with queued and non-sent updates on desktop
changes.
- Server for Windows: Fixed a missing system libraries error on Windows 2003
(sometimes wtsapi32.dll or psapi.dll could not be found).
- Viewer for Windows: Now it is possible to change the port the Viewer
listens on (in the Listening mode) and reconnect to the server right on the
fly.

- Java Viewer: Introducing new full-screen mode, with optional auto-scaling,
auto-scrolling and a pop-up toolbar.
- Installer for Windows: Added new MSI installer properties, to automate
pre-setting passwords in silent mode.
- Server for Windows: Fixed a problem with querying local users on incoming
connections. TightVNC has a feature to let local user approve or reject
incoming connections. If there was no user action within a pre-configured
time limit, new connection will be either accepted or rejected
automatically. Unfortunately, the timeout setting did not work correctly in
previous version and that could result in infinite timeouts. That has been
fixed.
- Server for Windows: Fixed the Apply button in the Configuration window - it
stayed disabled on editing configuration settings.
- Viewer for Windows: Fixed authentication handling in RFB protocol version
3.7. This should resolve connectivity problems with Ubuntu systems and Vino
servers.
- Viewer for Windows: Fixed hang-up on changing language or keyboard layout.
To fix this problem, Windows message handling has been re-designed completely.
- Viewer for Windows: Fixed priority of preferred encodings. Previous version
could work inefficiently with servers that do not support Tight encoding,
because the Viewer could choose uncompressed Raw encoding instead of
well-compressed ZRLE.
- Viewer for Windows: Eliminated 34-character limit on hostnames in the New
Connection window.
- Viewer for Windows: Using correct line ending characters in cross-platform
clipboard transfers.
- Viewer for Windows: Introduced a number of improvements and fixes in the
user interface. That includes new commands in the toolbar and in the system
menu, and architectural changes such as restoring the option to start new
connections from the same Viewer instance.
- Viewer for Windows: Adjusting viewer window size on remote desktop resizing.
- Viewer for Windows: Other minor improvements and fixes.
- Source Code (Server and Viewer for Windows): Improved logging architecture.
The changes will not be visible to end user, but developers will appreciate
new logging system. There should be no more static methods and global log
objects, so it will be easier to reuse separate components in third-party
applications. Now all components work via a simple logging interface or can
work without logging at all.
- Source Code (Server and Viewer for Windows): Corrected build problems in
various combinations of build configurations and platforms, in both Visual
Studio 2008 and Visual Studio 2010.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

to random crashes.
- Viewer for Windows: "Entering full screen" warning now includes an option
for not showing it next time.
- Viewer for Windows: Fixed a problem with -optionsfile command-line option
not working correctly unless full path was provided with the options file.
Also, error reporting have been improved when using -optionsfile.
- Viewer for Windows: Initial image of the remote desktop did not always
render correctly in full screen. Now that should be fixed.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
\* TightVNC 2.5.0
- Installer for Windows: Parameter-based silent installation. You can
pre-configure TightVNC Server via MSI parameters and perform mass
installation via a batch file or Group Policy.
- Installer for Windows: Both 32-bit (x86) and 64-bit (x64) versions of the
installer are available.
- Server for Windows: Full support for 64-bit systems. Besides obvious
benefits of using native architecture, this allows to attach so called
"message hooks" to 64-bit applications. In a simple language, message hooks
help at detecting screen activity, so that we can get updates almost
immediately instead of polling the complete screen once per second or so.
- Server for Windows: Support for mirror video driver (DFMirage). This makes
screen reading ultra-fast in all supported versions of Windows, from Windows
2000 to Windows 7. DFMirage driver is a separate product, but it's free for
TightVNC users (and it's available commercially if needed).
- Server for Windows: Improved performance when sharing a desktop with Windows
Aero enabled. With Aero, each screen reading operation is expensive, and we
can improve performance by reading more pixels in less operations.
- Server for Windows: Improved logging. Most importantly, new version reports
all incoming connections to Windows Event Log. Also, logging to text files
has been improved - the service writes to the same log file from all its
child processes. There's always just one log file, so it's easier to locate
an error message or e-mail the log to technical support service.
- Server for Windows: New option to configure extra ports mapped to arbitrary
screen areas. If a client connects to such an extra port, it will be shown
the corresponding part of the screen only.
- Server for Windows: New command-line options to share full desktop, primary
monitor, selected monitor, a window, or an arbitrary rectangular area.
- Server for Windows: Optimized video processing for specific window classes.
You can tell TightVNC to treat certain windows as video by providing a list
of window class names. Once a matching window is detected, its contents will
be sent to clients continuously, with minimum delays.
- Viewer for Windows: Completely rewritten version, free of GPL-only source
code.
- Viewer for Windows: Native 64-bit version for improved performance in x64
systems.
- Viewer for Windows: Fast screen drawing and optimized decoders.
- Viewer for Windows: New ZRLE decoder for improved compatibility with wide
range of VNC-compatible servers.
- Viewer for Windows: Desktop scaling that can be easily controlled via the
toolbar.
- Viewer for Windows: New feature to pause screen updates. You can freeze the
remote desktop at any moment, e.g. to make a screenshot, examine details or
demonstrate the screen to other people.
- Viewer for Windows: Unicode-enabled compilation. Unlike previous versions of
TightVNC Viewer, this one fully supports Unicode and has no problems with
using multiple national languages in user input, screen labels, file names
etc.
- Viewer for Windows: Easily reusable source code. The viewer has been
redesigned from the scratch. The primary design goal was to develop a
"remote control SDK" and build the viewer on top of it. And we've done just
that. So not only we provide new version of the viewer, but we also give
software developers an easy way to add remote control functionality to their
products (both free and commercial). The resulting SDK has a simple
interface which hides all the complexity of the underlying protocols. It's
written in C++, has minimum dependencies on Windows systems and will be made
truly cross-platform in its future versions.
- Java Viewer: Desktop scaling that can be easily controlled via the toolbar.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
\* TightVNC 2.1 (Java Viewer only)
- Java Viewer: Added support for various color modes. You can restrict the
number of colors to save traffic, or prefer a rich-color format to maximize
image quality. From the GUI, you can choose a color mode with 8, 64, 256,
65536, 16777216 colors, or select the server's native number of colors.
However, the core component supports any color format as allowed by the RFB
protocol (except palette-based modes).
- Java Viewer: Corrected negotiation of the protocol version. There was an
error which made TightVNC Java Viewer incompatible with Apple Screen Sharing
(built-in VNC-compatible server in Mac OS X). New version should be able to
connect to Mac OS X.
- Java Viewer: Various minor fixes and improvements.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
\* TightVNC 2.0.4
- Server for Windows: Fixed a potential security problem which
could allow a logged in user to gain elevated privilegies in
file transfers. This problem affected Windows 2000 systems only.
- Server for Windows: CPU use was significantly reduced in idle
periods when there are no users connected.
- Server for Windows: Fixed a problem which resulted in wrong
color rendering in "big-endian" viewers (e.g. PowerPC-based
Mac viewers).
- Server for Windows: Fixed rendering of semi-transparent mouse
cursors. Previously, big black boxes could be seen instead of
such cursors.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
\* TightVNC 2.0.3
- Server for Windows: Fixed a bug which prevented file transfers
from working properly under Windows 2000.
- Server for Windows: Introducing new "error handler" which allows
saving memory dumps on critical errors.
- Server for Windows: In systems with swapped left and right mouse
buttons, remote mouse events will be adjusted accordingly. As a
result, the remote mouse should work just like the local one.
- Server for Windows: Fixed a number of problems led to errors on
setting service passwords from the installer.
- Server for Windows: Not allowing to enter administrative passwords
longer than eight characters. This limitation is caused by using
standard DES-based VNC-compatible authentication. Previous
versions used only the first eight characters anyway but it was
possible to enter longer passwords and that could confuse users
who did not know about the limitation.
- Server for Windows: Fixed a problem with injecting lowercase
characters when CapsLock was on on the server. Previous version
generated uppercase characters when CapsLock was on, regardless of
the Shift state.
- Server for Windows: Implemented a special trick to bypass the
problem with generating "^6" instead of "6" when using US
International keyboard layout. It looks like there is a bug in
Windows so we could do nothing better than to cook a workaround
specifically for this case.
- Server for Windows: Fixed clipboard handling with multiple client
connections. Previously, clipboard contents might not be sent to
particular clients in certain circumstances.
- Server for Windows: Adjusted log verbosity levels for log messages
generated by the control interface connection, so that such
messages will not overload the log any more.
- Server for Windows: Improved support for simple RFB clients that
cannot handle desktop size changes.
- Server for Windows: Made minor adjustments in the user interface.
Specifically, the "About..." form has been cleaned up, and a typo
has been corrected in the Configuration window.
- Viewer for Windows: Fixed a number of problems with keyboard
handling: preventing modifier keys from being stuck on switching
to/from the viewer window; distinguishing left and right modifiers
properly; sending arbitrary Unicode characters even if they were
not defined in the original X11 protocol; and sending correct
codes for the keys on the numeric keypad.
- Viewer for Windows: Ctrl-Alt-Del combination should not depend on
current ScrollLock state (which normally toggles Alt key to Meta
key conversion).
- Viewer for Windows: Fixed an issue with not sending update
requests after choosing Minimize then Maximize on the viewer
window (as opposed to the Minimize/Restore sequence which always
worked correctly).
- Viewer for Windows: Fixed a number of problems with saving and
restoring connection options.
- Viewer for Windows: Fixed user interface logic in the Options
window. There were incorrect dependencies between
compression-related controls.
- Viewer for Windows: Improved phrasing for a number of error
messages and log records in the file transfer module.
- Source Code: Visual Studio 2010 is now supported, upgraded
solution and project files are included in the source
distribution. Versions for Visual Studio 2008 are included as
well.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
\* TightVNC 2.0.2
- Server for Windows: The server could work incorrectly or even
crash when font size adjustment or DPI scaling feature was used.
New version should be fully compatible with Windows desktop
scaling. This fix was developed for TightVNC 2.0.1 but was not
included in that version due to a packaging problem.
- Server and Viewer for Windows: More fixes have been made to solve
problems with clipboard transfers. Both server and viewer could
send question characters instead of non-ASCII symbols if current
input language did not match the text encoding. These fixes
complement related changes introduced in version 2.0.1.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
\* TightVNC 2.0.1
- Server for Windows: The server could work incorrectly or even
crash when font size adjustment or DPI scaling feature was used.
New version should be fully compatible with Windows desktop
scaling. [UPDATE: Due to a packaging problem this fix was not
included in version 2.0.1.]
- Server for Windows: Fixed log file rotation. After creating five
backup copies, it failed to rename old files and just overwrote
the most recent log file.
- Viewer for Windows: Server-to-client clipboard transfers have been
fixed. Characters beyond the basic ASCII set could be copied into
the local clipboard incorrectly.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
\* TightVNC 2.0 (available for Windows only)
- Server and Viewer for Windows: Introducing new file transfer
subsystem based on new protocol extensions. Multiple files and
directories can be copied at once, directories are processed
recursively. Data compression is used to speed-up copying. Files
can be renamed or removed, new directories can be created. File
sizes are not limited by 4 Gb any more.
- Server for Windows: Implemented new architecture which separates
service code from the user interface. This enables service-mode
operation under Windows Vista and Windows 7. Also, this fixes all
known problems with multi-user features of modern Windows systems
like Fast User Switching and Terminal Services.
- Server for Windows: Screen updates have become reliable. If
something went wrong and the picture in the viewer is garbled,
incomplete or outdated, it will be recovered in reasonable time.
There should be no more hidden menus or destructive window
movements. If fast update detection methods fail, full-screen
polling will keep updates going.
- Server for Windows: Featuring new secure administrative interface.
What was called "TightVNC tray icon" in previous versions is now a
separate process which acts as a control interface to the TightVNC
service. Control interface can be optionally protected with a
password to make sure users cannot reconfigure or shut down the
service unless they know the password (or have administrator
privileges).
- Server for Windows: There should be no more confusion between
"default settings" and "user settings". In TightVNC 2.0, there is
only one service-mode configuration and it is not affected by any
per-user settings. The "Configure..." menu item of the service
always shows the effective configuration. From the other side,
TightVNC Server can be started as an application, and in that case
each user has his/her own configuration.
- Server for Windows: Featuring IP-based access control for incoming
connections. Previous versions of TightVNC did allow similar IP
filtering, but now everything is easily configurable. You can even
test the rules on specific IP addresses, prior to applying new
rules.
- Installer: TightVNC 2.0 distribution has been packaged with new
installer. It's smarter and more efficient. It tries to prevent
reboots whenever possible. It invites to set passwords so that
TightVNC Server would be ready to work right at the moment of
finishing the installation. From the other side, it can operate
silently (when run with /S option in the command line). Finally,
the complete self-installing TightVNC package (both server and
viewer parts, and the uninstall tool) is only 550 kilobytes in
size.
- Server and Viewer for Windows: Keyboard handling has been
improved. Older versions of TightVNC had problems with passing
characters that do not fit in the Latin-1 code space. TightVNC 2.0
adds full support for different national codepages and keyboard
layouts.
- This list of changes is not full. TightVNC Server 2.0 for Windows
has been completely rewritten by the TightVNC team. It does not
include old TightVNC 1.3 code. So the right answer to the "What's
New?" question must be "Everything!".
----------------------------------------------------------------------
\* TightVNC 1.3.10
- Windows Server: Impersonating currently logged on user while
processing file transfer requests. Disabling file transfers if
current user is unknown or nobody is logged in.
- Windows Server: Fixed rendering problems when multiple CopyRects
were combined with normal updates. That could caused distortions
that never updated even with full-screen polling active.
- Windows Server: Added new "-silent" command-line option which
modifies the behavior of -install, -reinstall and -remove options
and makes them not show informational windows on successful
execution. Note that -silent should precede other respective
options in the command line.
- Windows Server: LastRect, XCursor and RichCursor pseudo-encodings
were not properly enabled if they preceded true encodings in the
SetEncodings protocol message.
- Windows Viewer: Fixed integer overflow vulnerabilities reported
by Core Security Technologies. A specially modified VNC server
could currupt the heap of the connected viewer causing its crash
or malfunction.
- Windows Viewer: TightVNC Viewer version 1.3.9 saved only
successful connections in the list of recently visited VNC
servers. Now we save unsuccessful connections too so that users
would not ever have to re-type server names after connection
failures. Also, several other enhancements were made to the code
which handles the list of recent connections.
- Windows Viewer: Fixed a bug with not loading passwords from saved
.vnc files correctly if the first byte of their encrypted
representation was zero.
- Windows Viewer: Fixed problems under Windows Vista where Windows
taskbar could remain visible above the full-screen window.
- Windows Viewer: Fixed a problem with decoding JPEG rectangles
wider than 2048 pixels.
- Windows Viewer: Fixed a bug with not saving log file name
correctly on using the Browse button.
- Windows Viewer: Usability improvements in the "New Connection"
dialog.
- Windows Packaging: Improved installer and uninstall utility.
In this version, self-installing executable will not try to
install service in Windows Vista. Improved uninstall program
always removes the WinVNC service if it was previously installed.
- Unix Server: Applied fixes for 64-bit Linux issues, a patch from
Russel Miranda.
- Unix Server: Made the vncserver script read configuration from
files (system-wide /etc/tightvncserver.conf and user-specific
$HOME/.vnc/tightvncserver.conf).
- All viewers: Allow configuring JPEG quality level regardless of
the preferred encoding set. This makes sense because TightVNC
Servers can transmit video data as JPEG even if Tight is not the
preferred encoding.
- Java viewer: Fixed a bug that caused NullPointerException when
connecting to any VNC server not supporting TightVNC protocol
extensions.
- Java viewer: Fixed a bug with ignoreCursorUpdates option in 24-bit
color mode caused the viewer to disconnect. Thanks to Damien
Mascre for pointing out the issue.
- Java viewer: PORT parameter is not required any more, now it
defaults to 5900.
- Java viewer: Do not defer update requests by default, to minimize
delays in screen updates.
- Java viewer: Improvements in reporting statistics on disconnect.
- Java viewer: Added debugging parameters (DEBUG\_XU, DEBUG\_CU) that
allow using the viewer as a tool for measuring VNC server
performance.
- Other minor improvements and bugfixes.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
\* TightVNC 1.3.9
- All platforms: Added support for the standard RFB protocol version
3.8 with TightVNC extensions.
- All platforms: Made "host:port" parsing maximally compatible with
VNC4. Interpreting a number in host names like somehost:5900 as an
actual port number if it's not in the range [0..99].
- Windows Server: Various user interface enhancements - changes in
GUI labels, tray icon with a red border when incoming connections
are not possible for any reason, more information in the tray icon
tip, smarter logic in displaying the Properties dialog, and more.
- Windows Server: Fixed a problem introduced in TightVNC 1.3.8 -
default passwords were not respected if user passwords were not
set.
- Windows Server: Slightly improved handling of passwords. One of
the notable changes is that now it's enough to enter a view-only
password without providing primary password.
- Windows Server: Fixed problems with running WinVNC service and
Terminal Services. When a Remote Desktop (RDP) client connected to
the console, WinVNC showed black screen and did not restore normal
operations even on disconnection of that RDP client. Now, we
always share the console correctly, and disable simultaneous RDP
and VNC sessions. The changes were ported from VNC 4.1.2.
- Windows Server: Better way of simulating Ctrl+Alt+Del. There are
reports that this solves the problem with greyed username and
password fields on Windows 2003 Server (bug #887617).
- Windows Server: Bugfix for the bug #1109102: attempt to restart
the machine remotely via TightVNC led to disconnect if there was
some non-saved data, and further connections were rejected.
- Windows Viewer: Multiple selection now works in file transfers,
thanks to developers at Novell and personally Rohit Kumar.
- Windows Viewer: The viewer terminated silently when the server
dropped connection right after accepting it. Now we report such
errors.
- Windows version source archive: Included project files for
compiling with Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition. Also, all required
libraries are now included within the source distribution.
- Unix Server: Applied patches from Debian Linux that port Xvnc to
x86\_64 platform (tightvnc-1.2.9-amd64support.p and
tightvnc-1.3\_alpha7-x86\_64.patch), thanks to Quanah Gibson-Mount.
- Java viewer: Implemented scaling, either with a fixed scaling
factor or automatic. If Java 2D API is available (Java 1.2 and
higher), then high-quality scaling is used. From the other side,
the viewer remains compatible with Java 1.1 where it would simply
use scaling with much decreased image quality. Scaling can be
enabled with new "Scaling Factor" parameter but cannot be
controlled from the GUI yet.
- Java viewer: Added support for ZRLE encoding.
- Java viewer: Disabled focus traversal keys under JVMs 1.4 and
higher. This fixes the problem with not sending Tab key events to
the VNC server.
- Java viewer: Fixed wrong pixel format interpretation at decoding
RichCursor pseudo-encoding (local cursor could be rendered in
wrong colors).
- Other improvements and bugfixes, see ChangeLog files within the
distribution for more details.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
\* TightVNC 1.3.8, release candidate version
- Win32 server: Fixed major problem with disconnecting clients on
screen locking, user logoff and logon, in the service mode.
- Win32 server: Added support for DFMirage driver direct screen
access mode (from DemoForge LLC).
- Win32 server: Added support for multiple monitors (from DemoForge
LLC).
- Win32 server: Improved layout and functionality of the Properties
dialog.
- Win32 server: More accurate password handling - now the server
code tries to distinguish between "empty" and "unset" passwords
better.
- Win32 server: New -shareall, -shareprimary and -sharearea
command-line options, working similarly to the -sharewindow
option.
- Win32 server: Fixed problems with restoring desktop wallpaper.
- Win32 viewer: Fixed bug with not enabling JPEG compression by
default.
- Win32 viewer: Fixed bug with not setting proper size of the viewer
window.
- Unix server: Port numbers are now calculated modulo 65536 with
vncviewer's -listen option. That makes it possible to listen on
TCP ports under 5900.
- Java viewer: Automatic encoding selection based on measuring
current network throughput.
- Other improvements and bugfixes, see ChangeLog files within the
distribution for more details.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
\* TightVNC 1.3dev7, release candidate version
- Win32 server: Fixed the problem with "olemainthreadwndname not
responding" in service mode under Windows NT 4.0. Under that OS,
the TightVNC service could hang on logoff.
- Win32 server: Removed the code for "desktop optimizations" that
was rather harmful than useful. Hopefully, this should fix
problems with crashing Delphi applications. Also this should
prevent settings like font smoothing always set to true on
disconnect.
- Win32 server: Fixed the issue with port number edit boxes that
were labeled incorrectly in the Properties dialog.
- Win32 server: Disallowing clipboard transfers in view-only mode.
- Win32 server: Fixed the problem with carriage return/linefeed
conversion of clipboard data.
- Win32 server: Fixed the problem with wallpaper being removed only
after completing the initial screen transmission.
- Win32 server: Minor improvements in the File Transfers dialog.
- Win32 server: More context help messages in Properties and File
Transfers dialogs.
- Unix server: Fixed a serious bug with sending cursor updates when
there was no FrameBufferUpdateRequest from that client.
- Unix server: Fixed problems with building Xvnc on modern linux
distributions, such as Fedora Core 3.
- Unix server: Disallowing clipboard transfers for view-only
clients.
- Other improvements and bugfixes, see ChangeLog files within the
distribution for more details.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
\* TightVNC 1.3dev6, Win32 release candidate version
- Win32 server: Improved layout of the Properties dialog, added
context help for every option. Also, current mirror driver status
is shown in the Hooks tab.
- Win32 server: Implemented new checkbox "Enable applet params in
URLs" corresponding to EnableURLParams registry setting.
- Win32 server: The option "Don't use mirror display driver even if
available" is now functional.
- Win32 server: New option "Blank screen on client connections".
When set and new client connects, the server's monitor is forced
to go to power saving mode.
- Win32 server: Fixed bugs with saving certain settings in the
registry, and bugs with setting default values when the registry
is not writable.
- Win32 server: Fixed a problem with one-pixel mouse offset.
- Win32 server: Fixed problems with inter-thread locking, this
should solve "Unhandled message type received" problems.
- Win32 server: Fixed a problem with the setting "Block remote input
on local activity", it was not working with DLL hooks disabled.
- Win32 server: Fixed various problems with file transfer
implementation. Error handling was improved, the C: drive bug
under Win98/Me seems to be solved.
- Win32 viewer: New "Auto" scaling mode. In this mode, the viewer
scales remote desktop to fit local window or screen size. If the
window size is changed, the scaling factor is adjusted
automatically.
- Win32 viewer: Now the viewer checks server's capabilities and does
not ever use non-standard protocol messages not supported by the
server. This change affects file transfers only, as other features
do not use non-standard protocol messages..
- Java viewer: New "scale remote cursor" option has been added. It
allows to reduce or enlarge cursor image in the full-control mode.
- Java viewer: A cursor repaint problem has been fixed.
- Other improvements and bugfixes, see ChangeLog files within the
distribution for more details.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
\* TightVNC 1.3dev5, development version
- Win32 server: Support for the "DFMirage" mirror video driver has
been added (the driver itself will be available separately). Using
the mirror driver greatly increases the speed and reliability of
updates, and also desreases CPU utilization on the server.
- Win32 server: New polling algorithm has been implemented. It's
similar to that found in x0rfbserver. New algorithm uses minimum
CPU time when there are no changes on the screen, and detects
major changes very quickly, resulting in greatly improved
responsiveness on the client side.
- Win32 server: Improved methods for filtering screen changes that
actually do not change anything. New algorithm not only works
faster, but it also detects changes much more accurately, leaving
less work to encoders.
- Win32 viewer: A special mode for Unix users has been implemented:
when ScrollLock is on, the viewer will send Meta on pressing Alt
keys.
- Win32 server: Fixed a problem with view-only clients that were
enabled full control on just opening the Properties dialog of the
server.
- Win32 server: It should not ever hang any more on changing ports
or the LoopbackOnly setting.
- Win32 server: DisableTrayIcon and RemoveWallpaper settings are
working again.
- Win32 server: The problem with not saving Query Settings has been
fixed.
- Win32 server: The polling mode "on event received only" has been
fixed - it did not work correctly in previous version.
- Win32 server: Fixed a number of issues with mouse handling,
including that annoying problem with pointer jumping on slow
connections.
- Win32 server: Applied a bugfix from HorizonLive solving the
problem with crashes or incorrect operation after color depth
changes on the server's desktop.
- Win32 viewer: It does not crash any more on entering long
passwords in the authentication window.
- Win32 viewer: Positioning and resizing logic of the viewer window
has been improved.
- Win32 viewer: Now the viewer chooses more reasonable file names
for saved .vnc sessions.
- Win32 viewer: In the full-screen mode, the viewer allows other
windows to be shown above the remote desktop. This makes hotkeys
such as Shift-Ctrl-Alt-O useful in the full-screen mode.
- Unix version: A number of bugfixes -- copying clipboard to
non-authenticated clients in Xvnc, delayed cursor shape updates in
Xvnc, and crashing on switching between KDE virtual desktops in
vncviewer.
- Unix viewer: Support for the new -autopass option has been added,
a patch from Ki NETWORKS, Inc.
- Other changes, see ChangeLog files within the distribution for
more details.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
\* TightVNC 1.3dev4, development version
- Featuring updated Unix version and Java viewer, supporting RFB
protocol version 3.7, with or without TightVNC protocol
extensions. Version 3.3 of the protocol is supported as well.
- Win32 version: Built-in Java viewer was absent in the previous
development version; now it's available again.
- Win32 version: Now the server does not crash on remote
Ctrl-Alt-Del events, and on changing display modes.
- Win32 version: A problem with reinstalling the service has been
fixed (WinVNC -reinstall command-line option). In previous
versions, reinstalling the service could fail if a user did not
close "Service unregistered" message box within a few seconds.
- Win32 version: Now the server does not hang on selecting equal RFB
and HTTP port numbers. A warning is shown instead.
- Win32 version: The server does not hang on toggling loopback
connection options, and on changing port/display numbers.
- Win32 version: WinVNC does not crash on choosing "Kill All
Clients" during file download.
- Win32 version: CopyRect handling in the server has been fixed, the
CopyRect encoding is enabled again.
- Win32 version: The Advanced Properties dialog of the server has
been removed. The controls of that dialog has been moved to tabs
in the Properties dialog.
- Win32 version: Context help in the server's Properties dialog has
been implemented (although not all descriptions are ready yet).
- Unix viewer: Fixed a bug with the viewer crashing on selecting
text in Xvnc, and then choosing F8 / Clipboard: local -> remote,
twice.
- There was some progress on supporting pluggable encryption and
authentication methods, in both Win32 and Unix versions, and in
the Java viewer.
- Other changes, see ChangeLog files within the distribution for
more details.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
\* TightVNC 1.3dev3, Win32 development (unstable) version
- All features and fixes from 1.2.9 and 1.3dev1 versions included.
- Improved GUI of the viewer featuring toolbar, hotkeys, pre-set
connection profiles, more configuration options, context help in
dialogs, and more. Finally, the viewer remembers all
per-connection and global settings in the registry.
- File transfers between viewer and server machines.
- Support for RFB protocol version 3.7, with TightVNC extensions.
- A possibility to turn off hooking via VNCHooks.dll in WinVNC while
full screen polling is in use.
- Other changes, see ChangeLog files within the distribution for
more details.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
\* TightVNC 1.2.9
- Win32 version: Major security-related bug in the server has been
fixed -- handling of the "QueryAllowNoPass" option was seriously
broken. Together with fixing this bug, the whole authentication
logic in the server code has been redesigned.
- Win32 version: Now the HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER registry hive is being
closed properly on restoring display settings, on disconnect. This
change should solve the problem with unloading the registry on
logout, when WinVNC is running as a service.
- Win32 version: Problems with "QuerySetting" and "QueryTimeout"
options have been fixed -- the settings could be copied from user
configuration to default settings without user's intention.
- Win32 version: A long-standing bug has been fixed -- the logic to
handle retries after authentication failures was flawed, and used
to delete the same object twice under certain conditions.
- Win32 version: Now it's possible to specify port numbers with the
winvnc -connect option, using the "host::port" format. Also,
providing a -connect option without arguments now brings up the
"Add New Client" dialog.
- Unix version: New "Request refresh" button has been implemented in
the viewer's F8 popup menu.
- Unix version: Xvnc compilation fixes for HP-UX and MacOS X have
been applied, from Ki NETWORKS, Inc.
- Unix version: New vncpasswd -f command-line option has been
implemented. It allows providing passwords on stdin and writes
encrypted passwords to stdout. In addition, the password file name
"-" now denotes stdout. Finally, a buffer overflow has been fixed
in vncpasswd -- it could be caused by a long file name in the
command line.
- Unix version: A patch to fix input focus problems in the X11
viewer has been applied, from Greg Breland.
- Unix version: A patch fixing Xvnc crashes on Sparc has been
applied, from the RealVNC distribution.
- Unix version: A problem with incorrect port interpretation has
been fixed, in the vncviewer's -tunnel option handling. Thanks to
Clark Sessions.
- Java viewer: A modification from Bernd Krueger-Knauber has been
accepted, to pass through X keysyms for foreign currencies.
- Java viewer: The problem with initial keyboard focus not set to
the desktop on some JVMs has been fixed.
- Other minor improvements and bugfixes.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
\* TightVNC 1.2.8
- Unix and Win32 versions: Support for a separate view-only password
has been implemented. Now the servers support two passwords -- one
to allow full control, another to restrict remote keyboard and
mouse input.
- Win32 version: The password reset problem has been solved. In
versions starting from 1.2.4, the password could get changed in
the registry on opening Properties dialog and just hitting the OK
button.
- Win32 version: New "-reload" command-line option has been
implemented in Win32 server. It forces the running instance to
reload the registry settings.
- Win32 version: "RemoveWallpaper" and "LockSetting" options have
been made configurable in the Properties dialog; the code has been
ported from RealVNC 3.3.6.
- Win32 version: Support for "AllowEditClients" registry setting has
been ported from RealVNC 3.3.6.
- Unix version: New "-x11cursor" option has been implemented in
vncviewer; a patch from Peter Astrand. This option allows using a
real X11 cursor with X11-style cursor shape updates, disables the
dot cursor, and disables cursor position updates in non-fullscreen
mode.
- Unix version: New "RunCommand" command to customize the X11
vncviewer popup menu has been implemented; a patch from Peter
Astrand.
- Unix version: Several patches from Debian Linux have been applied.
This should fix a number of bugs and improve building on some
platforms supported by Debian Linux.
- Unix version: A problem with Xvnc eating all CPU time after xfs
restarts has been fixed; a patch from Martin Koegler.
- Other minor improvements and bugfixes.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
\* TightVNC 1.2.7
- Unix and Win32 versions, Java viewer: The most significant problem
with local cursor handling has been solved -- now clients can see
remote cursor movements performed on the server or by another
client. New PointerPos encoding and cursor shape updates both
minimize bandwidth requirements and greatly improve responsiveness
of the mouse pointer, while still allow to track correct pointer
position in all situations.
- Unix and Win32 versions: In all the places where display numbers
had to be used, now it's easy to use port numbers as well. The
viewers now allow to use new "hostname::port" syntax, in addition
to the traditional "hostname:display" format. The same new syntax
can be used in the "Add new client" dialog of Win32 server. In the
server, now it's equally easy to set display and port numbers.
Besides that, HTTP and RFB port numbers can be set individually.
- Unix and Win32 versions: In servers, decreased JPEG quality
factors for low quality levels. This improves bandwidth usage
while the image quality remains satisfactory in most cases. In
clients, JPEG compression is now enabled by default, because
usually it's a reasonable choice. To prevent viewers from
requesting JPEG compression, new -nojpeg option can be used.
- Unix and Win32 versions: Improved installer under Windows, better
RPMs for Linux.
- Win32 version: Major enhancements in layout and functionality of
the dialog boxes.
- Win32 version: New keyboard handling code has been ported from
RealVNC 3.3.6. This should solve all the issues with arrow keys
acting as numbers in console windows, and shift+arrows not working
under Win2k.
- Win32 version: Adopted WinVNC -reinstall option from RealVNC
3.3.5, together with a number of other changes in different
places. The viewer now accepts a port number after the -listen
command-line option, an improvement from RealVNC 3.3.6.
- Win32 version: Eliminated high CPU usage on the server before
sending cursor shape updates.
- Unix version: Bugfix for Xvnc's -localhost and -interface options
that were broken on many systems, thanks to Luke Mewburn for the
bugfix. Xvnc -version command-line option is now supported.
- Tight encoding is now documented in rfbproto.h files within source
archives.
- Java viewer: Implemented new buttons "Login again" and "Close
window" near the disconnect or error messages in the applet mode,
and introduced new "Offer Relogin" parameter to control this
improvement. Thanks to Peter Astrand for the initial version of
the "Login again" patch.
- Java viewer: Support for connections via HTTP proxies using HTTP
CONNECT method. This will not work in the applet mode, due to Java
security restrictions.
- Java viewer: Extra .vnc files have been removed, having just
index.vnc should be enough. Also, an example HTML page has been
prepared, to simplify installation under a standalone Web server.
- Java viewer: Added a MANIFEST to the JAR archive, to allow easy
execution of the JAR file, using java -jar command-line option.
- Other minor improvements and bugfixes.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
\* TightVNC 1.3dev1, Win32 development (unstable) version
- Implemented partial screen sharing. Any single window or any
rectangular screen area can be shared instead of the whole screen.
The position and dimensions of the shared screen area can be
changed dynamically, and client windows will adjust their
dimensions on the fly. The user interface to choose shared screen
area is very intuitive and easy to use.
- Screen resolution changes won't cause WinVNC to disconnect clients
any more (but changes in screen color format still result in
disconnects, this will be fixed later).
- It's possible to make WinVNC ignore remote inputs when local mouse
or keyboard is in use. Remote events will be re-enabled after a
specified timeout (3 seconds by default).
- There may be other changes I forgot to mention. :-)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
\* TightVNC 1.2.6
- Win32 version: In this version, when WinVNC binds to a local TCP
port, it does not try to check several times if the port is in
use. It just re-uses the port if the display number is not set to
"Auto". One visible effect of this change is that the delay
between starting up and showing the icon is greatly reduced.
- Unix version: Fixed the bug which caused the vncserver script to
fail when the XAUTHORITY environment variable was not set.
- Unix version: Fixed the bug which prevented the vncpasswd utility
from setting correct permissons on the passwd file.
- Unix version: Fixed a repeated challenge replay attack
vulnerability, bugtraq id 5296.
- Unix version: Added files to simplify building of Linux RPMs,
thanks to Peter Astrand.
- Unix version: Improved scrolling in the full-screen mode, modified
patch from Ville Herva.
- Minor cleanups.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
\* TightVNC 1.2.5
- Win32 version: Fixed a problem in the I/O subsystem that was
introduced in TightVNC 1.2.2 and was causing major slowdown in
communication with clients.
- Win32 version: Enabled remote upgrade in the installation script.
Also, the installer will install a copy of the TightVNC Web site,
and will create shortcuts to most important documentation pages.
- Win32 version: Implemented new feature to specify applet
parameters in URL requests being sent to the built-in HTTP server.
Added support for new "EnableURLParams" registry setting which can
be used to enable this feature.
- Win32 version: Added support for the NewFBSize pseudo-encoding
allowing to change framebuffer geometry on the fly on server's
request.
- Win32 version: Included "solution" and "project" files for MS
Visual Studio 7, from Andrew van der Stock, applied a set of minor
fixes to suppress compilation warnings under MS Visual Studio 7.
- Win32 version: The viewer now tries to preserve the size and
position of the desktop window after applying new connection
options.
- Unix version: Implemented new feature to specify applet parameters
in URL requests being sent to the built-in HTTP server. Added
support for new $PARAMS variable in .vnc HTML templates.
- Unix version: Added the possibility to keep users' vnc directories
under /tmp, as suggested by Ivan Popov. This mode can be enabled
by editing the $vncUserDir variable in the vncserver script. Also,
new -t option has been implemented in the vncpasswd utility which
allows to change VNC password files under /tmp.
- Unix version: Applied Xvnc -viewonly patch from Ehud Karni.
- Unix version: Applied Linux/PowerPC Xvnc fix from Peter A. Castro.
- Unix version: Bug fixed: Xvnc failed to reset compression level
and JPEG image quality on reading lists of encodings supported by
clients.
- Unix version: Made the viewer handle XCursor encoding operating on
the framebuffer instead of setting new cursors directly in X.
- Unix version: Applied a number of porting fixes from Ki Networks,
Inc.
- Java viewer: Added new feature allowing to save RFB sessions in
FBS files compatible with rfbproxy. This feature works only if JVM
security manager allows access to the local filesystem, which is
usually true only when the viewer is used as a standalone
application or if the viewer applet is cryptographically signed.
New "Record" button will appear in the button panel if this
feature is enabled.
- Java viewer: Added new "ENCPASSWORD" parameter, modified patch
from Peter Astrand.
- Java viewer: Applied patch from Peter Astrand to fix problems with
Swedish keys and broken JVMs.
- Other minor fixes and cleanups.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
\* TightVNC 1.2.4
- Win32 version: WinVNC crashes on reporting zero statistics were
fixed. This should eliminate crashes when using x2vnc and win2vnc
client programs.
- Win32 version: a problem with listening viewer was fixed.
Initiating multiple non-shared connections could crash the viewer
application.
- Win32 version: real passwords are never placed into the password
text control in the WinVNC Properties dialog any more. This should
prevent grabbing plain-text passwords from that text control.
- Win32 version: logging on errors was improved to provide better
diagnosis for errors, especially for those causing the message
"Connection closed" right after authentication.
- Win32 version: handling of log files was improved. Now WinVNC
should be able to save backup copies of log files under
Win95/98/Me. Also, all log files are now written in MS-DOS/Windows
text format instead of the Unix one.
- Win32 version: a problem with reporting error messages in the
listening viewer was fixed.
- Win32 version: reporting incorrect statistics in the Tight encoder
was fixed.
- Win32 version: HTML pages and templates for the built-in HTTP
server were improved.
- Unix version: applied patch from Ki Networks, Inc. solving build
problems on a number of commercial Unix systems, and fixing a
number of minor bugs and typos.
- Unix version: added a possibility to denote standard input with
the "-" file name instead of a real password file name.
- Unix version: fixed a bug causing vncpasswd utility work
incorrectly when a file name argument was given in the command
line.
- Unix version: applied patch to solve keyboard focus problems in
the full-screen vncviewer, from Peter Astrand. The patch does not
seem to solve all the issues, but definitely makes things better.
New grabKeyboard resource was added to control full-screen mode
behavior.
- Java viewer: new "Show Offline Desktop" parameter was added to
make the desktop still visible even after the remote side has
closed connection.
- Java viewer: error messages were made much more meaningful.
- Java viewer: keyboard focus problems were fixed. This should
prevent opening new windows (e.g. Options or Clipboard) behind the
active authenticator or desktop window.
- Java viewer: now "R"/"r" keys can be used to request screen
updates in view-only mode.
- Java viewer: applied patch from Peter Astrand to fix problems with
Swedish keys and broken JVMs.
- Other minor fixes and cleanups.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
\* TightVNC 1.2.3
- Unix and Win32 versions: zlib library was updated to the most
recent version (1.1.4) where a potential security issue was fixed.
- Unix and Win32 versions: fixed blocking I/O problems in built-in
HTTP servers. Older versions had to wait while one client finishes
his transaction, only then they served new client connections,
thus making easy denial-of-service attacks possible.
- Unix and Win32 versions: updated built-in Java viewer, see details
below.
- Win32 version: Added support for mouse wheel events. Wheel mouse
support is fully compatible and interoperable with Unix version
where this feature was available for a long time.
- Win32 version (WinVNC): The -connect command-line option now
accepts a display number after a hostname.
- Win32 version: Creating associations for .vnc files in the
installer.
- Java viewer was GREATLY improved: the code was converted to Java
1.1, painting techniques were re-designed completely (now the
viewer should work in MacOS), several new parameters were added,
all parameters were documented in the README file. Most important
new features include: support for 24-bit colors, JPEG support in
Tight encoding, RFB Bell message support, new "Refresh" button, a
possibility to operate in a separate scrollable window, dynamic
view-only mode. Many more changes were introduces, see the
ChangeLog for more information. Please note that new Java viewer
class names were changed, e.g. vncviewer.jar file has become
VncViewer.jar etc.
- Unix version: a number of changes in the vncserver script, e.g.
the default color depth is now 24, extra delay after Xvnc startup
removed, font path is now configurable in the beginning of the
script, and more.
- Unix version: zlib library was removed from the core X sources.
Instead, both vncviewer and Xvnc now can use either system zlib
and JPEG libraries, or ones packaged within TightVNC source
archive in the lib/ directory. Unix sources are distributed in two
versions: one with these libraries for those who don't have them
installed in the system, and another version without libraries,
copied directly from CVS, for those who do have zlib and/or JPEG
libraries installed. In the former case, build procedure would
include additional "make libs" step. System libraries will be
linked dynamically, libraries included in the source archive will
be linked in statically.
- Unix version now includes comprehensive manual pages for
vncviewer, vncserver, Xvnc, vncconnect and vncpasswd programs. The
vncinstall script in the source distribution now accepts one more
parameter allowing to specify where to install manual pages.
- Unix version (Xvnc): a number of patches from Red Hat Linux vnc
package were incorporated into the TightVNC codebase. This adds
support for more architectures including s390 and s390x, adds a
possibility to use tcp\_wrappers for Xvnc access control.
- Unix version (Xvnc): several bugfixes, e.g. applied patch to fix
crash in the code dealing with font server; fixed word alignment
problem in raw encoder experienced by Sparc users.
- Unix version is no more distributed as patches to a standard VNC
release. This is because patches cannot handle changes in binary
files and handle file removals very inefficiently.
- Other minor fixes and cleanups.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
\* TightVNC 1.2.2
- Win32 server: long-standing Win9x resource consumption problem has
been fixed. Now the server thread does not use blocking I/O, and
therefore is always ready to process messages from the VNCHooks
DLL.
- Win32 server: now built-in HTTP daemon may be enabled and disabled
interactively from the Advanced Preferences dialog (this setting
is saved in new "EnableHTTPDaemon" registry key).
- Win32 server: changes in layout and text of the Advanced
Preferences dialog.
- Xvnc: Minor bugfix which should prevent potential dereference of a
NULL pointer.
- Unix viewer: Now viewer window would be raised on beep (bell)
event, unless new -noraiseonbeep option is provided in the command
line or "raiseOnBeep" resource set to False.
- One more packaging option for the Unix source: ready to build
archive with Zlib and JPEG libraries inside.
- Other minor fixes and cleanups.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
\* TightVNC 1.2.1
- Win32 server: added support for reverse connections on ports other
than 5500, modified patch from Steve Kann.
- Win32 viewer: added support for new command-line options:
-noshared and -encoding XXX.
- Bugfixes in Win32 viewer: changes in exception handling eliminate
Borland C++ compilation problems causing application crashes on
repetitive connections, notably in the listen mode. Also, now
warning exceptions causing disconnects are reported to user,
except for the case when a user has closed the viewer window.
- Better packaging in Win32 version: self-installing package is
available, vncviewer now shows correct icon image.
- Unix vncviewer: Default tunneling command template has been
changed, to allow tunneled connections to hosts where only
loopback VNC connections are enabled. New -via
command-line option provides enhanced tunneling functionality, now
one can make vncviewer tunnel connections to a VNC host via third
machine acting as a gateway.
- Java viewer: Addition of new parameters PASSWORD, "Show Controls",
and "View Only", modified patch from Steve Kann.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
\* TightVNC 1.2.0
- Tight encoding is now configurable and can operate at different
compression levels where low compression levels are very fast in
terms of CPU usage. New "-compresslevel N" option implemented in
vncviewer to set compression levels for Tight encoding (1 - fast,
9 - best).
- Enhanced techniques to split large rectangles in Tight encoder;
now it tries to find large solid-color areas and send them in
separate rectangles.
- Lossy JPEG compression in Tight encoding has been implemented, new
"-quality N" vncviewer option should be used to enable this
feature (0 - low image quality and best compression, 9 - best
image quality). JPEG compression is used only for screen areas
that seem to be suitable for JPEG compression (although algorithms
to detect such areas are not perfect, of course).
- New "XCursor" and "RichCursor" encodings implemented. They are
used to transmit cursor shape updates from server to clients
("local cursor" feature requested by many users). Mouse movement
no longer causes framebuffer updates to happen, vncviewer
processes mouse locally when this feature is active. New
-nocursorshape vncviewer option turns this feature off.
- A number of recent changes from both TridiaVNC and AT&T's releases
merged into the source, now the code is based on version 3.3.3r2
for Unix part, and on 3.3.3r9 for Win32.
- Unix vncviewer: When -tunnel option is specified in the command
line, special rules are now used to choose preferred encoding. Now
viewer does not think that server is running on the same machine
when tunneling is on and the preferred encoding is now "tight"
with default compression instead of raw.
- Xvnc: Rules to set default pixel formats have been changed: now
they are RGB565 instead of BGR556 for color depth 16, and RGB888
instead of BGR888 for depth 24. This makes Xvnc compatible with
Imlib renderer used in Gnome and also helps to avoid unnecessary
pixel format translations in many cases.
- Xvnc: X11 modifier mapped to META key is now Mod4 instead of Mod1.
New -compatiblekbd option implemented in Xvnc to force META and
ALT keys behave the same way as they do in the original AT&T's
version.
- A number of bugs fixed: viewer crashes after inflate() call, Xvnc
CoRRE encoding problems, Xvnc bit-order issues in XCursor and
RichCursor encodings, etc.
- Java viewer now supports Tight encoding and cursor shape updates.
Drawing techniques were changed, settings "Raw pixel drawing:
Fast/Reliable" and "CopyRect: Fast/Reliable" removed from the
Options panel since they do not make sense in new drawing model.
- Other new features, optimizations, fixes and cleanups, see
ChangeLog files.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
\* VNC Tight Encoding 1.1
- New ``gradient'' filter implemented in servers (it can be disabled
in Xvnc with new -lazytight option). The filter preprocess
full-color screen areas prior to compression in order to achieve
better compression ratios (with the cost of slower compression).
Vncviewers of version 1.0 had support for this filter already, but
there was small bug causing image distortions in certain cases. So
it is recommended to upgrade both servers and viewers.
- Stupid bug fixed: extra unused color was included in palettes in
many cases; compression ratios used to be worse than they should
be.
- The algorithm used to split large rectangles into parts has been
changed. This change can increase compression ratios in many
situations.
- Byte-order issues in servers have been (hopefully) fixed.
- Performance tuning, code rewrites and cleanups in various places.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
\* VNC Tight Encoding 1.0
- Initial release.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

List:       [bugtraq](?l=bugtraq&r=1&w=2)
Subject:    [RE: VNC authentication weakness](?t=102753174600001&r=1&w=2)
From:       ["Andrew van der Stock" <avanderstock () b-sec ! com ! au>](?a=102622351600003&r=1&w=2)
Date:       [2002-07-26 4:09:27](?l=bugtraq&r=1&w=2&b=200207)
[Download RAW [message](?l=bugtraq&m=102769183913594&q=mbox) or [body](?l=bugtraq&m=102769183913594&q=raw)]

This weakness has been documented for some time. Most have been
documented in print (Hacking Exposed 3rd edition, pp 539-543,
particularly p542).

The other issues that haven't been covered off before include:

* NT 4.0 default registry permissions are weak, and allow normal users
to replace the crypted password with one of their own in HKLM.

* Under all versions of VNC, it's not clear when the HKCU version will
be used. The code will quite happily use the one in HKCU (if it exists)
under most circumstances from my own testing. This can be a problem if a
user runs the app version of VNC (requires no special privileges).

* many of the servers do not adequately check DNS results before doing a
log with a %s format string. (Not normally exploitable - logging is
rarely turned on).

* it may be possible to attack the mini-web server turned on by default.
I've had limited success in looking at this issue because I don't
normally do shellcode (prefer fixing the problem), and thus my limited
l33tness has hampered my exploiting this issue. It's there if you go
through the code. Fairly sure a .. exploit of some form is possible.

So what can be done? TightVNC 1.2.5 for Win32 should have an routine or
two to tighten up registry security on NT platforms (NT 4.0 SP3 and
later), and the location of the password should be moving to the LSA
secrets area.

I've explicitly asked Constantin to turn off the mini-web server by
default (search the tightvnc mail lists back about 8 months). Those
sites that need it, will turn it back on. I've never used it. Don't know
many sites that do.

But here is a longer term solution:

I've been working on RFB 4.0 for some time. A major feature is that it
replaces the default authenticator with SRP, ditching the 3DES C/R
completely. The proposal is not complete as yet, but the SRP portion is.
Beyond completing a few things in there in ABNF, the protocol
description is nearly complete. The trick then is to get the currently
active projects to support it.

If people are interested in reviewing the security of the protocol and
suggest improvements, please do so.

The PDF can be downloaded from here:
<http://www.evilsecurity.com/vnc/>

Direct link to the Word and Visio source files in case you wish to
provide comments back in a marked up form:
<http://www.evilsecurity.com/vnc/rfb.zip>

Remember - this is a draft specification, and beyond a grammar checker
that I have written to test the protocol (more on that to come), it
doesn't actually exist in code form yet.

Thanks,
Andrew van der Stock
