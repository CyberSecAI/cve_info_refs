```
  - Root cause of vulnerability:
    - A buffer overflow exists in the cnd-program of mgetty due to insufficient bounds checking when handling the CallerName argument in the Caller ID string.
    - The faxspool directory in mgetty was world-writable, allowing modification of fax transmission privileges.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
    - Buffer overflow in cnd-program.
    - Insecure world-writable spool directory for outgoing faxes.
  - Impact of exploitation:
    - Buffer overflow can lead to denial of service and potentially arbitrary code execution.
    - Insecure spool directory allows local users to modify fax transmission privileges.
  - Attack vectors:
    - Remote attackers can exploit the buffer overflow by sending a specially crafted Caller ID string with a long CallerName argument.
    - Local users can exploit the insecure spool directory by modifying fax transmission privileges.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position:
    - Remote attackers can exploit the buffer overflow via network access to the service.
    - Local users with access to the system can exploit the insecure spool directory.
