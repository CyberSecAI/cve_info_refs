The provided document is a Microsoft Security Bulletin (MS02-066) that addresses multiple vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer. Specifically, it mentions CVE-2002-1186 as one of the vulnerabilities fixed in this cumulative patch.

Here's the breakdown of the information related to CVE-2002-1186:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Internet Explorer handles encoded characters within a URL. Specifically, when certain encoded characters are included, the proper security checks are bypassed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Information disclosure: The vulnerability could allow an attacker to "spy" on a user's session with a second website after they have first visited the attacker's website and clicked a crafted link. The attacker could then access information the user shares with the second website.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive personal information (e.g., name, address, credit card info) that a user shares with the second website.
- The attacker can only "spy" on the user's session on the second web site. They cannot follow the user to other websites and can't spy on future sessions with the same website if the user navigates there directly. The attacker cannot perform any actions on the system or alter data.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker must first host a website (Site A).
- This website contains a malicious hyperlink to a second website (Site B).
- The hyperlink has encoded characters that exploit the vulnerability.
- The user must visit Site A and click the crafted hyperlink to Site B.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to host a website.
- The attacker needs to entice the user to visit their website.
- The attacker needs to entice the user to click a specific link on their site with the malformed URL.
