## Mike Spice's Quiz Me! does not adequately validate user input

#### Vulnerability Note VU#318835

Original Release Date: 2002-09-18 | Last Revised: 2002-09-18

---

### Overview

Mike Spice's Quiz Me! does not adequately validate user input, allowing directory traversal. As a result, an attacker can cause Quiz Me! to overwrite any file on the server to which the web server process has write privileges.

### Description

| Mike Spice's Quiz Me! is a CGI script written in Perl, enabling webmasters to publish interactive quizzes on their sites. The CGI variable 'quiz' is passed by Quiz Me! to Perl's open() function, without adequate validation to filter '../' sequences and null bytes. As a result, an attacker can cause Quiz Me! to traverse directories and overwrite any file on the server to which the web server process has write privileges. |
| --- |

### Impact

| Remote attackers can overwrite files on the server. |

### Solution
