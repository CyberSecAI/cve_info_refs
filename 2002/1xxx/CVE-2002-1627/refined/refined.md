{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The CGI script 'Quiz Me!' does not adequately validate user input passed through the 'quiz' variable before passing it to Perl's open() function.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Directory traversal",
    "Insufficient input validation",
     "Use of unfiltered user-supplied input in file operations"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote attackers can overwrite files on the server to which the web server process has write privileges.",
  "Attack vectors": "By crafting a malicious 'quiz' variable containing '../' sequences and null bytes, an attacker can cause 'Quiz Me!' to traverse directories and overwrite files.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable script."
