        "title": "Mantis Advisory/2002-02 Limiting output to reporters can be bypassed",
        "vulnerability": "It is possible to instruct Mantis to show reporters only the bugs that they reported, by setting the limit_reporters option to ON. This will automatically set the 'reporter' filter on the 'View Bugs' page.\n\nThe information on the 'View Bugs' page was also available in a form suitable for printing, by clicking on the 'Print Reports' link on the 'View Bugs' page. However this script, print_all_bug_page.php, did not check the limit_reporters option and thus allowed reporters to see the summaries of bugs they did not report.",
