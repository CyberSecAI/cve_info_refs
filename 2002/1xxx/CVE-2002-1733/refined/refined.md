- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Prospero MessageBoards application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied HTML input in messages, allowing users to inject arbitrary client-side scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability, lack of input sanitization/escaping.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can inject malicious client-side scripts (JavaScript, VBScript) into messages that will execute when other users view the messages. This could lead to:
    - Stealing user session cookies, allowing the attacker to impersonate the victim.
    - Potentially wider attacks if combined with browser vulnerabilities, such as stealing more information than just cookies
    - Any action that can be achieved through JavaScript execution in the user's browser
- **Attack vectors:** Posting a message to the message board containing malicious HTML or JavaScript.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Must have an account on the message board
    - Ability to post messages
    - Basic knowledge of HTML and scripting (JavaScript, VBScript) to craft malicious input
