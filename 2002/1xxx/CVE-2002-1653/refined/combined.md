## cryptcat does not encrypt data communications when -e command argument is used

#### Vulnerability Note VU#165099

Original Release Date: 2002-03-03 | Last Revised: 2004-02-23

---

### Overview

With certain options used, cryptcat does not encrypt network connections as expected.

### Description

| Cryptcat is an enhanced version of netcat that adds twofish encryption.  If cryptcat is started in listen (server) mode binding a shell to a network port, cryptcat fails to enable encryption. Without encryption enabled on the server, cryptcat clients will not be able to connect. Furthermore, netcat clients can connect to the server port and communicate without encryption. |
| --- |

### Impact

| Users may open unencrypted ports on the server with the assumption that any connections to that port will be encrypted by cryptcat. |
| --- |

### Solution

| The CERT/CC is currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem. |
| --- |

| None. |
