{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insufficient validation of user-supplied input before passing it to Perl's open() function.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Directory traversal vulnerability due to lack of filtering of '../' sequences.",
    "Null byte injection vulnerability due to lack of null byte filtering."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote attackers can overwrite arbitrary files on the server, as the CGI script runs with web server process privileges.",
  "Attack vectors": "By manipulating CGI variables passed to the Perl script.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Remote attacker is required and no special privileges are needed."
