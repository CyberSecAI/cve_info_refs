- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `at` utility of HP Tru64 UNIX.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A buffer overflow vulnerability within the `at` utility.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow a local attacker to gain elevated privileges and execute arbitrary code on the system.
- **Attack vectors**: Local attack. The vulnerability is exploited by a local user on the vulnerable system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a local user on the system with the ability to execute the `at` command.
