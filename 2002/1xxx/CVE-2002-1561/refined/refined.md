Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the Windows RPC Endpoint Mapper's improper handling of malformed messages received over TCP/IP. Specifically, the RPC Endpoint Mapper process does not properly check message inputs under certain circumstances, leading to a NULL pointer dereference.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect handling of malformed messages by the RPC Endpoint Mapper.
- A NULL pointer dereference occurs when processing a malformed RPC message.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote attacker can cause the RPC Endpoint Mapper to terminate, denying service to legitimate users.
- **Loss of RPC-based services:** Since the Endpoint Mapper is part of the RPC service, its failure leads to the loss of all RPC-based services offered by the server and potential loss of COM functions.
- **Potential privilege escalation:**  After the RPC service has been terminated, an attacker may potentially take control of an orphaned named pipe and gain the privileges of the RPC service (Local System), although this is not the primary focus of the provided text.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker establishes a TCP/IP connection to the Endpoint Mapper process on a remote machine (port 135).
- The attacker initiates RPC connection negotiation.
- The attacker sends a malformed RPC message, triggering the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to connect to the Endpoint Mapper running on the target machine (TCP port 135).
- No additional privileges are required.
- The attacker needs to be able to send a malformed RPC message.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000, and Windows XP.
- Microsoft released patches for Windows 2000 and Windows XP but stated that architectural limitations prevent them from providing a patch for Windows NT 4.0.
- As a workaround, users are encouraged to block port 135 using a firewall.
- A side effect of the patch for some specific configurations is a potential issue with local COM calls.
- The RPC Endpoint Mapper is crucial for the operation of RPC based services, as it provides clients with port numbers for RPC services and maintains information about RPC connections.
- The vulnerability is a denial of service issue, and does not enable the attacker to execute arbitrary code or retrieve data.
