     Files XSS

Hi

It has been pointed out to me that you are currently presenting incorrect
information on four of your web pages about security vulnerabilies in
Actinic Catalog:

'Currently, there are no known upgrades, patches, or workarounds available
to correct this issue.'

These security loopholes, which all relate to cross-site scripting, were
closed in a subsequent release. The fix is to upgrade to the latest version,
currently v7.0.6

The other IDs affected are 27096, 27097 and 27098

I would be grateful if these could be corrected.

Best regards

Bruce Townsend
