PACKAGE : mysql
SUMMARY : remote DOS and arbitrary code execution
DATE    : 2002-12-15 12:12 UTC
EXPLOIT : remote

- - --------------------------------------------------------------------

- From e-matters advisory:

"We have discovered two flaws within the MySQL server that can be used
by any MySQL user to crash the server. Furthermore one of the flaws can
be used to bypass the MySQL password check or to execute arbitrary code
with the privileges of the user running mysqld.

We have also discovered an arbitrary size heap overflow within the mysql
client library and another vulnerability that allows to write '\0' to any
memory address. Both flaws could allow DOS attacks against or arbitrary
code execution within anything linked against libmysqlclient."

Read the full advisory at
<http://security.e-matters.de/advisories/042002.html>

SOLUTION

It is recommended that all Gentoo Linux users who are running

emerge rsync
emerge mysql
emerge clean

     Advisory: Multiple MySQL vulnerabilities
 Release Date: 2002/12/12
Last Modified: 2002/12/12
       Author: Stefan Esser [s.esser@e-matters.de]

  Application: MySQL <= 3.23.53a, <= 4.0.5a
     Severity: Several vulnerabilities within (lib)MySQL could
               allow (remote) compromise of client and/or server.
         Risk: Medium to critical
Vendor Status: Vendor released MySQL 3.23.54
    Reference: <http://security.e-matters.de/advisories/042002.html>

Overview:

   We have discovered two flaws within the MySQL server that can be used
   by any MySQL user to crash the server. Furthermore one of the flaws can
   be used to bypass the MySQL password check or to execute arbitrary code
   with the privileges of the user running mysqld.

   We have also discovered an arbitrary size heap overflow within the mysql
   client library and another vulnerability that allows to write '\0' to any
   memory address. Both flaws could allow DOS attacks against or arbitrary
   code execution within anything linked against libmysqlclient.

Details:

   While auditing the MySQL sourcetree we discovered several bugs within
   the MySQL client and server that are listed below:

   +++ SERVER +++ COM_TABLE_DUMP - Signed Integer Vulnerability

   When handling the COM_TABLE_DUMP package MySQL < 4.x takes two chars
   from the packet, casts them directly to unsigned integers and uses
   them as length parameters for memcpy. Obviously negative values within
   the chars will turn into very big unsigned numbers. Because this is a
   heap to heap copy operation and there is no memory allocating function
   within the SIGSEGV handler we strongly believe this bug can only be used
   for denial of service attacks. Depending on the packet mysqld will
   directly crash or hang in an endless loop of segmentation faults.
   This was tested against Windows, Linux and FreeBSD systems.

   +++ SERVER +++ COM_CHANGE_USER - Password Length Vulnerability

   In February 2000 Robert van der Meulen discovered a flaw within the
   main password authentication system of MySQL: The MySQL challenge
   response algorithm creates an expected response with exactly the
   length of the response provided by the client. So if the client sends
   only a one char response MySQL will check only one byte. But this
   means it is possible to give the correct response with only 32 tries
   (because the charset is only 32 chars big). When this bug was fixed
   in 2000 the MySQL authors simply added a check in the server that the
   response must be 8 chars long. However they forgot to add this check
   to the COM_CHANGE_USER command, too. So it is still possible for an
   attacker with a valid mysql-account to compromise the other accounts
   that are allowed to login from the same host. For a local user this
   means he can break into the mysql root account and so compromise all
   databases. This is especially dangerous in a shared environment or if
   the root user is allowed to login from other hosts than localhost.
   While the attacker can supply a one byte response to break into the
   other accounts he can also send an oversized one. If the response is
   longer than 16 chars the internal created expected answer overflows
   a stack buffer. If the response is long enough it is possible to
   overwrite the saved instruction pointer with bytes that are generated
   by the random number generator of the password verification algorithm.
   While this sounds hard or impossible to exploit, we successfully
   exploited this bug on our linux maschines. Due to the fact that mysql
   restarts on crash you have unlimited tries. Because of the limited
   set of characters generated by the random number generator we strongly
   believe that this bug is not exploitable on Windows, because it
   is not possible to overwrite the instruction pointer with valid
   controllable addresses.

   +++ CLIENT +++ libmysqlclient read_rows Overflow

   When the MySQL client library receives answer rows from the server it
   wants to copy the answers into another buffer. Therefore it loops
   through the returned fields and copies them to the other location.
   This is done without actually checking if the stored field sizes are
   within the destination buffer boundaries. Additionally there is also a
   terminating '\0' added to the end of all fields without checking for
   enough space within the destination buffer. Due to the fact that this
   bug gets already triggered by a simple SELECT query anything that is
   linked against libmysql is potentially vulnerable. Due to the nature
   of this bug it is trivial to use it as denial of service attack against
   the client applications (A negative fieldsize will do the job). If it
   possible to use this overflow to execute code on the client system
   is different from application to application. It depends mainly on the
   fact if malloc() overflows are exploitable on that particular system
   and if the application allows enough control over the heap structure
   by triggering different execution paths.

   +++ CLIENT +++ libmysqlclient read_one_row Byte Overwrittes

   When the MySQL client library fetchs one row from the MySQL server it
   loops through the fields to remember pointers to the field values.
   The field sizes are trusted and not checked against out of boundary
   conditions. After remembering the pointer the previous field gets
   zero terminated. A malformed packet can supply any field size and so
   overwrite some arbitrary memory address with a '\0'. An invalid address
   will of course crash the client. Because the address that is written to
   is arbitrary (maybe hard to supply because it must be supplied as delta)
   all clients that make use of fetching the answer row by row are most
   probably vulnerable to arbitrary code execution exploits.

   Finally it must be mentioned that an attacker can of course use a
   combination of the described attacks to break into a system or to get
   access to privileges he normaly does not own. f.e. it is possible for
   a local user to crash the server with the COM_TABLE_DUMP bug (if he
   cannot takeover the root account with the COM_CHANGE_USER bug) and
   then bind a fake server to the MySQL port 3306. And with a fake server
   he can exploit the libmysqlclient overflow. Another scenario would be
   an attacker that tries to exploit his favourite mod_scripting language
   to takeover the webserver by connecting to an external fake server...

Proof of Concept:

   e-matters is not going to release an exploit for these vulnerabilities
   to the public.

Vendor Response:

   03. December 2002  - Vendor was contacted via email.
   04. December 2002  - Vendor informs me that bugs are fixed and that
                        they started building new packages.
   12. December 2002  - Vendor has released MySQL 3.23.54 which fixes these
                        vulnerabilites.

Recommendation:

   We suggest anyone using MySQL to upgrade to a new or patched version
   as soon as possible.

## SUSE Security

# A Process That Never Ends

### SUSE is committed to delivering best effort security to its customers and to the Open Source community. We believe that trust in Open Source Software security in general, and the user's privacy in particular, are both indispensable and indefeasible.

We treat software security as a process that never ends. This means we:

* Promptly react to security incidents and deliver premium quality security updates
* Continuously improve the security-related functionality in SUSE products
* Continuously contribute to the rapidly growing maturity of Open Source Software
* Respect the Open Source Software security principles of openness, transparency and traceability

Software security is a complex challenge. Software can provide many of its own security features, such as authentication methods, encryption, intrusion prevention and detection, and backup.

At the same time, it can also contain errors (both deliberate and accidental) that can affect the system's security, including design flaws, programming errors, and backdoors.

The SUSE Security Team addresses all of these aspects of software security, on an ongoing basis. Software security cannot be thought of as a state you can achieve at a specific point in time. Instead, it is a process that must be executed with professional expertise and continuous development. This persistent focus is what has given Open Source Software, Linux and SUSE such an excellent reputation for security.

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.
