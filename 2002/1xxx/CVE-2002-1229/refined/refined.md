## Vulnerability Report for CVE-2002-1229

Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**1. Root Cause:**

- Undocumented accounts with default passwords exist in Avaya P550R/P580/P880/P882 switches.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Undocumented Accounts:** The presence of "diag" and "manuf" accounts is not documented.
- **Default Passwords:**  The "diag" account has a default password of "danger", and the "manuf" account has a default password of "xxyyzz".
- **Excessive Privileges:** These accounts ("diag" and "manuf") have "read-write" access-type, which is more privileged than normal administrative access ("admin" access-type).

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Privileged Access:** A remote attacker can gain privileged (developer) access to the switch via telnet or the web interface.
- **Data Manipulation:** An attacker could read and/or write switch data, potentially leading to configuration changes, denial of service, or other malicious activities.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

- **Remote Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via telnet or the web interface.
- **Default Credentials:** Attackers can use the default credentials for the "diag" and "manuf" accounts.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the switch.
- **Knowledge of Default Credentials:** The attacker needs to know the undocumented usernames ("diag", "manuf") and their default passwords ("danger", "xxyyzz").

**Mitigation:**

- Upgrade to software version 5.3.0 or later.
- Disable the "manuf" and "diag" accounts.
- As a temporary workaround, download the configuration file via TFTP, edit out these accounts or change their password hashes, and upload it to the switch.
- Block access to administrative interfaces (telnet, web) at the firewall.
