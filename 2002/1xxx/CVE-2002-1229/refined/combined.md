Undocumented account vulnerability in Avaya P550R/P580/P880/P882 switches

1. Problem Description

Two undocummented accounts with default passwords allow access via telnet
and the web interface to Cajun P550R/P580/P880/P882 switches. Both
accounts give developer access to the switch. The vulnerability can be
avioded by upgrading to software version 5.3.0 or later and disabling the
accounts.

2. Tested systems

The following versions were tested and found vulnerable:

Avaya Cajun P580 software version 5.2.14

All previous software versions are assumed to be vulnerable. This
problem is present in P550R,P580,P880 and P882.

3. Details

The vulnerable firmware installs the following strings into the switch
configuration by default:

username "root" password encrypted-type1 "$tSfIcnbTP.pxRf7BrhGW31"
access-type admin
username "diag" password encrypted-type1 "$PQO.vGxkvDHkEDCJ2YsoD1"
access-type read-write
username "manuf" password encrypted-type1 "$seHFLP9b16m2v/534WCk90"
access-type read-write

The only documented password is for the root user. This user can't
change the diag and manuf accounts.

The un-documented passwords are:

user	password
----	--------
diag	danger
manuf	xxyyzz

Both of these accounts give developer access to the switch (read-write
access-type), which is more priviliged than normal administrative access
(admin access-type).

4. Recommendations

As always it is good administrative practice to block access to
administrative interfaces (telnet, web) at the firewall. Upgrading to
software version 5.3.0 or later and disabling the accounts resolves ths
issue.

As a temporary workaround download the configuration file via tftp, edit
out these accounts, or change their password hashes, and upload it to the
switch.

5. Vendor status

AVAYA was informed on 2 Oct 2002. The vendor responded the same day, proved
responsive and worked promptly on the problem. I have agreed to release the
information after the release of the official AVAYA advisory. The official
Avaya advisory was out on 11 Oct 2002. The fixed software is avaliable from the
Avaya support site <http://support.avaya.com>.

Official AVAYA security advisories are located at

information in this advisory.  The opinions expressed are my own and not

#### Vulnerability Note VU#482241

Original Release Date: 2002-10-18 | Last Revised: 2002-10-18

---

### Overview

Multiple Avaya switches do not adequately protect privileged access.

### Description

| Avaya's P882, P880, P580, and P550R series switches do not adequately protect account access. As a result, a remote attacker can gain access to the switch via http or telnet. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker can gain privileged access to the switch. As a result, an attacker could read and/or write switch data. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Upgrade the switch firmware. |
| --- |

| **Workaround**  If you cannot upgrade the switch firmware as Avaya suggests, you may wish to disable the "manuf" & "diag" accounts on the switch. |
