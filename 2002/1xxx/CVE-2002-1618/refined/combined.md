## HP-UX fails to apply standard UNIX filesystem security measures when using OnLineJFS

#### Vulnerability Note VU#248337

Original Release Date: 2003-06-13 | Last Revised: 2003-06-13

---

### Overview

A vulnerability in [OnlineJFS](http://www.software.hp.com/cgi-bin/swdepot_parser.cgi/cgi/displayProductInfo.pl?productNumber=B3929CA) could allow an intruder to gain greater access than expected.

### Description

| [OnlineJFS](http://www.software.hp.com/cgi-bin/swdepot_parser.cgi/cgi/displayProductInfo.pl?productNumber=B3929CA) "provides the online management of the Journaled File System (JFS), a high-integrity, highly available file system supported by HP-UX."  According to Hewlett-Packard, there is a vulnerability in OnlineJFS 3.1 in which the *sticky bit* does not function properly. The sticky bit is a frequently-implemented but non-standard extension to the standard UNIX permission scheme. The symbolic representation of this bit is **S\_ISVTX,** which is mnemonic for "save text," and the historical meaning of the sticky bit related to keeping executable files in memory for faster activation (the file would *stick* in memory). Many systems that implement sticky bits have abandoned this meaning entirely, although HP-UX retains it The most common modern meaning of sticky bits is in the context of directories. When the sticky bit is set on directories, files in that directory cannot be moved or renamed, except by the owner or superuser, even if the privileges on the file would otherwise permit such modifications. The sticky bit is commonly set on the /tmp directory as a security measure. See for example [VU#10277](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/10277), [VU#426273](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/426273) and the [Unix Security Checklist](http://www.cert.org/tech_tips/usc20_full.html). On HP-UX, the sticky bit has meaning for files, directories, and symbolic links. Furthermore, the sticky bit has meaning when an executable file is loaded remotely. For a description of these different behaviors, see the [comp.sys.hp.hpux FAQ](http://www.faqs.org/faqs/hp/hpux-faq/).  The specific failure of OnlineJFS regarding sticky bits is unknown. It is likely that at least one security impact of this vulnerability is that the sticky bit on directories is ignored, allowing a variety of race conditions to occur, which could subsequently lead to root access. |

 Source: HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY
 SECURITY BULLETIN: HPSBUX0210-223
 Originally issued: 14 Oct 2002
 SSRT2358 Security Vulnerability in OnLineJFS 3.1
 -----------------------------------------------------------------

NOTICE: There are no restrictions for distribution of this Bulletin
provided that it remains complete and intact.

The information in the following Security Bulletin should be
acted upon as soon as possible.  Hewlett-Packard Company will
not be liable for any consequences to any customer resulting
from customer's failure to fully implement instructions in this
Security Bulletin as soon as possible.

 ------------------------------------------------------------------
PROBLEM: OnLineJFS sticky bit does not function properly.

IMPACT:  Standard UNIX filesystem security measures not observed.

PLATFORM: HP9000 Series 700/800 running HP-UX 10.20, and 11.00
          releases.

SOLUTION: Apply appropriate patches:
             PHKL\_24201 for 11.00,
             PHKL\_27832 for 10.20 series 700,
             PHKL\_27833 for 10.20 series 800.

MANUAL ACTIONS: No

AVAILABILITY: Patches are available now on itrc.hp.com.

 ------------------------------------------------------------------
 A. Background
    Hewlett-Packard has discovered that standard UNIX filesystem
    security measures are not being observed on HP-UX releases 10.20
    and 11.00 when the OnLineJFS (product B3929BA) is being used.
    The fileset is JournalFS.VXFS-BASE-KRN.

 B. Recommended solution
    Retrieve and apply the appropriate patches:
             PHKL\_24201 for HP-UX 11.00,
             PHKL\_27832 for HP-UX 10.20 series 700,
             PHKL\_27833 for HP-UX 10.20 series 800.

    Note: - A reboot will be required.
          - HP-UX 10.24 (VVOS) is not affected.
          - Though the 11.00 patch has been superseded, this listed
            patch is first available solution to the security problem
            any newer superseded patches address this issue as well.

    To determine if you are running OnLineJFS, run:
    /usr/sbin/swlist -l fileset JournalFS.VXFS-BASE-KRN
