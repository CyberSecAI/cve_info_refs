Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how Microsoft IIS handles HTTP requests with a blank "Host" header. When such a request is received, the server sometimes includes its internal IP address in the response. This behavior occurs in responses to certain WebDAV methods or when Basic authentication is enabled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the disclosure of the server's internal IP address. This is considered sensitive information that could aid attackers in reconnaissance and further attacks.
- **WebDAV Methods:** The use of WebDAV methods like `PROPFIND`, `WRITE`, and `MKCOL` can lead to the disclosure of internal IP addresses in specific parts of the response, like the `HREF` property or `Location` header.
- **Basic Authentication:** The issue is also present when Basic authentication is enabled.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Reconnaissance:** The disclosed internal IP address provides attackers with a piece of information about the internal network configuration, which could be useful for identifying internal targets and planning further attacks. This is particularly relevant when the IIS server is behind Network Address Translation (NAT).
- **Aid in Further Attacks:** While the vulnerability does not directly allow for server compromise, it provides a starting point for potential further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malformed HTTP Requests:** Sending HTTP requests to the web service with a blank "Host" header is the main attack vector. Specifically, the following methods can be used to trigger the vulnerability:
  - `PROPFIND` requests.
  - `WRITE` requests.
  - `MKCOL` requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable IIS server.
- **Basic Understanding of HTTP:** The attacker needs to craft HTTP requests, specifically those with a blank Host header and using the methods mentioned above.

**Affected Systems:**
- Microsoft IIS 4, 5, and 5.1
- Windows NT, 2000, and XP
