- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The web server fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input by not filtering out "../" sequences within HTTP requests.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Path traversal vulnerability. The lack of proper input validation allows attackers to bypass directory restrictions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can view the contents of arbitrary files on the server's filesystem.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted HTTP request with "../" sequences in the URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server. No specific local access is required.
