- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the BioLogon 3 software's GINA (Graphical Identification and Authentication) component. It allows bypassing the intended three-factor authentication (Fingerprint, Smart Card, Password).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The "More" option within the GINA, specifically, the ability to access "Configure / Sounds" in XP or similar menus in NT, allows for launching a "Browse" dialog that grants system-level explorer access.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with physical access can gain system-level privileges without proper authentication. This allows them to obtain, alter, remove data, or install backdoors.
- **Attack vectors:** Physical access to a workstation or laptop running the vulnerable software.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs physical access to the machine. They do not need to be authenticated. The attacker is expected to have a basic understanding of Windows GUI interaction.
