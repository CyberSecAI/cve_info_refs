## ISC DHCPD contains format string vulnerability when logging DNS-update requests

#### Vulnerability Note VU#854315

Original Release Date: 2002-05-08 | Last Revised: 2003-01-13

---

### Overview

The DHCP daemon (DHCPD) is a server that is used to allocate network addresses and assign configuration parameters to dynamically configured hosts. A format string vulnerability may permit an intruder to execute code with the privileges of the DHCP daemon (typically root).

### Description

| The [Internet Software Consortium (ISC)](http://www.isc.org/) produces a [DHCP server](http://www.isc.org/products/DHCP/). DHCPD listens for requests from client machines connecting to the network. Versions 3 to 3.0.1rc8 inclusive of DHCPD contain an option (NSUPDATE) that is compiled in by default. NSUPDATE allows the DHCP server to send an update to the DNS server after processing a DHCP request. The DNS server responds by sending a message back to the DHCP server. The response from the DNS server can contain user-supplied data. When this message is received, the DHCP server logs the transaction. A format string vulnerability exists in the DHCPD code that logs the transaction. This vulnerability may permit an attacker to execute code with the privileges of the DHCP daemon. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker can execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable host with the privileges of the DHCP server (DHCPD), typically root. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Obtain a patch from vendor. |
| --- |

| If you cannot upgrade, apply the following patch.  **--- common/print.c Tue Apr 9 13:41:17 2002+++ common/print.c.patched Tue Apr 9 13:41:56 2002@@ -1366,8 +1366,8 @@ \*s++ = '.'; \*s++ = 0; if (errorp)- log\_error (obuf);+ log\_error ("%s",obuf); else- log\_info (obuf);+ log\_info ("%s",obuf); } #endif /\* NSUPDATE \*/** |

### [Alcatel](#IAFY-59WNCC) Affected

Notified:  May 07, 2002  Updated: May 29, 2002

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

Following the recent CERT advisory on security vulnerabilities in the ISC DHCP implementation, Alcatel has conducted an immediate assessment to determine any impact this may have on our portfolio. A first analysis has shown that only one customer-specific product was affected. Alcatel is working with that customer on a solution. The security of our customers' networks is of highest priority for Alcatel. Therefore we continue to test our product portfolio against potential ISC DHCP security vulnerabilities and will provide updates if necessary.

## History

The CERT Division is the birthplace of cybersecurity. For nearly 30 years, the CERT Division of the SEI has partnered with government, industry, law enforcement, and academia to advance cybersecurity and improve the security and resilience of computer systems and networks.

Originally focused on incident response, we have expanded into cybersecurity areas such as network situational awareness, malicious code analysis, secure coding, resilience management, insider threats, digital investigations and intelligence, workforce development, DevOps, forensics, software assurance, vulnerability discovery and analysis, and risk management.

## Former Director Richard Pethia

[Richard Pethia](/about/leadership/display.cfm?customel_datapageid_2623=3545) was founding director of the SEI's CERT Division. Pethia, who served as director of CERT from 1988 to 2016, guided the organization through tremendous growth and change. Under Pethia's leadership, the unit expanded and evolved from the CERT Coordination Center—a small group focused on computer incident response—to a research organization of more than 200 professionals dedicated to solving problems with widespread cybersecurity implications.
