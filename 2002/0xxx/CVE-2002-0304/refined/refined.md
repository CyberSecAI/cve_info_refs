Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The LilHTTP web server version 2.1 improperly handles path traversal sequences (specifically, "./") in web requests. This allows attackers to bypass intended access restrictions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The server fails to properly sanitize or validate the requested file paths, allowing the use of relative path specifiers ("./") to navigate outside the intended web root directory.
*   **Bypassed Access Controls:**  Password protection on files/folders is rendered ineffective due to the path traversal vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized File Disclosure:** Attackers can access and read the contents of files and folders that are supposed to be protected, potentially exposing sensitive information like configuration files, user data, or other confidential resources.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** Attackers craft a specific HTTP request containing path traversal sequences to request the protected files.
*   **Example URL:**  `http://host/./protectedfolder/protectedfile.htm`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the web server to send the malicious HTTP requests.
*   **No Authentication:** The vulnerability does not require any prior authentication.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability was confirmed in LilHTTP Server v2.1. Other versions may also be affected.
*   The issue is fixed in v2.2, which is available for download at <http://www.summitcn.com/downloads/lilhtv22.zip>.
