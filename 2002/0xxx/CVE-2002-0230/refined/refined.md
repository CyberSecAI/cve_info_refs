Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in the context of CVE-2002-0230:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of input sanitization in the `cmd` parameter of the `fom.cgi` script in Faq-O-Matic. Specifically, the script does not properly remove or encode special characters like `<` and `>`, allowing for the injection of arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary weakness is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the web application, which will then be executed in the browsers of users who access the crafted link.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** An attacker can execute JavaScript code in the context of the vulnerable website, allowing them to potentially steal cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other actions on behalf of the victim.
*   **Cookie theft:** The attacker can steal cookies from logged-in users (including moderators and administrators) using JavaScript.
*   **Phishing:** Attackers can redirect users to a fake website that is made to look like the original, for example to steal credentials.
*   **Defacement:** The attacker can change the appearance of the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through a specially crafted URL that includes malicious JavaScript code in the `cmd` parameter of the `fom.cgi` script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote Access:** The attacker can trigger this vulnerability remotely via the web.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker typically needs to trick the victim into clicking the crafted link, often delivered via email or other communication channels.

**Additional details:**
*   The vulnerability was tested on Faq-O-Matic version 2.712.
*   The vendor confirmed the vulnerability and has provided a fix in CVS.
*   The vulnerability can be mitigated by sanitizing the input, specifically encoding special HTML characters. Disabling active scripting on the client side also reduces the risk.
