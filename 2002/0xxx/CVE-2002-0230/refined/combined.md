TITLE: Faq-O-Matic Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability
-----

discovery date: February 1st, 2002
--------------

publication date: February 4th, 2002
----------------

impact: low-to-low-medium
------

local: no way!
-----

remote: yes!
------

introduction:
------------

This is a great little product for managing a bunch of FAQs. It allows people who \
visit the site to maintain the FAQ by adding new questions and answers and stuff like \
that. It has quite a pleasing colour scheme. Also the name of the product has some \
real pep, it reminds me of a vacuum cleaner. Vrooooooom! Though it is obvious by the \
motif of the Faq-O-Matic website that they are aiming for more of a food processor \
feel.

Check it out here:

<http://faqomatic.sourceforge.net/fom-serve/cache/1.html>

Faq-O-Matic is open-source. It appears to be quite popular. Additionally, a huge body \
of people have contributed to it.

Faq-O-Matic 2.712 was the version I tested. At the time of writing, this is the most \
recent stable version of the software.

The vendor's personal page has a wonderful picture of a sassy-looking green cat:

[http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~jonh/whome2/image=L500dejo.html](http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~jonh/whome2/image%3DL500dejo.html)

background:
----------

Faq-O-Matic has some cross-site scripting problems.

Cross-Site Scripting, in short, is a type of problem that allows a malicious person \
to make a nice person run some JavaScript in their browser. The JavaScript is \
executed on the victim and is in the context of the super website running Faq-O-Matic \
Frequently Asked Question manager.

For more information on cross-site scripting, check it here:

<http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2000-02.html>

<http://httpd.apache.org/info/css-security/>

I just picked this program at random because I liked the peppy name. It turns out \
there was a very recent discussion on the Faq-O-Matic mailing list about the \
possibility of CSS bugs. So this is pretty timely.

details:
-------

You can reproduce this condition with the following example:

<http://faqomaticsite/cgi-bin/fom/fom.cgi?cmd=><script>alert("superpetz")</script>&file=1&keywords=superpetz

This causes an alert box which says "superpetz". Underneath the alert box is an error \
page which indicates that the user attempted an unknown command. The problem is that \
the "cmd=" parameter does not get rid of "<" or ">" type stuff.
With some tweaking you can steal some cookies from one of the Faq-O-Matic moderators \
or the admin. You just need to send the link with the script code for stealing the \
cookies in a HTML e-mail to your victim. Then voila!, you can make your own special \
FAQs about different types of vacuum cleaners. Of course, another thing that a \
malicious guy may do for fun is to create an alert message that says "Click here to \
visit our new fantabulous FAQ Warehouse", and then send the victim of the attack to a \
site like this:

<http://www.wa4dsy.net/robot/Rally2000/jpeg500/vacomatic.jpeg>
[http://film.guardian.co.uk/gallery/image/0,8545,-10204337732,00.html](http://film.guardian.co.uk/gallery/image/0%2C8545%2C-10204337732%2C00.html)
<http://www.rcba.org/allvac/>

Then the victim is like, oh no, now my favorite FAQ Warehouse is taken over by the \
vacuum emporium!

Of course, a really malicious guy will probably just make it connect to porno site or \
something like Aryan Nations site.

Ironically, when I was playing with this, I got an error message to the admin mailbox \
which contained the un-sanitized script code.

workarounds/solutions:
---------------------

Let it be known that superpetz is not a super smart guy. I wrote the vendor and he \
gives some information for a fix. The first time I read his response I totally \
glossed over this information and then I sent him a reply that said something like: \
"OKAY JERKFACE!!!! WHEN ARE YA GONNA FIX THIS STUFFZ??". But then I realize that \
there is fix information in the vendor response, and so I lose much face because of \
this. He just says that the output can be "entified", which should be easy enough to \
accomplish for an open-source code monkey who likes to tinker with such stuff.

Of course, if you really wanna be on the safe side, you can just disable active \
scripting in your browser. This cross-site scripting stuff is quite prevalent in CGI \
programs.

You should probably be smart and use an e-mail client that allows you to not accept \
HTML e-mail, because that is one of the more popular attack vectors for this type of \
stuff!!!

vendor response:
---------------

The vendor guy confirmed this bug in Vac... err Faq-O-Matic. He says I have a nice \
tuque, but my tuque got stolen by some

college students. The response was pretty quick and he only has nice stuff to say.

terms of vulnerability disclosure:
---------------------------------

This guy was pretty forthright and co-operative, even if he does uses terms I don't \
understand like "a gimmie". He just said

something like "Yeah, this is an issue, easy to fix, thanks for pointing it out!". \
Seems like it is okay to go public with

it.

This really ain't no rocket math. Just take what you want and copy and bastardize it \
to your heart's delight.

Hey BugTraq dudes,

The Faq-O-Matic vendor has intimated to me that there is a fix available in CVS. \
There should be a tarball available shortly, as soon as it is confirmed that the fix \
properly address various permutations of SUPERPETZ Faq-O-Matic Cross-Site Scripting \
vulnerability.

Check out the cool robots that the vendor has built:

<http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~jonh/robots/>

Including a robot vacuum cleaner! Vrooom!
