{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow when handling the number of responses during challenge response authentication in OpenSSH. Additionally, a buffer overflow exists related to the number of responses in PAM modules using interactive keyboard authentication.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow in handling the number of responses during challenge response authentication.",
      "Buffer overflow involving the number of responses received during challenge response authentication (PAM modules)."
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the sshd daemon (often root), potentially leading to a complete compromise of the system or a denial-of-service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a specially crafted reply during challenge response authentication (SKEY or BSD_AUTH).",
      "Exploiting PAM modules with interactive keyboard authentication."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable SSH server. For the challenge response vulnerability to be exploitable, the ChallengeResponseAuthentication option must be enabled and the system must be using SKEY or BSD_AUTH. For the PAM vulnerability, the PAMAuthenticationViaKbdInt option must be enabled."
  },
  "affected_versions": "OpenSSH versions 2.3.1p1 through 3.3 are affected. OpenSSH 3.4 and later are not affected. Specifically, versions between 2.9.9 and 3.3 contain the bug in ChallengeResponseAuthentication code, and all versions between 2.3.1 and 3.3 have the PAMAuthenticationViaKbdInt bug.",
  "additional_info": "The vulnerability is present only in version 2 of the SSH protocol. The advisory also mentions that OpenSSH 3.2 and later prevent privilege escalation if UsePrivilegeSeparation is enabled in sshd_config, and OpenSSH 3.3 enables UsePrivilegeSeparation by default. It is recommended to upgrade to OpenSSH 3.4 as it includes additional checks for potential bugs."
