1. Versions affected:

        All versions of OpenSSH's sshd between 2.9.9 and 3.3
        contain an input validation error that can result in
        an integer overflow and privilege escalation.

        OpenSSH 3.4 and later are not affected.

        OpenSSH 3.2 and later prevent privilege escalation
        if UsePrivilegeSeparation is enabled in sshd_config.
        OpenSSH 3.3 enables UsePrivilegeSeparation by
        default.

        Although OpenSSH 2.9 and earlier are not affected
        upgrading to OpenSSH 3.4 is recommended, because
        OpenSSH 3.4 adds checks for a class of potential bugs.

2. Impact:

        This bug can be exploited remotely if
        ChallengeResponseAuthentication is enabled in sshd_config.

	Affected are at least systems supporting
	s/key over SSH protocol version 2 (OpenBSD, FreeBSD
	and NetBSD as well as other systems supporting
	s/key with SSH).  Exploitablitly of systems
	using PAM in combination has not been verified.

3. Short-Term Solution:

        Disable ChallengeResponseAuthentication in sshd_config.

	or

        Enable UsePrivilegeSeparation in sshd_config.

4. Solution:

	Upgrade to OpenSSH 3.4 or apply the following patches.

5. Credits:

	ISS.

## OpenSSH vulnerabilities in challenge response handling

#### Vulnerability Note VU#369347

Original Release Date: 2002-06-26 | Last Revised: 2002-12-06

---

### Overview

There are two related vulnerabilities in the challenge response handling code in OpenSSH versions 2.3.1p1 through 3.3. They may allow a remote intruder to execute arbitrary code as the user running sshd (often root). The first vulnerability affects OpenSSH versions 2.9.9 through 3.3 that have the challenge response option enabled and that use SKEY or BSD\_AUTH authentication. The second vulnerability affects PAM modules using interactive keyboard authentication in OpenSSH versions 2.3.1p1 through 3.3, regardless of the challenge response option setting. Additionally, a number of other possible security problems have been corrected in OpenSSH version 3.4.

### Description

| Two related vulnerabilities have been found in the handling of challenge responses in OpenSSH.  The first vulnerability is an integer overflow in the handling of the number of responses received during challenge response authentication. If the challenge response configuration option is set to yes and the system is using SKEY or BSD\_AUTH authentication then a remote intruder may be able to exploit the vulnerability to execute arbitrary code. This vulnerability is present in versions of OpenSSH 2.9.9 through 3.3. An exploit for this vulnerability is reported to exist. This vulnerability is partially described in a recent ISS security advisory available at<http://bvlive01.iss.net/issEn/delivery/xforce/alertdetail.jsp?oid=20584>The second vulnerability is a buffer overflow involving the number of responses received during challenge response authentication. Regardless of the setting of the challenge response configuration option, systems using PAM modules that use interactive keyboard authentication (PAMAuthenticationViaKbdInt), may be vulnerable to the remote execution of code. At this time, it is not known if this vulnerability is exploitable. Both vulnerabilities are corrected by the patches in a recent OpenSSH security advisory available from<http://www.openssh.com/txt/preauth.adv>Both vulnerabilities exploit features present only in version 2 of the SSH protocol. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker can execute code with the privileges of the user running the sshd (often root). These vulnerabilities may also be used to cause a denial-of-service condition. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade to OpenSSH version 3.4**These vulnerabilities are eliminated by upgrading to OpenSSH version 3.4, which is available from the OpenSSH web site at<http://www.openssh.com/>OpenSSH version 3.4 will correct several other software defects with potential security implications not described in this advisory.**Apply a patch from your vendor**A patch for this problem is included in the OpenSSH advisory at<http://www.openssh.com/txt/preauth.adv>This patch may be manually installed with minor changes to correct these vulnerabilities in all affected versions of OpenSSH. Please note that applying the patches described in the OpenSSH advisory does not correct the other software defects with potential security implications not described in this advisory.If your vendor has provided a patch to correct these vulnerabilities, you may want to apply their patch rather than upgrading your version of sshd. System administrators may want to confirm whether their vendor's patch includes the other possible vulnerabilities corrected in OpenSSH 3.4. More information about vendor-specific patches can be found in the vendor section of this document. Because the publication of this advisory was unexpectedly accelerated, statements from all of the affected vendors were not available at publication time. We will update this document as vendorsprovide additional information. |
| --- |

| **Disable SSH protocol version 2**Since both vulnerabilities are present only in protocol version 2 features, disabling version 2 of the protocol will prevent both vulnerabilities from being exploited. Typically, this is accomplished by adding the following line to /etc/ssh/sshd\_config:Protocol 1This option may set to "2,1" by default. System administrators should be aware that disabling protocol version 2 may prevent the sshd daemon from accepting connections in certain configurations. Applying one or both of the configuration changes described below may be a less disruptive workaround for this problem.**Disable challenge response authentication**For OpenSSH versions greater than 2.9, system administrators can disable the vulnerable portion of the code by setting the "ChallengeResponseAuthentication" configuration option to "no" in their sshd configuration file. Typically, this is accomplished by adding the following line to /etc/ssh/sshd\_config:ChallengeResponseAuthentication noThis option may be enabled (set to "yes") by default. This workaround should prevent the first vulnerability from being exploited if SKEY or BSD\_AUTH authentication is used. It will **not** prevent the possible exploitation of the vulnerability via PAM interactive keyboard authentication.**Disable PAM authentication via interactive keyboard**For OpenSSH versions greater than 2.9, system administrators can disable the vulnerable portion of the code affecting the PAM authentication issue by setting the "PAMAuthenticationViaKbdInt" configuration option to "no" in their sshd configuration file. Typically, this is accomplished by adding the following line to /etc/ssh/sshd\_config:PAMAuthenticationViaKbdInt noThis option may be disabled (set to "no") by default. This workaround should prevent the second vulnerability from being exploited if PAM interactive keyboard authentication is used. It will **not** prevent the possible exploitation of the vulnerability via SKEY or BSD\_AUTH authentication.**Disable both options in older versions of OpenSSH**For OpenSSH versions between 2.3.1p1 and 2.9, system adminstrators will instead need to set the following options in their ssh configuration file:KbdInteractiveAuthentication noChallengeResponseAuthentication noSetting both of these options is believed to prevent the exploitation of the vulnerabilities regardless of which authentication mechanisms are used.**Use privilege separation to minimize impact**System administrators running OpenSSH versions 3.2 or 3.3 may be able to reduce the impact of this vulnerability by enabling the "UsePrivilegeSeparation" configuration option in their sshd configuration file. Typically, this is accomplished by adding the following line to /etc/ssh/sshd\_config:UsePrivilegeSeparation yesThis workaround does **not** prevent these vulnerabilities from being exploited, however due to the privilege separation mechanism, the intruder may be limited to a constrained chroot environment with restricted privileges. This workaround will not prevent these vulnerabilities from creating a denial-of-service condition. Not all operating system vendors have implemented the privilege separation code, and on some operating systems, it may limit the functionality of OpenSSH. System administrators are encouraged to carefully review the implications of using the workaround in their environment, and use a more comprehensive solution if one is available. The use of privilege separation to limit the impact of future vulnerabilities is encouraged. |

### [Red Hat Inc.](#CFCN-5BFKWY) Affected

Notified:  June 25, 2002  Updated: November 27, 2002

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

Red Hat Linux versions 7, 7.1, 7.2 and 7.3 as well as Red Hat Linux Advanced Server version 2.1 ship with OpenSSH. The Red Hat Linux OpenSSH packages were not compiled with either BSD\_AUTH or SKEY enabled, therefore in order to be vulnerable to this issue a user would need to have enabled the configuration option "PAMAuthenticationViaKbdInt" in their sshd configuration file (the default is disabled).

We are continuing to investigate this vulnerability and will release updated packages where appropriate.

### Vendor Information

The vendor has not provided us with any further information regarding this vulnerability.

### Addendum

RedHat has published a security advisory on this issue:

### [SuSE Inc.](#CFCN-5BFL28) Affected

Notified:  June 25, 2002  Updated: June 27, 2002

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

[F]urther details about the bugs in question have turned up by now, indicating that SuSE Linux products are not affected to the mentioned problem unless the administrator of an openssh installation has actively added the configuration option (PAMAuthenticationViaKbdInt) to the daemon configuration file /etc/ssh/sshd\_config to turn this option on. In other words: We are not vulnerable by default.

We have quickly published update packages with the workaround as described in your announcement, but due to incompatibilities and errors in the newer package, we think about downgrading back to our 2.9.9p2 version packages as well as one newer version on one of our newer products. The decision about the downgrade has not been made yet, but we are positive about that we will publish another set of update packages that effectively remove the weakness from the package. After all, the currently offered packages for download from our ftp server (ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/suse/i386/update/) represent an emergency fix that should be considered incomplete considering the quality standards at SuSE.

### Vendor Information

The vendor has not provided us with any further information regarding this vulnerability.

### Addendum

Since the SuSE Linux distributions of OpenSSH is not vulnerable by default, sites with PAMAuthenticationViaKbdInt enabled are encouraged to turn it off until final complete packages are availlable.

If you have feedback, comments, or additional information about this vulnerability, please send us email.

### [Sun Microsystems Inc.](#CFCN-5BFKXU) Affected

Notified:  June 25, 2002  Updated: July 08, 2002

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

The version of OpenSSH that is in Solaris 9 is not believed to be vulnerable if the default configuration is used. If sshd\_config(4) has been updated so that BOTH of the following entries are present then it is vulnerable.

PAMAuthenticationViaKBDInt yes
KbdInteractiveAuthentication yes

Note that in the default sshd\_config(4) PAMAuthenticationViaKBDInt is listed but KbdInteractiveAuthentication is not (the compiled in default for KbdInteractiveAuthentication is no).

Sun is in the process of producing a patch for Solaris 9. Older Solaris releases are not vulnerable since they do not include OpenSSH as part of the Solaris distribution - hosts that added OpenSSH as part of their own site configurations should check the official OpenSSH advisory for details.

The patch that Sun produces to fix this issue will not contain the new OpenSSH Privsep support as it is not yet stable enough on Solaris due to interactions with PAM and BSM auditing, this may appear in a future release - Sun is working with the OpenSSH developers on the PAM problems and once a working OpenSSH with PAM and BSM is available we will re-evaluate our position on Privsep.

Sun will publish a Sun Security Bulletin and a Sun Alert for this issue. The Sun Alert will be available from:

<http://sunsolve.sun.com>

The patch will be available from:

<http://sunsolve.sun.com/securitypatch>

Sun Security Bulletins are available from:

### [The SCO Group (SCO Linux)](#IAFY-5BFJ3F) Affected

Notified:  June 25, 2002  Updated: June 27, 2002

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

Caldera OpenLinux OpenSSH has neither the S/KEY nor BSD Auth features compiled in, so it is not vulnerable to the Challenge/Response vulnerability. We do have the ChallengeResponseAuthentication option on by default, however, so to be safe, we recommend that the option be disabled in the sshd\_config file.

In addition, the sshd\_config PAMAuthenticationViaKbdInt option is off by default, so OpenLinux is not vulnerable to the other alleged vulnerability in a default configuration, either. However, Caldera recommends that this option be disabled if it has been enabled by the system administrator.

### Vendor Information

The vendor has not provided us with any further information regarding this vulnerability.

### Addendum

Caldera has published an advisory

ftp://ftp.caldera.com/pub/security/OpenLinux/CSSA-2002-030.0.txt

### Vendor Statement

At this time, SGI does not ship OpenSSH as a part of IRIX.

The OpenSSH privilege separation code mostly works with IRIX, but it uses a flag to mmap that isn't in IRIX (MAP\_ANON) for compression so you can't have both on at the same time. IRIX doesn't ship with PAM so a lot of the PAM issues aren't issues for us.

## Former Director Richard Pethia

[Richard Pethia](/about/leadership/display.cfm?customel_datapageid_2623=3545) was founding director of the SEI's CERT Division. Pethia, who served as director of CERT from 1988 to 2016, guided the organization through tremendous growth and change. Under Pethia's leadership, the unit expanded and evolved from the CERT Coordination Center—a small group focused on computer incident response—to a research organization of more than 200 professionals dedicated to solving problems with widespread cybersecurity implications.

Subject:    [Revised OpenSSH Security Advisory (adv.iss)](?t=102511868400005&r=1&w=2)
From:       [Markus Friedl <markus () openbsd ! org>](?a=93911306800001&r=1&w=2)
Date:       [2002-06-26 19:08:10](?l=bugtraq&r=1&w=2&b=200206)
[Download RAW [message](?l=bugtraq&m=102514631524575&q=mbox) or [body](?l=bugtraq&m=102514631524575&q=raw)]

This is the 2nd revision of the Advisory.

1. Versions affected:

        Serveral versions of OpenSSH's sshd between 2.3.1 and 3.3
        contain an input validation error that can result in an
        integer overflow and privilege escalation.

        All versions between 2.3.1 and 3.3 contain a bug in the
        PAMAuthenticationViaKbdInt code.

        All versions between 2.9.9 and 3.3 contain a bug in the
        ChallengeResponseAuthentication code.

        OpenSSH 3.4 and later are not affected.

        OpenSSH 3.2 and later prevent privilege escalation if
        UsePrivilegeSeparation is enabled in sshd_config.  OpenSSH
        3.3 enables UsePrivilegeSeparation by default.

        Although some earlier versions are not affected upgrading
        to OpenSSH 3.4 is recommended, because OpenSSH 3.4 adds
        checks for a class of potential bugs.

2. Impact:

        This bug can be exploited remotely if
		ChallengeResponseAuthentication
	is enabled in sshd_config.

        Affected are at least systems supporting s/key over
        SSH protocol version 2 (OpenBSD, FreeBSD and NetBSD
        as well as other systems supporting s/key with SSH).
        Exploitablitly of systems using
		PAMAuthenticationViaKbdInt
	has not been verified.

3. Short-Term Solution:

        Disable ChallengeResponseAuthentication in sshd_config.

	and

	Disable PAMAuthenticationViaKbdInt in sshd_config.

	Alternatively you can prevent privilege escalation
	if you enable UsePrivilegeSeparation in sshd_config.

4. Solution:

	Upgrade to OpenSSH 3.4 or apply the following patches.

5. Credits:

# OpenSSH Remote Challenge Vulnerability

```

	Internet Security Systems Security Advisory
June 26, 2002

OpenSSH Remote Challenge Vulnerability

Synopsis:

ISS X-Force has discovered a serious vulnerability in the default
installation of OpenSSH on the OpenBSD operating system. OpenSSH is a
free version of the SSH (Secure Shell) communications suite and is used
as a secure replacement for protocols such as Telnet, Rlogin, Rsh, and
Ftp. OpenSSH employs end-to-end encryption (including all passwords) and
is resistant to network monitoring, eavesdropping, and connection
hijacking attacks. X-Force is aware of active exploit development for
this vulnerability.

Impact:

OpenBSD, FreeBSD-Current, and other OpenSSH implementations may be
vulnerable to a remote, superuser compromise.

Affected Versions:

OpenBSD 3.0
OpenBSD 3.1
FreeBSD-Current
OpenSSH 3.0-3.2.3

OpenSSH version 3.3 implements "privilege separation" which mitigates
the risk of a superuser compromise. Prior to the release of this
advisory, ISS and OpenBSD encouraged all OpenSSH users to upgrade to
version 3.3. Versions of FreeBSD-Current built between March 18, 2002
and June 23, 2002 are vulnerable to remote superuser compromise.
Privilege separation was implemented in FreeBSD-Current on June 23,
2002.

Note: OpenSSH is included in many operating system distributions,
networking equipment, and security appliances. Refer to the following
address for information about vendors that implement OpenSSH:
http://www.openssh.com/users.html

Description:

A vulnerability exists within the "challenge-response" authentication
mechanism in the OpenSSH daemon (sshd). This mechanism, part of the SSH2
protocol, verifies a user's identity by generating a challenge and
forcing the user to supply a number of responses. It is possible for a
remote attacker to send a specially-crafted reply that triggers an
overflow. This can result in a remote denial of service attack on the
OpenSSH daemon or a complete remote compromise. The OpenSSH daemon runs
with superuser privilege, so remote attackers can gain superuser access
by exploiting this vulnerability.

OpenSSH supports the SKEY and BSD_AUTH authentication options. These are
compile-time options. At least one of these options must be enabled
before the OpenSSH binaries are compiled for the vulnerable condition to
be present. OpenBSD 3.0 and later is distributed with BSD_AUTH enabled.
The SKEY and BSD_AUTH options are not enabled by default in many
distributions. However, if these options are explicitly enabled, that
build of OpenSSH may be vulnerable.

Recommendations:

Internet Scanner X-Press Update 6.13 includes a check, OpenSshRunning,
to detect potentially vulnerable installations of OpenSSH. XPU 6.13 is
available from the ISS Download Center at: http://www.iss.net/download.
For questions about downloading and installing this XPU, email
support@iss.net.

ISS X-Force recommends that system administrators disable unused OpenSSH
authentication mechanisms. Administrators can remove this vulnerability
by disabling the Challenge-Response authentication parameter within the
OpenSSH daemon configuration file. This filename and path is typically:
/etc/ssh/sshd_config. To disable this parameter, locate the
corresponding line and change it to the line below:

ChallengeResponseAuthentication no

The "sshd" process must be restarted for this change to take effect.
This workaround will permanently remove the vulnerability. X-Force
recommends that administrators upgrade to OpenSSH version 3.4
immediately. This version implements privilege separation, contains a
patch to block this vulnerability, and contains many additional pro-
active security fixes. Privilege separation was designed to limit
exposure to known and unknown vulnerabilities. Visit
http://www.openssh.com for more information.

Additional Information:

http://www.iss.net/security_center/static/9169.php

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the
name CAN-2002-0390 to this issue. This is a candidate for inclusion in
the CVE list (http://cve.mitre.org), which standardizes names for
security problems.

ISS X-Force and Black Hat consulting will host a presentation titled,
"Professional Source Code Auditing" at Black Hat Briefings USA 2002. The
presentation will explore advanced source code auditing techniques as
well as secure development best-practices. Please refer to
