The provided content describes a vulnerability in Bugzilla's `doeditvotes.cgi` script.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The script fails to properly handle cases where the `$who` variable is undefined, leading to an attempt to use this undefined variable in a URL within an error message.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-   **Unsanitized user input:** The code directly uses the `$who` variable, which can be influenced by user input through cookies, without proper sanitization or validation. This can lead to the inclusion of arbitrary, potentially malicious, data in the generated HTML.
-   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) potential:** Although not directly stated, the vulnerability could be exploited if a crafted value for `$who` is used, which can cause a broken link, but it could be extended to cause XSS if the vulnerability is not patched.
-   **Broken links:** The primary impact of this issue is the creation of a broken link, as the `$who` variable is used in the `href` attribute without being checked for validity or being escaped to be used as part of the URL.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-   **Error messages with broken links:** The immediate impact is that users receive error messages containing broken or malformed links which can be confusing to the user.
-   **Potential for XSS (if a crafted `$who` value was provided):** An attacker could, in theory, inject malicious scripts through a carefully crafted `$who` value (though it is not confirmed in the provided content).

**Attack vectors:**
-   An attacker could potentially manipulate the `$who` value using cookies to inject a malicious script. This is not confirmed but is a potential outcome of this vulnerability if the value of the `$who` variable was not properly sanitized.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-   The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the user's cookie values, specifically the `Bugzilla_login` cookie.
