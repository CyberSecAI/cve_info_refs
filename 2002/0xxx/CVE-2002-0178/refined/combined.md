## Uudecode performs inadequate checks on user-specified output files

#### Vulnerability Note VU#336083

Original Release Date: 2002-07-15 | Last Revised: 2002-12-13

---

### Overview

The uudecode utility contains a vulnerability that allows an attacker to overwrite arbitrary files, symbolic links, and named pipes.

### Description

| The uudecode utility is used to decode files that have been encoded in the 7-bit printable format generated by uuencode. This format allows for the specification of a desired output file name, which may also contain an absolute or relative path. Some implementations of uudecode fail to check the specified file name or its type before writing, so it is possible for uudecode to overwrite existing files, including regular files, symbolic links, and named pipes.  If an attacker can convince a user to invoke uudecode on a malicious file without reviewing the included file name, the attacker can cause the user to overwrite any file accessible by the user. If the victim user has root privileges, the attacker can exploit this vulnerability to overwrite arbitrary files. With respect to symbolic links and named pipes, attackers who exploit this vulnerability can alter the normal operation of system scripts and running processes, significantly increasing the risk of system compromise.This vulnerability was first discovered in the uudecode implementation included with the GNU Sharutils package, but may be present in other implementations as well. For more information on GNU Sharutils, please see <http://www.gnu.org/directory/sharutils.html>. |
| --- |

### Impact

| Attackers can convince users to overwrite arbitrary files, symbolic links, and named pipes. This ability can be leveraged to gather information, destroy system and user data, and gain control of vulnerable hosts. |

### Solution

| **Apply a patch from your vendor**Please see the vendor section of this document for information on obtaining patches. |

### [Cray Inc.](#JPLA-5C4JW8) Affected

Notified:  July 15, 2002  Updated: August 19, 2002

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

Cray, Inc. is vulnerable however it is by design and will remain that way to maintain POSIX compliancy. According to the POSIX standards for uudecode:

"If the pathname of the file to be produced exists, and the user does not have write permission on the file, uudecode will terminate with an error. If the pathname of the file to be produced exists, and the user has write permission on that file, the existing file will be overwritten."

So, if a user has root write permission then yes they can overwrite a file using uudecode (or cat, or other various unix commands).

### Vendor Information

The vendor has not provided us with any further information regarding this vulnerability.

The CERT/CC has no additional comments at this time.

SSRT2301 uudecode  (Severity - Medium)

  A potential security vulnerability has been discovered
  in the HP Tru64 UNIX operating system, where under certain
  circumstances, system integrity may be compromised through
  improper file access (overwriting files). This potential
  vulnerability may be in the form a local security domain
  risk.

RESOLUTION

  Early Release Patches (ERPs) are now available for all

  dupatch to install and will not  install over any
  Customer Specific Patches (CSPs) which have file
  intersections with the ERPs. Contact your normal support
  channel and request HP Tru64 services elevate a case to
  Support Engineering if a CSP must be merged with one of
  the ERPs.  Please review the README file for each patch
  prior to installation.

Notified:  July 15, 2002  Updated: July 22, 2002

### Status

Unknown

### Vendor Statement

The SuSE security team has been aware of this issue for several years. We would like to point out that not overwriting existing files is not sufficient protection, as an attacker may also gain access by creating files that were not there previously (e.g. many people don't have ~/.shosts or ~/.ssh/authorized\_keys2).

The best solution in our opinion is to make sure that all mail user agents etc always invoke uudecode with a filename argument on the command line. This is the case for SuSE Linux, so we do not consider ourselves vulnerable to this issue.

### Vendor Information

The vendor has not provided us with any further information regarding this vulnerability.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

- - --------------------------------------------------------------------
GENTOO LINUX SECURITY ANNOUNCEMENT 200210-012
- - --------------------------------------------------------------------

PACKAGE : sharutils
SUMMARY : inadequate checks on user-specified output files
DATE    : 2002-10-30 14:10 UTC
EXPLOIT : local

- - --------------------------------------------------------------------

The uudecode utility would create an output file without checking
to see if it was about to write to a symlink or a pipe. If a
user uses uudecode to extract data into open shared directories,
such as /tmp, this vulnerability could be used by a local attacker
to overwrite files or lead to privilege escalation.

Read the full advisory at
<http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/336083>

SOLUTION

It is recommended that all Gentoo Linux users who are running
sys-apps/sharutils-4.2.1-r5 and earlier update their systems as follows:

emerge rsync
emerge sharutils
emerge clean
