The provided content relates to CVE-2002-0849.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the default insecure file permissions of the `/etc/iscsi.conf` configuration file in the Linux-iSCSI package. This file stores cleartext passwords required for the CHAP authentication protocol used by iSCSI.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure default file permissions: The `/etc/iscsi.conf` file was created with world-writable permissions by default, or world-readable, making it accessible to any user on the system.
- Storage of cleartext passwords: The file contains cleartext passwords used for iSCSI authentication.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker with local access could read the `/etc/iscsi.conf` file and obtain the cleartext passwords. This allows the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the iSCSI storage and potentially other resources if the passwords are reused.

**Attack vectors:**
Local access is the primary attack vector. An attacker needs to have access to the system on which the vulnerable `/etc/iscsi.conf` file exists.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker must have local access to the system where the vulnerable iSCSI configuration is present and must be able to read the /etc/iscsi.conf file.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was present in a beta release of Red Hat Linux, while the default installation from Cisco and SourceForge was not vulnerable.
- The recommended fix is to change the file permissions to 0400, where only the root user has read access to the file.
- The issue highlights the importance of protecting configuration files that contain sensitive information such as cleartext passwords.
