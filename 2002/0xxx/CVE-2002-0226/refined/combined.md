When a user requests a new password for his account, a new password is
generated and sent to the requester (anyone that knows the username+email
information, which is usually available in "user profile").

The problem is that the password is simply the first 6 characters of the
user's SessionID, which is, of course, known to anybody who knows how to
see a value in a cookie.

Hence every user in the world can come to the board, request a new
password for someone, and then login with that username + 6 first
characters of the SessionID from the cookie.

The author has been notified (by me), and even released a patch, but, as
it appears, didn't bother saying that here, where most of the world will
be reading it, so I decided to do it myself.

Here's my post:

And here's the patch:

  Best regards,
