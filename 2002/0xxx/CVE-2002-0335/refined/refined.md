The provided content details buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the WorldGroup 3.x FTP and web servers.

**Root Cause:**

*   **FTP Server:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper bounds checking when handling the `LIST` command. A long sequence of "/*/" in the LIST command can cause a buffer overflow.
*   **HTTP Server:** The vulnerability is due to a buffer overflow when processing long GET requests to the `/signup/` path.  Specifically, a long string of 'a' characters after `/signup/` can trigger the overflow in Windows 9x/ME systems. The vulnerability description notes that the error lies between a system function in Windows and the Worldgroup web interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Buffer Overflows:** Both FTP and HTTP servers are susceptible to buffer overflow vulnerabilities due to inadequate input validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation leads to a denial of service. The provided proof-of-concept exploits specifically aim to crash the servers by sending crafted requests.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **FTP Server:** Sending a crafted `LIST` command with an excessive number of directory traversals ("/*/") over the network to the vulnerable server's FTP port (21).
*   **HTTP Server:** Sending a crafted `GET` request with a long string of 'a' characters to the `/signup/` path over the network to the vulnerable server's HTTP port (80).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have network connectivity to the vulnerable server.
*   For the FTP attack, the attacker needs to be able to establish an FTP connection, authenticating with any username/password combination.
*   For the HTTP attack, the attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests.

The content provides more details than the typical CVE description, including:
*   Specific vulnerable commands (`LIST` for FTP and `GET` for HTTP).
*   Example exploit code (FTP_DOS.C and WWW_DOS.C).
*   The affected OSes are noted to be specifically Windows 9x/ME for the HTTP vulnerability.
