The provided content describes a vulnerability in Netscape 6 and Mozilla browsers, which allows reading local files by exploiting the XMLHttpRequest object. This vulnerability is similar to one found in Internet Explorer 6.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way the `XMLHttpRequest` object handles server-side redirects. The browser does not properly check the target of the redirect and allows redirects to local files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-   Improper handling of server-side redirects by `XMLHttpRequest` object.
-   Lack of validation of the target URI after a redirect.
-   The browser does not distinguish between allowed web zones and local files during redirects.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can read arbitrary local files on the user's system.
- Sensitive data stored in local files can be exposed.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker needs to host a malicious web page.
- The web page must use the `XMLHttpRequest` object to send a request to a server-side script.
- The server-side script will redirect the request to a local file using the `file://` URI scheme.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a webpage, as the exploit is triggered by a web page.
- The attacker needs the user to open the malicious page in a vulnerable browser.
