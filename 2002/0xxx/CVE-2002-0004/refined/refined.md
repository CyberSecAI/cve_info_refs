Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2002-0004:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a bug in the `/usr/bin/at` command's parser. Specifically, the parser deallocates the same memory location twice, leading to a double-free condition. This heap corruption can cause a segmentation fault.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Double Free:** The core vulnerability is a double-free, where memory is freed more than once. This is a classic memory corruption issue.
- **Heap Corruption:** The double free corrupts the heap, creating an unstable state.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Segmentation Fault (Denial of Service):**  A specially crafted input to `at`  (e.g., `/usr/bin/at 31337 + vuln`) causes a segmentation fault, crashing the program.
- **Potential Privilege Escalation:** The vulnerability can be exploited to gain the privileges of the "daemon" user. Due to other "minor problems", it is also possible for an attacker to gain root access.
  
**Attack Vectors:**

- **Command-Line Argument:** The vulnerability is triggered by providing a specific, crafted argument to the `at` command.
- **Local Attack:**  An attacker must be able to execute the `at` command on the vulnerable system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local User Access:** An attacker needs to have local user access to the system.
- **Ability to Execute `at`:**  The attacker must be able to execute the `at` command.
- **Understanding of Exploit:** The attacker needs to be aware of the crafted input that triggers the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

- **Exploit Available:** An exploit for Red Hat 7.0 is publicly available which escalates privileges to root.
- **Affected Packages:** `at` versions prior to the patched versions are vulnerable. Example `at-3.1.8-12`.
- **Red Hat 7.0 and Mandrake Linux 8.1** are specifically mentioned as being affected.
- **Mitigation:** Patches are provided by Mandrake Linux (MDKSA-2002:007) and presumably Red Hat, to fix this double-free vulnerability. A fix from SuSE adding the O_EXCL option to open(2) system calls is also mentioned.
