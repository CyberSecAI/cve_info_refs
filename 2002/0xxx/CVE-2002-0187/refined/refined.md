The provided content describes two vulnerabilities, one of which is related to CVE-2002-0187.

**Vulnerability:** Script injection via XML tag (CVE-2002-0187)

*   **Root cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of the "Root" parameter within SQLXML when processing XML SQL queries. This parameter, intended to ensure well-formed XML results, does not sanitize input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious script.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**
    *   Improper input validation of the Root parameter in SQLXML.
    *   Failure to sanitize or escape script within XML responses.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary script within the user's browser with the privileges of the IE Security Zone associated with the IIS Server running SQLXML HTTP components. Typically, this would be the Intranet Zone. While default settings for the Intranet Zone are very similar to the Internet Zone, there may be slight differences that could be leveraged by an attacker.
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   An attacker lures a user to a website under their control.
    *   The website contains a link that submits a crafted XML query to the vulnerable SQL server.
    *   The crafted query includes malicious script within the "Root" parameter.
    *   When the server responds, the script is embedded in the XML response and executed within the user's browser.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker needs to know the address of a vulnerable SQL Server.
    *   The attacker needs to know the virtual directory configured on the IIS server for SQLXML HTTP components.
    *   The attacker needs to lure the victim to a malicious website under the attacker's control.
    *   The user must have permission to query the affected SQL server.

The document also mentions an additional vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Unchecked buffer in SQLXML ISAPI extension (CAN-2002-0186)

*   **Root cause:** The vulnerability is due to an unchecked buffer in the SQLXML ISAPI extension when handling HTTP data queries.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**
    *   Buffer overflow vulnerability within the ISAPI extension.
    *   Insufficient bounds checking when processing HTTP requests.
*  **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected IIS server with LocalSystem privileges, potentially leading to full control of the system.
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   An attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable IIS server hosting SQLXML components.
    *   The request includes malformed data that causes a buffer overflow.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker needs direct network connectivity to the vulnerable IIS server.
    *   The attacker needs to know the location of the virtual directory setup for SQLXML.
    *  SQLXML HTTP components must be enabled.
