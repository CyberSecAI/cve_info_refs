Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the Apache PL/SQL module used by Oracle9i Application Server (iAS), Oracle9i Database and Oracle8i Database.
*   The module does not properly handle HTTP Authorization headers. Specifically, it crashes when it receives a malformed Authorization request that lacks an authentication type (auth-scheme) token.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The PL/SQL module fails to validate the format of the HTTP Authorization header, leading to a crash when the `auth-scheme` token is missing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can crash the Apache service, making the Oracle9i Application Server or related services unavailable to legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is remote, via HTTP requests.
*   **Malformed HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP Authorization header that lacks the necessary `auth-scheme` token.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is present in the `modpplsql` or `mod_plsql` module within Apache.
*   The vulnerable module is used to handle authentication requests for Oracle iAS components like stored procedures and Database Access Descriptors (DAD).
*   The document references RFC 2616 and RFC 2617, which describe the HTTP Authorization mechanism and Basic/Digest authentication schemes, respectively. The vulnerability occurs when the `auth-scheme` is missing, which is required by these protocols.
*   Oracle released a security alert (#28) addressing this vulnerability with a patch.
*   The vulnerability is also present in Oracle9i Database and Oracle8i Database.
