## Oracle9i Application Server Apache PL/SQL module does not properly handle HTTP Authorization header

#### Vulnerability Note VU#805915

Original Release Date: 2002-02-25 | Last Revised: 2002-03-15

---

### Overview

A vulnerability exists in the way the Apache Procedural Language/Structured Query Language (PL/SQL) module used by Oracle9i Application Server (iAS) handles HTTP Authorization headers. This vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to crash the Apache service.

### Description

| [NGSSoftware](http://www.nextgenss.com/) has released Insight Security Research Advisory [#NISR06022002B](http://www.nextgenss.com/advisories/oraplsbos.txt) that describes a number of vulnerabilities in the [Apache](http://www.apache.org/) PL/SQL module used by Oracle9i Application Server (iAS). This document addresses a denial-of-service vulnerability triggered by a malformed HTTP Authorization request.  Oracle iAS uses the Apache HTTP Server to provide web services, including access to stored procedures via the Oracle PL/SQL module (modpplsql or mod\_plsql). In iAS, PL/SQL is used to communicate with the database and generate HTML that can be interpreted by a web browser. The PL/SQL module handles authentication requests for various elements of Oracle iAS, such as stored procedures and Database Access Descriptors (DAD). If necessary, the PL/SQL module will prompt for credentials using the Authorization mechanism of the HTTP protocol. Section 14.8 of [RFC 2616](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt) describes HTTP Authorization and [RFC 2617](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2617.txt) describes the Basic and Digest HTTP Authentication schemes. Both server challenges and client requests use a token to determine what type of Authentication scheme (auth-scheme) to use. If the PL/SQL module receives a malformed HTTP Authorization request that does not contain an Authentication type (auth-scheme) token, the Apache process will crash, denying service to legitimate users.The vulnerable PL/SQL module may also be used by Oracle9i Database and Oracle8i Database. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An unauthenticated remote attacker can crash the Apache service. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply Patch**Apply the appropriate patch referenced in [Oracle Security Alert #28](http://otn.oracle.com/deploy/security/pdf/ias_modplsql_alert.pdf). |
| --- |

| **Block or Restrict Access**Monitor and/or restrict access to the Apache service (typically 80/tcp). It may be possible to use TCP Wrapper or similar technology to provide improved access control and logging. Additionally, an application layer firewall or Intrusion Detection System (IDS) may be able to filter requests made to Apache. Note that these workarounds are designed to limit access and detect exploit attempts. These workarounds do not prevent exploitation of this vulnerability.**Disable Vulnerable Service**Disable the vulnerable service (modplsql or mod\_plsql in Apache). |

## History

The CERT Division is the birthplace of cybersecurity. For nearly 30 years, the CERT Division of the SEI has partnered with government, industry, law enforcement, and academia to advance cybersecurity and improve the security and resilience of computer systems and networks.

Originally focused on incident response, we have expanded into cybersecurity areas such as network situational awareness, malicious code analysis, secure coding, resilience management, insider threats, digital investigations and intelligence, workforce development, DevOps, forensics, software assurance, vulnerability discovery and analysis, and risk management.

## Former Director Richard Pethia

[Richard Pethia](/about/leadership/display.cfm?customel_datapageid_2623=3545) was founding director of the SEI's CERT Division. Pethia, who served as director of CERT from 1988 to 2016, guided the organization through tremendous growth and change. Under Pethia's leadership, the unit expanded and evolved from the CERT Coordination Center—a small group focused on computer incident response—to a research organization of more than 200 professionals dedicated to solving problems with widespread cybersecurity implications.
