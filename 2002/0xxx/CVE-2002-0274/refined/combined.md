Hey,

Its a good time to announce that 2xs security LTD. decided to
create a research team in order to focus on finding new bugs,
further more we managed to develop a security tool to discover
bugs/security flaws. In the near future, the tool itself will became
an open source project.

Its looks like there is few insecure/lame programming in exim mail
server up to current version.

first lets take a look at the file:
[2xs:root:~] ls -la /usr/exim/bin/exim
-rws--x--x    1 root     root      2061186 Oct 23 12:56
/usr/exim/bin/exim*
[2xs:root:~]

Suid goodie.

[2xs:w00p:/root] id

[2xs:w00p:/root] /usr/exim/bin/exim -F `perl -e' print "A" x 32770'` -C
`perl -e' print "A" x 32768'`
Segmentation fault
[2xs:w00p:/root]

Many other argument should work as well (as long there is -C among them)

after short debugging we found that there is no overflow since the
eip register coredumped in the code segment and not in the data segment,
yet we believe that there might be a way to exploit this bug with
log_write(), we are not going to deliver a working exploit until the
vendor
will research and fix this bug.

We provide a patch to version 3.34 that should solve this bug.

In version 3.21 and lower there is another small bug with -t flag
again non exploitable just bad programming.

This bug was found by The Analyzer, Izik and Mixter. 2xs security
research team.

should anyone have questions or comments you can email us:

analyzer@2xss.com
izik@2xss.com
mixter@2xss.com
