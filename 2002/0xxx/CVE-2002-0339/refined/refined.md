Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2002-0339:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how Cisco IOS devices with Cisco Express Forwarding (CEF) enabled handle discrepancies between the IP packet length specified in the IP header and the length indicated by the physical layer (MAC) header. When the IP header indicates a longer packet length than the physical layer, the device extends the physical layer packet to match the IP header's length by appending data. This appended data is sourced from a buffer that holds previously processed packets, leading to an information leak.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Leak:** The core vulnerability is an information leak, where fragments of past packets are unintentionally included in new packets.
*   **Improper Buffer Handling:** The issue is caused by incorrect handling of memory buffers and how data is used to pad packets to a specific length.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Exposure of Sensitive Data:** Exploitation of this vulnerability can allow an attacker to collect fragments of previously processed packets, potentially exposing sensitive data that might have been contained in those packets.
*   **Information Gathering:** Attackers may leverage this information to gain further insight into the network or users, which could be used in subsequent attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Manipulated IP Packet Length:** The attack vector involves crafting IP packets with a header specifying a packet length that is longer than the physical layer's reported length.
*   **Network Traffic:** The vulnerability is exposed by normal network traffic passing through a vulnerable Cisco IOS device with CEF enabled.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs to be able to send IP packets to or through a vulnerable Cisco device. This generally means being on the same network or having the ability to route traffic through the vulnerable device.
*   **Packet Manipulation:** The attacker needs the ability to manipulate the IP packet header to specify an IP packet length longer than the physical layer's length.
