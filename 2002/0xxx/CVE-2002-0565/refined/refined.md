Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- Oracle 9iAS, when processing JSP requests, compiles the JSP files into temporary files, specifically `.java` files which contain the original JSP source code. These files are stored in a publicly accessible directory `/_pages`. Additionally, a `globals.jsa` file, if used, is also accessible.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of JSP source code through the publicly accessible `.java` files. This includes sensitive information like database usernames, passwords, and proprietary business logic.
- **Insecure File Permissions/Access Control:** The `/_pages` directory and the `globals.jsa` file are accessible over the internet without proper access control restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can access and analyze JSP source code to uncover sensitive information.
- This could lead to further attacks, such as:
    - Gaining unauthorized access to the database
    - Understanding business logic and identifying vulnerabilities
    - Compromising the application and its data
- The `globals.jsa` file, which may contain application-wide settings, can also be accessed, potentially leading to further compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via HTTP by accessing the publicly available files through the web server.
- **Direct File Access:** Attackers can directly request the generated `.java` files and the `globals.jsa` files via URLs if they are aware of the naming conventions and directory structure.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected server.
- The attacker does not need any prior authentication or authorization to retrieve the vulnerable files.
- Knowledge of Oracle 9iAS file storage conventions helps to locate the files.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability allows for sensitive information disclosure.
- The vulnerability is considered medium to high risk.
- The provided fix involves restricting access to the vulnerable directory using Apache's `httpd.conf` configuration file.
- The issue was reported to Oracle on the 17th of December.
- The vulnerability affects all platforms running Oracle 9iAS.

This analysis provides more detail than the basic CVE description, elaborating on specific vulnerable files, the nature of the information disclosed, the required attacker position, and a detailed fix using apache configuration.
