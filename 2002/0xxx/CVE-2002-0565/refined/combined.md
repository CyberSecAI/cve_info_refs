## Oracle 9iAS creates temporary files when processing JSP requests that are world-readable

#### Vulnerability Note VU#547459

Original Release Date: 2002-02-27 | Last Revised: 2002-03-12

---

### Overview

Oracle Database Server version 9iAS makes JSP source code publicly available. The source code may be used by attackers to analyze proprietary business logic or uncover Oracle's network configuration, usernames, and/or passwords.

### Description

| When Oracle receives a request for JSP file, it compiles the file in a temporary directory under the "\_pages" directory. The compilation of each JSP file results in a ".java" file, which contains Java bytecode and the original JSP source code. Since the "\_pages" directory is publicly available over the Internet, any remote user can download the ".java" file and read the JSP source code. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker may analyze JSP source code to determine Oracle usernames and passwords, database configuration, or other business logic that may be helpful for mounting more attacks. |
| --- |

### Solution

| The CERT/CC is currently unaware of a solution to this problem from the vendor. |
| --- |

| The following workarounds were suggested by David Litchfield and have not been tested by CERT/CC.  Edit the httpd.conf file found in the $ORACLE\_HOME$/apache/apache/conf directory.To prevent access to the globals.jsa file add the following entry:<Files ~ "^\globals.jsa">    Order allow,deny    Deny from all</Files>To prevent access to the .java pages add the following entry:<Location /\_pages>    Order deny,allow    Deny from all</Location>Note that if the JSP pages are stored in a aliased directory (i.e. not a subdirectory of "htdocs") then it is neccessary to add an entry of<Location /dirname/\_pages>    Order deny,allow    Deny from all</Location>when "dirname" is the name of the aliased directory. |

## History

The CERT Division is the birthplace of cybersecurity. For nearly 30 years, the CERT Division of the SEI has partnered with government, industry, law enforcement, and academia to advance cybersecurity and improve the security and resilience of computer systems and networks.

Originally focused on incident response, we have expanded into cybersecurity areas such as network situational awareness, malicious code analysis, secure coding, resilience management, insider threats, digital investigations and intelligence, workforce development, DevOps, forensics, software assurance, vulnerability discovery and analysis, and risk management.

## Former Director Richard Pethia

[Richard Pethia](/about/leadership/display.cfm?customel_datapageid_2623=3545) was founding director of the SEI's CERT Division. Pethia, who served as director of CERT from 1988 to 2016, guided the organization through tremendous growth and change. Under Pethia's leadership, the unit expanded and evolved from the CERT Coordination Center—a small group focused on computer incident response—to a research organization of more than 200 professionals dedicated to solving problems with widespread cybersecurity implications.

NGSSoftware Insight Security Research Advisory

Name:    OracleJSP
Systems Affected:  Oracle 9iAS
Platforms:  All Operating Systems
Severity:  Medium/High Risk
Vendor URL:   <http://www.oracle.com/>
Author:   David Litchfield (david@nextgenss.com)
Date:   6th February 2002
Advisory number: #NISR06022002C
Advisory URL:  <http://www.nextgenss.com/advisories/orajsp.txt>

Description
***********
The web service with Oracle 9iAS is powered by Apache and provides many
application environments with which to offer services from the site. These
include SOAP, PL/SQL, XSQL and JSP. A security issue exists in the OracleJSP
environment where an attacker can get access to the source code of the of
the translated JSP page. There is a second issue relates to an attacker
gaining access to the globals.jsa contents.

Details
*******
When a user requests a JSP page from a server running OracleJSP the JSP page
is translated, compiled and executed with the results being returned to the
requesting client. During this process three intermediary files are created.
Assuming the JSP page is named "foo.jsp"

_foo$__jsp_StaticText.class
_foo.class
_foo.java

these are stored in the /_pages directory. If foo.jsp existed in a
subdirectory named "bar", i.e. /bar/foo.jsp, a "_bar" directory would be
created under the "_pages" directory and the three files placed here.

For more details on exact naming conventions please read
<http://download-west.oracle.com/otndoc/oracle9i/901_doc/java.901/a90208/tran>
depl.htm

The problem arises due to the fact that translated .java file contains the
clear text source code and these can be accessed directlys. As this will
often contain sensitive information such as a database UserID and password
and business logic this is considered as a security risk.

Further to this if the JSP application is using a globals.jsa file for
setting application wide settings an attacker may access this directly and
gain access to the contents. This poses the same threat: as the globals.jsa
can contain sensitive information it must be protected.

Fix Information
***************
To address these problems edit the httpd.conf file found in the
$ORACLE_HOME$/apache/apache/conf directory.

To prevent access to the globals.jsa file add the following entry:

<Files ~ "^\globals.jsa">
    Order allow,deny
    Deny from all
</Files>

To prevent access to the .java pages add the following entry:

<Location /_pages>
    Order deny,allow
    Deny from all
</Location>

Note that if the JSP pages are stored in a aliased directory (i.e. not a
subdirectory of "htdocs") then it is neccessary to add an entry of

<Location /dirname/_pages>
    Order deny,allow
    Deny from all
</Location>

when "dirname" is the name of the aliased directory.

Oracle were informed of these issues on the 17th of December.
