- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `CONVERT.EXE` utility, used to convert FAT32 file systems to NTFS on Windows 2000 and Windows XP, does not apply default NTFS permissions to the converted boot partition.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure directory permissions on system-critical directories such as `C:\`, `C:\Documents and Settings\All Users`, `C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Desktop`, `C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Start Menu`, and the System Restore directories.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local attacker can execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges. This requires another user to log in to the system.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access, exploiting insecure permissions on critical directories.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have local access to the system and another user must log in after the vulnerable permissions are set.
