```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The `catsnmp.sql` script, which is executed by `catproc.sql` (required during patch application), drops and recreates the `dbsnmp` user with a default password "dbsnmp".
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
    - Default password: The `dbsnmp` user is created with the default password "dbsnmp", making it easily guessable.
    - Excessive privileges: In 9i releases, the `dbsnmp` user is granted the "SELECT ANY DICTIONARY" privilege, which allows access to sensitive system objects containing potentially unencrypted passwords. In 8i releases, the user is granted access to `V_$ views`.
    - Automatic script execution: `catsnmp.sql` is automatically executed by `catproc.sql` when applying patchsets or individual patches, potentially reverting any changes made to the password or user.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker with access to the database could use the default `dbsnmp` credentials to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information, including unencrypted passwords stored in system objects or other system level information, depending on the version. This could lead to further compromise of the database and potentially the system.
- Attack vectors: An attacker needs to have network access to the Oracle database and attempt to log in with the default `dbsnmp` credentials.
- Required attacker capabilities/position:
    - The attacker must have network access to the Oracle database server.
    - The attacker must be aware of the default `dbsnmp` user and password, or that it has been re-created.
