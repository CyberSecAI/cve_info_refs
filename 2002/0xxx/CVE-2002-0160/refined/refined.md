Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a directory traversal vulnerability in the web server interface of Cisco Secure ACS. The web server does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when accessing files, allowing access to files outside of the intended webroot.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Directory Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is a directory traversal issue. By using ".." sequences in the URL, a logged-in user can navigate to parent directories, escaping the webroot.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The webserver fails to properly validate the URL path provided by the user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Access:** An attacker can read the contents of any file on the same volume where the software is installed. This includes sensitive data like configuration files, system files, and potentially other private user data.
- **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability allows for information disclosure by revealing the contents of accessed files.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** Attackers exploit the vulnerability by crafting a malicious URL containing directory traversal sequences (e.g., `..\..\..\..\..\..\temp\temp.class`).
- **Web Interface:** The attack is launched through the webserver interface of Cisco Secure ACS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Valid User Login:** An attacker needs to have a valid login to the Cisco Secure ACS web interface before exploiting the vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the Cisco Secure ACS server.

**Additional Notes:**
- Only Cisco ACS for Windows is affected by this vulnerability. The Unix version is not vulnerable.
