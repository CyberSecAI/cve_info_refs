Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2002-0070:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the Windows Shell's handling of URL handlers, specifically when a URL handler is mapped in the registry to a program that no longer exists.
- An unchecked buffer exists in the Windows Shell function responsible for locating applications associated with custom URL handlers, particularly when those applications have been incompletely removed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Buffer overflow: The Windows Shell contains a buffer that can be overflowed by crafting a specific URL with excessive data. This can lead to arbitrary code execution.
- Incorrectly removed URL handlers: Applications may fail to properly remove their custom URL handlers during uninstallation, leaving orphaned registry entries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Code Execution: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user who triggered the vulnerability.
- System compromise: Depending on the user's privileges, an attacker could perform actions like adding/deleting files, communicating with websites or reformatting hard drive.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious URLs: Attackers can craft malicious URLs using the orphaned URL handlers.
- Web pages: Attackers can embed malicious URLs in a web page and trick users into visiting it.
- HTML Emails: Attackers can send emails containing the malicious URLs, which are triggered when the email is opened/viewed.
- Local Exploitation: A local program can directly call the vulnerable Windows Shell function to trigger the overflow, although the need to execute local code makes this less critical.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Knowledge of an orphaned URL handler: The attacker must know a URL handler that is registered but points to a non-existent executable.
- Ability to deliver malicious URL: The attacker needs to find a way to make a victim's system process the malicious URL (via web, email, local program etc).
- Ability to craft a malformed URL that triggers the buffer overflow by providing excessive data.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability requires specific conditions: the system must have installed and uninstalled an application that improperly removed its custom URL handler, leaving an orphan registry entry.
- Default Windows installations are not vulnerable out-of-the-box: The vulnerability can only be exploited after specific software has been installed and removed, and not all software causes this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is not in the third-party application itself, but in how Windows Shell handles the missing applications associated with a URL Handler.
- Microsoft products are not known to cause the vulnerability.
