## Multiple vendors' Domain Name System (DNS) stub resolvers vulnerable to buffer overflows

#### Vulnerability Note VU#803539

Original Release Date: 2002-06-27 | Last Revised: 2003-04-16

---

### Overview

Buffer overflow vulnerabilities exists in the DNS stub resolver library used by BSD, ISC BIND, and GNU glibc. Other systems that use DNS resolver code derived from ISC BIND may also be affected. An attacker who is able to control DNS responses could exploit arbitrary code or cause a denial of service on vulnerable systems.

### Description

| The Domain Name System (DNS) provides name, address, and other information about Internet Protocol (IP) networks and devices. By issuing queries to and interpreting responses from DNS servers, IP-enabled network operating systems can access DNS information. When an IP network application needs to access or process DNS information, it calls functions in the stub resolver library, which may be part of the underlying network operating system. On BSD-based systems, DNS stub resolver functions are implemented in the system library libc. In ISC BIND, they are implemented in libbind, and on GNU/Linux-based systems, they are implemented in glibc.  The DNS resolver libraries on BSD-based systems (libc), ISC BIND (libbind), GNU/Linux (glibc), and possibly other systems that use code derived from ISC BIND contain buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the way the resolvers handle DNS responses. Quoting from FreeBSD Security Advisory FreeBSD-SA-02:28.resolv:*DNS messages have specific byte alignment requirements, resulting in padding in messages. In a few instances in the resolver code, this padding is not taken into account when computing available buffer space. As a result, the parsing of a DNS message may result in a buffer overrun of up to a few bytes for each record included in the message.*NetBSD Security Advisory 2002-006 provides further detail:*In lib/libc/net/gethnamaddr.c:getanswer() and lib/libc/net/getnetnamadr.c:getnetanswer(), two variables manage packet buffer parsing - a pointer to the byte we are looking at, and the remaining length on the buffer. The remaining length was not updated consistently, and malicious DNS responses are able to write outside the buffer.*This problem is not limited to DNS servers or to BIND. Any application that uses a vulnerable resolver library is likely to be affected. Applications that are statically linked must be recompiled using patched resolver libraries.Note that the DNS stub resolver implemented in glibc on GNU/Linux systems is vulnerable via DNS lookups for network names and addresses (VU#542971). |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker who is able to control DNS responses could exploit arbitrary code or cause a denial of service on vulnerable systems. The attacker would need to be able to spoof DNS responses or control a DNS server that provides responses to a vulnerable system. Any code executed by the attacker would run with the privileges of the process that called the vulnerable resolver function, potentially root. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply a Patch**Apply a patch from your vendor. In the case of statically linked binaries, it is necessary to recompile using the patched version of the DNS stub resolver libraries.**Upgrade**Upgrade your system as specified by your vendor. |
| --- |

| **Use of a local caching DNS server is not an effective workaround**When this document was initially published, it was thought that a caching DNS server that reconstructs DNS responses would prevent malicious code from reaching systems with vulnerable resolver libraries. This workaround does not prevent some DNS responses that contain malicious code from reaching clients, whether or not the responses are reconstructed by a local caching DNS server. Since the server may cache the responses, the malicious code could persist until the server's cache is purged or the entries expire.**Disable Reverse DNS Lookups**Disable the reverse DNS lookup functions in applications that perform DNS name lookups from IP addresses. For example, some HTTP and FTP servers perform reverse DNS lookups to convert IP addresses to hostnames in logs. Disabling reverse DNS lookups will only protect against specific exploit attempts that rely on the reverse lookup as an attack vector. |

If you have feedback, comments, or additional information about this vulnerability, please send us email.

### [Conectiva](#AAMN-5CDNQP) Affected

Updated:  August 14, 2002

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

Conectiva Linux supported versions (6.0, 7.0 and 8) are not vulnerable to VU#803539 regarding glibc packages. Regarding VU#542971, these same versions of Conectiva Linux are vulnerable but not in the default installation, since /etc/nsswitch.conf ships without the dns parameter in the "networks:" line.

Updated glibc packages which fix the second vulnerability, VU#542971, will be provided.

### Vendor Information

The vendor has not provided us with any further information regarding this vulnerability.

### Addendum

Please see Conectiva Linux Announcement [CLSA-2002:507 (english)](http://distro.conectiva.com.br/atualizacoes/?id=a&anuncio=000507&idioma=en).

### [GNU glibc](#AAMN-5BMSW2) Affected

Notified:  June 28, 2002  Updated: July 18, 2002

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

For resolving host names and addresses via DNS, Version 2.1.2 and earlier versions of the GNU C Library are vulnerable. Later versions are not vulnerable.

For the less commonly used action of resolving network names and addresses via DNS as per Internet RFC 1011, Version 2.2.5 and earlier versions are vulnerable.

To work around the problems, modify the file /etc/nsswitch.conf so that it contains "hosts:" and "networks:" lines that do not mention "dns". For example, you might use the following lines in your /etc/nsswitch.conf file:

# This "networks:" line omits "dns" to work around a bug in glibc
# 2.2.5 and earlier.
networks: files nisplus

# This "hosts:" line omits "dns" to work around a bug in glibc 2.1.2
# and earlier.
hosts: nisplus [NOTFOUND=return] files
[CERT/CC: This workaround will break network and host resolution that is not provided through some other means, such as database files (/etc/hosts, /etc/networks) or NIS. In most cases, resolution for non-local networks and hosts will be disabled.]
Most GNU/Linux distributions with glibc 2.1.3 and later ship with a line like "networks: files" in /etc/nsswitch.conf and thus unless this line is changed they are not vulnerable.

To fix the problem instead of working around it, we suggest upgrading to Version 2.1.3 or later, and applying the following patch, taking care to relink any statically linked applications that use the affected functions. This patch can also be found at:

BIND 9 contains a copy of the BIND 8.3.x resolver library (lib/bind). This will be updated with the next BIND 9 releases (9.2.2/9.3.0) in the meantime please use the original in BIND 8.3.3.

Vendors wishing additional patches should contact bind-bugs@isc.org.
Query about BIND 4 and BIND 8 should be addressed to bind-bugs@isc.org.
Query about BIND 9 should be addressed to bind9-bugs@isc.org.

### Vendor Information

The vendor has not provided us with any further information regarding this vulnerability.

### Addendum

The resolver library included in BIND 9.2.0 and 9.2.1 is a copy of the vulnerable resolver library included with BIND 8.3.x. In BIND 9, the vulnerable 8.3.x resolver library (libbind) is not built or installed by default unless BIND 9 is configured with the "--enable-libbind" option. BIND 9.2.2 is not vulnerable since it includes the updated resolver library (libbind) from BIND 8.3.3.

ISC has documented this issue on the [BIND Vulnerabilities](http://www.isc.org/products/BIND/bind-security.html) page of the ISC web site under the heading "libbind buffer overflow" and in a [status update](http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=bind-announce&m=104692041818694&w=2) to the bind-announce mailing list.

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

[T]he resolver libraries in question got copied far and wide. They used to have a hell of a lot of bugs in them.

Now might be a good time for people to compare each others' libraries to each other. I would urge them to compare against the OpenBSD ones, where we've spent a lot of time on, but of course we still missed this. But perhaps people can then share some around. Not everyone is going to move to the bind9 stuff, since it is very different.

### [Openwall GNU/\*/Linux](#AAMN-5BMNJE) Affected

Updated:  July 01, 2002

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

No release or branch of Openwall GNU/\*/Linux (Owl) is known to be affected, due to Olaf Kirch's fixes for this problem getting into the GNU C library more than two years ago.

The BIND 4.9.8-OW2 patch and BIND 4.9.9 release (and thus 4.9.9-OW1) include fixes for this vulnerability, originally developed by Jun-ichiro itojun Hagino of NetBSD. The updated patches are available at the usual location:

<http://www.openwall.com/bind/>
The BIND 4.9.x-OW patches provide certain security features which are not a part of ISC's now deprecated BIND 4 and are recommended for use by sites which chose to stick with BIND 4 for a little longer for whatever reason. They aren't a part of Owl.

### [Secure Computing Corporation](#AAMN-5BNT9S) Affected

Notified:  July 02, 2002  Updated: July 18, 2002

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

This is the official Secure Computing response to CERT Advisory CA-2002-19 Buffer Overflow in Multiple DNS Resolver Libraries. Note that we are currently supporting three different firewalls with different solutions to this vulnerability.

GAUNTLET (tm) FIREWALL & VPN (5.X and 6.0)
Gauntlet software users should contact their operating system vendor for a revised version of the library (on Solaris it is libresolv.so, on HP-UX it is libnss\_dns.1) in question and apply it as soon as it is available.

GAUNTLET E-PPLIANCE FIREWALL & VPN (EPL 1.X and 2.0)
Gauntlet e-ppliance would be vulnerable to this theoretical attack. Secure Computing engineering is currently examining the issue in preparation for a patch for the e-ppliance 300 and 1000 (all versions).

SIDEWINDER(tm) FIREWALL & VPN (all releases including Sidewinder Appliance)
This buffer overflow vulnerability can not be exploited to gain access to, or gain any valuable information from a Sidewinder. An attack against one of the Sidewinder components using this vulnerability would yield no special privileges (such as root access, shell access, configuration information, etc.) due to Sidewinder's SecureOS(tm) Type Enforcement(tm) technology (TE).

None of Sidewinder's critical services (proxies, ACL engine, etc.) do direct DNS processing. Resolution is done by 'self contained' DNS resolver processes which are not granted Type Enforcement access to any of the services configuration data, nor could it access the data contained by the service sessions, nor even execute a shell. This process has no access to any system resources useful to an attacker. And of course, there is no useful concept of root privilege on Sidewinder.

### [Sendmail](#AAMN-5BJMPJ) Affected

Updated:  July 01, 2002

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

Sendmail uses the BIND resolver API, and is commonly linked with the BIND resolver library (libbind). As a result, Sendmail could be leveraged to exploit this vulnerability.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

1)  problem description, brief discussion, solution, upgrade information

    A vulnerability has been discovered in some resolver library
    functions. The affected code goes back to the resolver library
    shipped as part of BIND4; code derived from it has been included
    in later BIND releases as well as the GNU libc.

    The bug itself is a buffer overflow that can be triggered if a
    DNS server sends multiple CNAME records in a DNS response.

    This bug has been fixed for the gethostbyXXX class of functions
    in GNU libc in 1999. Unfortunately, there is similar code in the
    getnetbyXXX functions in recent glibc implementations, and
    the code is enabled by default. However, these functions are
    used by very few applications only, such as ifconfig and ifuser,
    which makes exploits less likely.

    We will make updated glibc packages available as they have gone
    through our build system, but without separate announcements.

    Until glibc patches are available, we recommend that you disable
    DNS lookups of network names in nsswitch.conf. Simply replace the
    line containing the tag "networks:" with this line:

networks: files

    In the unlikely event that you've configured any name to network
    mapping via DNS, make sure you copy this information to
    /etc/networks.

    The resolver bug is also present in the libbind library included
    in BIND. This library is used by utilities from the bindutil package.

    We are therefore providing security updates for bind8 that
    address this vulnerability. As communicated previously (1),
    the SuSE security team is not providing fixes for BIND4 anymore.

    The bind9 packages shipped by SuSE are not vulnerable.

    Please download the update package for your distribution and
    verify its integrity by the methods listed in section 3) of this
    announcement.

    Apply the updata packages (bindutil, bind8) package using

rpm -Fvh bind\*.rpm

    If you are running the BIND name server, you should restart the name
    server process by issuing

    rcnamed restart

    Our maintenance customers are being notified individually. The
    packages are being offered to install from the maintenance web.

2)  Pending vulnerabilities in SuSE Distributions and Workarounds:

  - There is a format string bug in the "nn" news reader that can
    be exploited by a malicious NNTP server to execute arbitrary
    commands within the client user's account. We will be releasing
    updated packages.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

3)  standard appendix: authenticity verification, additional information

  - Package authenticity verification:

    SuSE update packages are available on many mirror ftp servers all over
    the world. While this service is being considered valuable and important
    to the free and open source software community, many users wish to be
    sure about the origin of the package and its content before installing
    the package. There are two verification methods that can be used
    independently from each other to prove the authenticity of a downloaded
    file or rpm package:
    1) md5sums as provided in the (cryptographically signed) announcement.
    2) using the internal gpg signatures of the rpm package.

    1) execute the command
        md5sum <name-of-the-file.rpm>
       after you downloaded the file from a SuSE ftp server or its mirrors.
       Then, compare the resulting md5sum with the one that is listed in the
       announcement. Since the announcement containing the checksums is
       cryptographically signed (usually using the key security@suse.de),
       the checksums show proof of the authenticity of the package.
       We disrecommend to subscribe to security lists which cause the
       email message containing the announcement to be modified so that
       the signature does not match after transport through the mailing
       list software.
       Downsides: You must be able to verify the authenticity of the
       announcement in the first place. If RPM packages are being rebuilt
       and a new version of a package is published on the ftp server, all
       md5 sums for the files are useless.

    2) rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the authenticity
       of an rpm package. Use the command
        rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
       to verify the signature of the package, where <file.rpm> is the
       filename of the rpm package that you have downloaded. Of course,
       package authenticity verification can only target an uninstalled rpm
       package file.
       Prerequisites:
        a) gpg is installed
        b) The package is signed using a certain key. The public part of this
           key must be installed by the gpg program in the directory
           ~/.gnupg/ under the user's home directory who performs the
           signature verification (usually root). You can import the key
           that is used by SuSE in rpm packages for SuSE Linux by saving
           this announcement to a file ("announcement.txt") and
           running the command (do "su -" to be root):
            gpg --batch; gpg < announcement.txt | gpg --import
           SuSE Linux distributions version 7.1 and thereafter install the
           key "build@suse.de" upon installation or upgrade, provided that
           the package gpg is installed. The file containing the public key
           is placed at the toplevel directory of the first CD (pubring.gpg)
           and at ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/suse/pubring.gpg-build.suse.de .

### [djbdns](#AAMN-5BJ6XK) Not Affected

Notified:  June 27, 2002  Updated: April 16, 2003

### Status

Not Affected

### Vendor Statement

djbdns does not have these bugs. djbdns has never used any BIND-derived code. djbdns, including the djbdns client library, is covered by a $500 security guarantee. The djbdns client library is free for use by other packages in place of BIND's libresolv. See <http://cr.yp.to/djbdns.html>.

Elsewhere in this advisory, CERT and the BIND company suggest that administrators do not need to rush to upgrade their libresolv-based clients if they are using BIND 9 caches. The idea is that (1) BIND 9 caches never put CNAME records into the answer section of a DNS packet except at the top and (2) the BIND company believes that these libresolv bugs cannot be triggered by answer sections with all CNAME records at the top.

dnscache, the caching component of djbdns, is like the BIND 9 cache in all relevant respects. Specifically, it never puts CNAME records into the answer section except at the top. (This is the normal behavior for DNS caches; BIND 4 and BIND 8 are abnormal.)

However, it is simply not true that clients are protected by caches. Attackers can send unusual packets directly to clients, using the same well-known techniques used to selectively forge DNS responses. I do not endorse the suggestion of relying on caches (whether BIND 9 or dnscache) as a ``solution'' to the libresolv bugs. All libresolv-based clients must be upgraded immediately.

There are exceptions. Sites that use a local dnscache on every machine, with local firewalls preventing forgery of 127.0.0.1 and with proper IP-address checks in client libraries, are immune to cache-to-client packet forgery, as are sites that use IPSEC. However, even at those sites, libresolv-based clients should be upgraded immediately; the ability of the cache to take control of client programs, rather than simply providing DNS data, is a violation of standard security policy.

## History

The CERT Division is the birthplace of cybersecurity. For nearly 30 years, the CERT Division of the SEI has partnered with government, industry, law enforcement, and academia to advance cybersecurity and improve the security and resilience of computer systems and networks.

Originally focused on incident response, we have expanded into cybersecurity areas such as network situational awareness, malicious code analysis, secure coding, resilience management, insider threats, digital investigations and intelligence, workforce development, DevOps, forensics, software assurance, vulnerability discovery and analysis, and risk management.

## Former Director Richard Pethia

[Richard Pethia](/about/leadership/display.cfm?customel_datapageid_2623=3545) was founding director of the SEI's CERT Division. Pethia, who served as director of CERT from 1988 to 2016, guided the organization through tremendous growth and change. Under Pethia's leadership, the unit expanded and evolved from the CERT Coordination Center—a small group focused on computer incident response—to a research organization of more than 200 professionals dedicated to solving problems with widespread cybersecurity implications.

=============================================================================
FreeBSD-SA-02:28.resolv                                     Security Advisory
                                                          The FreeBSD Project

Topic:          buffer overflow in resolver

Category:       core
Module:         libc
Announced:      2002-06-26
Credits:        Joost Pol <joost@pine.nl>
Affects:        All releases prior to and including 4.6-RELEASE
Corrected:      2002-06-26 06:34:18 UTC (RELENG_4)
                2002-06-26 08:44:24 UTC (RELENG_4_6)
                2002-06-26 18:53:20 UTC (RELENG_4_5)
FreeBSD only:   NO

I.   Background

The resolver implements functions for making, sending and interpreting
query and reply messages with Internet domain name servers.
Hostnames, IP addresses, and other information are queried using the
resolver.

II.  Problem Description

DNS messages have specific byte alignment requirements, resulting in
padding in messages.  In a few instances in the resolver code, this
padding is not taken into account when computing available buffer
space.  As a result, the parsing of a DNS message may result in a
buffer overrun of up to a few bytes for each record included in the
message.

III. Impact

An attacker (either a malicious domain name server or an agent that
can spoof DNS messages) may produce a specially crafted DNS message
that will exploit this bug when parsed by an application using the
resolver.  It may be possible for such an exploit to result in the
execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the resolver-using
application.  Though no exploits are known to exist today, since
practically all Internet applications utilize the resolver, the
severity of this issue is high.

IV.  Workaround

There is currently no workaround.

V.   Solution

Do one of the following:

1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to 4.6-STABLE; or to the RELENG_4_6
or RELENG_4_5 security branch dated after the correction date
(4.6-RELEASE-p1 or 4.5-RELEASE-p7).

2) To patch your present system:

The following patch has been verified to apply to FreeBSD 4.5 and
FreeBSD 4.6 systems.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

# fetch ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/patches/SA-02:28/resolv.patch
# fetch ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/patches/SA-02:28/resolv.patch.asc

b) Execute the following commands as root:

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch

c) Recompile the operating systems as described in
<URL:<http://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/makeworld.html>>.

Note that any statically linked applications that are not part of
the base system (i.e. from the Ports Collection or other 3rd-party
sources) must be recompiled.

VI.  Correction details

The following list contains the revision numbers of each file that was
corrected in FreeBSD.

Synopsis

	There is a remote buffer overflow in the resolver code of libc.

Impact

	Serious.

	Exploitability will vary on application-specific issues.

Description

	There is a slight mistake in the resolver code of libc.

	This will allow an attacker-controlled DNS server to reply
	with a carefully crafted message to (for example) a
	gethostbyname request.

	This reply will trigger the buffer overflow

Solution

	FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD CVS have been updated.

OpenPKG Security Advisory                            The OpenPKG Project
<http://www.openpkg.org/security.html>              <http://www.openpkg.org>

OpenPKG-SA-2002.006                                          04-Jul-2002
________________________________________________________________________

Package:             bind
Vulnerability:       buffer overflow vulnerability
OpenPKG Specific:    no

Affected  Releases:  OpenPKG 1.0
Affected  Packages:  <= bind-8.2.5-1.0.0
Corrected Packages:  >= bind-8.2.6-1.0.1
Dependent Packages:  -

Description:
  According to CERT Advisory CA-2002-19 [[5]](#5) a buffer overflow
  vulnerability exists in multiple implementations of DNS resolver
  libraries. Applications that utilize vulnerable DNS resolver libraries
  may be affected.

  For the OpenPKG bind package this means that the included utilities
  dig, host, nslookup and nsupdate are affected. Please note that the
  named server itself is not affected.

  A remote attacker who is able to send malicious DNS responses could
  potentially exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code or
  cause a denial of service on a vulnerable system.  Note that a
  possible attack would be performed by a DNS response, thus bypassing
  any firewall.

  For more details and background information see the corresponding
  NetBSD Security Advisory 2002-006 [[6]](#6).

  The Internet Software Consortium (ISC) Berkeley Internet Name Domain
  (BIND) Vulnerabilities Summary table [[7]](#7) shows that for the 8.2.x
  track of BIND the DNS resolver library (libbind) issue is fixed in
  8.2.6.

  Please check whether you are affected by running "<prefix>/bin/rpm -q
  bind". If you have the "bind" package installed and its version is
  affected (see above), we recommend that you immediately upgrade it
  (see Solution).

Solution:
  Select the updated source RPM appropriate for your OpenPKG release
  [[4]](#4), fetch it from the OpenPKG FTP service [[3]](#3) or a mirror location,
  verify its integrity [[1]](#1), build a corresponding binary RPM from it and
  update your OpenPKG installation by applying the binary RPM [[2]](#2). For
  the latest OpenPKG 1.0 release, perform the following operations to
  permanently fix the security problem (for other releases adjust
  accordingly).

  $ ftp ftp.openpkg.org
  ftp> bin
  ftp> cd release/1.0/UPD
  ftp> get bind-8.2.6-1.0.1.src.rpm
  ftp> bye
  $ <prefix>/bin/rpm --checksig bind-8.2.6-1.0.1.src.rpm
  $ <prefix>/bin/rpm --rebuild bind-8.2.6-1.0.1.src.rpm
  $ su -
  # <prefix>/bin/rpm -Fvh <prefix>/RPM/PKG/bind-8.2.6-1.0.1.*.rpm
  # <prefix>/etc/rc bind stop start
