{
  "cveId": "CVE-2002-0651",
  "description": "Multiple vendors' Domain Name System (DNS) stub resolvers are vulnerable to buffer overflows. An attacker who is able to control DNS responses could exploit arbitrary code or cause a denial of service on vulnerable systems.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    {
      "rootCause": "The root cause of this vulnerability is a failure to account for padding bytes within DNS messages when computing the available buffer space during parsing. This discrepancy leads to buffer overflows when processing DNS responses.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Buffer Overflow: The primary vulnerability is a buffer overflow when parsing DNS responses, specifically due to incorrect handling of padding bytes.",
        "Inconsistent Length Management: The remaining length of the buffer was not updated consistently, allowing malicious DNS responses to write outside the allocated memory.",
         "Lack of Input Validation: The resolver code does not adequately validate the length and structure of DNS responses, leading to the overflow."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker who can control DNS responses could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the process calling the vulnerable resolver function or cause a denial of service. This could lead to a complete compromise of the vulnerable system, as the affected processes may run with root privileges.",
      "attackVectors": [
        "Spoofed DNS Responses: An attacker could spoof DNS responses to the target system.",
        "Compromised DNS Servers: An attacker could compromise a DNS server that provides responses to the vulnerable system."
      ],
      "requiredCapabilities": [
        "Control Over DNS Responses: The attacker needs to be able to manipulate DNS responses received by the vulnerable system."
      ],
    "additionalDetails": "The vulnerability affects the DNS stub resolver library used by BSD, ISC BIND, and GNU glibc. Other systems using DNS resolver code derived from ISC BIND may also be affected. The issue lies within the functions responsible for handling DNS responses where byte alignment requirements result in padding, which is not always accounted for when calculating available buffer space. This can cause a buffer overrun of a few bytes for each record included in the message. Notably, reverse DNS lookups can also be used as an attack vector. Also, the vulnerability is not limited to DNS servers or BIND; any application using the vulnerable resolver library is at risk. Staticly linked applications must be recompiled with patched libraries."
