Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2002-0559:

**Vulnerability Overview:**

CVE-2002-0559 is associated with multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the Oracle9i Application Server's Apache PL/SQL module (modplsql or mod_plsql). These vulnerabilities can be triggered by various attack vectors, all related to processing of input by the PL/SQL module.

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of these vulnerabilities is the insufficient bounds checking in the PL/SQL module when handling various inputs:
*   **HTTP Location header (VU#313280):** A buffer overflow occurs when a long URL is used in the HTTP Location header. This is triggered when a request to a help page is made without specifying the DAD.
*   **Cache directory name (VU#923395):** A buffer overflow occurs when a crafted cache directory name is provided via the PL/SQL gateway configuration page.
*   **HTTP Authorization header (VU#878603):** A buffer overflow can be triggered by a malformed HTTP Authorization request containing a crafted password parameter.
*   **HTTP request (VU#750299):** A crafted HTTP request to the PL/SQL module can cause a buffer overflow.
*   **Database Access Descriptor (DAD) password (VU#659043):** A buffer overflow can be triggered by providing a specially crafted password when configuring a DAD through the PL/SQL gateway administration interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a buffer overflow, where the program attempts to write data beyond the allocated memory buffer.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The PL/SQL module does not properly validate the length of input data in various parts of the code, leading to the buffer overflows.
*   **Lack of Access Controls:** By default, some of the administration pages are accessible to anyone who has access to the web server, which increases the attack surface, particularly for the cache directory and DAD password related vulnerabilities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause the Apache process to crash, leading to a denial of service.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Apache process. On Windows systems, Apache typically runs with SYSTEM privileges, which would allow an attacker to gain complete control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Exploitation:** All the vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely without requiring any prior authentication.
*   **HTTP Requests:** The attacks are carried out by sending specially crafted HTTP requests to the Oracle9i Application Server that are not correctly handled by the PL/SQL module
*   **Web interface:** The cache directory and DAD password vulnerabilities are exposed via the web-based administration interfaces of the PL/SQL gateway.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the server running the vulnerable Oracle9i Application Server.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any credentials to exploit the vulnerabilities.
*   **Understanding of HTTP Protocol:** The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious HTTP requests or know how to interact with the vulnerable administration interfaces.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerabilities affect the PL/SQL module used by Oracle9i Application Server and potentially also Oracle9i Database and Oracle8i Database.
*   All of the listed CERT vulnerability notes (VU#313280, VU#923395, VU#878603, VU#750299, VU#659043) reference Oracle Security Alert #28 as the fix.
*   The vulnerabilities were discovered and reported by David Litchfield of NGSSoftware.
*   The vulnerabilities were made public around February 2002 and addressed in Oracle Security Alert #28, which is mentioned in all the vulnerability notes.

In summary, CVE-2002-0559 represents a significant security risk due to the ease of remote, unauthenticated exploitation, potentially leading to complete system compromise on affected systems. The root cause of all the vulnerabilities associated with the CVE is insufficient input validation within the Oracle PL/SQL module.
