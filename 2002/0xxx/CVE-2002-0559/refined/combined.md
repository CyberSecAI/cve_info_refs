## Oracle9i Application Server Apache PL/SQL module vulnerable to buffer overflow via HTTP Location header

#### Vulnerability Note VU#313280

Original Release Date: 2002-03-12 | Last Revised: 2002-03-15

---

### Overview

A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the Apache Procedural Language/Structured Query Language (PL/SQL) module used by Oracle9i Application Server (iAS). This vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code on the system with the privileges of the Apache process.

### Description

| [NGSSoftware](http://www.nextgenss.com/) has released a paper titled [*Hackproofing Oracle Application Server*](http://www.nextgenss.com/papers/hpoas.pdf) that describes a number of security issues in the [Apache](http://www.apache.org/) PL/SQL module used by Oracle9i Application Server (iAS). This document addresses a buffer overflow that occurs in the HTTP Location header sent in response to a request for a help page.  Oracle iAS uses the Apache HTTP Server to provide web services, including access to stored procedures via the Oracle PL/SQL module (modpplsql or mod\_plsql). In iAS, PL/SQL is used to communicate with the database and generate HTML that can be interpreted by a web browser. The PL/SQL module also provides the ability to remotely administer Database Access Descriptors (DAD) and access help pages. While access to the DADs is restricted by username and password, access to the help pages is not and they can be accessed by any user. A help page can be requested through its direct URL, as demonstrated in the following example:  http://ias-server/pls/DAD/help/helppage.html  A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the code that handles a request for a help page. This vulnerability is documented in [VU#500203](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/500203). A help page can also be requested without specifying the DAD, as shown in this example:  http://ias-server/pls/help/helppage.html  Upon receiving this request, the PL/SQL module responds with an HTTP Location header directing the client to a URL containing the default DAD, as in the first example above. The buffer overflow described in this document occurs in the HTTP Location header parameter. A malicious URL that is reproduced in the HTTP Location header could trigger the buffer overflow, thus crashing the Apache process or executing code of the attacker's choice.The vulnerable PL/SQL module may also be used by Oracle9i Database and Oracle8i Database. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An unauthenticated remote attacker could cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code on the system with the privileges of the Apache process. Since the Apache service typically runs with SYSTEM privileges on Windows NT and Windows 2000, an attacker may be able to gain complete control of the system. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply Patch**Apply the patch referenced in [Oracle Security Alert #28](http://otn.oracle.com/deploy/security/pdf/ias_modplsql_alert.pdf). |
| --- |

## Oracle9i Application Server Apache PL/SQL module vulnerable to buffer overflow via cache directory name

#### Vulnerability Note VU#923395

Original Release Date: 2002-02-28 | Last Revised: 2002-03-15

---

### Overview

A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the Apache Procedural Language/Structured Query Language (PL/SQL) module used by Oracle9i Application Server (iAS). This vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause a denial-of-service or execute arbitrary code on the system with the privileges of the Apache process.

### Description

| [NGSSoftware](http://www.nextgenss.com/) has released Insight Security Research Advisory [#NISR06022002B](http://www.nextgenss.com/advisories/oraplsbos.txt) that describes a number of vulnerabilities in the [Apache](http://www.apache.org/) PL/SQL module used by Oracle9i Application Server (iAS). This document addresses a buffer overflow vulnerability caused by a crafted cache directory name entered in the PL/SQL gateway configuration page.  Oracle iAS uses the Apache HTTP Server to provide web services, including access to stored procedures via the Oracle PL/SQL module (modpplsql or mod\_plsql). In iAS, PL/SQL is used to communicate with the database and generate HTML that can be interpreted by a web browser. The PL/SQL module supports caching of PL/SQL objects and provides a web-based administration interface to configure the cache and other settings. A malformed directory name specified in the cache configuration form could trigger a buffer overflow, executing arbitrary code with the privileges of the Apache service. In the default configuration, the administration pages are available to anyone who is able to access to the web server [[VU#611776](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/611776)].The vulnerable PL/SQL module may also be used by Oracle9i Database and Oracle8i Database. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An unauthenticated remote attacker could cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code on the system with the privileges of the Apache process. Since the Apache service typically runs with SYSTEM privileges on Windows NT and Windows 2000, an attacker may be able to gain complete control of the system. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply Patch**Apply the appropriate patch referenced in [Oracle Security Alert #28](http://otn.oracle.com/deploy/security/pdf/ias_modplsql_alert.pdf). |
| --- |

| **Block or Restrict Access**Monitor and/or restrict access to the Apache HTTP service (typically 80/tcp). It may be possible to use TCP Wrapper or similar technology to provide improved access control and logging. Additionally, an application-level firewall or Intrusion Detection System (IDS) may be able to filter requests made to Apache.Access to the PL/SQL gateway administration web pages can be restricted by specifying authorized user names and connect strings or an administrative Database Access Descriptor (DAD) in the PL/SQL gateway configuration file, /Apache/modplsql/cfg/wdbsvr.app. For more information, read the section titled *Protecting the Administration pages* in the Oracle iAS documentation under*Using the PL/SQL Gateway*.Note that these workarounds are designed to limit access and detect exploit attempts. These workarounds do not prevent exploitation of this vulnerability.**Disable Vulnerable Service**Disable the PL/SQL service (modplsql or mod\_plsql in Apache). |

## Oracle9i Application Server Apache PL/SQL module vulnerable to buffer overflow via HTTP Authorization header

#### Vulnerability Note VU#878603

Original Release Date: 2002-02-28 | Last Revised: 2002-03-15

---

### Overview

A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the Apache Procedural Language/Structured Query Language (PL/SQL) module used by Oracle9i Application Server (iAS). An HTTP Authorization header with a crafted password parameter could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Apache service.

### Description

| [NGSSoftware](http://www.nextgenss.com/) has released Insight Security Research Advisory [#NISR06022002B](http://www.nextgenss.com/advisories/oraplsbos.txt) that describes a number of vulnerabilities in the [Apache](http://www.apache.org/) PL/SQL module used by Oracle9i Application Server (iAS). This document addresses a buffer overflow vulnerability caused by a malformed HTTP Authorization request.  Oracle iAS uses the Apache HTTP Server to provide web services, including access to stored procedures via the Oracle PL/SQL module (modpplsql or mod\_plsql). In iAS, PL/SQL is used to communicate with the database and generate HTML that can be interpreted by a web browser. The PL/SQL module handles authentication requests for various elements of Oracle iAS, such as stored procedures and Database Access Descriptors (DAD). If necessary, the PL/SQL module will prompt for credentials using the Authorization mechanism of the HTTP protocol. Section 14.8 of [RFC 2616](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt) describes HTTP Authorization and [RFC 2617](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2617.txt) describes the Basic and Digest HTTP Authentication schemes. A malformed HTTP Authorization request that contains a crafted password parameter could trigger a buffer overflow, executing arbitrary code with the privileges of the Apache service.The vulnerable PL/SQL module may also be used by Oracle9i Database and Oracle8i Database. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An unauthenticated, remote attacker could cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code on the system with the privileges of the Apache process. Since the Apache service typically runs with SYSTEM privileges on Windows NT and Windows 2000, an attacker may be able to gain complete control of the system. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply Patch**Apply the appropriate patch referenced in [Oracle Security Alert #28](http://otn.oracle.com/deploy/security/pdf/ias_modplsql_alert.pdf). |
| --- |

| **Disable Vulnerable Service**Disable the vulnerable service (modplsql or mod\_plsql in Apache).**Block or Restrict Access**Monitor and/or restrict access to the Apache service (typically 80/tcp). It may be possible to use TCP Wrapper or similar technology to provide improved access control and logging. Additionally, an application-level firewall may be able to filter requests made to Apache. Note that these workarounds are designed to limit access and detect exploit attempts. These workarounds do not prevent exploitation of this vulnerability. |

## Oracle9i Application Server Apache PL/SQL module vulnerable to buffer overflow via Database Access Descriptor password

#### Vulnerability Note VU#659043

Original Release Date: 2002-02-28 | Last Revised: 2002-03-15

---

### Overview

A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the Apache Procedural Language/Structured Query Language (PL/SQL) module used by Oracle9i Application Server (iAS). Specifying a crafted password for a Database Access Descriptor (DAD) could cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Apache service.

### Description

| [NGSSoftware](http://www.nextgenss.com/) has released Insight Security Research Advisory [#NISR06022002B](http://www.nextgenss.com/advisories/oraplsbos.txt) that describes a number of vulnerabilities in the [Apache](http://www.apache.org/) PL/SQL module used by Oracle9i Application Server (iAS). This document addresses a buffer overflow vulnerability caused by a crafted DAD password entered in the PL/SQL gateway configuration page.  Oracle iAS uses the Apache HTTP Server to provide web services, including access to stored procedures via the Oracle PL/SQL module (modpplsql or mod\_plsql). In iAS, PL/SQL is used to communicate with a database and generate HTML that can be interpreted by a web browser. A DAD specifies how a PL/SQL request connects to a database application. The PL/SQL module provides a web-based administration interface to add and configure DADs. When creating a new DAD, specifying a malformed password in the configuration form could trigger a buffer overflow, executing arbitrary code with the privileges of the Apache service. In the default configuration, the administration pages are available to anyone who is able to access to the web server [VU#611776].The vulnerable PL/SQL module may also be used by Oracle9i Database and Oracle8i Database. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An unauthenticated remote attacker could cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code on the system with the privileges of the Apache process. Since the Apache service typically runs with SYSTEM privileges on Windows NT and Windows 2000, an attacker may be able to gain complete control of the system. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply Patch**Apply the appropriate patch referenced in [Oracle Security Alert #28](http://otn.oracle.com/deploy/security/pdf/ias_modplsql_alert.pdf). |
| --- |

| **Block or Restrict Access**Monitor and/or restrict access to the Apache HTTP service (typically 80/tcp). It may be possible to use TCP Wrapper or similar technology to provide improved access control and logging. Additionally, an application-level firewall or Intrusion Detection System (IDS) may be able to filter requests made to Apache.Access to the PL/SQL gateway administration web pages can be restricted by specifying authorized user names and connect strings or an administrative Database Access Descriptor (DAD) in the PL/SQL gateway configuration file, /Apache/modplsql/cfg/wdbsvr.app. For more information, read the section titled *Using the PL/SQL Gateway* in the Oracle iAS documentation for the *Oracle HTTP Server powered by Apache*.Note that these workarounds are designed to limit access and detect exploit attempts. These workarounds do not prevent exploitation of this vulnerability.**Disable Vulnerable Service**Disable the PL/SQL service (modplsql or mod\_plsql in Apache). |
