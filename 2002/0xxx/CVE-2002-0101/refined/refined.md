- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a flaw in how Internet Explorer handles the `showModelessDialog()` JavaScript function. When this function is called repeatedly in a loop, it creates an infinite number of modeless dialog boxes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The core weakness is the lack of proper resource management when `showModelessDialog()` is called in a loop. It doesn't limit the number of dialogs that can be created, allowing for a denial of service.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exploitation results in a denial-of-service condition. The continuous creation of dialog boxes consumes system resources, including CPU, making the Internet Explorer unresponsive. The issue persists even after closing the main browser window and can require a system reboot.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a malicious HTML page containing JavaScript code that repeatedly calls `showModelessDialog()`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker only needs to host or provide a link to the malicious HTML page. The user must open this page in a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer.
