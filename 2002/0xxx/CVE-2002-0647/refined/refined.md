The provided document describes multiple vulnerabilities addressed by Microsoft Security Bulletin MS02-047. One of these vulnerabilities is identified as CVE-2002-0647.

**Vulnerability:** Buffer Overrun in Legacy Text Formatting ActiveX Control (CAN-2002-0647)

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** An obsolete ActiveX control used for certain types of text formatting contains an unchecked buffer. By providing malformed input values, an attacker can cause the control to take arbitrary actions.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unchecked buffer in an ActiveX control.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability can gain the ability to take any action on a user's system that the user himself could take, including running programs, communicating with web sites, reformatting the hard drive, or taking other actions.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attacker could exploit the vulnerability either by hosting a specially crafted web page on a web site, or by sending such a web page to another user as an HTML email.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to create a web page that calls the vulnerable ActiveX control with a malformed input value.

The document also provides the following information about the vulnerability:

*   The vulnerable ActiveX control is not installed by default but is downloaded automatically. Microsoft removed the control from its download site upon discovery of the vulnerability.
*   Users of Outlook Express 6.0, Outlook 98 and Outlook 2000 with the Outlook Email Security Update, and Outlook 2002 are not at risk from email attacks because they read HTML mail in the Restricted Sites zone.
*   The patch eliminates the vulnerability by setting the "kill bit" on the affected ActiveX control, preventing it from being executed within Internet Explorer.
