Based on the content, here's an analysis of the Dino's WebServer v1.2 vulnerability:

*   **Vulnerability:** Denial of Service (DoS), potentially caused by a buffer overflow or heap overflow.
*   **Root Cause:** The server hangs at 99% CPU usage when processing a series of long GET requests. The author suspects a heap or buffer overflow occurs during the process of copying GET requests into a log window.
*   **Weakness:** The application copies the request string, which can lead to an overflow when handling long requests.
*   **Impact:** The server becomes unresponsive and cannot handle other requests, requiring a restart.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a series of long GET requests (e.g., `GET /<60,000 A's> HTTP/1.0`) within a short period (1-2 seconds).
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server. Sending a single long request is not enough to trigger the vulnerability; it requires multiple requests in quick succession.
*   **Additional Details:** The vulnerability was tested on Windows 2000 Pro SP1 and Windows NT4.0 Work SP6. The author was unable to contact the vendor.
