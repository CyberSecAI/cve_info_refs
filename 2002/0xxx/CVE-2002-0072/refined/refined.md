Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2002-0072:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Microsoft IIS handles error conditions arising from ISAPI filters. Specifically, when an ISAPI filter (such as those used by FrontPage Server Extensions or ASP.NET) encounters a URL exceeding its maximum allowed length, it replaces the URL with a null value.  IIS then attempts to process this null URL when sending an error message to the client, leading to an access violation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper error handling in IIS when dealing with null URLs returned by ISAPI filters
- Lack of proper input validation when processing error messages.
- ISAPI filters (specifically FrontPage Server Extensions and ASP.NET) which generate the described error condition with excessively long URLs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS). Exploiting this vulnerability causes the IIS service to crash, disrupting web services. 
-  On IIS 5.0 and 5.1, the service automatically restarts, but the vulnerability can be used for sustained attacks. On IIS 4.0, manual restart of service is required.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a web request to an affected server which triggers an ISAPI filter to return a null URL.
- This can be done by supplying an excessively long URL to a web server running a vulnerable ISAPI filter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to a vulnerable IIS server.
- The server must have either FrontPage Server Extensions or ASP.NET installed. Note: FrontPage Server Extensions are often installed by default. ASP.NET is not installed by default.
