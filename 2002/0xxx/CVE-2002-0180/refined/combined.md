Release  : April 15 2002
Author   : Spybreak (spybreak@host.sk)
Software : Webalizer
Version  : 2.01-09, 2.01-06
URL      : <http://www.mrunix.net/webalizer/>
Status   : vendor contacted
Problems : remote buffer overflow

--- INTRO ---

The Webalizer is a web server log file analysis program
which produces usage statistics in HTML format for
viewing with a browser.  The results are presented in both
columnar and  graphical format, which facilitates
interpretation.

Webalizer 2.01-06 is a part of the Red Hat Linux 7.2
distribution, enabled by default and run daily by the cron
daemon.

--- PROBLEM ---

The webalizer has the ability to perform reverse DNS lookups.
This ability is disabled by default, but if enabled, an
attacker with command over his own DNS service, has the
ability to gain remote root acces to a machine, due to a remote
buffer overflow in the reverse resolving code.

## webalizer vulnerable to buffer overflow when performing reverse DNS lookups

#### Vulnerability Note VU#582923

Original Release Date: 2002-10-28 | Last Revised: 2002-10-28

---

### Overview

A remotely exploitable buffer overflow exists in all versions of webalizer prior to version 2.01-10.

### Description

| [webalizer](http://www.mrunix.net/webalizer/) is a web server log file analysis program.  webalizer has the ability do resolve hostnames as part of the process of generating reports. A buffer overflow exists in the code that resolves the hostnames. As a result, an attacker controlled DNS server can send an unusually large DNS response message and corrupt the data produced by the program and/or gain root privileges. Note that webalizer would have to be actively performing a DNS lookup in order for this vulnerability to be exploited. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker controlled DNS server can send an unusually large DNS response message and corrupt the data produced by the program and/or gain root privileges. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Apply a vendor patch. If a patch is not available, upgrade to version 2.01-10 or later. |
