Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2002-0722:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an error in how Internet Explorer (IE) determines the origin of a file in the File Download dialog box when processing a specially crafted URL. Specifically, when the download URL contains certain special characters, IE stops displaying the correct download location.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **File Origin Spoofing:**  A specially formed URL can cause IE to display a misleading origin for a downloaded file, making it appear as if it's coming from a trusted source, when it's not.
- The download itself isn't affected, but the displayed origin is incorrect.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Social Engineering:** Attackers can trick users into downloading and executing malicious files by making them believe the files are from a trusted source.
- **Compromise:** If the user opens the downloaded file, it could perform any action that the user could perform on the system, potentially leading to system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Pages:** An attacker can host a web page with a specially crafted URL that initiates a file download.
- **HTML Emails:** The crafted URL can be embedded within an HTML email, and when the user clicks on the link, the file download can be initiated, showing a spoofed origin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Crafted URL:** The attacker needs to create a URL with specific characters that cause IE to misrepresent the file origin.
- **Hosting or Sending Malicious Link:** The attacker needs to host the malicious URL on a website or send it via email.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker requires user interaction to download and open the file after the download dialog is displayed.  The user must choose to save or open the file for exploitation to occur.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is similar to the "file extension spoofing" issue.
- The user has to make the decision to open or save the file.
- The patch addresses the issue by ensuring that IE correctly determines and displays the origin of a file download.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" severity across internet servers, intranet servers, and client systems.
