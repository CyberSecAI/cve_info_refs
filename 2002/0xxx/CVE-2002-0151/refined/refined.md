- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An unchecked buffer in the Multiple UNC Provider (MUP) service when processing file requests. Specifically, while the first buffer allocation has input checking, the second copy of the file request does not, which is sent to a redirector.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer overflow vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    -  Local privilege escalation, allowing the attacker to execute code with Local System privileges.
    -  System failure (denial of service) by causing a system crash or reboot.
    -  Complete control over the machine, including the ability to add, delete, or modify data, create/delete user accounts, and add accounts to the local administrators group.
- **Attack vectors**:
    -  A local attacker must log on interactively and execute a specially crafted program that exploits the MUP service.
    -  The attack requires the ability to log onto the target machine and run code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Must have valid user credentials to log on to the target system.
    -  Must be able to execute code on the local system.
