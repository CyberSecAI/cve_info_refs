On a Citrix server supporting applications running off of a Novell Directory Services \
network, I found that additional information about the victim network can be \
discovered.

After opening the applist.asp page and seeing all configured applications, without \
authentication, I clicked on one of the apps. Another browser window opened with the \
following error:

There was an error:
This operation requires user credentials to be specified. The following session field \
was not set: NFUSE_USER

while opening the URL of:

<http://nfuse.insecureMSserver.com/launch.asp?NFuse_Application=LookOut&NFuse_MIMEExtension=.ica>

I appended &NFUSE_USER=ABM&NFUSE_PASSWORD=byte-me to the URL. Note that the two \
parameters NFUSE_USER and NFUSE_PASSWORD were supplied with bogus parameters.

After a short period of time, Citrix presented me with a Novell client login screen. \
By clicking the Advanced button, I was able to browse Novell Directory Services for \
all tree, organizational units, and server names contained on the network. In the \
NT/2000 tab of the client, I was able to ascertain the name of the AD domain, and the \
server name hosting the Citrix published application.

As was and is still the case, as far as I can tell this bug only the exposes network \
information. But, exposure of information such as this is great for recognizance \
preceding further attacks.

I tested with a bogus application name after the NFuse_Application parameter, but \
only with a valid app name is this a problem.
