The provided content describes two vulnerabilities in Kazaa, Grokster, and Morpheus clients which utilize FastTrack's peer-to-peer technology.

**Vulnerability 1: Remote Denial of Service**

*   **Root Cause:** The clients open a new pop-up window for every received message if the sender's username is not ignored. The client does not check available memory, leading to resource exhaustion when a large number of messages are sent, causing the system to become unstable, hang, or crash.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of input validation and resource management when handling incoming messages.
*   **Impact:** Remote system exhaustion, leading to instability, hangs, or crashes and loss of downloaded data. Reboot may be required.
*  **Attack Vectors:** Sending multiple crafted HTTP messages to a vulnerable client.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities:**  An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP messages to the victim's machine via port 1214.

**Vulnerability 2: Identity Faking**

*   **Root Cause:** The message system allows attackers to easily fake the sender's identity within the `X-Kazaa-Username` and `X-Kazaa-Network` headers. This can be used to trick users into divulging information via private messages.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of proper authentication or verification of the sender's identity in the message service.
*   **Impact:** Users can be tricked into revealing sensitive information by believing they are communicating with a trusted entity.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Sending crafted HTTP messages with manipulated sender information
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP messages to the victim's machine via port 1214.

The provided document also includes C code for exploiting both vulnerabilities: `kazaa-xploit.c` for the denial of service and `kazaa-msg.c` for faking identity.
