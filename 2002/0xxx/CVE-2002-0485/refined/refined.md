Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the inconsistent handling of case sensitivity in HTTP headers, specifically `Content-Type` and `Content-Disposition`. While most Mail User Agents (MUAs) ignore the case of these headers, some content filtering software may treat them as case-sensitive.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Case Sensitivity Mismatch:** The primary vulnerability lies in the differing interpretations of header case sensitivity between MUAs and some content filtering software. MUAs generally ignore case, whereas vulnerable filtering software might enforce it.
*   **Header Manipulation:** Attackers can exploit this by crafting email headers with non-standard capitalization of `Content-Type` and `Content-Disposition` to bypass filtering rules.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Content Filtering Bypass:** Successful exploitation allows malicious content (like viruses) to bypass content filtering software, potentially infecting systems.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Email Headers:** The primary attack vector is crafting malicious emails with specially capitalized headers like `CONTENT-type` instead of `Content-Type`.
*   **Attached Files:** The exploit is used to disguise malicious attachments, such as a file named "eicar.com" within the email.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Email Sending Capability:** The attacker needs the ability to send crafted emails.
*   **Understanding of Email Header Structure:** The attacker needs to understand how to craft and manipulate email headers.
*  **Awareness of Vulnerable Filtering Software:** The attacker must know that the target uses a filtering software vulnerable to this case-sensitivity issue.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is reported to affect NAV (Norton AntiVirus).
*   McAfee and KAV (Kaspersky AntiVirus) are reported to be unaffected by this specific bypass technique.
* The provided text refers to a whitepaper which was updated to include this method for bypassing content filtering software.
