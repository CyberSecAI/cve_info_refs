-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
For Immediate Disclosure
=============== SUMMARY ================
Title: Apache 2.0 vulnerability affects non-Unix platforms
Date: 9th August 2002
Revision: 2
Product Name: Apache HTTP server 2.0
OS/Platform: Windows, OS2, Netware
Permanent URL: http://httpd.apache.org/info/security\_bulletin\_20020809a.txt
Vendor Name: Apache Software Foundation
Vendor URL: http://httpd.apache.org/
Affects: All Released versions of 2.0 through 2.0.39
Fixed in: 2.0.40
Identifiers: CVE-2002-0661
=============== DESCRIPTION ================
Apache is a powerful, full-featured, efficient, and freely-available Web
server. On the 7th August 2002, The Apache Software Foundation was
notified of the discovery of a significant vulnerability, identified by
Auriemma Luigi .
This vulnerability has the potential to allow an attacker to inflict
serious damage to a server, and reveal sensitive data. This vulnerability
affects default installations of the Apache web server.
Unix and other variant platforms appear unaffected. Cygwin users are
likely to be affected.
=============== SOLUTION ================
A simple one line workaround in the httpd.conf file will close the
vulnerability. Prior to the first 'Alias' or 'Redirect' directive, add
the following directive to the global server configuration:
RedirectMatch 400 "\\\.\."
Fixes for this vulnerability are also included in Apache HTTP server
version 2.0.40. The 2.0.40 release also contains fixes for two minor
path-revealing exposures. This release of Apache is available at
http://downloads.apache.org/httpd/
More information will be made available by the Apache Software
Foundation and Auriemma Luigi  in the
coming weeks.
=============== REFERENCES ================
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name CVE-2002-0661 to this issue.

Auriemma Luigi, PivX security advisory AL#001

Application: Apache WebServer (<http://httpd.apache.org>)
Version:     2.0.39 and previous 2.0.x, ONLY on systems that supports
             backslash path delimiters (Win/Netware/OS2 etc...)
Bug:         Directory traversal vulnerability and path disclosure
Risk (high): An attacker can view ANY file in the system and execute
             code on it.
             An attacker can view the path where is located the
             server.

######################################################################

1) Introduction
2) Bug
3) The Code
4) Fix
5) Philosophy

----------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Introduction

The bug I have found about the directory traversal can be classified
as a high risk bug and the path disclosure as a low risk.
With the first bug an attacker can see every file in the system and
execute it using the /cgi-bin/ path.
The bug was shown to the Apache Group some minutes after it's being
discovered. The bug was quickly fixed.
The second bug instead is a simple path disclosure bug, useful for
obtaining more info about the server (important if the administrator
hide some information)

- IMPORTANT NOTE -

The ASF recommends all Win32, Netware and OS2 users immediately
upgrade to the 2.0.40 or, temporary, apply the fix suggested in the
Fix section of this advisory.
It is also suggested that any of the un*x-flavors also should consider
upgrading to 2.0.40 to eliminate the path-revealing bugs that apply to
all versions.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

2) Bug

A) CAN-2002-0654
----------------

The bug is not dangerous because it does not give remote access to the
system or other data accesses but for an attacker it is useful in
gathering detaild information about the server to launch other
malicious attacks.
With this bug we can see the path where Apache is installed, so we can
know if the server run on a Windows machine, if it is the second
version of Apache (Apache2) and naturally the server version (all of
the the info is useful if the administrator has obscured the Server
field or other info about the server, so if the bug is present, we
know for example that the Apache installed is a version prior the
2.0.40).

However let's go with the example.

From the browser we must insert the following string:
<http://127.0.0.1/error/HTTP_NOT_FOUND.html.var>

Then the server will answer with this page:

> Not Acceptable
>
> An appropriate representation of the requested resource \
> /error/HTTP_NOT_FOUND.html.var could not be found on this server.
> Available variants:
>
> * C:/server/Apache Group/Apache2/error/HTTP_NOT_FOUND.html.var , type text/html, \
> language de
> * C:/server/Apache Group/Apache2/error/HTTP_NOT_FOUND.html.var , type text/html, \
> language en
> * C:/server/Apache Group/Apache2/error/HTTP_NOT_FOUND.html.var , type text/html, \
> language es
> * C:/server/Apache Group/Apache2/error/HTTP_NOT_FOUND.html.var , type text/html, \
> language fr

As we can see, the server answer with the full path of the file we
have requested.
We can request all the files .var in the error folder and we will have
the same result.

More detailed info can be found on the Apache website
<http://httpd.apache.org>

---

B) CAN-2002-0661
----------------

The problem is in the management of the bad chars that can be used to
launch some attacks, such as the directory traversal. In fact the
backslash char ('\' == %5c) is not checked as a bad char, so it can be
used for seeking the directories of systems that use it as a path
delimiter (Windows, Netware, OS2 and others).

Then another problem is that the attacker can execute commands on the
remote host simply using the /cgi-bin/ path.

The following are two simple examples.

for view the file winnt\win.ini:
[http://127.0.0.1/error/%5c%2e%2e%5c%2e%2e%5c%2e%2e%5c%2e%2e%5cwinnt%5cwin.ini](http://127.0.0.1/error/%5C..%5C..%5C..%5C..%5Cwinnt%5Cwin.ini)

for run the wintty utility in the Apache2/bin folder:
[http://127.0.0.1/cgi-bin/%5c%2e%2e%5cbin%5cwintty.exe?%2dt+HELLO](http://127.0.0.1/cgi-bin/%5C..%5Cbin%5Cwintty.exe?%2dt+HELLO)

In human readable form, they mean:
[http://127.0.0.1/error/\..\..\..\..\winnt\win.ini](http://127.0.0.1/error/%5C..%5C..%5C..%5C..%5Cwinnt%5Cwin.ini)
[http://127.0.0.1/cgi-bin/\..\bin\wintty.exe?-t+HELLO](http://127.0.0.1/cgi-bin/%5C..%5Cbin%5Cwintty.exe?-t+HELLO)

So in the first example we go down to the root path with \..\..\..\..\
because we are in "c:\program files\Apache Group\Apache2\error".
Instead in the second example we use the /cgi-bin/ path and we pass
arguments with "file.exe?arg1+arg2+arg3+...".

More detailed info will be found on the Apache website
<http://httpd.apache.org>

----------------------------------------------------------------------

3) The Code

Look the examples in section 2.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

4) Fix

Apache 2.0.40 from Apache website (<http://httpd.apache.org>)

However this is a simple workaround suggested by the Apache Group for
the directory traversal bug:

---
A simple one line workaround in the httpd.conf file will disallow the
vulnerability. Prior to the first 'Alias' or 'Redirect' directive, add
the following directive to the global server configuration:

RedirectMatch 400 "\\\.\."

---

----------------------------------------------------------------------

5) Philosophy

I'm really hopeful about the FULL-DISCLOSURE policy, because with it
"everyone" can know the real effects of an attack, the real danger of
a bug, someone can learn a bit of creative programming (I have learned
a bit of interesting C from the source code of some published
exploits under this policy) and it's useful for all the people that
are hopeful in this type of disclosure.
No secrets!
