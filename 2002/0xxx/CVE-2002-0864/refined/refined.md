Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described as CVE-2002-0864:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) implementation in Windows XP handles specific types of malformed data packets during the initial connection phase. Specifically, a crafted "PDU Confirm Active" packet with a disabled Pattern BLT command can trigger the issue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The RDP implementation in Windows XP (RDP 5.1) fails to properly validate incoming data packets, particularly the "PDU Confirm Active" packet with the Pattern BLT command disabled.
*   **Denial of Service:** This lack of validation leads to a system failure when processing the malformed packet.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploiting this vulnerability results in the complete failure of the Windows XP system, requiring a reboot to restore normal operation.
*   **Loss of Unsaved Data:** Any unsaved data present on the affected system is lost when the system crashes.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based Attack:** An attacker needs to send a crafted "PDU Confirm Active" packet to the RDP port (TCP 3389) of the vulnerable Windows XP machine.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to the system or establish a valid RDP session to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the target system on port 3389. This could be on the same local network or potentially from the internet if port 3389 is exposed (although this is not default).
*   **Packet Crafting:** The attacker needs the technical ability to craft a malformed "PDU Confirm Active" RDP packet with a disabled Pattern BLT command (as described in the exploit).
*   **Knowledge of RDP Protocol:** An understanding of the Remote Desktop Protocol is required to create the necessary malformed packets.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability only affects Windows XP, not Windows 2000 or Windows NT 4.0.
* The Remote Desktop service is not enabled by default in Windows XP, so systems with the service disabled are not vulnerable.
* Firewalls that block port 3389 can mitigate the risk of remote exploitation.
* The issue is resolved by a patch that makes the Remote Desktop service handle malformed packets gracefully.
