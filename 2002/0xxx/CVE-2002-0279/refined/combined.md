     ----------------------------------------------------------
     HP-UX Systems running snmpd or OPENVIEW
     ----------------------------------------------------------
     Any HP-UX 10.X or 11.X system running snmpd or snmpdm is
     vulnerable.  To determine if your HP-UX system has snmpd
     or snmpdm installed:

       swlist -l file | grep snmpd

B. Fixing the problem
   Install the appropriate patch or firmware revision or work
   around problem as detailed below.

C. Recommended solution
    ---------------------------------------------------------
    hp procurve switch 2524
    ---------------------------------------------------------
    No known workaround.  Patches are in process.

    ---------------------------------------------------------
    NNM  (Network Node Manager)
    ---------------------------------------------------------
    Disable snmpd and snmpdm as detailed for HP-UX below.
    Patches are in process.

    ---------------------------------------------------------
    MC/ServiceGuard
    ---------------------------------------------------------
    Concerning the impact of disabling the SNMP agent on nodes
    in MC/ServiceGuard or ServiceGuard OPS Edition clusters:

    If SNMP is disabled on nodes running in MC/ServiceGuard
    or ServiceGuard OPS Edition clusters, it will no longer be
    possible for cluster monitoring applications that use the
    cluster SNMP MIB to obtain the correct status for the cluster.

    Examples of such applications are ClusterView, ClusterView Plus
    or EMS High Availability Monitors, which all receive
    cluster-related SNMP information from the cluster nodes.

    This means that these applications will no longer display the
    correct status for the cluster, including the cluster starting
    or halting, nodes leaving or joining the cluster, and application
    packages starting up or halting in the cluster.

      NOTE:  All supported versions of MC/ServiceGuard as well as
             ServiceGuard OPS Edition are affected by this issue.

             The ServiceGuard Manager product does not use the cluster
             SNMP MIB, and therefore is _NOT_ affected by the
             disabling of SNMP on cluster nodes.

    ---------------------------------------------------------
    Event Monitoring System  (EMS)
    ---------------------------------------------------------
    It should also be noted that if an MC/ServiceGuard or ServiceGuard
    OPS Edition application package has package resources defined
    that use EMS High Availability Monitors, then those package
    resources will no longer contain the current status for the
    cluster.  It may be necessary to remove the definition for these
    package resources in order to allow continued operation of the
    package after SNMP has been disabled.

    ---------------------------------------------------------
    JetDirect Firmware (older versions only)
    ---------------------------------------------------------
    Update firmware to X.08.32(or higher) or  X.21.00(or higher)
    as applicable.

    ----------------------------------------------------------
    HP-UX Systems running snmpd or OPENVIEW
    ----------------------------------------------------------
    The following patches are available now:

     PHSS_26137    s700_800  HP-UX 10.20 OV EMANATE14.2 Agent$
     PHSS_26138    s700_800  HP-UX 11.X  OV EMANATE14.2 Agent$
     PSOV_03087    Solaris 2.X      EMANATE Release 14.2 $

    All three patches are available from:

     <http://support.openview.hp.com/cpe/patches/>

    In addition PHSS_26137 and PHSS_26138 will soon be available
    from:

     <http://itrc.hp.com>

  ============================================================
   NOTE: The patches are labeled OV (Open View).  However, the
   patches are also applicable to systems that are _NOT_
   running Open View.
  ============================================================

    Workaround for HP-UX Systems:

    If a patch is not available for your platform or you cannot
    install an available patch, snmpd and snmpdm can be disabled
    by removing their entries from /etc/services and removing the
    execute permissions from /usr/sbin/snmpd and /usr/sbin/snmpdm.
