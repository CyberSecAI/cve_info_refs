The provided content describes a vulnerability in Greymatter versions 1.21c and earlier, where administrator login credentials can be exposed.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the "Add Bookmarklets" feature, which creates a `gmrightclick*.reg` file containing the administrator's username and password in clear text. This file is placed in a publicly accessible directory (often `/archive/`)

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1.  **Cleartext password storage:** The administrator's password is stored in cleartext within the `gmrightclick*.reg` file.
2.  **Insecure file permissions:** Default file permissions of 666 for many CGI scripts in the Greymatter install.
3.  **Predictable file location:** The `gmrightclick*.reg` files are often placed in a predictable directory, such as `/archive/`, making them easily discoverable.
4.  **Lack of secure configuration:** The bookmarklet functionality creates the vulnerability unless a clear function is configured and used.
5.  **Insecure bookmarklet feature:** The feature generates a registry file that contains the password and username.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to obtain the administrator's username and password, granting full administrative access to the Greymatter site. This allows the attacker to:
* Post to the blog.
* Erase entries.
* Upload files.
* Potentially gain further access to the underlying server depending on the privileges of the web server.

**Attack vectors:**
1.  **Direct access to the `gmrightclick*.reg` file:** Attackers can directly access the file by browsing to the publicly accessible directory or by using search engines to locate the file based on the filename.
2.  **Access Log Snooping:** As the cleartext password is included in the HREF when rebuilding threads, it can be located via access logs.
3. **Brute force file location:** It may be possible to brute force the file location.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
1.  **Network access:** The attacker needs network access to the Greymatter site.
2. **Basic web navigation skills:** To locate the `gmrightclick` file.
3.  **Knowledge of default install locations:** To find the vulnerable file in common locations like `/archive/`.
