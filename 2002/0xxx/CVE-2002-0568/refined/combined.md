## Oracle 9iAS default configuration allows arbitrary users to view sensitive configuration files

#### Vulnerability Note VU#476619

Original Release Date: 2002-03-06 | Last Revised: 2002-03-06

---

### Overview

It is possible to read the "XSQLConfig.xml" and "soapConfig.xml" configuration files from an Oracle 9i Application Server under the default installation without any authorization. This can lead to an intruder gaining access to sensitive information about the server and potentially compromising it.

### Description

| The XSQL configuration and SOAP configuration files contain sensitive information such as the database server host name, user ID's and passwords. Since these files are not protected by default, any user can access it directly through a virtual directory and view the contents. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An intruder can gain sensitive information about the configuration of the server. This information can be used to compromise the server. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Apply the appropriate permissions to these files, please see Oracle's [Security Alert](http://otn.oracle.com/deploy/security/pdf/ojvm_alert.pdf) on this issue. |
| --- |

| Apply the appropriate permissions to the "XSQLConfig.xml" and "soapConfig.xml" configuration files. |

## History

The CERT Division is the birthplace of cybersecurity. For nearly 30 years, the CERT Division of the SEI has partnered with government, industry, law enforcement, and academia to advance cybersecurity and improve the security and resilience of computer systems and networks.

Originally focused on incident response, we have expanded into cybersecurity areas such as network situational awareness, malicious code analysis, secure coding, resilience management, insider threats, digital investigations and intelligence, workforce development, DevOps, forensics, software assurance, vulnerability discovery and analysis, and risk management.

## Former Director Richard Pethia

[Richard Pethia](/about/leadership/display.cfm?customel_datapageid_2623=3545) was founding director of the SEI's CERT Division. Pethia, who served as director of CERT from 1988 to 2016, guided the organization through tremendous growth and change. Under Pethia's leadership, the unit expanded and evolved from the CERT Coordination Center—a small group focused on computer incident response—to a research organization of more than 200 professionals dedicated to solving problems with widespread cybersecurity implications.

Howdy,
I've written a white-paper, "Hackproofing Oracle Application Server." It
covers vulnerable areas and what must done to secure the box. Anyone
