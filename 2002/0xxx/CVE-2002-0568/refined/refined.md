Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2002-0568:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the default configuration of Oracle 9i Application Server which does not properly protect sensitive configuration files. Specifically, "XSQLConfig.xml" and "soapConfig.xml" are accessible without any authorization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Default Configuration:** The application server is configured by default to allow unauthorized access to sensitive files.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The "XSQLConfig.xml" and "soapConfig.xml" files contain sensitive information such as database server hostnames, user IDs, and passwords.
*   **Lack of Access Control:**  There is a lack of proper access control on the configuration files, allowing any user to read them.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Information Exposure:** Attackers can gain access to sensitive server configuration details, potentially including database connection strings with user credentials.
*   **Server Compromise:** The disclosed information can be used to further compromise the server and potentially other systems connected to it.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct URL Access:** Attackers can directly access the vulnerable files through virtual directories.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** Attackers require network access to the Oracle 9i Application Server. They do not require prior authentication or privileged access to the system.

**Summary of vulnerability details:**

The vulnerability stems from a failure to secure sensitive configuration files by default in Oracle 9i Application Server. This lack of access control allows remote, unauthenticated users to access these files containing potentially critical information, that could lead to a full system compromise. The vulnerability is present due to the insecure default configuration and lack of access controls over the affected files.
