Entercept Ricochet Advisory
Solaris snmpdx Vulnerabilities
<http://www.entercept.com/news/uspr/06-03-02.asp>

DETAILS
An unchecked buffer in Sun's Solaris SNMP component can be overrun and remotely \
exploited, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges. There \
is also a format string vulnerability in Solaris that can be exploited, allowing a \
hacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges. The buffer overflow occurs in \
the MIB parsing component and the format string vulnerability in the logging \
component of snmpdx, which is installed by default with the Solaris Operating System. \
Exploiting these vulnerabilities would give an attacker complete control of the \
attacked server.  VERSIONS AFFECTED
Solaris 2.6, 7, and 8
FIX INFORMATION
Entercept worked closely with the Sun Security team, while they developed a patch. \
Information on the patch is available at Sun's Security Bulletin #00219 at \
<http://sunsolve.sun.com/pub-cgi/secBulletin.pl>.
