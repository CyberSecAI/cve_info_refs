Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** An unchecked buffer in the MIB parsing component of the Solaris SNMP daemon (snmpdx).
*   **Format String Vulnerability:** A format string vulnerability in the logging component of the snmpdx daemon.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unchecked Buffer:** The MIB parsing component fails to properly validate the size of input data, leading to a buffer overflow.
*   **Format String Vulnerability:** The logging component does not sanitize format strings, allowing an attacker to inject format specifiers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of either vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the vulnerable system.
*   **Complete System Control:** This gives the attacker full control of the targeted server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation:** Both vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely.
*   **SNMP Service:** The vulnerabilities are located in the Solaris SNMP daemon (snmpdx), which is installed by default.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable system running the snmpdx service.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerabilities:** The attacker needs to know how to trigger either the buffer overflow in the MIB parsing component or the format string vulnerability in the logging component.

**Additional Notes:**
* The advisory mentions that Entercept worked with Sun to develop a patch.
* Patches were released by Sun as noted in Security Bulletin #00219.
