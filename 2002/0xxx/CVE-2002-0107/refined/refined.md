Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the CacheOS web administration interface (running on port 8081 by default) improperly handling HTTP requests. Specifically, the server responds differently to requests that omit the HTTP version (e.g., `GET /Secure/Local/console/cmhome.htm` without `HTTP/1.0`) compared to requests that include it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** By sending a specific request without the HTTP version (e.g., `GET /Secure/Local/console/cmhome.htm`), the CacheOS server sometimes includes snippets of data from recently cached URLs in its 404 error response. This data can include sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, form contents, and URLs.
*   **Inconsistent Response Handling:** The server's inconsistent behavior when dealing with requests lacking the HTTP version (sometimes responding with "Request cannot be honored," other times with a 404 error containing cached data) indicates a flaw in input validation and error handling.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Exposure of Sensitive Information:** An attacker can potentially steal user credentials (usernames, passwords), form data, and other sensitive information transmitted through the cache.
*   **Compromise of User Accounts:** The extracted credentials can lead to the compromise of user accounts and potentially further attacks.
*   **Privacy Breach:** The exposure of URLs and content can breach user privacy.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the CacheOS server, specifically to port 8081.
*   **HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending specific, malformed HTTP GET requests to the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker must be on the network and able to connect to the CacheOS server on the specific port (8081).
*   **Basic Network Tools:** Tools such as telnet or netcat (nc) can be used to send the malformed requests.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without needing any prior authentication.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory specifically states that the vulnerability was tested on CacheOS v3.1.* versions and all were found vulnerable. They did not test version 4.*.
*   The vendor was contacted but there was no confirmation on whether a patch was released for this vulnerability.
