- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The "Simple, secure webserver 1.1" component of Symantec firewalls does not handle DNS lookup failures properly. When a CONNECT request is made to a domain with a missing or flawed DNS server, the webserver waits for a timeout, during which it becomes unresponsive to other clients.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Denial-of-service vulnerability due to inefficient handling of DNS resolution failures.
    - Lack of proper forking or request handling mechanism while waiting for DNS timeout.
    - The vulnerability exists regardless of ACL rules.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can cause a denial-of-service condition by sending HTTP CONNECT requests to domains with non-responsive DNS servers. This makes the firewall unresponsive to other clients.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can send specifically crafted HTTP CONNECT requests to the vulnerable webserver.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to connect to the proxy server from the outside.
