Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `crontab` application in SCO OpenServer 5.0.6 contains a format string vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Format string vulnerability in the `crontab` application.
- The application is installed with setgid `cron` permissions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Local users can elevate their privileges to the `cron` group and potentially to higher privileges due to the nature of the `crontab` utility.
- Arbitrary code execution, leading to privilege escalation.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local user execution of the `crontab` command with format string specifiers, such as `%x%x%x%x`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a local user on the affected SCO OpenServer 5.0.6 system.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability allows an attacker to execute code by using format string specifiers within the `crontab` command.
- The `crontab` application, being setgid `cron`, provides the attacker with the initial `cron` group privileges, paving the way for higher privilege escalation.
- The provided example shows that inputting `%x%x%x%x` to `crontab` results in an attempt to open a file with an address as its name, indicating the format string vulnerability.
