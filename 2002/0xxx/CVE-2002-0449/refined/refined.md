Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability Details for CVE-2002-0449**

*   **Root Cause:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in `webpsvc.exe`, a system service component of Talentsoft's Web+ development platform. This service is used by the `webplus.exe` CGI program.
*   **Weakness:** The vulnerability occurs when an overly long character string is sent to `webplus.exe`, which then passes it to `webpsvc.exe`. This causes a buffer overflow in `webpsvc.exe`, overwriting the saved return address on the stack.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running `webpsvc.exe`. Since `webpsvc.exe` typically runs as the SYSTEM user, this leads to a privilege escalation and full system compromise.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attack vector is through a specially crafted URI request to a web site running Web+. The `webplus.exe` CGI program is the initial point of entry.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker needs the ability to send a crafted URI request to a vulnerable web server. They don't require any special access to the server beyond the ability to send HTTP requests.

**Additional Information:**
* The vulnerability was reported to Talentsoft by NGSSoftware on February 12, 2002.
*   A patch has been made available by the vendor.
*  The vulnerability is present in Web+ v5.0 and affects IIS 4/5 on Windows NT/2000.
*   The vulnerability is described as a "High Risk" issue.
