Severity:  High Risk
Vendor URL:   <http://www.oracle.com/>
Author:   David Litchfield (david@nextgenss.com)

Issue
*****
Attackers can execute any function in any library remotely on a system
running Oracle's database server without a user ID or password.

Description
***********
A large part of Oracle database functionality is provided by PL/SQL
packages. PL/SQL, or Procedural Language/ Structured Query Language, extends
SQL and allows an "executable" package be created that exports procedures
and functions. PL/SQL packages can be extended to call functions exported by
operating system libraries or Dynamic Link Libraries. It is possible to
create a (PL/SQL) library and PL/SQL package that calls any function in any
library on the file system. An attack would probably call system() and pass
the name of a program to be executed. It is apparent that to do this a user
must be able to connect to the Oracle database server and login with an
account that has the CREATE LIBRARY permission before an attack becomes
successful. However, NGSSoftware Insight Security Research has discovered a
way to fool the Oracle database server into loading arbitrary libraries and
executing arbitrary functions without ever having to authenticate.

Details
*******
When a PL/SQL package executing in the database is required to run an
external procedure the oracle process connects to the Listener and requests
that the Listener load the relevant library, call the function and pass the
function any parameters passed to it. The Listener does not load the library
into its own process address space but rather launches another process,
extproc on Unix systems or extproc.exe on Windows platforms, and directs
oracle to connect to it. Oracle obliges and connects to the extproc process
using named pipes and makes the same request that it made to the listener.
Extproc loads the library and calls the function. There is no authentication
performed anywhere in all of this. This opens up a glaring and extremely
dangerous security hole.

It is possible for an attacker to masquerade as an Oracle process and
execute any function in any DLL on the file system. What exacerbates this
problem is that, even though communication normally goes over named pipes,
it can be forced to use sockets and can be done remotely. Because of this,
an attacker can write an exploit that
connects to the listener/extproc over TCP and, without ever having to
authenticate, run any function in any library they wish. A real world attack
would probably call system() exported by msvcrt.dll on Windows platforms or
exec() or system() exported by libc on unix platforms. Any operating system
command passed as a parameter to these functions would run in the security
context of the account running the oracle processes. On Unix systems this is
commonly the "oracle" user and on Windows NT/2000 this is, by default, the
local SYSTEM account. Needless to say that any commands executed as these
users will have dire consequences for the computer system involved.

Fix Information
***************
There are several things that can be done to help mitigate the risk of such
an attack. The first line of defense is, of course, with the use of a
firewall. No one should be able to access the listener port of 1521 from the
Internet. This not only helps mitigate the risk concerned with this problem
but a slew of others, too.

Moving to the Oracle database server itself, PLSExtproc functionality can be
removed if not needed. To do this remove the relevant entries in
tnsnames.ora and listener.ora. The PLS External Procedure service can have
many different names depending upon the system and Oracle version installed.
This could be icache_extproc, PLSExtproc
or extproc. It is also suggested that extproc(.exe) be deleted, too, on the
off chance that an attacker, replaces the entries in tnsnames.ora and
listener.ora.

If this functionality is required then it is possible to limit the machines
that may access the listener. Whilst this is a trust mechanism based only on
IP address it does help. The process is called "valid node checking" and
requires a modification to the sqlnet.ora file found in the
$ORACLE_HOME\network\admin directory. Add the entries

 tcp.validnode_checking = YES
 tcp.invited_nodes = (10.1.1.2, scylla)

Replace 10.1.1.2 or Scylla in this example with the hosts that require
access. Any host not listed here will still be able to make a TCP connection
to the listener but the listener will simply terminate the connection.
Invited nodes should be restricted to machines that require access.

As another step towards help mitigating the risk, you could set the listener
listening on a non-default port (i.e. not 1521). Whilst this is not a great
solution, as anyone with a TCP port scanner has a highly likely chance of
finding the listener, it still helps.

Finally, on Windows NT/2000 the Oracle processes should not be running as
local SYSTEM. It is suggested that a low privileged account be created and
the Oracle processes run as this user. This account will need to be given
the "Logon as a service" account privilege.

Oracle was alerted to the theoretical vulnerability last summer and provided
with working exploit code in October and are currently investigating the
issue and working on a patch. NGSSoftware and Oracle have decided to release
this advisory in the interim of the patch becoming available so Oracle
customers may take steps to mitigate the
risk that may be posed to their Oracle database servers.

A check for this security hole has been added to the Oracle scan module of
Typhon II, NGSSoftware's vulnerability assessment scanner, of which more
information is available from the NGSSoftware website,
<http://www.nextgenss.com/>.

## Oracle 9i Database Server PL/SQL module allows remote command execution without authentication

#### Vulnerability Note VU#180147

Original Release Date: 2002-02-26 | Last Revised: 2003-07-03

---

### Overview

Oracle Database Server allows remote users to execute system commands without authenticating.

### Description

| Oracle Database Server provides extended functionality through the use of Procedural Language/Structured Query Language (PL/SQL) libraries. PL/SQL includes commands to load arbitrary system libraries and execute any function contained in those libraries. These commands require special user privileges. However, the functions of user authentication and library loading are split among different Oracle processes. As a result, it is possible to load libraries and execute arbitrary functions from them without authenticating.  Oracle runs a "Listener" process that receives requests from clients and forks separate child processes to handle each request. When the child process runs a PL/SQL library that makes use of other libraries, the child process first checks the user's authentication and privileges to ensure that the libraries should be loaded. Then it sends a request to the Listener process to load libraries. The Listener request forks another process named "extproc" ("extproc.exe" on Windows), which loads the library and executes functions as requested by the child process.Since the authentication is performed in the child process and not in the Listener, any process masquerading as an Oracle child process can ask the Listener to load any library and execute any command. The Listener assumes that the child process has performed authentication.Furthermore, it is possible to establish connections to the Listener and extproc processes over sockets, allowing remote attackers to exploit this vulnerability.This vulnerability is present in Oracle Database Server version 9i and may be present in other previous versions. |
| --- |

### Impact

| Remote users can execute arbitrary code with privileges of the user running Oracle, typically username "oracle" on Unix systems or the local "SYSTEM" user on Windows systems. |
| --- |

### Solution

| The CERT/CC is currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem. |
| --- |

| 1. Install a firewall and restrict access to port 1521 from outside the network.2. Configure the Oracle Listener to run on a port other than 1521.3. Remove PLSExtproc and icache\_extproc functionality from Oracle if not needed, by deleting relevant lines from the "tnsnames.ora" and "listener.ora" files.4. Implement trust node checking by adding the following lines to the "sqlnet.ora" file:tcp.validnode\_checking = YEStcp.invited\_nodes = (<comma-delimited list of allowed hostnames or IP addrs>)5. On Windows, run Oracle processes under a low-privileged user account instead of under the local SYSTEM account. |
