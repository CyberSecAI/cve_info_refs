{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Oracle Listener process does not perform authentication before loading libraries and executing functions via the extproc process. This allows an attacker to masquerade as an Oracle process and request the execution of arbitrary code.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Inadequate authentication in the Oracle Listener process",
      "Lack of authorization checks before loading libraries and executing functions",
      "Trust of client requests without proper validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution with the privileges of the user running the Oracle processes. This is typically the 'oracle' user on Unix systems, or the local 'SYSTEM' account on Windows, potentially leading to complete system compromise.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network connection to the Oracle Listener (typically port 1521)",
      "Masquerading as an Oracle client process to the Listener",
      "Exploiting the lack of authentication to load arbitrary libraries and execute functions via the extproc process."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": [
      "Ability to establish a network connection to the Oracle Listener.",
      "Ability to send crafted requests to the listener, imitating Oracle client requests."
    ],
  "additional_information": "The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over TCP and does not require any user credentials to be successful. The attacker can execute arbitrary commands by calling functions like `system()` or `exec()` from a library such as msvcrt.dll on Windows or libc on Unix."
