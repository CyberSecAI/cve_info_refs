-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

The CVE for this issue in gv should have been CAN-2002-0838 instead
of CAN-2001-0832.  There was a little confusion when Red Hat
originally assigned it to us out of their reserved pool.  Sorry for
any inconvenience.

iDEFENSE Security Advisory 09.26.2002
Exploitable Buffer Overflow in gv

DESCRIPTION

The gv program that is shipped on many Unix systems contains a buffer
overflow which can be exploited by an attacker sending a malformed
postscript or Adobe pdf file. The attacker would be able to cause
arbitrary code to run with the privileges of the victim on his Linux
computer. The gv program is a PDF and postscript viewing program for
Unix which interfaces with the ghostscript interpreter. It is
maintained at <http://wwwthep.physik.uni-mainz.de/~plass/gv/> by
Johannes Plass.  This particular security vulnerability occurs in the
source code where an unsafe sscanf() call is used to interpret
PostScript and PDF files.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name CAN-2001-0832 to this issue.

ANALYSIS

In order to perform exploitation, an attacker would have to trick a
user into viewing a malformed PDF or PostScript file from the command
line. This may be somewhat easier for Unix based email programs that
associate gv with email attachments. Since gv is not normally
installed setuid root, an attacker would only be able to cause
arbitrary code to run with the privileges of that user.  Other
programs that utilize derivatives of gv, such as ggv or kghostview,
may also be vulnerable in similiar ways.

A proof of concept exploit for Red Hat Linux designed by zen-parse is
attached to this message.  It packages the overflow and shellcode in
the "%%PageOrder:" section of the PDF.

[root@victim]# ls -al /tmp/itworked
/bin/ls: /tmp/itworked: No such file or directory
[root@victim]# gv gv-exploit.pdf
[root@victim]# ls -al /tmp/itworked
- -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Aug 22 16:50 /tmp/itworked
[root@victim]#

DETECTION

This vulnerability affects the latest version of gv, 3.5.8. An
exploit has been tested on Red Hat Linux 7.3.

WORKAROUND

To avoid potential exploitation, users can select alternatives to gv
such as Kghostview (included with the KDE desktop environment) for
instance. Additionally, the vulnerability does not seem to be
exploitable when a file is opened from the gv interface instead of
the command line.

VENDOR RESPONSE

The author could not be contacted, and the main home page has not
been updated since 1997.  Coordinated public disclosure was scheduled
for September 26, 2002 with Unix vendors.

KDE Security Advisory: KGhostview Arbitary Code Execution
Original Release Date: 2002-10-08
URL: http://www.kde.org/info/security/advisory-20021008-1.txt
0. References
cve.mitre.org: CAN-2002-0838
BUGTRAQ:20020926 iDEFENSE Security Advisory 09.26.2002:
Exploitable Buffer Overflow in gv
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=bugtraq&m=103305615613319&w=2
1. Systems affected:
KGhostView of any KDE release between KDE 1.1 and KDE 3.0.3a
2. Overview:
KGhostview includes a DSC 3.0 parser from GSview, which is vulnerable
to a buffer overflow while parsing a specially crafted .ps input
file. It also contains code from gv 3.5.x which is vulnerable to another
buffer overflow triggered by malformed postscript or Adobe pdf files.
3. Impact:
Viewing certain Postscript or PDF files can result in the execution of
arbitary code placed in the file and as a result opens possibilities for
any remote manipulation under the local user account.
4. Solution:
Apply the patch listed in section 5 to kdegraphics/kghostview, or update
to KDE 3.0.4.
kdegraphics-3.0.4 can be downloaded from
http://download.kde.org/stable/3.0.4 :
6065219c825102c843ba582c4a520cac kdegraphics-3.0.4.tar.bz2
5. Patch:
A patch for KDE 3.0.3 is available from
ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/security\_patches :
9e33962406ac123e4fbdab20b4123ccf post-3.0.3-kdegraphics-kghostview.diff
A patch for KDE 2.2.2 is available from
ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/security\_patches :
62a1178c6a1730cbab98bbc825adafe9 post-2.2.2-kdegraphics-kghostview.diff
