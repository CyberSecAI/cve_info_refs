## History

The CERT Division is the birthplace of cybersecurity. For nearly 30 years, the CERT Division of the SEI has partnered with government, industry, law enforcement, and academia to advance cybersecurity and improve the security and resilience of computer systems and networks.

Originally focused on incident response, we have expanded into cybersecurity areas such as network situational awareness, malicious code analysis, secure coding, resilience management, insider threats, digital investigations and intelligence, workforce development, DevOps, forensics, software assurance, vulnerability discovery and analysis, and risk management.

## Former Director Richard Pethia

[Richard Pethia](/about/leadership/display.cfm?customel_datapageid_2623=3545) was founding director of the SEI's CERT Division. Pethia, who served as director of CERT from 1988 to 2016, guided the organization through tremendous growth and change. Under Pethia's leadership, the unit expanded and evolved from the CERT Coordination Center—a small group focused on computer incident response—to a research organization of more than 200 professionals dedicated to solving problems with widespread cybersecurity implications.

## ISC BIND 9 fails to process additional data chains in responses correctly thereby causing the server to fail an internal consistency check

#### Vulnerability Note VU#739123

Original Release Date: 2002-06-04 | Last Revised: 2002-09-18

---

### Overview

A denial-of-service vulnerability exists in version 9 of the Internet Software Consortium's ([ISC](http://www.isc.org/)) Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) server. **ISC BIND versions 8 and 4 are not affected**. Exploiting this vulnerability will cause vulnerable BIND servers to shut down.

### Description

| BIND is an implementation of the Domain Name System (DNS) that is maintained by the ISC. A vulnerability in Version 9 of BIND exists which may result in the deliberate shutdown of vulnerable BIND servers by arbitrary remote attackers. The shutdown can be caused by a specific DNS packet designed to create an improperly-handled error condition. Because the error condition is correctly detected but is not handled properly, this vulnerability will not allow an intruder to execute arbitrary code or write data to arbitrary locations in memory. The error condition that triggers the shutdown occurs when the rdataset parameter to the *dns\_message\_findtype()* function in message.c is not NULL as expected. The condition causes the code to assert an error message and call *abort()* to shutdown the BIND server. |
| --- |

### Impact

| Exploitation of this vulnerability will cause the vulnerable BIND server to abort and shut down. As a result, the BIND server will not be available unless restarted. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Apply a patch from your vendor or upgrade to BIND 9.2.1. BIND 9.2.1 is available from <http://www.isc.org/products/BIND/bind9.html>. |
