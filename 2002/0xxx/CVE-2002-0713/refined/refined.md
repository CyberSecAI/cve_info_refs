The provided content contains information about multiple vulnerabilities and bug fixes in Squid versions prior to 2.4.STABLE7. However, the primary focus is on the vulnerabilities addressed in the 2.4.STABLE7 release.

Based on the advisory, the following vulnerabilities are relevant to CVE-2002-0713:

**1. Gopher Client Vulnerabilities**

*   **Root Cause:**  Multiple bugs and lack of proper cleanup in the Gopher client.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Code flaws leading to security issues and rendering problems with Gopher menus.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Potential for remote code execution.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Malicious Gopher servers or crafted Gopher responses.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**  Attacker needs to be able to send requests through the proxy for gopher:// URLs.  This could be achieved through social engineering, which can cause an attack without direct access to the proxy server.

**2. FTP Directory Parsing Vulnerabilities**

*   **Root Cause:** Insecure parsing of FTP directory listings.
*  **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Buffer overflows in code parsing FTP directories.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Potential for remote code execution.
*   **Attack Vectors:**  Malicious FTP servers or crafted FTP responses.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Attacker needs to be able to send requests through the proxy to untrusted FTP servers.

**3. FTP Data Channel Security Issue**

*   **Root Cause:** Lack of validation of FTP data channel addresses.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Squid's FTP client did not verify that the data channel addresses match the control channel address.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Potential for theft or injection of data, bypassing firewall rules.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Malicious FTP servers using different IPs for control and data channels.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Attacker needs to be able to send requests through the proxy to untrusted FTP servers.

**4. MSNT Auth Helper Buffer Overflows**

*   **Root Cause:** Buffer overflows in the MSNT auth helper when using allowusers or denyusers.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Buffer overflow in the MSNT authentication helper.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Potential for remote code execution in certain configurations.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Crafted usernames and passwords or access control file entries.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Attacker must be able to trigger authentication via the MSNT helper with specially crafted inputs.

**5. Insecure Forwarding of Proxy Authentication Credentials**

*   **Root Cause:** Insecure forwarding of proxy authentication credentials under certain conditions.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Squid may forward proxy authentication credentials to sites that do not require them.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Exposure of user's proxy login and password to external websites.
*   **Attack Vectors:**  A combination of proxy authentication and sites not requiring authentication.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Attacker needs to control a website accessible through the proxy which does not require proxy authentication and can receive the forwarded credentials.
