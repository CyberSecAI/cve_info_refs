- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Profile Service contains an unchecked buffer in a section of code that handles certain types of API calls.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unchecked buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could cause the Commerce Server process to fail or could run arbitrary code in the LocalSystem security context.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker who provides specially malformed data to certain calls exposed by the Profile Service can trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have valid credentials to log on to the Commerce Server website, either through self-registration or by being an existing user. They also need to access a page that uses the affected Profile Service APIs.
