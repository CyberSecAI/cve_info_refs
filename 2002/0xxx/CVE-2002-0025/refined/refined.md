This document describes multiple vulnerabilities, including CVE-2002-0025.

**CVE-2002-0025 Details:**

*   **Vulnerability:** Application Invocation via Content-Type field.
*   **Root Cause:** A flaw in how Internet Explorer processes the `Content-Type` HTML header field. This flaw allows a web page to specify any application on a user's system to open a downloaded file, bypassing the usual restriction of only opening files with their associated applications and the restriction of only using applications deemed safe.
*   **Weakness:** Improper handling of the `Content-Type` HTML header, allowing a web page to specify an arbitrary application for opening a downloaded file.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can force a user's system to open a downloaded file with a specified, potentially malicious, application.  This could lead to arbitrary code execution if the chosen application is vulnerable or if the user is tricked into opening a malicious file using a vulnerable application.  This could result in actions such as creating, modifying, or deleting data, communicating with web sites or reformatting the hard drive.
*  **Attack Vector:**
    *   The attacker could host a web page containing the malformed `Content-Type` information on their web site.
    *   The attacker could send the malicious page as an HTML email to the victim.
*   **Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to host a web page or send an email with the crafted HTML content.
    *   The attacker needs to have a file hosted on their server.
    *   The attacker needs to know or guess an application that is installed on the victim's computer, which can be exploited.

**Mitigating Factors:**

*   The attacker can only exploit this vulnerability if the specified application is installed on the user's system.
*   The vulnerability does not allow the attacker to inventory installed applications or to force the user to install new applications.
*   The vulnerability does not allow the attacker to circumvent security features of the application or reconfigure it.
*   Users of Outlook 2002 who configured it to render HTML mail as plaintext would not be at risk from email-borne attacks.
