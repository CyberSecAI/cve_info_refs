- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Essentia Web Server fails to properly sanitize user-supplied URLs, specifically not handling directory traversal sequences like "/../".
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Directory traversal vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can view and download any file on the server, potentially gaining access to sensitive data, configuration files, or even executable code.
- **Attack vectors:**  By inserting the string "/../" into the URL. For example: `http://host/../../`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No special privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.
