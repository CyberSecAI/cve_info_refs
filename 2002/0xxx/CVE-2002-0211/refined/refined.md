- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The installation script for Tarantella Enterprise 3 creates a temporary `gunzip` binary in `/tmp` with world-writable permissions. The filename includes the process ID, e.g., `gunzip16152`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Insecure file creation: The `gunzip` binary is created in `/tmp` with `777` permissions, allowing any user to modify it.
    - Race condition: A race condition exists between the time the `gunzip` binary is extracted and the time it's used by the installer.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local unprivileged user can exploit the race condition by replacing the temporary `gunzip` binary with a malicious script. This allows them to execute arbitrary code with root privileges, leading to a complete system compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** A local attacker with shell access can exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be a local user with shell access to the system where Tarantella Enterprise 3 is being installed. The attacker must also be able to write files to the `/tmp` directory.
