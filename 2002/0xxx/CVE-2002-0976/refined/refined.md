The provided content describes a vulnerability in Internet Explorer that allows for reading local files, which is related to CVE-2002-0976.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in a legacy XML Datasource applet (`com.ms.xml.dso.XMLDSO.class`) shipped with Internet Explorer since version 4.0. This applet is loaded from a local file, and when a `<base href="file:///C:/">` tag is added to the head section, the applet's codebase is set to the local file system, enabling it to access local XML files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - The XMLDSO applet improperly handles its codebase when a base href is set to a local file path.
    - The applet allows reading local XML files.
    - The applet also allows using XML external entities to read local text files.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - An attacker can read local XML and text files from the victim's system.
    - This can expose sensitive information stored in local files.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page that includes the vulnerable XMLDSO applet.
    - The HTML page also contains a `<base href="file:///C:/">` tag to set the applet's base URL to the local file system.
    - The attacker can use the applet to specify local files to read using the `url` parameter or by using XML external entities.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious HTML page to the victim, typically through a website or email.
    - The victim needs to be using Internet Explorer with the vulnerable applet enabled.
