The provided content is related to CVE-2002-0710.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `sendform.cgi` script allows a remote attacker to read arbitrary files on the web server by manipulating the `BlurbFilePath` parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Directory traversal vulnerability: The script does not properly sanitize the `BlurbFilePath` parameter, allowing attackers to specify arbitrary file paths, including absolute paths, on the server.
- Lack of input validation: The script does not validate the `BlurbFilePath` parameter to restrict the file paths to those within the intended directory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote attackers can read any file on the web server with the privileges of the web server user, potentially exposing sensitive information such as `/etc/passwd`.
- If the attacker can write files to the web server, they can use `sendform.cgi` as a "spam proxy" by controlling the content of the email message and sending it to arbitrary addresses.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker modifies the `BlurbFilePath` parameter to point to the file they want to read.
- The attacker sets the "email" parameter to their own email address.
- The attacker sets `SendCopyToUser` to "yes".
- The attacker submits the modified form to `sendform.cgi`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server running the vulnerable `sendform.cgi` script.
- The attacker doesn't need any authentication.
