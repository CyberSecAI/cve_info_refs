Strumpf Noir Society Advisories
! Public release !
<--#

-= Avirt Gateway Suite Remote SYSTEM Level Compromise =-

Release date: Thursday, January 17, 2002

Introduction:

Avirt Gateway Suite combines the features of the Avirt Gateway
internet sharing technology with the functionality of the Avirt
Mail server in one integrated package for the enterprise.

The Gateway Suite can be found at vendor Avirt's web site:
<http://www.avirt.com>

Problem:

The Avirt Gateway technology integrated in the Gateway Suite contains,
amongst others, a telnet proxy. Due to an error in the implementation of
this proxy inside the Gateway Suite however, the system on which it is
installed will be effectively turned into an insecure telnet server.

To exploit this flaw, an attacker would only have to telnet to the
telnet proxy (running on port 23 by default installation) and could then
browse the system's file structure using the 'dir' and/or 'ls' commands.
Typing 'dos' after connecting to the target machine would drop the
attacker in a dos prompt. No authentication is required except for
using an ip-address which is in one of the proxy's allowed ranges.

The Gateway Suite runs as a NT system service by default.

(..)

Solution:

Vendor has been notified. After trying to confirm receipt of our initial
e-mail to them, we received a message with in the subject line "SPAM?",
which stated the following:

"As of right now, we will add the problem to our bug list which will be
consulted when any upgrades are made."

This was tested on a Win2k configuration running the Avirt Gateway
Suite v4.2. The Avirt Gateway (also v4.2) product itself is not vulnerable
to this problem.

Hello,

I have seen 2 advisories for avirt 4.2 gateway.
Did they patch it without modifying the version ?
I tried the proof of concept exploit and it did nothing but close the
server.
I wanted to trigger the buffer overflow on the web server too, in order
to write a proof of concept exploit
but my attempts did nothhing but close the server again.. (something
like 4000 chars)
I never managed to overwrite my EIP.(or doesn't it crash when you do it ? )
I was wondering if they patched it in a dodgy way ?
Sorry if it is not the good place for such a post ;-)

Best Regards,

Nicolas Brulez
