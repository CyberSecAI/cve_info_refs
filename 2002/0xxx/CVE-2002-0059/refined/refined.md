{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A double-free vulnerability exists in the zlib library's decompression algorithm. When processing specially crafted invalid compressed data, the `huft_build()` function can return an unexpected `Z_MEM_ERROR`. This error leads to a double-free of an internal data structure in the subsequent `inflate_blocks()` call.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Double-Free vulnerability",
      "Improper handling of error conditions during decompression"
    ],
    "impact": "Exploitation can lead to denial-of-service, information leakage, and potentially arbitrary code execution. Specifically, memory corruption via a double-free allows attackers to influence the behavior of programs using zlib by manipulating memory allocation and deallocation.  While denial of service is likely, arbitrary code execution could be possible under certain conditions.",
    "attack_vectors": "Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by passing specially crafted, invalid compressed data to programs that use the zlib library.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to provide input to an application that uses zlib for decompression."
