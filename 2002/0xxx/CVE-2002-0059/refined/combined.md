## History

The CERT Division is the birthplace of cybersecurity. For nearly 30 years, the CERT Division of the SEI has partnered with government, industry, law enforcement, and academia to advance cybersecurity and improve the security and resilience of computer systems and networks.

Originally focused on incident response, we have expanded into cybersecurity areas such as network situational awareness, malicious code analysis, secure coding, resilience management, insider threats, digital investigations and intelligence, workforce development, DevOps, forensics, software assurance, vulnerability discovery and analysis, and risk management.

## Former Director Richard Pethia

[Richard Pethia](/about/leadership/display.cfm?customel_datapageid_2623=3545) was founding director of the SEI's CERT Division. Pethia, who served as director of CERT from 1988 to 2016, guided the organization through tremendous growth and change. Under Pethia's leadership, the unit expanded and evolved from the CERT Coordination Center—a small group focused on computer incident response—to a research organization of more than 200 professionals dedicated to solving problems with widespread cybersecurity implications.

## Double Free Bug in zlib Compression Library Corrupts malloc's Internal Data Structures

#### Vulnerability Note VU#368819

Original Release Date: 2002-03-11 | Last Revised: 2005-07-08

---

### Overview

There is a bug in the zlib compression library that may manifest itself as a vulnerability in programs that are linked with zlib. This may allow an attacker to conduct a denial-of-service attack, gather information, or execute arbitrary code.

It is important to note that the CERT/CC has not received any reports of exploitation of this bug. Based on the information available to us at this time, it is difficult to determine whether this bug can be successfully exploited. However, given the widespread deployment of zlib, we have published this document as a proactive measure.

### Description

| There is a bug in the decompression algorithm used by the popular zlib compression library. If an attacker is able to pass a specially-crafted block of invalid compressed data to a program that includes zlib, the program's attempt to decompress the crafted data can cause the zlib routines to corrupt the internal data structures maintained by malloc.The bug results from a programming error that causes segments of dynamically allocated memory to be released more than once (i.e., "double-freed"). Specifically, when inftrees.c:huft\_build() encounters the crafted data, it returns an unexpected Z\_MEM\_ERROR to inftrees.c:inflate\_trees\_dynamic(). When a subsequent call is made to infblock.c:inflate\_blocks(), the inflate\_blocks function tries to free an internal data structure a second time. Because this bug interferes with the proper allocation and deallocation of dynamic memory, it may be possible for an attacker to influence the operation of programs that include zlib. In most circumstances, this influence will be limited to denial of service or information leakage, but it is theoretically possible for an attacker to insert arbitrary code into a running program. This code would be executed with the permissions of the vulnerable program. |
| --- |

### Impact

| This bug may introduce vulnerabilities into any program that includes the affected library. Depending upon how and where the zlib routines are called from the given program, the resulting vulnerability may have one or more of the following impacts: denial of service, information leakage, or execution of arbitrary code. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade your version of zlib**The maintainers of zlib have released version 1.1.4 to address this vulnerability. Any software that is linked to or derived from an earlier version of zlib should be upgraded immediately. The latest version of zlib is available at <http://www.zlib.org>.These are the MD5 checksums for zlib version 1.1.4: abc405d0bdd3ee22782d7aa20e440f08 [zlib-1.1.4.tar.gz](http://www.gzip.org/zlib/zlib-1.1.4.tar.gz)9bf1d36ced334b0cf1f996f5c8171018 [zlib114.zip](http://www.gzip.org/zlib/zlib114.zip) The maintainers of zlib have published an advisory regarding this issue; for further information, please see <http://www.gzip.org/zlib/advisory-2002-03-11.txt> **Apply a patch from your vendor**The zlib compression library is freely available and used by many vendors in a wide variety of applications. Any one of these applications may contain vulnerabilities that are introduced by this vulnerability. For the most recent information available to the CERT/CC, please see the vendor section of this document. |

### [OpenSSH](#JPLA-57PLVL) Affected

Notified:  February 23, 2002  Updated: June 24, 2002

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

OpenSSH itself relies on zlib as a third party library. OpenSSH's internal malloc state might get corrupted if the double-free bug is present in zlib. At this moment, it is not known if this bug will allow an intruder to gain privileges.

For some malloc implementation it is possible to detect and ignore the double-free. However, that is entirely dependent on the malloc implementation. Currently, it seems that \*BSD operating systems might not be affected by this problem.

We advise everybody to upgrade their third party libraries and recompile OpenSSH if necessary. Turning off compression in the server is possible only by removing zlib from myproposal.h and subsequent recompliation.

### [Openwall GNU/\*/Linux](#JPLA-57ZTJ2) Affected

Notified:  February 14, 2002  Updated: March 12, 2002

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

All versions of Openwall GNU/\*/Linux (Owl) prior to the 2002/02/15 Owl-current snapshot are affected by the zlib double-free vulnerability. Owl-current after 2002/02/15 includes the proper fixes in its userland packages. In order to not place the users of other vendors' products at additional risk, we have agreed to delay documenting this as a security change and including the fixes in Owl 0.1-stable until there's a coordinated public announcement. While we don't normally support this kind of a policy (releasing a fix before there's an announcement), this time handling the vulnerability in this way was consistent with the state of things by the time the (already publicly known) bug was first realized to be a security vulnerability.

The zlib bug could affect the following Owl packages: gnupg, openssh, rpm, texinfo (not necessarily in a security sense). Of these, the OpenSSH could potentially allow for an active remote attack resulting in a root compromise. If only SSH protocol version 1 is allowed in the OpenSSH server this is reduced to a local attack, but reverse remote attack possibilities by a malicious server remain. Additionally, any third-party software that makes use of the provided zlib library could be affected.

Parts of the Linux 2.2 kernel included in Owl were also affected by the vulnerability. Fortunately, those parts (Deflate compression support for PPP and the experimental Deflate compression extension to IrDA) are normally not used by the Owl userland. The bug has been corrected starting with Linux 2.2.20-ow2 which has been made public and a part of both Owl-current and Owl 0.1-stable on 2002/03/03. This change, however, will only be documented in the publicly-available change logs on the coordinated public announcement date.

### [Red Hat Inc.](#JPLA-57DKCV) Affected

Notified:  February 07, 2002  Updated: March 14, 2002

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

Red Hat Linux ships with a zlib library that is vulnerable to this issue. Although most packages in Red Hat Linux use the shared zlib library we have identified a number of packages that either statically link to zlib or contain an internal version of the zlib code.

Updates to zlib and these packages as well as our advisory note are available from the following URL. Users of the Red Hat Network can use the up2date tool to automatically upgrade their systems.

<http://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHSA-2002-026.html>

Red Hat would like to thank CERT/CC for their help in coordinating this issue with other vendors.

- -----------------------
- --- Issue Specifics ---
- -----------------------

This bulletin covers several graphics-related security issues:

  o  It's been reported that the zlib libraries that ship with x\_eoe
     have a "double free" vulnerability.

     See: <http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/368819>

  o  It's been reported that the IRIX X server has security vulnerabilities.

     1) Under certain conditions, Mozilla can cause the X server to crash.

     See:  <http://web.lemuria.org/security/mozilla-dos.html> for details.

     2) There is a vulnerability in the MIT-SHM code that can allow a local
        user to read or write to any SHM segment.

     See: <http://www.linuxsecurity.com/advisories/caldera_advisory-2006.html>

SGI has investigated the issue and recommends the following steps for
neutralizing the exposure.  It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that these measures be
implemented on ALL vulnerable SGI systems.

These issues have been corrected in future releases of IRIX and with patches.

- --------------
- --- Impact ---
- --------------

The X server (/usr/bin/X11/Xsgi) is installed by default on IRIX 6.5 systems
as part of x\_eoe.sw.Server.

To determine the version of IRIX you are running, execute the following
command:

  # uname -R

That will return a result similar to the following:

  # 6.5 6.5.16f

The first number ("6.5") is the release name, the second ("6.5.15f" in this
case) is the extended release name.  The extended release name is the
"version" we refer to throughout this document.

Exploitation of these vulnerabilities can result in a root compromise or a
Denial of Service attack.  A local account is required to exploit these
vulnerabilities.

- ----------------------------
- --- Temporary Workaround ---
- ----------------------------

There is no good workaround available for these problems if running in
graphical mode is desired.  SGI recommends either upgrading to IRIX 6.5.18
when it is released, or installing the appropriate patch from the listing
below.

If running in graphical mode is not needed, you can execute the command
"/usr/gfx/stopgfx" and it will turn the windowsystem configuration flag off,
kill the X server, and keep it from being restarted on next boot.

- ----------------
- --- Solution ---
- ----------------

SGI has provided a series of patches for these vulnerabilities. Our
recommendation is to upgrade to IRIX 6.5.18 when available, or install the
appropriate patch.

- -----------------------
- --- Issue Specifics ---
- -----------------------

It's been reported that there are multiple vulnerabilities in Java:

  o  A defect in the Java(TM) Virtual Machine may allow illegal
     access to protected fields or methods of an object:
     <http://sunsolve.sun.com/pub-cgi/retrieve.pl?doc=fsalert%2F50083>

  o  The Java(TM) Secure Socket Extension (JSSE) may incorrectly validate
     the digital certificate of a web site:
     <http://sunsolve.sun.com/pub-cgi/retrieve.pl?doc=fsalert%2F50081>

  o  The Java Plug-in may incorrectly validate the digital certificates of
     signed JAR files:
     <http://online.securityfocus.com/archive/1/300767>
     <http://lsd-pl.net/java_security.html>

  o  A defect in the Bytecode Verifier may allow new instances of objects
     to be created without calling the proper initialization method from
     within the constructor of the created class:
     <http://sunsolve.Sun.COM/pub-cgi/retrieve.pl?doc=fsalert%2F49304>

  o  CERT has reported a bug in the zlib compression library:
     <http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2002-07.html>
     <http://sunsolve.sun.com/pub-cgi/retrieve.pl?&doc=secbull/220>
     <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2002-0059>

     SGI's implementations of the Java(TM) Runtime Environment include zlib
     and are affected. This bug may allow malicious code to corrupt memory
     and possibly crash the Java Runtime Environment.

SGI has investigated the issues and recommends the following steps for
neutralizing the exposure.  It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that these measures be
implemented on ALL vulnerable SGI systems.

These issues have been corrected in SGI's release of the Java2 v1.4.1 APIs.

- --------------
- --- Impact ---
- --------------

Java is installed by default on IRIX 6.5 systems as part of java\_eoe.

To determine the version of IRIX you are running, execute the following
command:

  # /bin/uname -R

That will return a result similar to the following:

  # 6.5 6.5.19f

The first number ("6.5") is the release name, the second ("6.5.16f" in this
case) is the extended release name.  The extended release name is the
"version" we refer to throughout this document.

- ----------------------------
- --- Temporary Workaround ---
- ----------------------------

There is no workaround for these issues. SGI recommends installing the new
Java API package noted below.

- ----------------
- --- Solution ---
- ----------------

SGI has provided a new version of Java (version 1.4.1) to address these
vulnerabilities. Our recommendation is to upgrade to this version of Java.

### [XFree86](#JPLA-57Z2J4) Affected

Notified:  March 05, 2002  Updated: March 11, 2002

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

XFree86 versions 4.0 through 4.2.0 include zlib version 1.0.8. XFree86 3.x includes zlib version 1.0.4. The zlib code included with XFree86 is only used on some platforms. This is determined by the setting of HasZlib in the imake config files in the xc/config/cf source directory. If HasZlib is set to YES in the platform's vendor.cf file(s), then the system-provided zlib is used instead of the XFree86-provided version. XFree86 uses the system-provided zlib by default only on the following platforms:

FreeBSD 2.2 and later
NetBSD 1.2.2 and later
OpenBSD
Darwin
Debian Linux

The zlib code in XFree86 has been fixed in the CVS repository (trunk and the xf-4\_2-branch branch) as of 14 February 2002. A source patch for XFree86 4.2.0 will be available from .

The following XFree86 4.2.0 binary distributions provided by XFree86 include and use a vulnerable version of zlib:

Linux-alpha-glibc22
Linux-ix86-glibc22

When updated binaries are available, it'll be documented at .

To check if an installation of XFree86 includes zlib, see if the following file exists:

/usr/X11R6/lib/libz.a

To check if an XFree86 X server is dynamically linked with zlib, look for a line containing 'libz' in the output of 'ldd /usr/X11R6/bin/XFree86'.

Various vendors repackage and distribute XFree86, and may use settings and configurations different from those described here.

### Vendor Information

The vendor has not provided us with any further information regarding this vulnerability.
