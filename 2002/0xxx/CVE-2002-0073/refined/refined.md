Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2002-0073:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the way Microsoft IIS (Internet Information Services) handles requests for the status of an existing FTP connection. Specifically, a malformed status request can trigger an error condition that is not correctly handled by the FTP service, leading to an access violation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Error Handling:** The FTP service fails to handle a malformed status request, leading to an attempt to use uninitialized data.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The access violation causes the IIS service to terminate. This affects both FTP and HTTP services running under the `inetinfo.exe` process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service:** Exploiting this vulnerability results in the termination of the IIS service, causing a denial of service for both FTP and web services hosted on the affected server.
- On IIS 5.0 and 5.1, the service will automatically restart, but an attacker can repeatedly exploit the vulnerability. On IIS 4.0, the service needs to be restarted manually.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malformed FTP Status Request:** An attacker sends a malformed request for the status of an existing FTP connection.
- **Existing FTP Session Required:** The attacker needs an existing FTP session with the server, which can be achieved through either:
  - Valid user credentials
  - Anonymous FTP access (which is enabled by default on some IIS versions)
  - Potentially, by injecting data into an existing FTP session through methods like ISN prediction.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable IIS server.
- **FTP Session:** The attacker must be able to establish an FTP session with the server. This requires either valid credentials, anonymous access, or the ability to inject data into an existing session.
- **Crafted Request:** The attacker must be able to craft a malformed status request.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is a denial of service (DoS), and it does not allow for remote code execution or privilege escalation.
*   Microsoft's advisory for this issue is available under MS02-018.
*   The vulnerability was discovered through fuzzing techniques on the STAT command using various globbing characters.
*   The crash occurs when a `memchr` call is passed a pointer that dereferences to NULL.
*   A patch is available from Microsoft (MS02-018) to correct this issue.
*   The IIS Lockdown Tool can disable the FTP service, mitigating the risk of exploitation.
*   The CERT vulnerability note for this issue is VU#412203.
*   This CVE is associated with a larger set of vulnerabilities addressed by the MS02-018 cumulative patch for IIS, as it is listed with other vulnerabilities in the bulletin and its associated security rating table.
