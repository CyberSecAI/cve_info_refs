- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The ScriptEase MiniWeb Server crashes when it receives a request with an unusually long URL.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The server does not properly handle long URLs, leading to a denial-of-service condition.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The server crashes, requiring a restart to regain normal functionality, leading to a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending an HTTP request with an unusually long URL to the server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the server. The attacker doesn't need any special privileges or authentication.
