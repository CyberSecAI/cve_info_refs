Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is improper handling of invalid paths by the `texis(CGI)` program. When an invalid path to a script is provided, instead of gracefully handling the error, the program reveals the full path to the webroot.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is path disclosure. The program reveals the server's file system structure by displaying the full path to the webroot when given an invalid script path.
*   **Information Leakage:** In addition to the webroot path, the software might also disclose system-specific information like the operating system and processor type in some cases.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Gathering:** Attackers can use this vulnerability to gain knowledge of the web server's file system layout. This information can be crucial for planning further attacks, including the location of sensitive files or configuration details.
*   **System Information Disclosure:**  Exposure of system information (OS, processor type) could provide attackers with additional information to tailor exploits.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending an HTTP request to the `texis(CGI)` program with an invalid path as a parameter (e.g., `/cgi-bin/texis/phine`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server to exploit the vulnerability. No prior authentication is needed.
