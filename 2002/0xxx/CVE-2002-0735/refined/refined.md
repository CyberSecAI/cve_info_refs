The content describes a format string vulnerability in `pam_ldap` and `squid_auth_ldap`.

**pam_ldap:**

*   **Root cause:** The `pam_ldap` module uses `snprintf` with a format string constructed from user-controlled input (`configFile`) via the command line argument `config=`.
*   **Vulnerability:** Format string vulnerability. If the filename provided to `config=` contains format string specifiers, they will be interpreted by `snprintf` leading to arbitrary memory reads/writes.
*   **Impact:** Local privilege escalation or denial of service. An attacker with local access to modify the command line arguments to `pam_ldap` can exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Attack vector:** Local, via a crafted command line argument to the `pam_ldap` module.
*   **Required capabilities:** Local user with the ability to execute `pam_ldap` with specific arguments.

**squid_auth_ldap:**

*   **Root cause:** The `squid_auth_ldap` module utilizes a logging function `logging()` that uses `vsnprintf` with a format string passed from various parts of the code. These format strings often contain user-provided or configuration-derived values.
*  **Vulnerability:** Format string vulnerability. The vulnerable calls to `logging` include format strings that contain potentially attacker-controlled data like usernames, DN, or search strings. If these strings include format specifiers, they will be interpreted by `vsnprintf` allowing for arbitrary memory reads/writes.
*   **Impact:** Remote denial of service, arbitrary code execution, or information leakage by controlling the format strings.
*   **Attack vector:** Remote, via crafted input to `squid_auth_ldap` which is logged.
*   **Required capabilities:** An attacker needs to be able to cause the vulnerable logging calls with crafted data (e.g., via LDAP requests).

The advisory provides more detail on the vulnerable code locations than a standard CVE description would. It lists the exact function calls where format string vulnerabilities exist in both `pam_ldap` and `squid_auth_ldap`.
