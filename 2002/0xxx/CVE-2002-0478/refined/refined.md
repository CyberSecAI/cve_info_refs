- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Foundry Networks EdgeIron 4802F Fast Ethernet switches have a default SNMP configuration that allows SNMP requests with any community string to have read and write access. This occurs because the switches do not check SNMPv1 community strings by default.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the lack of community string validation in the default SNMP configuration. While the device comes with default community strings "public" (RO) and "private" (RW), the device responds to any community string with read/write access.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can read and write to SNMP objects on the switch, which could lead to a variety of attacks, including altering switch configurations. In the example provided, the attacker is able to change the system name.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through SNMP. The attacker needs IP access to the switch to send SNMP requests.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the switch. No authentication is required to perform read or write operations as any community string will work.
