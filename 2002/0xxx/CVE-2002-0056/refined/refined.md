Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from unchecked buffers within the `OpenDataSource` and `OpenRowset` functions in Microsoft SQL Server 7.0 and 2000 when handling OLE DB provider names in ad-hoc connections to remote data sources. Specifically, when a user supplies an overly long string to the "provider name" parameter within these functions, it causes a buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Buffer Overflow:** The core issue is a buffer overflow vulnerability within the mentioned functions. The lack of proper input validation on the "provider name" parameter allows an attacker to provide a string longer than the allocated buffer, leading to memory corruption.
- **Unchecked buffers:** The functions lack proper validation of the size of the "provider name" parameter, leading to the overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The most immediate impact is a crash of the SQL Server service, resulting in a denial of service.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** With a carefully crafted payload, an attacker could overwrite memory within the SQL Server process, potentially allowing arbitrary code execution within the security context of the SQL Server service.
- **Data Manipulation:** Successful code execution could allow an attacker to modify, add or delete data in the database.
- **System Compromise:** Depending on the SQL Server service's configuration, exploitation could give the attacker a significant level of control over the database and potentially the server itself.
- **Privilege Escalation:** If the SQL Server service is running with elevated privileges, the attacker could potentially gain those same privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Direct Query Execution:** An attacker could directly execute a crafted SQL query containing the vulnerable functions with an overly long "provider name." This requires the ability to execute arbitrary queries on the SQL Server.
- **Indirect Exploitation through Applications:** If a web application or other database front-end uses these functions, an attacker could inject malicious input into the application, which in turn would cause the vulnerable function to be called with an overly long "provider name."

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Execute Queries:** The attacker needs the ability to execute SQL queries on the target SQL Server, either directly or indirectly.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Functions:** The attacker needs to know about the `OpenDataSource` and `OpenRowset` functions, as well as the fact that they accept a provider name which is vulnerable to a buffer overflow.
- **(Optional) Knowledge of Server Environment:** If the attacker aims for code execution, some understanding of the server's memory layout and SQL Server process may be required to craft a successful exploit.

**Additional Details:**

- The buffer overflow occurs at different character lengths for SQL Server 7.0 and 2000 (6819 and 6887, respectively), and will crash the server at slightly higher number of characters (6918 and 6998, respectively).
- The vulnerability is present in all service packs and fixes applied to affected versions at the time of discovery.
- The impact of the vulnerability could vary depending on the security context in which the SQL Server service is running. If configured with the principle of least privilege, the impact would be limited.
- Microsoft was initially slow to respond to the vulnerability report, according to the original advisory.
