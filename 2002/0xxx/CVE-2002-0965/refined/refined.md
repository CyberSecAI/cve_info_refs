- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A buffer overflow occurs in the Oracle TNS Listener when it attempts to log an error caused by a TNS request with an overly long SERVICE_NAME parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Buffer overflow in the TNS Listener component.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the TNS Listener process.
    - Denial of service (DoS) on the vulnerable system.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a specially crafted TNS request with an oversized SERVICE_NAME parameter to a vulnerable Oracle Listener.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Remote, unauthenticated attacker capable of sending network requests to the Oracle TNS Listener. The attacker does not require any prior authentication or access to the target system.
