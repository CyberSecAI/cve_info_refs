This content is related to the identified CVE.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The CyberStop Webserver for Windows is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to its handling of specific requests and large input strings.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The web server crashes when accessing specific URLs like `/aux`, `/prn`, and `/com1`.
- Sending a long string of 'A' characters also causes the server to crash.
- The server exhibits runtime errors such as "Run-time error 40006" and "Run-time error 5" and can crash the service, requiring a restart.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The server becomes unavailable, disrupting web services provided by the server.
- System instability: Ports for mouse and printers crash, indicating instability and potential cascading failures.
- Service restart: Administrators are forced to restart the service, leading to further downtime and inconvenience.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending crafted HTTP GET requests to specific URLs (/aux, /prn, /com1)
- Sending a long string of 'A' characters within the requested URL via HTTP.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs network connectivity to the vulnerable web server on port 80.
- No authentication is required, as the vulnerability is exploitable by any user.
- Ability to send crafted HTTP requests to the server
