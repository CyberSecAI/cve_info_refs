- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Terminal Services Advanced Client (TSAC) ActiveX control contains an unchecked buffer in the code that processes one of the input parameters.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the TSAC ActiveX control.
- **Impact of exploitation**: By exploiting the buffer overflow, an attacker could execute arbitrary code within the security context of the currently logged-on user, potentially gaining complete control over the user's system.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Hosting a web page that exploits the vulnerability, which could affect any user who visits the site.
    - Sending an HTML email to a user, which could exploit the vulnerability when the email is opened.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious web page or send a malicious HTML email.
    - The target user must have the vulnerable TSAC ActiveX control installed on their system.
    - The attacker needs to craft a specific malformed input value to trigger the buffer overflow.
