This document provides details on multiple vulnerabilities patched by Microsoft Security Bulletin MS02-005. One of these vulnerabilities is related to CVE-2002-0026.

**Vulnerability:** Script execution bypass.

**Root cause:** A flaw in how Internet Explorer handles asynchronous events on a web page. Specifically, an HTML directive designed to allow items to respond to events could be misused. IE performs security checks when a page initially loads, but by misusing this directive, a script on a web page could fire after the initial security checks are completed, effectively bypassing the user's security settings that disable scripting.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   Bypassing script execution restrictions.
*   The vulnerability exists because IE performs security checks upon the initial page load, but scripts can be fired after these checks have been completed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   An attacker could run scripts on a user's system even if the user has disabled scripting in their browser's security settings.
*   Although the vulnerability enables script execution, it doesn't provide any other means of bypassing other security measures or the browser's security model.

**Attack vectors:**
*   A malicious web page hosted on a web site.
*   A malicious web page sent to a user as an HTML email.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to create a web page that exploits the vulnerability.
*   The attacker needs to host this page on a website or send it via email to potential victims.
