- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Web browsers, specifically Microsoft Internet Explorer (versions 5.x and 6) and some Opera configurations, fail to honor the `Content-Type` header, misinterpreting `text/plain` content as `text/html`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The browser executes embedded scripts within a document, even when the `Content-Type` header indicates it should be treated as plain text.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Malicious scripts can be executed within the user's browser context, potentially leading to:
    - Cookie theft.
    - Session hijacking.
    - Defacement of web pages.
    - Other malicious activities by executing arbitrary JavaScript.
- **Attack vectors:**  A web server sends a response with a `Content-Type: text/plain` header, but includes HTML and JavaScript code within the content body. A vulnerable browser, ignoring the header, interprets it as HTML and executes the script. This can be exploited via webmail or bulletin board systems.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to control the content of a web server response. This could be through injecting content into a web application or exploiting an existing vulnerability that allows them to manipulate server responses.
