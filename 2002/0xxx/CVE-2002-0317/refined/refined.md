Advisory Title: Gator installer Plugin allows any software to be installed
Release Date: 21/01/2002

Application: Gator installer plugin for Internet Explorer (GAIN)
Platform: Windows clients with Internet Explorer.
DLL version - 3.0.6.1
Severity: Malicious users can install backdoor software and gain easy access to the target machine.

Root cause of vulnerability: The Gator installer plugin for Internet Explorer (GAIN) ActiveX component allows an attacker to specify an arbitrary location for the installation file.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- The ActiveX component is scriptable, allowing an attacker to control the location of the installation file via HTML.
- The plugin checks if the filename is setup.ex_ (compressed) or any other file (uncompressed). If it's setup.ex_, it's decompressed and executed. Otherwise the file will be executed directly.
- The plugin does not validate the source or the content of the file, allowing the execution of arbitrary executables.

Impact of exploitation: A malicious user can use this vulnerability to install arbitrary software, such as trojans or backdoors, on a victim's machine. This can allow for complete control over the system.

Attack vectors:
- The attack vector is through a malicious HTML page that uses the vulnerable ActiveX component to download and execute an arbitrary executable.
- The attacker needs to create an HTML page containing the exploit code.

Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious HTML page accessible to the victim and a malicious executable.
