- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from improper handling of long filenames (longer than 200 characters) by PGP Corporate Desktop Version 7.1.x.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A buffer overflow occurs when PGP attempts to encrypt or decrypt files with excessively long names.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially:
    - Temporarily disable PGP.
    - Obtain a user's passphrase.
    - Execute malicious code on the user's computer.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves manipulating or creating files with names exceeding 200 characters that PGP would attempt to process (encrypt or decrypt).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to create or control the names of files that the vulnerable PGP software will interact with. This likely requires local access to the machine or the ability to trick a user into processing a file with a crafted long filename.
