ABOUT THIS HOTFIX
This hotfix consists of a single compressed file named
PGPhotfix\_LFN\_20020828b.zip. You can decompress this
file using an extraction utility such as WinZip. The zip
file contains three files: PGPhotfix.exe, PGPhotfix.exe.sig,
and this Read Me file.
You can confirm the integrity of this hotfix by verifying
the provided sig file. The verification procedure should
report a good signature from the "Network Associates
Software Release Key 2002" key.

ISSUES RESOLVED IN THIS HOTFIX
1) While PGP supports long file names, it encounters
problems when it tries to encrypt or decrypt files
that have names longer than 200 characters. When
PGP tries to encrypt or decrypt these files, it
suffers an overflow and crashes. An attacker could
theoretically take advantage of this vulnerability
to temporarily disable PGP, obtain a user's passphrase,
or run malicious code on the user's computer.
For more information on this issue, see
Foundstone Labs Advisory - 080202-PCRO.
This hotfix fixes PGP's long file name handling and
removes the potential vulnerability.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
INSTALLING THE HOTFIX
1. Back up your existing PGPsc.dll file. If you use the
PGP Outlook plug-in, you must also back up your
PGPexch.dll file.
These files are located in your Windows system directory
(generally \Windows\System or \WINNT\System32).
2. Extract the files from the hotfix zip file into a folder.
NOTE: Running PGPhotfix.exe from within an extraction
utility such as WinZip will not install the hotfix.
You should extract the hotfix files and then run
PGPHotfix.exe.
3. Run the program PGPhotfix.exe. This will replace the
existing PGPsc.dll file on your computer with a new
version, as well as PGPexch.dll if you use the
PGP Outlook plug-in.
4. Restart the computer.
5. You can verify that the hotfix was installed by looking
for PGPsc.dll in your Windows system directory. (If you
have the PGP Outlook plug-in installed, you can also
look at PGPexch.dll.) Right-click the file and choose
"Properties"from the shortcut menu. Click the
Version tab.
Both files should show the following information:
File Version: 7.1.2.0
Product Version: 7.1.2
Build Number: 114
