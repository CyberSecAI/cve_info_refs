  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A format string vulnerability exists in the error message handling of the rpc.rwalld daemon.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Format string vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "An intruder can execute code with the privileges of the rwall daemon, typically root. Additionally, it can cause resource exhaustion preventing the wall command from executing.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote network access to the rpc.rwalld service (typically port 32777/UDP)",
       "Remote exploitation by triggering the error message of rwall daemon"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send messages to the rpc.rwalld service."

  "affected_systems": [
    "Solaris 2.5.1",
    "Solaris 2.6",
    "Solaris 7",
    "Solaris 8",
    "Solaris 6 ( by default)"
  ],
   "additional_notes": "The vulnerability is triggered when the wall command cannot be executed, causing rwall daemon to print an error message. The vulnerability is difficult to exploit remotely as it depends on exhaustion of system resources."
