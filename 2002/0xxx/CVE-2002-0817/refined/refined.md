Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `super` program's use of `syslog(3)` for error logging. Specifically, the `SysLog` macro is defined as `syslog((pri), (buf))`. This allows an attacker to inject format string specifiers into the `buf` argument, leading to arbitrary memory writes.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Format string vulnerability:** The `super` program uses a user-controlled string as the format string in the `syslog` function without proper sanitization.
- **Setuid wrapper:** The `super` program is a setuid root wrapper, meaning that when it is run it has root privileges.
- **Lack of input validation:** The program does not validate the input provided by the user.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary code execution:** An attacker can overwrite arbitrary memory locations. The provided exploit targets the `.dtors` section to gain root shell access.
- **Privilege escalation:** An unprivileged user can gain root privileges by exploiting this vulnerability.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker provides a malicious command to `super` containing format string specifiers.
- The vulnerable `super` program passes this attacker-controlled command to the `syslog` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have local access to the system.
- The attacker needs to be able to execute the vulnerable `super` binary.
- The attacker needs to determine the address of the `.dtors` section, though this is likely to be relatively consistent across systems.

**Additional details:**
- The provided code includes a proof-of-concept exploit written in C which demonstrates how to exploit this vulnerability. The exploit constructs a string with format specifiers that, when passed to `syslog` will overwrite the address of the `.dtors` section with shellcode address.
- The exploit uses a shellcode that sets the effective user ID to 0 and then launches `/bin/sh`
- The author mentions that this vulnerability is present when `super` is compiled to use syslog for error logging.
