#### Vulnerability Note VU#612843

Original Release Date: 2002-07-23 | Last Revised: 2003-04-11

### Overview

The Sun iPlanet Web Server and Sun ONE Web Server both ship with a search engine that is not enabled by default. A remotely exploitable buffer overflow exists in the search engine that could permit an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system.

### Description

| The Sun iPlanet Web Server Enterprise Edition 4.1 and Sun ONE Web Server 6.0 ship with a search engine that contains a buffer overflow. The search engine is not enabled by default, but is a likely configuration option that would be enabled by the site administrator. If the search engine is enabled, then a remote attacker may be able to exploit the buffer overflow to execute arbitrary code on the system. |

### Impact
