LiveUpdate
Hi All,

In a similar vien would anyone with Symantec Ghost V7.0 installed like =
to
comment on this key:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\NGServer\params

Ghost creates a special user account on the machine to run the service
under
but it seems it is storing the password for this account in plain text =
in
the registry.

Regards
Peter

AM, Symantec LiveUpdate"

During the installation process for Symantec Ghost Corporate Edition, t=
he
key in question is created with Administrator access only by default.
Normal best practice procedures of administrators allowing "least
privilege" access to normal system users would preclude access to any
unauthorized registry information by anyone other than a user with
administrator privileges.

Unauthorized access to the system registry presents security concerns f=
or
any program(s), which use the registry to persist data.   Protection of=

your system includes restricting physical access to your system and
restricting administrative privileges.

Symantec take the security of our products very seriously and appreciat=
es
the concerns of Mr. Miller.  Symantec is constantly working to improve =
our
products and we will be reviewing additional protective measures for th=
is
key in future upgrades.

Please direct any Symantec product security concerns to SymSecurity at
symsecurity@symantec.com.
