Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Symantec Ghost Corporate Edition stores the password for a special user account used to run the service in plain text within the Windows registry at `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\NGServer\params`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Plaintext Password Storage:** Storing the password in plain text within the registry is a major security flaw. Anyone with access to the registry can easily obtain the password.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker who gains access to the registry could obtain the password for the special user account used by the Symantec Ghost service. This could potentially lead to privilege escalation, allowing the attacker to gain control of the system or perform unauthorized actions.
- **System Compromise:** With the account password, an attacker could potentially manipulate the Symantec Ghost service for malicious purposes, potentially compromising the integrity and security of the entire system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Unauthorized Registry Access:** The primary attack vector is gaining unauthorized access to the system registry. This could be achieved through:
    - Malware infection.
    - Direct access to the system with sufficient privileges (e.g., local access by a user with some level of privilege or through remote admin tools).
    - Exploiting other vulnerabilities that allow registry access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Registry Access:** The attacker must be able to access and read the Windows registry on the target system where Symantec Ghost Corporate Edition is installed.
- **Privilege Level:** While the key is created with Administrator access by default, an attacker may gain access to the registry if they have local administrator access, local access with certain privileges, or via other methods for privilege escalation.

**Additional Notes:**
- Symantec's response indicates that the registry key is created with Administrator access only by default, and it's their opinion that administrator practices should minimize access to unauthorized users to such keys. However, this does not address the vulnerability of storing the password in plaintext.
- Symantec acknowledges the issue and mentions they are reviewing additional protective measures for future upgrades, indicating they recognize the security risk.
