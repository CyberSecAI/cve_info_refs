## Domain Name System (DNS) stub resolver libraries vulnerable to buffer overflows via network name or address lookups

#### Vulnerability Note VU#844360

Original Release Date: 2002-11-13 | Last Revised: 2003-04-24

---

### Overview

The DNS stub resolver library in ISC BIND 4.9.2 through 4.9.10 contains buffer overflows in code that handles responses for network name and address requests. Other resolver libraries derived from BIND 4 such as BSD libc, GNU glibc, and those used by System V UNIX systems may also be affected. An attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the application that made the request or cause a denial of service.

### Description

| A DNS stub resolver library provides an interface for network applications to make requests and receive responses from the domain name system. The BIND 4 resolver library (libresolv.a) contains several buffer overflows in the functions that handle responses for network name and address requests (getnetbyname(), getnetbyaddr()). While reading the answer portion of a DNS response, the functions copy data received from the network into inadequately sized buffers. A specially crafted DNS response could overflow the buffers, possibly injecting arbitrary code onto the stack.  ISC BIND 4.9.2 through 4.9.10 are vulnerable. DNS stub resolver libraries that are derived from BIND 4 may vulnerable, including BSD libc, GNU glibc, and resolvers used by System V UNIX systems. In addition, some network applications provide their own resolver functions which may use vulnerable code from BIND 4.The buffer overflows described in this document are different than the network lookup vulnerability described in [CA-2002-19](http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2002-19.html)/[VU#542971](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/542971)/[CAN-2002-0684](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2002-0684).When performing a DNS lookup, applications issue calls to resolver functions, at which point most applications dynamically load the relevant portion of the resolver library. Other applications are statically linked at compile time to include resolver functions. In order to use updated resolver code, dynamically linked process must be restarted, and statically linked binaries must be recompiled. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the application that made the request or cause a denial of service. The attacker would need to control DNS responses, possibly by spoofing responses or gaining control of a DNS server. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Patch or Upgrade**Upgrade or apply a patch as specified by your vendor. Dynamically linked processes must be restarted and statically linked binaries must be recompiled and in order to use the fixed resolver libraries. |
| --- |

| **Local Caching DNS Server Not Effective**A local caching DNS server will not prevent malicious responses from reaching vulnerable stub resolvers. |

Affected

### Vendor Statement

Version 2.3.1 of the GNU C Library is vulnerable. Earlier versions are also vulnerable. The following patch has been installed into the CVS sources, and should appear in the next version of the GNU C Library. This patch is also available from the following URL:

<<http://sources.redhat.com/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/libc/resolv/nss_dns/dns-network.c.diff?r1=1.17&r2=1.15&cvsroot=glibc>>

        \* resolv/nss\_dns/dns-network.c (getanswer\_r): In BYNAME case, search
        all aliases for one that matches the "<dotted-quad>.IN-ADDR.ARPA" form.
        Do the parsing inline instead of copying strings and calling
        inet\_network, and properly skip all alias names not matching the form.

2002-11-14  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

        \* resolv/nss\_dns/dns-network.c (getanswer\_r): Check for buffer
        overflow when skipping the question part and when unpacking aliases.

### [Openwall GNU/\*/Linux](#AAMN-5FTUSU) Affected

Notified:  November 12, 2002  Updated: November 14, 2002

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

BIND 4.9.10-OW2 includes the patch provided by ISC and thus has the two vulnerabilities affecting BIND 4 fixed. Previous versions of BIND 4.9.x-OW patches, if used properly, significantly reduced the impact of the "named" vulnerability. The patches are available at their usual location:

<http://www.openwall.com/bind/>

A patch against BIND 4.9.11 will appear as soon as this version is officially released, although it will likely be effectively the same as the currently available 4.9.10-OW2.

It hasn't been fully researched whether the resolver code in glibc, and in particular on Openwall GNU/\*/Linux, shares any of the newly discovered BIND 4 resolver library vulnerabilities. Analysis is in progress.

## History

The CERT Division is the birthplace of cybersecurity. For nearly 30 years, the CERT Division of the SEI has partnered with government, industry, law enforcement, and academia to advance cybersecurity and improve the security and resilience of computer systems and networks.

Originally focused on incident response, we have expanded into cybersecurity areas such as network situational awareness, malicious code analysis, secure coding, resilience management, insider threats, digital investigations and intelligence, workforce development, DevOps, forensics, software assurance, vulnerability discovery and analysis, and risk management.

## Former Director Richard Pethia

[Richard Pethia](/about/leadership/display.cfm?customel_datapageid_2623=3545) was founding director of the SEI's CERT Division. Pethia, who served as director of CERT from 1988 to 2016, guided the organization through tremendous growth and change. Under Pethia's leadership, the unit expanded and evolved from the CERT Coordination Center—a small group focused on computer incident response—to a research organization of more than 200 professionals dedicated to solving problems with widespread cybersecurity implications.
