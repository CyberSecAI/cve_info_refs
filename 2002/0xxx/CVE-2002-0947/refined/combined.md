## Oracle Reports Server Reports Web Cartridge (RWCGI60) vulnerable to buffer overflow via database name parameter

#### Vulnerability Note VU#997403

Original Release Date: 2002-06-04 | Last Revised: 2002-11-15

---

### Overview

A buffer overflow vulnerability in Oracle Reports Server 6i could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Reports Server process.

### Description

| Oracle Reports Server is a component of Oracle Application Server that handles client requests for reports from multiple data sources. Oracle Reports Server is capable of accepting requests and delivering reports over the web using a Reports Web Cartridge (RWCGI60). RWCGI60 is a CGI program that translates and delivers information between the Oracle HTTP Server and the Oracle Reports Server. According to a [report](http://www.nextgenss.com/advisories/orarep.txt) by NGSSoftware, RWCGI60 is vulnerable to a buffer overflow via an HTTP request containing a specially crafted database name parameter.  According to [Oracle Security Alert #35](http://technet.oracle.com/deploy/security/pdf/reports6i_alert.pdf), Oracle Reports Server 6.0.8.18.0 and earlier are vulnerable, and Oracle9i Application Server 1.0.x includes a vulnerable version of Oracle Reports Server. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An unauthenticated, remote attacker could execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service on a vulnerable system. By default, the Oracle Reports stand-alone server runs as SYSTEM on Windows NT and Windows 2000 systems. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply a Patch**[Oracle Security Alert #35](http://technet.oracle.com/deploy/security/pdf/reports6i_alert.pdf) provides information on patches that address this vulnerability. |
| --- |

| **Restrict Access**Where possible, limit access to trusted users, hosts, and networks.**Disable Oracle Reports Services**If your site does not use the Oracle Reports Services, disable it.**Disable RWCGI60**If you are able to use other components of Oracle Reports Services to process reports via HTTP, do not use RWCGI60. |
