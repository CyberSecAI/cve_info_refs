Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the Oracle Reports Web Cartridge (RWCGI60) component of Oracle Reports Server. This occurs when handling an HTTP request with a specially crafted database name parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the RWCGI60 CGI program. This occurs when the program attempts to copy more data into a fixed-size buffer than it can hold.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Reports Server process. This often includes system level privileges depending on the OS the server is running on (SYSTEM on Windows NT and 2000).
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The overflow could also lead to a denial of service by crashing the Reports Server process.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability is triggered via a specially crafted HTTP request containing a malicious database name parameter.
*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability, making it easily exploitable remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Oracle Reports Server.
*   **Ability to Craft HTTP Requests:** The attacker must be able to craft and send a specially formatted HTTP request to the server.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability affects Oracle Reports Server 6.0.8.18.0 and earlier and is included in Oracle9i Application Server 1.0.x.
*   The vulnerability is specifically related to the RWCGI60 component of the Oracle Reports Server.
* The content mentions that Oracle released security alert #35 addressing the issue.
