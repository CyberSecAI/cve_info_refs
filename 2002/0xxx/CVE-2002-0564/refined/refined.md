Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in the context of CVE-2002-0564:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the insecure implementation of the Apache PL/SQL module within Oracle9i Application Server. The vulnerability stems from the ability of an attacker to specify the Database Access Descriptor (DAD) used to access a PL/SQL application via the URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **DAD Substitution:** Attackers can manipulate the URL to specify a different DAD than intended by the application.
*   **Lack of Authentication Enforcement:**  Some DADs may grant PUBLIC access to applications or procedures, bypassing intended authentication mechanisms.
*   **URL Parameter Manipulation:**  The DAD parameter being exposed in the URL makes it susceptible to tampering.
*   **Inconsistent Access Control:** Different DADs within the same database schema might have varying access control policies, leading to privilege escalation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to Oracle PL/SQL applications and procedures by substituting the DAD with one that allows public access.
*   **Data Manipulation:**  Depending on the application's functionality, attackers can potentially read, modify, or delete data within the database.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By using a publicly accessible DAD, an attacker can bypass authentication and gain access to protected applications.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **URL Manipulation:**  The attacker manipulates the URL by changing the DAD parameter to access a PL/SQL application.
*   **Web Requests:** Exploitation occurs via standard HTTP requests by crafting specific URLs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the Oracle9i Application Server.
*   **Knowledge of DADs:** The attacker needs to know or guess a DAD that grants PUBLIC access, or at least have knowledge of the DAD structure.
*   **Basic HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker should be able to manipulate URL parameters in a web request.

**Additional Notes**
* The vulnerability was discovered and reported by David Litchfield of NGSSoftware.
* The provided content also mentions that Oracle9i Database and Oracle8i Database may also be vulnerable due to the use of the same PL/SQL module.
* Oracle provided a security alert to address this issue by using the "exclusion_list" parameter in the configuration.
