Based on the provided document, here's the information related to CVE-2002-0189:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A local resource file included with Internet Explorer (IE) contains an HTML web page that fails to properly validate inputs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-site scripting vulnerability in a local HTML resource. The vulnerability exists because a local resource file that is included with IE contains an HTML web page that fails to properly validate inputs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability could cause HTML scripts to execute as if they were run locally on the user's system.
- The attacker's script would run in the Local Computer zone, allowing it to run with fewer restrictions than it would in the Internet Zone.
- The scripts could take any action on the local system as if it were run locally.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-borne:** An attacker could create a malicious web page that invokes the vulnerable web page and injects the script he wants to execute.
- **Email-borne:** An attacker could send the malicious web page as an HTML email.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to craft a malicious web page.
- For web-borne attacks: Ability to host the malicious page on a web server and entice the user to visit it.
- For email-borne attacks: Ability to send HTML emails to the intended victim.
- No special privileges are needed. The actions an attacker can take are constrained by the user's privileges.

**Mitigating Factors:**
- Users who read email in the Restricted Sites zone are protected from automated email-borne attacks (e.g., Outlook Express 6.0, Outlook 98/2000 with Outlook Email Security Update, and Outlook 2002). However, users can still be attacked if they click on a malicious link within the email.
- Users who have enabled the "Read as Plain Text" feature in Outlook 2002 SP1 are immune from HTML email attacks.
- Any limitations on the rights of the user's account would also limit the actions of the attacker's script.
-  Users who exercise caution in what web sites they visit or who place unknown or untrusted sites in the Restricted Sites zone can protect themselves from attempts to exploit this issue on the web.

**Severity:**
- Critical on client systems for Internet Explorer 6.0.
- Moderate on Internet and Intranet servers for Internet Explorer 6.0.
- Not present on IE 5.01 and 5.5.

**Patch Information:**
- The patch eliminates the vulnerability by instituting proper input validation in the local HTML resource in question.
- This is part of a cumulative patch that also addresses other vulnerabilities.
