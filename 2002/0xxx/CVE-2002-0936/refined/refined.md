Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2002-0936:

**CVE Description:**

The provided content states the following about CVE-2002-0936:

> **Denial of service vulnerability**
> [CVE-2002-0936](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2002-0936)
>
> The issue described requires an attacker to be able to plant a JSP page
> on the Tomcat server. If an attacker can do this then the server is
> already compromised. In this case an attacker could just as easily add a
> page that called System.exit(1) rather than relying on a bug in an
> internal Sun class.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises from a scenario where an attacker has already compromised the Tomcat server, allowing them to upload a malicious JSP page. The underlying cause is not a specific bug within Tomcat itself but rather a consequence of pre-existing compromise. The attacker can leverage a bug in an internal Sun class, however they could more easily execute arbitrary code and cause a denial of service more directly.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- The core vulnerability is the ability to upload and execute a malicious JSP page on the Tomcat server. This indicates a broader access control/security issue.
- Exploitation requires a compromised system and the attacker having the ability to plant JSP files.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- Denial of Service: An attacker could render the server unresponsive by uploading and executing a malicious JSP page that leverages a bug in an internal Sun class.
- The attacker could also directly execute arbitrary code which could achieve the same goal.
- The text emphasizes that if an attacker can upload a JSP, they already have the ability to cause serious harm.

**Attack vectors:**

-  Upload a malicious JSP page to the Tomcat server. This can be achieved through various means depending on the specific server configuration and vulnerabilities present.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to have sufficient access to the Tomcat server to upload and execute JSP files. This typically implies a pre-existing compromise or some other means of unauthorized access to the server.

**Additional Notes:**

- The content states that this is not a vulnerability in Tomcat, but rather a consequence of a compromised server. The vulnerability relies on a bug in an internal Sun class, but direct execution of arbitrary code by an attacker would achieve the same goal more easily, and the system is already compromised if a JSP can be planted on the server.
- The fix is not applicable because if an attacker can plant a JSP file, they can do anything and the server is already compromised.
