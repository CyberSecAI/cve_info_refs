- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Expressions server does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when handling file paths, allowing directory traversal.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Directory traversal vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can view arbitrary files on the server's file system. This includes sensitive system files, configuration files, and potentially other confidential data.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited through HTTP requests to the Expressions server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Expressions server and does not require any user credentials. They can exploit this vulnerability remotely.
