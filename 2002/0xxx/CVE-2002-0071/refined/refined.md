Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2002-0071:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from an off-by-one error in the HTR ISAPI extension (ISM.DLL) when calculating the buffer size needed for storing an input value. This miscalculation leads to a buffer that is one byte smaller than required.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Buffer Overflow:**  A specially crafted HTR request can exploit the undersized buffer, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow. This overflow occurs due to the ISAPI extension miscalculating the size of the buffer needed to hold the request. Specifically, the parameter handling of the module is vulnerable (`/foo.htr?<buffer>=x`).
- **Improper Input Validation:** The HTR ISAPI extension fails to properly validate the size of the input before copying it into a buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Overwriting the buffer with random data can crash the IIS service, preventing the server from handling web requests. This is the most likely outcome of an attempted exploit.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In very specific and difficult-to-achieve circumstances (e.g., the server having not served any web requests since the last boot), an attacker could overwrite program code in memory with malicious code. This would allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the HTR ISAPI extension.
    - On IIS 4.0, this could result in complete control over the server.
    - On IIS 5.0 and 5.1, this would grant privileges associated with the IWAM_*computername* account (an unprivileged user).

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious HTR Requests:** Attackers send specially crafted, malformed HTTP requests targeting the .htr ISAPI extension. These requests include oversized input designed to overflow the undersized buffer within the HTR extension.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable IIS server.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know how to craft the malicious HTR request to trigger the buffer overflow.
- **(For RCE):** Knowledge of memory layout and specific conditions of the server (e.g., that the server hasn't served any requests since the last boot) is needed to execute arbitrary code. This is not easy to achieve, making DoS attacks more likely.
-  The attacker needs to know the locations of certain information in memory. This is most likely to occur when the web server has not served any content since being rebooted.

**Additional Notes:**
- The HTR ISAPI extension is an older technology and is not widely used.
- Microsoft has long recommended disabling the HTR ISAPI extension unless it is business-critical.
- The IIS Lockdown Tool disables HTR by default.
- URLScan tool (if configured correctly) can prevent exploitation by blocking malformed requests
- The vulnerability affects IIS 4.0 and 5.0. IIS 5.1 is not affected.
- The vulnerability was independently reported by Dave Aitel of @Stake and Peter Grundl of KPMG.
