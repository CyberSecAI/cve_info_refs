- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The iBuySpy store application lacks proper authorization checks on the `orderdetails.aspx` page. It does not verify if the logged-in user is the owner of the order before displaying order details.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability. The application uses the `OrderID` parameter directly without validating the user's authorization to access the specific order.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can view other users' order details, including personal information and purchase history.
- **Attack vectors:** By modifying the `OrderID` parameter in the URL, an attacker can access other users' order details.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have a valid user account on the iBuySpy store website and must be logged in.
