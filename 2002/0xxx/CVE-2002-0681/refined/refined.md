Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities in GoAhead Web Server v2.1 as reported by Westpoint Security Advisory wp-02-0001:

**1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

*   **Root Cause:** The server includes the requested URL in its 404 error messages without proper sanitization.
*   **Weakness:** Insufficient input validation and output encoding of user-supplied data (URL).
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the URL, which will then be executed in the victim's browser when the server returns the 404 error. This can lead to various attacks, such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
*   **Attack Vector:** A crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript code is requested from the server.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**  The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.

**2. Directory Traversal**

*   **Root Cause:** The server does not properly sanitize the requested URL, allowing for traversal outside of the web root directory.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of input validation and inadequate path sanitization.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can read arbitrary files from the server's file system by using directory traversal sequences (e.g., `..%5C..%5C`). This can lead to exposure of sensitive information such as configuration files, source code, or user data.
*   **Attack Vector:** A crafted URL containing URL encoded directory traversal sequences (e.g., `..%5C`) is requested from the server.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.

The advisory also mentions that the vendor did not respond to the vulnerability report and it is unknown if a patch was available.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory provides more specific details than a typical CVE description, such as the exact encoding used for directory traversal and the specific exploit vector for XSS.
*   The advisory also provides links to previous security incidents related to the GoAhead web server, suggesting this might be a reoccurring issue.
