- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An unchecked buffer in a function that handles user authentication within Microsoft Content Management Server (MCMS) 2001.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could either cause a denial of service by corrupting program code and causing the MCMS authentication service to fail or gain the ability to run arbitrary code with LocalSystem privileges by overwriting program code.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a specially crafted request to an affected server through a web page that calls the vulnerable authentication function without proper input validation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to connect to the affected server and access a web page that passes authentication data to the vulnerable system function. The web page also needs to lack input length validation.
