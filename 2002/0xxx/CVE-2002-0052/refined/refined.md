- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A flaw in how VBScript is handled in Internet Explorer, specifically in validating cross-domain access within frames. This allows scripts from one domain to access content from another domain, violating the intended cross-domain security model.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper cross-domain access control in VBScript handling within Internet Explorer. This allows a script in one frame to access the content of another frame, even if they belong to different domains.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Information Disclosure: An attacker can read files on the user's local machine (that can be opened in a browser), potentially including sensitive information.
    - Exposure of data from third-party websites: The attacker can capture content from third-party websites that the user visited after visiting the attacker's site. This could include usernames, passwords, or credit card information.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Malicious website: The attacker hosts a website with malicious VBScript code that exploits the vulnerability.
    - HTML email: The attacker sends an HTML email containing the malicious VBScript code. When the email is opened/previewed, the script executes, potentially exfiltrating data.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to lure the victim to a website they control or send them a specially crafted HTML email.
    - To access local files, the attacker needs to know the exact name and location of the files.
    - The attacker can only access files that can be displayed in a browser (text, HTML, image files).
