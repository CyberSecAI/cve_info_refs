Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2002-0057:

**Summary:**

The vulnerability lies in the XMLHTTP ActiveX control within Microsoft XML Core Services (MSXML), which fails to properly enforce Internet Explorer security zone restrictions. This allows a malicious website to potentially read local files from a user's system.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The XMLHTTP control does not properly check the security settings of a redirected data stream returned in response to a request, and thus does not enforce IE Security Zone restrictions. It does not recognize when a data source is redirected to a local file, thereby allowing access.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- Improper security checks on redirected data streams.
- Failure to adhere to IE Security Zone restrictions.
- Ability to bypass checks intended to prevent accessing local files.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can read local files from the victim's system. The attacker cannot add, change, or delete files.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Website:** An attacker must host a malicious website that leverages the XMLHTTP control to redirect a data request to a local file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to host a website they control.
- The attacker needs to know (or guess) the full path and file name of the target file on the user's system.
- The attacker needs to entice the user to visit the malicious site.
- Cannot be exploited via HTML email.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is considered "Critical" for client systems (home users) due to the potential disclosure of personal information.
- The vulnerability affects MSXML versions 2.6, 3.0, and 4.0, which are included in Windows XP, Internet Explorer 6.0, and SQL Server 2000.
- The provided content from marc.info indicates that this vulnerability was publicly known before the MS02-005 patch was released, and that MS02-005 did *not* fix this vulnerability. The content also notes that the vulnerability is only fixed for NT4/Win2000 with the "Windows 2000 Security Rollup Package, January, 2002", whereas other versions of Windows are still vulnerable.
