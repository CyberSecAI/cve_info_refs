- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The stored procedure `sp_MScopyscriptfile` fails to validate user input before passing it to the `xp_cmdshell` extended stored procedure.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The vulnerability is an arbitrary command execution due to lack of input validation in the `sp_MScopyscriptfile` stored procedure, which allows execution of OS commands via `xp_cmdshell`.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A low-privileged user can execute arbitrary operating system commands with the security context of the SQL Server account. If the SQL Server account has administrator privileges, the attacker can gain full control of the server.
- **Attack vectors**:  The attacker exploits the vulnerability by calling the `sp_MScopyscriptfile` stored procedure with a specially crafted `@scriptfile` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have a low-privileged SQL Server login with the `EXECUTE` permission on `sp_MScopyscriptfile`. The target SQL server should also be configured as a distributor.
