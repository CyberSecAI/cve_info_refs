RELATED: The provided content discusses a vulnerability in the GNU tar utility, specifically related to path traversal using "../" sequences. This aligns with CVE-2002-0399, which is described as a vulnerability related to directory traversal in tar.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability arises from a flaw in how GNU tar handles filenames containing ".." sequences during extraction. Specifically, tar removes leading slashes but fails to properly check for ".." sequences after removing the leading slash, allowing for directory traversal.  Additionally, a related symlink vulnerability exists, where `tar` could be tricked into following a symbolic link it just extracted and writing files outside of the intended directory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Directory traversal vulnerability:  tar fails to properly sanitize filenames containing ".." after stripping leading slashes, allowing an attacker to write files outside the intended target directory.
    - Symlink vulnerability: tar can be tricked into following a newly extracted symlink and writing files outside the intended directory if a check is reversed.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers could overwrite arbitrary files and potentially execute malicious code on the system by writing files to unexpected locations.
- **Attack vectors:** Crafted tar archives with filenames containing leading slashes followed by "../" sequences or that leverage symlinks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker needs to be able to create or modify a tar archive, and the victim must then extract this malicious archive with a vulnerable version of `tar`.
