How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

I believe 3APA3A was first to post this to Bugtraq last year:

<http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=bugtraq&m=99496364810666>

At least 1.13.17 and 1.13.18 are known to get the contains_dot_dot()
function right, some older versions certainly didn't have it.  1.13.19
introduced a bug which broke the check and it's still not fixed in
1.13.25.

There's another related problem where tar could be made to follow a
symlink it just extracted and place a file outside of the intended
directory tree, pointed out on Bugtraq by Willy TARREAU in 1998:

<http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=bugtraq&m=90674255917321>

Paul Eggert included a fix for it in 1.13.18:

"2000-10-23

...Extract potentially dangerous symbolic links more carefully,
deferring their creation until the end, and using a regular file
placeholder in the meantime."

However, he later broke it with a typo (reversed check) in 1.13.19.
1.13.25 has that check fixed again.

I've now fixed these two bugs and a third (non-security) bug that
1.13.19 introduced for the Owl package, with proper credit to you and
others involved, in both the package and the system-wide change log:

<http://www.openwall.com/Owl/CHANGES.shtml>

Although the two security bugs are now fixed, please keep in mind that
tar has traditionally been intended for making and extracting tape
backups rather than archives obtained from untrusted sources.  Be very
careful with what input you pass it and what user you run it as.

I've attached the two security patches to this message.  The dot-dot
patch is valid for 1.13.19 to 1.13.25, the symlink patch is needed for
1.13.19 and possibly some versions after it but not 1.13.25.  Other
patches that we use may be obtained via:

cvs -z3 -d :pserver:anoncvs:anoncvs@anoncvs.owl.openwall.com:/cvs co Owl/packages/tar

or:
