Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2002-0569:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the Oracle 9i Application Server's XSQL Servlet bypassing file permission checks. Even if configuration files are protected with appropriate permissions, the XSQLServlet allows access to these files, exposing their contents.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insufficient Access Control:** The XSQL Servlet does not respect the file system permissions intended to restrict access to sensitive configuration files.
- **Bypass of Security Measures:** The servlet provides a way to bypass intended security restrictions by allowing unauthorized access to sensitive data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can read sensitive configuration files.
- **Server Compromise:**  The leaked information about the server's configuration can be used to further compromise the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request via XSQLServlet:** Attackers can send an HTTP request to access the configuration files through the XSQLServlet. This method bypasses normal file permission checks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server to send the malicious HTTP request.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any prior authentication.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered and reported by David Litchfield of NGSSoftware.
- The vulnerability is present in the default installation of Oracle 9i Application Server because configuration files are not protected by default.
- A "403 Forbidden" response would be expected if the files had proper permissions, but the XSQLServlet allows for an unauthorized access.
- The CERT/CC at the time was not aware of a practical solution, recommending applying appropriate permissions and potentially removing the XSQLServlet.

The information provided in the CERT Vulnerability Note (VU#977251) and the Bugtraq post provides more details than the official CVE description.
