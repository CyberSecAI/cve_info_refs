- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the Low BandWidth X proxy (lbxproxy), specifically in the `ConnectToServer` function located in `lbxproxy/di/wire.c`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer overflow due to a crafted display command-line option.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local attacker can execute arbitrary code with root privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is local and involves exploiting a buffer overflow within the `lbxproxy` by manipulating the display command-line option.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A local user must be able to execute `lbxproxy` with a crafted command-line argument. The `lbxproxy` must be running with root privileges.
