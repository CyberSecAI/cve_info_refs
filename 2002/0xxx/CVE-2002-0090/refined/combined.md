## Low BandWidth X proxy vulnerable to buffer overflow via crafted display command line option

#### Vulnerability Note VU#188507

Original Release Date: 2002-08-19 | Last Revised: 2002-08-19

---

### Overview

A locally exploitable buffer overflow exists in the [Low BandWidth X proxy](http://www.xfree86.org/4.2.0/lbxproxy.1.html).

### Description

| The Low BandWidth X proxy is a component of [XFree86](http://www.xfree86.org) (a freely redistributable open-source implementation of the X Window System). The Low BandWidth X proxy allows applications to transparently take advantage of the Low Bandwidth extension to X (LBX). LBX allows one to make more efficient use of low bandwidth high latency communication links. Quoting from [LBX technical specifications](http://lpo.fri.uni-lj.si/doc_link/en_US/a_doc_lib/x11/specs/lbx.htm):  *Low Bandwidth X (LBX) is a network-transparent protocol for running X Window System applications over transport channels whose bandwidth and latency are significantly worse than that used in local area networks. It combines a variety of caching and reencoding techniques to reduce the volume of data that must be sent over the wire. It can be used with existing clients by placing a proxy between the clients and server, so that the low bandwidth/high latency communication occurs between the proxy and server.*The vulnerability manifests itself in the following function:[lbxproxy/di/wire.c](http://ftp.x.org/pub/R6.4/xc/programs/lbxproxy/di/wire.c):ConnectToServer |

### Impact

| A local attacker can execute arbitrary code with root privileges. |

### Solution

| Apply a vendor patch. |
