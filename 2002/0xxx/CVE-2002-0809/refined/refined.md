The provided content relates to CVE-2002-0809.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The bug report describes an issue where the Bugzilla bug tracking system does not correctly handle URL encoded characters in parameter names, specifically when the hyphen character '-' is encoded as '%2D'. This occurred when using the NetPositive browser which encoded the hyphens in URLs.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect URL decoding: The server-side code was not properly decoding URL-encoded parameter names, specifically not converting '%2D' back to '-'.
- Loss of form data: Due to the incorrect decoding, form fields with encoded hyphens in their names were being dropped or ignored when processing form submissions.
- Information Exposure: When group membership bits are encoded with '%2D', the server interprets this as a request to remove membership from the group. This could lead to unintentional exposure of private bug information due to incorrect group membership handling.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Loss of private bug information: Users belonging to private groups could unintentionally expose bug information by making seemingly benign updates while using a browser which encoded hyphens.
- Incorrect group membership: Updates would not preserve group membership information.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when a user submits a form with hyphens in the parameter names, and the browser encodes these hyphens as '%2D'. The server fails to decode these back to hyphens.
- This can occur when using specific browsers that encode hyphens. In the bug report, the NetPositive browser is mentioned.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be a user of Bugzilla, with permissions to make changes to bugs.
- The attacker needs to use a browser which encodes hyphens in URL query parameters (like NetPositive).
