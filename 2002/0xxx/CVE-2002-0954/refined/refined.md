The provided content discusses a vulnerability in Cisco PIX firewalls related to weak password encryption, which aligns with the description of CVE-2002-0954 (PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval). While there is no official description, this document provides the context for the vulnerability.

Here's a breakdown of the information:

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: The primary issue is the weak encryption algorithm used to store passwords within the PIX configuration file. This makes offline brute-force attacks feasible if the attacker obtains the configuration file.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**:
    *   Weak password encryption: The core vulnerability is the insufficient strength of the encryption applied to passwords in the configuration file.
    *   Reliance on a shared enable password:  The practice of using a single, shared enable password across multiple devices increases the risk.
    *   Unprotected configuration file: The document highlights the risk of configuration file interception during transfer between devices.
*   **Impact of Exploitation**: An attacker who gains access to the configuration file can potentially decrypt passwords and gain administrative access to the PIX firewall. This enables the attacker to fully compromise the firewall and network it protects.
*   **Attack Vectors**:
    *   Configuration file interception: The primary attack vector involves capturing the PIX configuration file during transfer or from insecure storage.
    *   Offline brute-force/dictionary attack: Once the attacker has the config file, they can perform offline brute-force or dictionary attacks on the weakly encrypted passwords.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**:
    *   Access to PIX configuration file: The attacker must somehow acquire the PIX configuration file.
    *   Ability to perform offline attacks: They must have the tools and resources to perform brute-force or dictionary attacks.

The document also includes mitigation strategies:
* Use strong, long passwords with mixed characters.
* Protect the configuration files during transfer and storage
* Configure permitted administrative hosts.
* Use the local database that uses "salted" passwords.
* Use TACACS+ or RADIUS for authentication.
* Avoid sharing the same configuration file across multiple devices.
