This document describes multiple vulnerabilities, including the one related to CVE-2002-0727.

**CVE-2002-0727** is related to the **Host() Vulnerability**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Office Web Components (OWC) expose the `Host()` function which provides access to applications' object models. This functionality is unsuitable for use by untrusted sites.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    *   The `Host()` function allows a caller (e.g., a script from a website) to access the object models of other applications on the user's system.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could use the `Host()` function to open an application (e.g. an Office application) on the user's system and invoke commands that execute operating system commands as the user. This could enable the attacker to load and run programs, alter data, reformat the hard drive, or change security settings.
*   **Attack vectors**:
    *   **Web-based attack**: An attacker would need to host a webpage containing malicious script that invokes the `Host()` function. The user would have to visit this site.
    *   **HTML email attack**: The malicious script could be included in an HTML email, which would execute when the email is rendered.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    *   The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious web page or HTML email.
    *   The attacker needs to induce the victim to either visit the malicious website or open the malicious HTML email.
*   **Additional Details:**
    *   The vulnerability is present in Office Web Components 2000 and 2002.
    *   The patch does not set a "kill bit" on the control, because it would break legitimate functionality.
    *   Mitigating factors include disabling ActiveX controls, using the Restricted Sites zone, reading emails as plain text, and having limited user privileges.

**Other Vulnerabilities Described in the Document (not related to CVE-2002-0727):**

*   **LoadText() Vulnerability (CAN-2002-0860):** A vulnerability in the `LoadText()` method of the OWC could allow a malicious website to read files on the user's system. This vulnerability could only be used to read files, not to modify them. The attacker would need to know the full path and name of the file.
*   **Copy()/Paste() Vulnerability (CAN-2002-0861):** The `Copy()` and `Paste()` methods in OWC fail to honor the "disabled" setting for Internet Explorer's "Allow paste operations via script," allowing a web site to read the user's clipboard, even when this setting was enabled.

**Remediation**:

*   Apply Office XP SP2 (preferred).
*   Apply the specific patches for Microsoft Project 2002 or Microsoft Project Server 2002, if applicable.
*   Apply the general patch for all other products affected.
*   Install the updated Office Web Components Download.
