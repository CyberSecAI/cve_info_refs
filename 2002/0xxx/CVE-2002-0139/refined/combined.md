This allows you to both send and receive files from a variety of FTP clients running on different operating systems, including Windows, BeOS, MacOS, OS/2, and UNIX  **Configuring SpoonFTP**  Configuring SpoonFTP is designed to be a simple process. Once you've started SpoonFTP, you can select Properties from the main window's menu and access all the settings. If you're running SpoonFTP as a service, you will need to run SpoonFTP using the Start menu, which runs the SpoonFTP status and configuration utility and presents the same Properties menu option.  All you really need to do to allow a user to login to SpoonFTP is add a user. Anonymous FTP is not added by default for security reasons, but you can add a standard anonymous user easily: just add a user named anonymous and check the anonymous option in the Settings window under the Users tab in Properties.  **Starting SpoonFTP**  On Windows NT/2000 systems:  SpoonFTP is installed as a service. After installing SpoonFTP, you can start the SpoonFTP service manually, or restart your system, which will automatically start the SpoonFTP service.    Other Windows systems, such as Win95/98/Me:  Go to Start->Programs->SpoonFTP or wherever you installed SpoonFTP, and select the SpoonFTP icon. Optionally, you can add SpoonFTP to your Start->Programs->Startup folder so it starts every time you start Windows.  **This is a shareware product. How do I register it?**  Once you install SpoonFTP, you have 30 days to review the full version of the software. After 30 days, users can no longer login unless you register.
