  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2002-0074",
      "relevance": "YES",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization in the IIS Help File search facility. Specifically, the search facility blindly uses user-provided input without proper filtering, which allows for the injection of malicious script.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious script into the user's browser session when the user clicks on a crafted link. This script executes within the context of the trusted site, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.",
       "attack_vectors": [
         "The attacker needs to lure the victim to click on a malicious link, or open an HTML mail.",
          "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted URL to an affected IIS server. This URL contains malicious script that is not properly sanitized by the server.",
          "The malicious script is then reflected back to the victim's browser through the search result page, where it is executed."
        ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious website or send a malicious email. They need to craft the malicious URL that contains the script.",
      "affected_versions": [
        "IIS 5.0",
        "IIS 5.1"
