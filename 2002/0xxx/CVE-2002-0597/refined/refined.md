- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by the improper handling of malformed packets received on TCP port 445 by the Microsoft LAN Manager (LANMAN) service in Windows 2000. When LANMAN receives these malformed packets, it allocates kernel memory to process them, leading to excessive memory consumption.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The core vulnerability lies in the inadequate parsing and handling of malformed network packets by the LANMAN service, which allows an attacker to trigger excessive memory allocation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The exploitation leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. As the systemâ€™s memory consumption nears 100%, Windows and its applications begin to malfunction, exhibiting symptoms like incomplete window drawing, error messages related to system sounds, IIS failures, and inability to perform routine tasks, potentially leading to a system crash and inability to recover on its own.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based, where the attacker sends specially crafted, malformed packets to the target system via TCP port 445.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the target system on TCP port 445. The attacker does not require any prior authentication.
