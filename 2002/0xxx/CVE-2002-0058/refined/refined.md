Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2002-0058:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in how the Java Virtual Machine (specifically, Sun's and Microsoft's implementations) handles HTTP requests when a proxy server is configured. A flaw exists in the processing of Java requests for proxy resources, allowing a malicious Java applet to redirect web traffic.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unchecked Network Access:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper checks on network access initiated by Java applets, specifically when a proxy server is involved.
*   **HTTP Proxy Connection Hijacking:** The vulnerability allows a malicious applet to hijack a browser's persistent HTTP connection to its configured proxy server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can redirect a user's Internet session to a system under their control. This enables the attacker to capture and examine the user's session information, potentially including usernames, passwords, and other sensitive data sent in clear text (HTTP). Although HTTPS traffic is encrypted, it is still vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack.
*   **Session Hijacking:** The attacker can silently redirect all browser traffic to a server of their choosing, without the user's knowledge.
*   **Spoofing/Manipulation:** The attacker can handle the redirected traffic, giving the user the impression of a normal session, but injecting malicious responses or modifying the communication.
*   **Denial of Service:** The attacker can discard the redirected traffic, effectively denying the user access to the intended resource.
*   **Replay Attacks:** Captured session information can be used in replay attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Java Applet:** The attack is initiated through a specially crafted Java applet hosted on a website controlled by the attacker.
*   **User Interaction:** The user needs to visit the attacker's website hosting the malicious applet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to host a website:** The attacker must host a website where they can post the malicious applet.
*   **Java development knowledge:** The attacker needs to develop a specifically crafted Java applet that exploits the vulnerability.
*   **Proxy Server requirement:** The target user must have their browser configured to use a proxy server for the exploit to be effective.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to Java applets; Java applications are not affected.
*   The issue affects multiple Java implementations including Sun's and Microsoft's JVM.
*   The attacker could capture the traffic and examine it for sensitive information if it is sent via HTTP.
*   The effect of exploiting the vulnerability lasts throughout a user's browsing session until the browser is closed.

The provided content offers more detail than the standard CVE description. It specifies that the vulnerability is related to how Java requests for proxy resources are handled, allowing redirection of traffic. It also highlights the impact as information disclosure and potential for code execution.
