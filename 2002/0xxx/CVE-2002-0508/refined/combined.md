|  | ---     **WWWIsis 3.x security issue**    The security issue reported by Mr. Klaus Ripke (krip@openisis.org) exists. It affects only wwwisis 3.x versions and does not affect later releases (current version is 5.0).  As Mr. Ripke describes it, a security hole exists when "prolog" and/or "epilog" parameters are passed in the query string with malicious values such as system calls.  **SOLUTION**  Of course the recommended action is to upgrade wwwisis to version 5.0. It has been completely rebuild and incorporates a lot of new features such as XML manipulation.  For those that will not upgrade and/or need to protect legacy systems a solution follows.  Wwwisis 3.x versions are not longer maintained and developers should take care of the problem at application level following simple rules in using prolog/epilog parameters.  The security issue occurs only in two situations:  a) PROLOG/EPILOG parameters are set before CGI parameter in de "somefile.in" file.  The solution in this case is to move them at the end of the CGI declaration. This change should not affect program's logic.  Example:  **a "somefile.in" file for wwwisis:**  *db=/db/some**pft=@some.pft  prolog=@prolog.pft  epilog=@epilog.pft  cgi='bool=',(if v100^n='boolean' then v100^v fi)/*  should be changed to:  *db=/db/some**pft=@some.pft**cgi='bool=',(if v100^n='boolean' then v100^v fi)/,'prolog=@prolog.pft'/,'epilog=@epilog.pft'/,*  *all in one line.*    **b) PROLOG/EPILOG parameters are not set**.  To create wwwisis scripts without setting prolog/epilog parameters is a non common situation. In this case, just declare the parameters as 'epilog=,' and 'prolog=,' at the end of the CGI declaration.  Example:  **a "somefile.in" file for wwwisis:**  *db=/db/some  pft=@some.pft  cgi='bool=',(if v100^n='boolean' then v100^v fi)/*  should be changed to:  *db=/db/some  pft=@some.pft  cgi='bool=',(if v100^n='boolean' then v100^v fi)/,'prolog=,'/,'epilog=,'/,*  When PROLOG/EPILOG parameters are defined as indicated, there is no way to break security through this trick. Even if someone try to redefine the parameters via CGI Query.   --- |  |
