Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2002-0648:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in how Internet Explorer handles the `<script>` tag with the `language="xml"` attribute (also known as XML data islands) when fetching XML data via the "src" attribute. While the intention is to restrict the source of XML data to the same domain as the HTML document, the browser fails to validate the source after a redirection. This allows an attacker to redirect the source to a different domain or even a local file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **Insufficient Domain Validation:** The primary weakness is that Internet Explorer does not properly check the final source of the XML data after a redirect, which violates the same-origin policy. This allows the browser to fetch and process data from a location that it should not have access to.
* **XML Parsing Error Exploitation:** Even if the fetched data is not valid XML, the XML parser's error mechanism (`parseError.srcText` property) can be used to extract data. If the data doesn't contain line breaks, the entire content can be exposed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can read the contents of XML files from both remote servers and local file systems. Additionally, fragments of non-XML files can be accessed. This can expose sensitive user information or system data.
* **Cross-Domain Data Access:** The vulnerability circumvents the intended security model that prevents web pages from accessing data from other domains, including the local file system.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Malicious Web Page:** The attacker can host a malicious web page on a server. When a user visits this page, the script attempts to read data from a location specified by the attacker.
* **HTML Email:** The attacker can send an HTML email containing the malicious script. When the user opens the email, the script will attempt to read the data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* The attacker needs to be able to host a web page or send HTML email.
* The attacker needs to know or guess the full path and name of the target XML file on the victim's system, although it is also possible to read parts of other types of files if the attacker doesn't have the exact filename.
* The attacker needs to have an understanding of how redirects work and how the `<script>` tag with `language="xml"` works in Internet Explorer.

**Additional Details from the provided content:**
*   The vulnerability affects Internet Explorer 5 and later versions and any other application using the IE engine such as Outlook and MSN Explorer.
*   The issue was reported to Microsoft on Feb 18, 2002, and a patch was released on Aug 22, 2002.
*   The vulnerability can expose private information.
