Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies within the interaction between JServ and the GNUJSP servlet. JServ incorrectly sets the servlet's PathInfo to `[dirname]/[file]` when a request is made to `<http://site/servlets/gnujsp/>[dirname]/[file]`. The GNUJSP servlet then incorrectly assumes that the request was actually for `<http://site/>[dirname]/[file]`, leading to the vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Directory Listing:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to list the contents of any web directory, including the web root (wwwroot).
*   **Script Source Disclosure:** The source code of certain script types can be revealed, depending on web server configurations.
*   **HTTP Restriction Bypass:** By accessing resources through `/servlets/gnujsp/`, attackers can bypass restrictions defined in `http.conf` or `.htaccess`, gaining access to files and directory structures along with the `.htaccess` files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can gain access to sensitive information by viewing directory structures, file contents, and source code.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  Bypassing access restrictions can lead to unauthorized access to critical files and potentially enable privilege escalation or further compromise the server.
*   **System Compromise:** The ability to access configuration files like `.htaccess` can aid in deeper system compromises.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious HTTP Requests:** Attackers send specially crafted HTTP requests to a vulnerable server using the pattern `<http://site/servlets/gnujsp/>[dirname]/[file]`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   **Knowledge of GNUJSP installation:** The attacker needs to know the existence and location of the /servlets/gnujsp path which is often easily guessed or found in error messages.

**Additional Information from the Content (More Detail than CVE Description):**

*   The issue lies within how JServ and GNUJSP interact.
*   A patch is provided to address the vulnerability by denying requests directly to the GNUJSP servlet URI.
*   The suggested patch enforces that only files mapped to the GNUJSP servlet (e.g., *.jsp) can be accessed.
*   The vulnerability was confirmed on Apache, but other servers with GNUJSP might be affected too.
*   The `denyuri` configuration option for GNUJSP is considered inadequate since it doesn't work with servlet aliases and multiple URI entries.
