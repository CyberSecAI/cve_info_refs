The provided document is a Microsoft Security Bulletin (MS02-033) that describes multiple vulnerabilities in Microsoft Commerce Server 2000 and 2002. It includes a section specifically addressing a new variant of an ISAPI filter buffer overrun, which is the vulnerability associated with CVE-2002-0623.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information for CVE-2002-0623:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- An unchecked buffer exists in the AuthFilter ISAPI filter, a component of Microsoft Commerce Server. This filter is not part of IIS and only present in the Commerce Server.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the AuthFilter ISAPI filter. This variant is the same as the one discussed in MS02-010 but exploitable in a different way.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can lead to complete control over the affected Commerce Server web server.
- An attacker could change web pages, reformat the hard drive, or add new users to the local administrators group.
- If the URLScan tool is used with default rules, exploitation is limited to causing the service to fail.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs to send specially crafted data within an HTTP request to the web server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker can be remote (Internet or Intranet) as long as they can access a web server running Microsoft Commerce Server with the vulnerable ISAPI filter enabled.
- The AuthFilter ISAPI filter must be enabled through the Commerce Server Administration Console. It's installed by default but not enabled by default.
- No specific authentication is required to exploit the buffer overflow.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects both Commerce Server 2000 and Commerce Server 2002.
- The provided document contains patch information and mitigation details, such as the recommendation to use the URLScan tool.
