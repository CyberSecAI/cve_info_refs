Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   A conflict exists between Microsoft's Encrypted File System (EFS) on Windows 2000 and PGP's file wiping feature. When a file is encrypted using EFS, Windows 2000 creates a temporary file containing the cleartext of the encrypted file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Temporary File Handling:** EFS creates temporary files containing the unencrypted content of files being encrypted.
*   **File Permission Restriction:** PGP's file wiping feature is unable to wipe the temporary file created by EFS due to file permission restrictions.
*   **Failure to Wipe Cleartext:** The inability of PGP to wipe the temporary files results in the cleartext of the encrypted files remaining accessible on the system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Exposure of Sensitive Data:** Cleartext data that was intended to be encrypted and protected remains on the disk, potentially exposing sensitive information.
*   **Data Breach:** An attacker who gains access to the system could potentially recover the cleartext data from the temporary files.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** An attacker would need local access to the machine where the encrypted files were created using EFS.
*   **File System Access:** The attacker needs to have sufficient file system access to read the temporary files left behind by EFS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker needs to have local user access to the system where the EFS encrypted files are stored.
*   **Basic File System Knowledge:** The attacker needs basic knowledge of file system locations and permissions to be able to locate and potentially access the vulnerable temporary files.

**Additional Notes:**
* The hotfix resolves the issue by preventing PGP from attempting to wipe these temporary EFS files, instead suggesting the user to use PGP's free disk space wipe feature for secure wiping.
*   The vulnerability is specific to Windows 2000 using EFS and a PGP product with file wiping capabilities.
