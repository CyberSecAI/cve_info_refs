ABOUT THIS HOTFIX
This Hotfix consists of a single compressed file which you can
decompress using an extraction utility such as WinZip. The zip
file contains three files: PGPhotfix.exe, PGPhotfix.exe.sig,
and this Read Me file. You may verify the signature file from
the "Network Associates Software Release Key 2002" prior to
installation of the hotfix.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
ISSUES RESOLVED IN THIS HOTFIX
1) There is a conflict between Microsoft's Encrypted File System
(EFS) on Windows 2000 and PGP�s file wiping feature. When you
encrypt a file using EFS, Windows 2000 creates a temporary file
that contains the cleartext of the encrypted file. PGP cannot
wipe this temporary file due to a file permissions restriction.
This causes EFS to fail to delete the temporary file. As a
result, cleartext remains available after the original file is
encrypted.
This hotfix resolves the issue by preventing PGP from attempting
to wipe the temporary EFS files. Because Windows 2000 EFS does
not wipe its temporary files, you should use PGP�s Free Disk
Space Wipe feature to make certain that all plaintext is
securely wiped.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
INSTALLING THE HOTFIX
1. Extract the files from hotfix Zip file into a folder.
2. Run the program PGPhotfix.exe. This will replace the existing
PGPsdk.sys on your machine with a new version of this driver.
3. Reboot the machine.
4. You can verify that the hotfix was installed by looking
for PGPsdk.sys in your Winnt\System32\drivers directory.
Right-click on the file, PGPsdk.sys and choose "Properties".
Click on the version tab.
