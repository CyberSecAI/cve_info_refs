Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause lies in web browsers (specifically Internet Explorer and Opera) allowing HTML forms to be submitted to non-HTTP services. These services might echo back the submitted data, which the browser then interprets as HTML, regardless of the underlying protocol.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Non-HTTP Service Interaction:**  Browsers render responses from non-HTTP services as HTML, leading to potential vulnerabilities.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization/Validation:** The browsers do not properly sanitize or validate the data echoed back from non-HTTP services.
- **Cross-Protocol Injection:** This vulnerability allows for cross-protocol injection, where malicious code can be injected via non-HTTP services.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Cookie Stealing:** Attackers can inject JavaScript code into the response from non-HTTP services, which the browser executes, allowing them to steal cookies.
- **Internal Network Penetration:**  The vulnerability can be used to gain access to internal networks.
- **Other malicious activities:** The attacker can potentially perform other malicious actions by injecting Javascript.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Form Creation:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTML form.
- **Form Submission:** The victim is tricked into submitting the form, either automatically using active scripting or through social engineering techniques.
- **Non-HTTP Service Echo:**  The form's submission goes to a non-HTTP service that echoes back the data.
- **JavaScript Injection and Execution:** The attacker injects JavaScript in the form data so when the browser renders the echoed back response as HTML, the malicious JavaScript is executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to create malicious HTML forms.**
- **Ability to trick the user into submitting the form.**
- **Knowledge of vulnerable non-HTTP services.**

This vulnerability is described as an "Extended HTML Form Attack." It leverages the browser's behavior of treating responses from non-HTTP protocols as if they were HTML, leading to the execution of injected JavaScript code.
