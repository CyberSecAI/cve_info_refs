Product:
Netgear Gateway Router RT314/RT311

Description:
Netgear's RT314 is a four-port gateway router targeted at the small home or small \
office network.

Systems Affected:
Tested on a Netgear RT314 running firmware versions 3.24 and 3.25. Any hardware \
running this firmware (RT-311 also runs the same firmware). Any product running \
ZyXel-RomPager web server 3.02 or earlier is probably also vulnerable.

Problem Description:
The Netgear RT314 Gateway Router (FW v3.25) runs a web server (ZyXEL-RomPager/3.02) \
for easy user configuration. This web server is vulnerable to the standard Cross Site \
Scripting problems seen in multiple web servers (noted in CERT CA-2000-02 from two \
years ago).  Though it may be difficult to exploit (attacker would need to know the \
internal address of the victim's router), it still opens the possibility that an \
attacker could gain unauthorized access to the router, and possibly reconfigure it to \
allow remote access.

To check Netgear devices for CSS, simply access the following URL in a browser:
 http://<router_ip>/<script>alert('Vulnerable')</script>
If you receive a JavaScript pop-up alert, the system is vulnerable to Cross Site \
Scripting.

Vendor Status:
Vendor was contacted on 1/5/2002 (support@netgear.com), but did not respond.
