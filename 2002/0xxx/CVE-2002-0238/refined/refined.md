- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Netgear RT314/RT311 routers use a web server (ZyXEL-RomPager/3.02) for configuration, which is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (CSS) attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The web server fails to properly sanitize user inputs, allowing the injection of malicious JavaScript code. Specifically, it's vulnerable to standard Cross Site Scripting issues.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access to the router and potentially reconfigure it to allow remote access. This could lead to a complete compromise of the router and the network behind it.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is performed by injecting JavaScript code into the URL. The provided example URL is `http://<router_ip>/<script>alert('Vulnerable')</script>`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to know the internal IP address of the victim's router.
