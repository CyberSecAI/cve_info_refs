- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Quake II server improperly expands console variables (cvars) in client-supplied input. Specifically, when a client sends a command containing an unexpanded variable (e.g., "$rcon_password"), the server expands this variable using its own local variables, instead of the client's.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Improper input validation/sanitization
    - Information disclosure vulnerability due to server-side expansion of client-supplied variables.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can obtain sensitive information, including authentication credentials like the rcon password, from affected servers. This could lead to complete compromise and control of the game server.
- **Attack vectors**: By sending crafted commands containing unexpanded cvar strings via a modified client to the server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Ability to communicate with the Quake II server via a modified client.
    - Need to prevent the client-side console from expanding the variable string before sending it to the server.
