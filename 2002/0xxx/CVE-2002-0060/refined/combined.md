## Linux kernel netfilter IRC DCC helper module creates overly permissive firewall rules

#### Vulnerability Note VU#230307

Original Release Date: 2002-03-01 | Last Revised: 2002-07-05

---

### Overview

The "netfilter" firewall subsystem included with Linux kernel versions 2.4.x contains a vulnerability that may allow remote attackers to reach hosts that should be protected.

### Description

| The "netfilter" subsystem included with Linux kernel versions 2.4.x provides a framework for services such as packet filtering and network address translation (NAT). This subsystem includes a Direct Client Connections (DCC) module for Internet Relay Chat (IRC) that allows netfilter to track outgoing DCC connections. When a DCC connection is initiated by a host inside the firewall, the IRC DCC helper module creates a dynamic firewall rule that allows responses from the remote end of the DCC connection to be passed back to the initiating host.  In versions 2.4.14 to 2.4.18-pre8 of the Linux kernel, netfilter contains an implementation error that causes the IRC DCC module to create firewall rules that are more permissive than necessary. Quoting from the [Netfilter Security Announcement](http://www.netfilter.org/security/2002-02-25-irc-dcc-mask.html):With IRC DCC, we can only tell the destination IP and port, thus we need an expectation "expect related connection from any ip / any port to this particular port number X at this particular IP address Y".Due to the implementation bug, however, the mask was to wide. The conntrack helper really says "expect related connection from any ip / any port to this particular port X at ANY IP".The netfilter subsystem is a standard part of the Linux kernel, so this vulnerability may be present in any Linux distribution that is based on the 2.4.x kernel. |
| --- |

### Impact

| This vulnerability may allow remote attackers to reach hosts that should be protected by the firewall. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply a patch from your vendor**To address this vulnerability, the CERT/CC recommends that all users of Linux kernel versions 2.4.x upgrade to the latest kernel version available for their distribution. For vendor-specific information regarding patches and affected versions, please consult the vendor section of this document. |
| --- |

| **Disable the IRC DCC helper module**If it is not possible or practical to immediately patch an affected device, disabling the IRC DCC helper module will prevent exploitation of this vulnerability. |
