Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2002-0655:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a buffer overflow in OpenSSL when handling ASCII representations of integers on 64-bit platforms. The buffers used to hold these representations were too small, leading to the overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** Multiple buffer overflows exist specifically when converting integers to ASCII on 64-bit systems.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation can lead to the execution of arbitrary code on the affected system.
*   **Server Exploitation:** On servers, the code will be executed with the privileges of the application or service that is vulnerable.
*   **Client Exploitation:** On clients, a remote attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the current user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerabilities are remotely exploitable.
*   The specific attack vector involves sending crafted data that causes a buffer overflow when OpenSSL attempts to convert integers to their ASCII representations, exploiting the undersized buffers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server or client.
*   **Crafted Input:** The attacker needs the ability to send specially crafted data to the vulnerable application.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability primarily affects OpenSSL versions prior to 0.9.6e and pre-release 0.9.7-beta2 on 64-bit platforms.
*   Multiple vendors were affected, including Apple, Debian, Gentoo, Guardian Digital, HP, IBM, ISC, Juniper, Mandrake, NetBSD, OpenLDAP, OpenPKG, Oracle, RedHat, Secure Computing, SuSE and Trustix.
*   The vulnerability is also related to other CVEs like CVE-2002-0656, CVE-2002-0657, and CVE-2002-0659, which cover other OpenSSL vulnerabilities discovered at the same time.
* Patches involve upgrading to OpenSSL 0.9.6e or later, and recompiling applications statically linked to vulnerable OpenSSL libraries.
