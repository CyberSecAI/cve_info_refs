Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- An unchecked buffer exists in an ODBC function within the Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC). This function is used to connect to data sources.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Buffer Overflow: The vulnerable ODBC function does not properly validate the size of input, leading to a buffer overflow when handling specially crafted data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user or service running the affected MDAC/ODBC component. This can lead to:
    - Complete control over the affected process.
    - The ability to create, modify, or delete data.
    - Reconfiguring the system.
    - Running programs of the attacker's choice.
- Denial of Service (DoS):  Overwriting the buffer with random data could cause the application to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Web-based Attacks:
    - An attacker can host a malicious webpage that, when visited, triggers the buffer overflow. This webpage can be hosted on a website or sent via email.
    - The exploit can be triggered via an ActiveX control with access to the vulnerable MDAC/ODBC functionality
- SQL Server Attacks:
    - An attacker can use a specially-malformed parameter within an OpenRowSet command within a Transact-SQL database query. This can cause a buffer overflow on the server.
- Email:
    - Attackers can send malicious HTML emails to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Web-based Attack:
    - The attacker needs to lure the victim into visiting a malicious webpage they control or click a link in an email.
- SQL Server Attack:
    - The attacker needs to have the ability to execute database queries against the SQL Server.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability exists in the underlying MDAC/ODBC component, and not the OpenRowSet command itself as initially believed.
- The original patch was flawed and did not correctly update the system file protection cache on some systems.
- The patch for this vulnerability was superseded by the patch in MS03-033.
- The vulnerability affects multiple versions of MDAC (2.5, 2.6, and 2.7).
- MDAC is a ubiquitous technology included with Windows XP, Windows 2000, and Windows ME, and many other Microsoft products.
- The security bulletin mentions that David Litchfield of Next Generation Security Software Ltd. reported this issue. The provided URL leads to a txt file containing the advisory regarding the SQL Server **OpenRowSet** attack vector.
