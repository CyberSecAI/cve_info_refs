The provided content relates to a vulnerability in Symantec's Norton AntiVirus Corporate Edition LiveUpdate where login credentials are stored in plaintext in the Windows registry.

**Root Cause:**
- LiveUpdate versions prior to 1.6 store the username and password for accessing the internal LiveUpdate server in plaintext within the Windows registry.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Storage of sensitive information (usernames and passwords) in cleartext.
- This information is stored in the registry at `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\INTEL\LANDesk\VirusProtect6\CurrentVersion\LiveUpdateSource`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Any user with access to the client machine can retrieve the cleartext username and password.
- This could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the internal LiveUpdate server, potentially leading to further compromise of the network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access to the affected machine is required.
- Attackers can use `regedit` or other registry editing tools to access the stored credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Must have local access to a machine where the Norton Antivirus Corporate Edition client with the vulnerable LiveUpdate version is installed.
- Must have the ability to run registry editing tools (like regedit).

**Additional Details:**
-  Symantec acknowledged the issue and stated that LiveUpdate 1.6 and later versions encrypt this username and password by default.
- The username and password in question are ONLY associated with the local network internal server and NOT used for authentication to access Symantec's LiveUpdate server.
- The issue stems from the way the internal server passes the credentials to the client.
- The provided "fix" in the content involves deleting the stored login and password from the registry to mitigate the issue.
- Symantec indicates the issue can be avoided if updates are pushed from a centralized server rather than having each client pull updates.
