## Common Desktop Environment (CDE) ToolTalk RPC database server (rpc.ttdbserverd) does not adequately validate file operations

#### Vulnerability Note VU#299816

Original Release Date: 2002-07-11 | Last Revised: 2002-08-15

---

### Overview

The Common Desktop Environment (CDE) ToolTalk RPC database server does not adequately validate file operations and follows symbolic links, allowing a local attacker to overwrite any file that is writeable by the server. The ToolTalk RPC database server typically runs with root privileges.

### Description

| CORE SECURITY TECHNOLOGIES has reported a vulnerability in the CDE ToolTalk RPC database server (rpc.ttdbserverd). A component of CDE, the ToolTalk architecture allows applications to communicate with each other via remote procedure calls (RPC) across different hosts and platforms. The ToolTalk RPC database server manages connections between ToolTalk applications. CDE and ToolTalk are installed and enabled by default on many common UNIX platforms.  Certain ToolTalk RPC database functions, among them \_TT\_TRANSACTION(), create and write to files that are referenced by user-supplied path and filename arguments. The ToolTalk RPC database server does not check that the file used in a create or write operation is not a symbolic link. By first creating a symbolic link, then issuing a specially crafted RPC call, a local attacker can overwrite the target of the symbolic link with arbitrary contents. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A local attacker could overwrite any file writeable by the ToolTalk RPC database server. This technique could be used to gain the privileges of the ToolTalk RPC database server, typically root. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply a Patch**When available, apply a patch from your vendor. |
| --- |

| **Disable rpc.ttdbserverd**Until patches are available and can be applied, you may wish to consider disabling the ToolTalk RPC database service. As a general best practice, the CERT/CC recommends disabling any services that are not explicitly required. The ToolTalk RPC database service may be enabled in /etc/rpc or in /etc/inetd.conf. On a Solaris 8 system, comment out the following entry in /etc/inetd.conf to disable the ToolTalk RPC database service (rpc.ttdbserverd):## Sun ToolTalk Database Server#100083/1        tli     rpc/tcp wait root /usr/dt/bin/rpc.ttdbserverd rpc.ttdbserverdThe rpcinfo(1M) and ps(1) commands may be useful in determining if you system is running the ToolTalk RPC database server. On a Solaris 8 system, the following examples indicate that the ToolTalk RPC database server is running:# rpcinfo -p | grep 100083    100083    1   tcp   32773# ps -ef | grep rpc.ttdbserverd    root   355   164  0  19:31:27 ?        0:00 rpc.ttdbserverd**Block or Restrict Access**Until patches are available and can be applied, block or restrict access to the RPC portmapper service and the ToolTalk RPC database service from untrusted networks such as the Internet. Using a firewall or other packet-filtering technology, block the ports used by the RPC portmapper and ToolTalk RPC services. The RPC portmapper service typically runs on ports 111/tcp and 111/udp. The ToolTalk RPC service may be configured to use port 692/tcp or another port as indicated in output from the rpcinfo command. Keep in mind that blocking ports at a network perimeter does not protect the vulnerable service from the internal network. It is important to understand your network configuration and service requirements before deciding what changes are appropriate. |

### [Compaq Computer Corporation](#AAMN-5BAVFQ) Affected

Notified:  June 11, 2002  Updated: September 09, 2002

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

SOURCE: Compaq Computer Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hewlett-Packard Company and Hewlett-Packard Company HP Services Software Security Response Team

CROSS REFERENCE: SSRT2251

At this time Compaq does have solutions in final testing and will publish HP Tru64 UNIX security bulletin (SSRT2251) with patch information as soon as testing has completed and kits are available from the support ftp web site.

A recommended workaround however is to disable rpc.ttdbserver until solutions are available. This should only create a potential problem for public software packages applications that use the RPC-based ToolTalk database server. This step should be evaluated against the risks identified, your security measures environment, and potential impact of other products that may use the ToolTalk database server.

To disable rpc.ttdbserverd:

+ Comment out the following line in /etc/inetd.conf:

rpc.ttdbserverd  stream tcp swait root /usr/dt/bin/rpc.ttdbserverd rpc.ttdbserverd

+ Force inetd to re-read the configuration file by executing the inetd -h command.

Note: The internet daemon should kill the currently running rpc.ttdbserver. If not, manually kill any existing rpc.ttdbserverd process.

### Vendor Information

The vendor has not provided us with any further information regarding this vulnerability.

### Addendum

Compaq (Hewlett-Packard) has released a security bulletin ([SRB0039W](http://wwss1pro.compaq.com/support/reference_library/viewdocument.asp?source=SRB0039W.xml&dt=11)/SSRT2251) that addresses VU#299816 and other vulnerabilities.

If you have feedback, comments, or additional information about this vulnerability, please send us email.

acted upon as soon as possible.  Hewlett-Packard Company will
not be liable for any consequences to any customer resulting
from customer's failure to fully implement instructions in this
Security Bulletin as soon as possible.

 ------------------------------------------------------------------
PROBLEM:  Buffer overflow in rpc.ttdbserver

PLATFORM: HP9000 Series 700/800 running HP-UX releases 10.10,
          10.20, 10.24, 11.00, 11.04, and 11.11.

DAMAGE:  Potential unauthorized access, increased privileges.

SOLUTION: Until patches are available, manually install a
          replacement rpc.ttdbserver.

MANUAL ACTIONS: Install replacement rpc.ttdbserver.

AVAILABILITY:  The replacement rpc.ttdbserver files are
                available now.

CHANGE SUMMARY: Added CA-2002-26 information

 ------------------------------------------------------------------
\*\*REVISED 02\*\*
 A. Background
-->>Buffer overflows in rpc.ttdbserver has been reported by CERT
-->>in CA-2002-20 and CA-2002-26.  The potential exists to exploit
-->>these overflows to gain unauthorized access.

 B. Recommended solution
    Until patches are available, install the appropriate file to
    replace rpc.ttdbserver.

     Note: The 10.20 file should be used for 10.24.
           The 11.00 file should be used for 11.04.

           On 10.24 and 11.04 (VVOS) rpc.ttdbserver is disabled
           by default.

\*\*REVISED 02\*\*
-->>  1. Download rpc.ttdbserver.2.tar.gz from the ftp site.
         This file is temporary and will be deleted when patches
         are available from the standard HP web sites, including
         itrc.hp.com.

        System:    hprc.external.hp.com  (192.170.19.51)

        Note: There is an ftp defect in IE5 that may result in
               a browser hang.  To work around this:
        - Select Tools -> Internet Options -> Advanced
        - Un-check the option: [ ] Enable folder view for FTP sites

\*\*REVISED 02\*\*
-->>  2. Copy the rpc.ttdbserver.2.tar.gz file to a protected
         directory and unpack it.
         If you wish to verify the md5 sum before unpacking the
         rpc.ttdbserver.tar.gz file, please refer to:

               HPSBUX9408-016
               Patch sums and the MD5 program

## History

The CERT Division is the birthplace of cybersecurity. For nearly 30 years, the CERT Division of the SEI has partnered with government, industry, law enforcement, and academia to advance cybersecurity and improve the security and resilience of computer systems and networks.

Originally focused on incident response, we have expanded into cybersecurity areas such as network situational awareness, malicious code analysis, secure coding, resilience management, insider threats, digital investigations and intelligence, workforce development, DevOps, forensics, software assurance, vulnerability discovery and analysis, and risk management.

## Former Director Richard Pethia

[Richard Pethia](/about/leadership/display.cfm?customel_datapageid_2623=3545) was founding director of the SEI's CERT Division. Pethia, who served as director of CERT from 1988 to 2016, guided the organization through tremendous growth and change. Under Pethia's leadership, the unit expanded and evolved from the CERT Coordination Center—a small group focused on computer incident response—to a research organization of more than 200 professionals dedicated to solving problems with widespread cybersecurity implications.
