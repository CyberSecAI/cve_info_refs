    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2002-0616",
      "root_cause": "A flaw in how Excel handles specially formatted inline macros that are attached to objects within a workbook. The Macro Security Model fails to correctly recognize it as a macro.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Bypassing of Macro Security Model.",
        "Improper handling of inline macros attached to objects within a workbook."

      "impact": "An attacker could execute arbitrary macro code on a user's system, potentially taking any action the user is capable of.",
       "attack_vector": "The user must open a specially crafted Excel workbook from an attacker and then click on an object within the workbook.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a malicious Excel workbook with an embedded inline macro and convince the user to open the file and click on an object within the workbook."

    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2002-0617",
        "root_cause": "A flaw in how Excel handles macros in a workbook when that workbook is opened through a hyperlink associated with a drawing shape in another workbook. The Macro Security Model does not detect the presence of macros in the target workbook.",
      "weaknesses": [
          "Bypassing of Macro Security Model.",
          "Improper handling of macros when a workbook is opened via a hyperlink on a drawing shape."

      "impact": "An attacker could execute arbitrary macro code when the user opens a malicious workbook through a hyperlink in another workbook.",
      "attack_vector": "The user must open a source workbook containing a hyperlinked drawing shape that points to a destination workbook with a malicious macro. The user must click on the shape to open the destination workbook.",
      "required_capabilities":"The attacker needs to create a source and a destination workbook. The source workbook contains a drawing shape with a hyperlink that points to a destination workbook. The destination workbook must have an autoexecute macro. Both workbooks must be made accessible to the victim, who must open the source workbook and click on the hyperlinked shape."

      "cve_id": "CVE-2002-0618",
        "root_cause": "A flaw in how XSL Stylesheets within Excel workbooks are handled under the Macros Security Model. The Macro Security Model fails to detect the presence of HTML scripting within an XSL stylesheet.",

          "Bypassing of Macro Security Model.",
          "Improper handling of HTML script in XSL stylesheets."

       "impact": "An attacker could execute HTML scripts as if they were run locally on the user's system, with the same level of permissions as the user.",
       "attack_vector": "The user must open an Excel workbook that contains a malicious XSL stylesheet and confirm the prompt to apply the stylesheet. Alternatively, if the workbook is configured to auto-refresh the query, the script will run after the refresh.",

        "cve_id": "CVE-2002-0619",
        "root_cause": "The original fix for the 'Word Mail Merge' vulnerability fails to correctly differentiate a remote Access data source when the Word Mail Merge document is an HTML document.",
        "weaknesses": [
            "Improper handling of remote data sources in mail merge documents.",
           "Failure to distinguish between local and remote data sources, causing them to be treated identically."
