- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A flaw exists in the security checks on casting operations within the Microsoft VM. This allows a specially crafted Java applet to perform an illegal cast operation, bypassing the sandbox and executing code outside of it.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Improper validation of type casting operations in the Microsoft VM.
    - Ability to escape the Java sandbox due to the flawed casting operations.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Arbitrary code execution in the context of the user.
    - Potential to add, change or delete data or configuration information.
    - Privilege escalation, as the attacker's code executes with the same privileges as the user.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Delivering a malicious Java applet through a website.
    - Luring the intended target to a website hosting the malicious applet.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Ability to craft a malicious Java applet at the binary level.
    - Ability to host the malicious applet on a website.
    - Need to entice the intended victim to visit the website hosting the malicious applet.
