      "cve": "CVE-2002-0404",
      "is_related": true,
      "content": "Four potential security issues have been discovered in Ethereal 0.9.3:\n\n* The SMB dissector could potentially dereference a NULL pointer in two cases.\n\n* The X11 dissector could potentially overflow a buffer while parsing keysyms.\n\n* The DNS dissector could go into an infinite loop while reading a malformed packet.\n\n* The GIOP dissector could potentially allocate large amounts of memory.\n\nIt may be possible to make Ethereal crash or hang by injecting a purposefully malformed packet onto the wire, or by convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file. It may be possible to make Ethereal run arbitrary code by exploiting the buffer and pointer problems.\n\nVersions prior to 0.9.3 are also subject to these bugs.",
      "root_cause": "Multiple vulnerabilities in different dissectors within Ethereal.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "NULL pointer dereference in SMB dissector",
