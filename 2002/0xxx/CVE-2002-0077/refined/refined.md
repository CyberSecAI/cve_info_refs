- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A flaw in how Internet Explorer (IE) applies security zones to objects invoked on an HTML page with the `codebase` property. Specifically, IE incorrectly considers these objects as part of the Local Computer zone, even if the page itself is in a different zone (e.g., the Internet zone).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper security zone handling for objects invoked via the `codebase` property within HTML pages. This allows local executables to be run without prompting the user.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could invoke an executable already present on the user's machine without the user's knowledge or consent. While the attacker cannot pass parameters to the invoked program, they could potentially execute a program like `logoff.exe` to shut down the user's system.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could create a specially crafted HTML web page that exploits the vulnerability. This page could then be hosted on a malicious website or sent to the user as an HTML email. If the user opens the page or email, the exploit would trigger.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious HTML page and either entice a user to visit a website hosting the page or send it to them via email. The attacker must know the name and location of a local executable on the victim's machine to invoke.
