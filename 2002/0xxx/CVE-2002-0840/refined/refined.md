{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists due to incorrect filtering of server signature data in the SSI error pages of Apache 2.0.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Lack of filtering on HTTP/1.1 \"Host\" headers",
      "Apache doesn't filter maliciously malformed headers containing HTML markup before passing them onto the browser as entity data."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can hijack web sessions, allowing a range of potential compromises on the targeted host. This could include privilege escalation and complete compromise of the web server or other sensitive systems.  Privacy risks are also severe as attackers can steal user's personal information.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack involves sending a crafted HTTP/1.1 \"Host\" header, which contains malicious HTML markup. This is often triggered by browsers decoding escaped hostnames in URL components before sending the request.",
   "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a URL with a malicious hostname that includes HTML markup. They do not need to be authenticated or have prior access."
  },
    "affected_versions": [
        "Apache 2.0 prior to 2.0.43",
         "Apache 1.3.26 and prior (when UseCanonicalName is disabled)"
    ],
    "solution": "Upgrade to Apache HTTP Server versions 1.3.27 or 2.0.43 or later.",
   "additional_notes": "The vulnerability is only exploitable when the `UseCanonicalName` directive is set to `Off` and wildcard DNS is enabled. This directive is set to `Off` by default in Apache 2.0 versions up to 2.0.33 but is `On` by default in 1.3, thus, version 1.3 requires a specific configuration."
