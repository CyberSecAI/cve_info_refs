This is being submitted without an update to Apache, but I am expecting an
Apache Update Announcement shortly.  The CVE has already assigned a
candidate
to this (it is currently reserved), and CERT has assigned VU#240329, but
has
not created a write-up yet.  The reason for the ugly mail2web .sig is
because
I'm posting from school.

Apache 2.0 Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability

Release Date:
October 2, 2002

Severity:
Medium (Session hijacking/possible compromise)

Systems Affected:
Apache 2.0 prior to 2.0.43

CVE: CAN-2002-0840

Description:
A vulnerability exists in the SSI error pages of Apache 2.0 that involves
incorrect filtering of server signature data. The vulnerability could
enable
an attacker to hijack web sessions, allowing a range of potential
compromises
on the targeted host.

This particular attack involves a lack of filtering on HTTP/1.1 "Host"
headers, sent by most recent browsers. The vulnerability occurs because
Apache doesn't filter maliciously malformed headers containing HTML markup
before passing them onto the browser as entity data.

The following URL will demonstrate the attack:

http://%3CIMG%20SRC%3D%22%22%20ONERROR%3D%22alert%28document%2Ecookie%29%22%
3
E.apachesite.org/raise_404

Some browsers submit the malicious host header when parsing this request:

Host: <img src="" onerror="alert(document.cookie)">

Apache returns this malicious host in the form of a server signature:

<ADDRESS>Apache/2.0.39 Server at <IMG SRC=""
ONERROR="alert(document.cookie)">.apachesite.org</ADDRESS>

Technical Description:
A few browsers (Internet Explorer for example), decode escaped hostnames in
URL components. With this decoding done, the browser then sends on the
malicious HTTP/1.1 "Host" header, and bounces the request back, completing
the attack. Mozilla could be exploited (as could several other additional
browsers) if JavaScript can be injected without spaces. However, I wasn't
able to come up with a lab scenario for this.

Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities are often assumed to be small, useless
exposures that aren't worth much attention. This is a false assumption --
depending on the applications installed, a successful privilege escalation
via XSS can result in complete compromise of a web server, or other
sensitive
systems. Further, the privacy risks from XSS holes are severe -- many users
will be far less inclined to visit a site that may accidentally cough up
their personal information to an attacker.

Vendor Status:
The Apache Software Foundation has released Apache 2.0.43 to eliminate this
vulnerability. It is available from <http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/>

## Apache HTTPD server vulnerable to cross site scripting on error page when using wildcard DNS

#### Vulnerability Note VU#240329

Original Release Date: 2002-10-03 | Last Revised: 2002-10-03

---

### Overview

Versions of the Apache HTTPD server with wildcard DNS enabled and UseCanonicalName disabled, are vulnerable to a cross-site scripting attack.

### Description

| Apache HTTPD servers versions 2.0.42 and prior, and 1.3.26 and prior, with wildcard DNS enabled and UseCanonicalName disabled, are vulnerable to a cross-site scripting attack via the error page. Only versions 2.0 to 2.0.33 have UseCanonicalName disabled by default. All other versions had UseCanonicalName enabled by default and are not vulnerable unless this option is disabled. |
| --- |

### Impact

| The victim will be presented with information which the compromised site did not wish their visitors to be subjected. This could be used to "sniff" sensitive data from within the web page, including passwords, credit card numbers, and any arbitrary information the user inputs. |
| --- |

### Solution

| This issue is resolved in [Apache HTTPD Server](http://httpd.apache.org) versions 1.3.27 and 2.0.43. |

________________________________________________________________________

Package:             apache
Vulnerability:       denial of service
OpenPKG Specific:    no

Affected  Releases:  OpenPKG 1.0             OpenPKG 1.1
Affected  Packages:  <= apache-1.3.22-1.0.4  <= apache-1.3.26-1.1.0
Corrected Packages:  >= apache-1.3.22-1.0.5  >= apache-1.3.26-1.1.1
Dependent Packages:  none                    none

Description:
  According to the Apache HTTP Server Project [1][[2]](#2), there are
  several remotely exploitable vulnerabilities which could allow an
  attacker to enact a denial of service against a server. The Common
  Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project identified the following
  three vulnerabilities:

  1. CAN-2002-0839 [[3]](#3): A vulnerability exists on platforms using System
  V shared memory based scoreboards. This vulnerability allows an
  attacker who can execute under the Apache UID to exploit the Apache
  shared memory scoreboard format and send a signal to any process as
  root or cause a local denial of service attack.

  2. CAN-2002-0840 [[4]](#4): Apache is susceptible to a cross site scripting
  vulnerability in the default 404 page of any web server hosted on a
  domain that allows wildcard DNS lookups.

  3. CAN-2002-0843 [[5]](#5): There were some possible overflows in the
  utility ApacheBench (ab) which could be exploited by a malicious
  server.

  Please check whether you are affected by running "<prefix>/bin/rpm -q
  apache". If you have an affected version of the "apache" package (see
  above), upgrade it according to the solution below. Remember to also
  rebuild and reinstall any dependent OpenPKG packages. [[6]](#6)

Solution:
  Select the updated source RPM appropriate for your OpenPKG release
  [7][[9]](#9), fetch it from the OpenPKG FTP service [8][[10]](#10) or a mirror
  location, verify its integrity [[11]](#11), build a corresponding binary RPM
  from it and update your OpenPKG installation by finally installing
  the binary RPM [[6]](#6). For the latest OpenPKG 1.1 release, perform the
  following operations to permanently fix the security problem (for
  other releases adjust accordingly).

  $ ftp ftp.openpkg.org
  ftp> bin
  ftp> cd release/1.1/UPD
  ftp> get apache-1.3.26-1.1.1.src.rpm
  ftp> bye
  $ <prefix>/bin/rpm --checksig apache-1.3.26-1.1.1.src.rpm
  $ <prefix>/bin/rpm --rebuild apache-1.3.26-1.1.1.src.rpm
  $ su -
  # <prefix>/bin/rpm -Fvh <prefix>/RPM/PKG/apache-1.3.26-1.1.1.*.rpm
  # <prefix>/etc/rc apache stop start

This issue does not affect Apache 2.0.   [CAN-2002-0839](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2002-0839)  In order to exploit this vulnerability a remote attacker would have to   use some other vulnerability to be able to run arbitrary commands   as the uid of the Apache server. Access to the uid of the Apache   server is also available to anyone who has the   authority   to create scripts that can be run by the server (such as PHP or CGI).  This issue was reported to the ASF by zen-parse through iDefense * A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in the default   error page. The issue could only be exploited if the directive   `UseCanonicalName` is set to `Off`   and a server is being run at a domain that uses wildcard DNS.   The default setting has been `Off` in 2.0 since 2   .0.33; 1.3 has   always had it `On`, so is not vulnerable by default, but is   vulnerable if you set `UseCanonicalName` to   `Off`. This issue   affects Apache 2.0 all versions including 2.0.42 and   1.3 all versions up to and including 1.3.26.   [CAN-2002-0840](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2002-0840)  Wildcard   DNS allows a server administrator to set up a host to respond to any   particular hostname in the domain. For example with a DNS entry of   `*.apacheweek.com` any domain that is looked up in the   apacheweek.com domain would resolve. Wildcard DNS is not particularly   common so this vulnerability will not affect many sites.  This issue was reported to the ASF by Matthew Murphy * Buffer overflows in the ApacheBench utility, ab, used for benchmarking   sites can be exploited if it is run against a malicious server.   [CAN-2002-0843](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2002-0843)  As a work-around, administrators could simply   remove the ApacheBench utility or not   run it against untrusted servers.  This issue was reported to the ASF by David Wagner * In Apache 2.0.42, for a location where both WebDAV and CGI were   enabled, a `POST` request to a CGI script would reveal the   CGI source to a remote user. This issue does not affect any versions   of Apache 2.0 other than 2.0.42, and does not affect Apache 1.3   servers running `mod_dav` 1.0.   [CAN-2002-1156](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2002-1156)   These issues have all been fixed in Apache 1.3.27 and Apache 2.0.43 which are now available.   ---  Apache 1.3.27 Released Apache 1.3.27 was released on 3rd October 2002 and is now the latest version of the Apache 1.3 server. The previous release was 1.3.26, released on the 18th June 2002. [See what was new in Apache 1.3.26](http://www.apacheweek.com/issues/02-06-21#apache1325).  Apache 1.3.27 is available in source form for compiling on Unix or Windows, for download from the [main Apache site](http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/) or from any [mirror download site](http://www.apache.org/mirrors/).  This is a security, bug fix and minor upgrade release. Due to security issues, any sites using versions prior to Apache 1.3.27 should upgrade to Apache 1.3.27. [Read more about the other security issues that affect Apache 1.3](http://www.apacheweek.com/features/security-13).   Security issues  * Fix the security vulnerability   regarding ownership permissions of System V shared memory based   scoreboards. The fix resulted in the new   `ShmemUIDisUser` directive.   [CAN-2002-0839](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2002-0839) * Fix the security vulnerability   regarding a cross-site scripting vulnerability in the default error   page when using wildcard DNS.   [CAN-2002-0840](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2002-0840) * Fix the security vulnerability   regarding some possible overflows in ab.c which could be exploited by   a malicious server.   [CAN-2002-0843](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2002-0843)   New features The main new features in 1.3.27 (compared to 1.3.26) are:   * A new directive, `ErrorHeader` has been added.   This allows headers (such as cookies)   to be specified that will accompany any   error pages or redirects * Configuration file globbing can now use simple pattern   matching which can stop backup and other files getting   included [BZ#12712](http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=12712) * `Include` directives may now have wildcards   in the final part of the path. * A new directive, `ProtocolReqCheck` has been   added which determines if Apache will   check for a valid protocol string in the request (such as    `HTTP/1.1`)   and return `HTTP_BAD_REQUEST` if not valid.   Versions of Apache   prior to 1.3.26 would silently ignore bad protocol strings, but   1.3.26 included a more strict check. This   directive makes it runtime   configurable. * Added support for Berkeley-DB/4.x to `mod_auth_db`. * Support Caldera OpenUNIX 8.   Bugs fixed The following bugs were found in Apache 1.3.26 and have been fixed in Apache 1.3.27:   * Some fixes to `mod_proxy`.   The cache was incorrectly updating the `Content-Length`   from 304 responses when doing validation.   Also fix a problem where headers from other modules were   added to the response headers when this was done in the   core already. * In 1.3.26, a null or all-blank `Content-Length`   triggers an error although previous versions would silently ignore   it and assume 0 length. 1.3.27 restores this previous behaviour. * Fix a one byte null overflow in ap\_get\_win32\_interpreter used   on Win32 platforms   triggered when the initial `#!` line in a CGI script did not   contain a \r or \n character in the first 1023 bytes.  ---  Apache 2.0.43 Released Apache 2.0.43 was released on 3rd October 2002 and is now the latest version of the Apache 2.0 server. The previous release was 2.0.42, released on the 24th September 2002. [See what was new in Apache 2.0.42](http://www.apacheweek.com/issues/02-06-21#apache2042).  Apache 2.0.43 is available in source form for compiling on Unix or Windows, for download from the [main Apache site](http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/) or from any [mirror download site](http://www.apache.org/mirrors/).  This is a security, bug fix and minor upgrade release. Due to security issues, any sites using versions prior to Apache 2.0.43 should upgrade to Apache 2.0.43. [Read more about the other security issues that affect Apache 2.0](http://www.apacheweek.com/features/security-20).   Security issues  * Fix the security vulnerability regarding a cross-site scripting   vulnerability in the default error page when using wildcard DNS.   [CAN-2002-0840](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2002-0840) * Fix the exposure of CGI source when a POST request is sent to   a location where both DAV and CGI are enabled.   [CAN-2002-1156](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2002-1156) * Fix the security vulnerability regarding some possible   overflows in ab.c which could be exploited by a malicious server.   [CAN-2002-0843](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2002-0843)   Bugs fixed The following bugs were found in Apache 2.0.42 and have been fixed in Apache 2.0.43:   * The `UserDir` directive has been fixed   to again take a list of user names to enable userdir access for,   as per 1.3. * Flushing behaviour has been improved, to ensure that available   response output is flushed when no new output is pending; helping   streaming CGIs and other dynamically-generated content * `mod_auth_ldap` has been fixed to retry   connections to the LDAP server if it becomes unavailable. * Fix for a locking problem in `mod_ssl`'s session   cache code which could cause infinite loops on some platforms * Fixes for `mod_cache` to prevent a segfault   when attempting to cache some combinations of content (for instance,   when using SSI tags which execute CGI scripts), and to correct   the `CacheMaxStreamingBuffer` directive   for virtual hosts * The default server root directory in `suexec` has   been fixed to match the default install root * `mod_proxy` was fixed to not strip   `WWW-Authenticate` headers on 4xx error responses which   prevented server authentication to be performed via the proxy   New features  * A new module, `mod_logio`, has been added which   allows logging of the number of bytes sent and received by the server. * A `-p` option has been added to `apxs`   to allow programs to be be compiled using this tool.  ---  In the news  ApacheCon early-bird extended If you are reading this issue on Friday the 4th October 2002 then you may still have a few hours to get the US$200 discount on [registration for ApacheCon](http://www.apachecon.com/). ApacheCon is being held in Las Vegas, USA from the 19th-21th November 2002, with an optional day of tutorials available on November 18th. The conference is being held at the same time as Comdex in Las Vegas, and all ApacheCon delegates also get a free pass to the Comdex Exhibit hall.  Apache Week will be on hand as always to report on the event. Find out more at the [conference web site](http://www.apachecon.com/), or read our account of [ApacheCon 2001 Santa Clara](http://www.apacheweek.com/features/apachecon2001).   Covalent founder breaks bond to form new Apache startup An article this week in ZDNet News, [Apache chief scouts a new direction](http://zdnet.com.com/2100-1104-960566.html), follows the resignation of  [Randy Terbush](http://httpd.apache.org/contributors/#terbush) from Covalent. Randy has started up a new company focusing on Apache services rather than products. He is joined by another former Covalent employee and ASF director [Dirk-Willem van Gulik](http://httpd.apache.org/contributors/#vangulik). Covalent received a lot of press attention back at the 2000 ApacheCon when they announced they were assembling a [dream team](http://linuxpr.com/releases/1410.html) of Apache developers. However with the [reported recent departure](http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=apache-cvs&m=102947008010433&q=raw)of lead Apache 2.0 contributor  [Ryan Bloom](http://httpd.apache.org/contributors/#bloom), only one of the original five remains. Even so, Covalent report having "their best quarters ever ... with double-digit growth". | | --- | | ---   This issue brought to you by: Mark J Cox, Joe Orton | |  |

                            Apache 1.3.27 Released

   The Apache Software Foundation and The Apache Server Project are
   pleased to announce the release of version 1.3.27 of the Apache HTTP
   Server.  This Announcement notes the significant changes in 1.3.27
   as compared to 1.3.26.

   This version of Apache is principally a security and bug fix release.
   A summary of the bug fixes is given at the end of this document.
   Of particular note is that 1.3.27 addresses and fixes 3 security
   vulnerabilities.

   CAN-2002-0839 (cve.mitre.org)[[1]](#1): A vulnerability exists in all versions
   of Apache prior to 1.3.27 on platforms using System V shared memory based
   scoreboards.  This vulnerability allows an attacker who can execute under
   the Apache UID to exploit the Apache shared memory scoreboard format and
   send a signal to any process as root or cause a local denial of service
   attack.  We thank iDefense for their responsible notification and
   disclosure of this issue.

   CAN-2002-0840 (cve.mitre.org)[[2]](#2): Apache is susceptible to a cross site
   scripting vulnerability in the default 404 page of any web server hosted
   on a domain that allows wildcard DNS lookups.  We thank Matthew Murphy
   for notification of this issue.

   CAN-2002-0843 (cve.mitre.org)[[3]](#3): There were some possible overflows
   in ab.c which could be exploited by a malicious server. Note that this
   vulnerability is not in Apache itself, but rather one of the support
   programs bundled with Apache. We thank David Wagner for the responsible
   notification and disclosure of this issue.

   We consider Apache 1.3.27 to be the best version of Apache 1.3 available
   and we strongly recommend that users of older versions, especially of
   the 1.1.x and 1.2.x family, upgrade as soon as possible.  No further
   releases will be made in the 1.2.x family.

   Apache 1.3.27 is available for download from

       <http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/>

   Please see the CHANGES_1.3 file in the same directory for a full list
   of changes.

   Binary distributions are available from

       <http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/binaries/>

   The source and binary distributions are also available via any of the
   mirrors listed at

       <http://www.apache.org/mirrors/>

   As of Apache 1.3.12 binary distributions contain all standard Apache
   modules as shared objects (if supported by the platform) and include
   full source code.  Installation is easily done by executing the
   included install script.  See the README.bindist and INSTALL.bindist
   files for a complete explanation.  Please note that the binary
   distributions are only provided for your convenience and current
   distributions for specific platforms are not always available. Win32
   binary distributions are based on the Microsoft Installer (.MSI)
   technology.  While development continues to make this installation method
   more robust, questions should be directed to the
   news:comp.infosystems.www.servers.ms-windows newsgroup.

   For an overview of new features introduced after 1.2 please see

   <http://httpd.apache.org/docs/new_features_1_3.html>

   In general, Apache 1.3 offers several substantial improvements over
   version 1.2, including better performance, reliability and a wider
   range of supported platforms, including Windows NT and 2000 (which
   fall under the "Win32" label), OS2, Netware, and TPE threaded
   platforms.

   IMPORTANT NOTE FOR APACHE USERS:   Apache 1.3 was designed for Unix OS
   variants.  While  the ports to non-Unix platforms (such as Win32, Netware
   or OS2) are of an acceptable quality, Apache 1.3 is not optimized for
   these platforms.  Security, stability, or performance issues on these
   non-Unix ports do not generally apply to the Unix version, due to
   software's Unix origin.

   Apache 2.0 has been structured for multiple operating systems from its
   inception, by introducing the Apache Portability Library and MPM modules.
   Users on non-Unix platforms are strongly encouraged to move up to
   Apache 2.0 for better performance, stability and security on their
   platforms.

   Apache is the most popular web server in the known universe; over half
   of the servers on the Internet are running Apache or one of its
   variants.

                     Apache 1.3.27 Major changes

  Security vulnerabilities

     * Fix the security vulnerability noted in CAN-2002-0839 (cve.mitre.org)
       regarding ownership permissions of System V shared memory based
       scoreboards.  The fix resulted in the new ShmemUIDisUser directive.

     * Fix the security vulnerability noted in CAN-2002-0840 (cvs.mitre.org)
       regarding a cross-site scripting vulnerability in the default error
       page when using wildcard DNS.

     * Fix the security vulnerability noted in CAN-2002-0843 (cve.mitre.org)
       regarding some possible overflows in ab.c which could be exploited by
       a malicious server.

  New features

   The main new features in 1.3.27 (compared to 1.3.26) are:

     * The new ErrorHeader directive has been added.

     * Configuration file globbing can now use simple pattern
       matching.

     * The protocol version (eg: HTTP/1.1) in the request line parsing
       is now case insensitive.

     * ap_snprintf() can now distinguish between an output which was
       truncated, and an output which exactly filled the buffer.

     * Add ProtocolReqCheck directive, which determines if Apache will
       check for a valid protocol string in the request (eg: HTTP/1.1)
       and return HTTP_BAD_REQUEST if not valid. Versions of Apache
       prior to 1.3.26 would silently ignore bad protocol strings, but
       1.3.26 included a more strict check. This makes it runtime
       configurable.

     * Added support for Berkeley-DB/4.x to mod_auth_db.

     * httpd -V will now also print out the compile time defined
       HARD_SERVER_LIMIT value.

   New features that relate to specific platforms:

     * Support Caldera OpenUNIX 8.

     * Use SysV semaphores by default on OpenBSD.

     * Implemented file locking in mod_rewrite for the NetWare
       CLib platform.

  Bugs fixed

   The following bugs were found in Apache 1.3.26 (or earlier) and have
   been fixed in Apache 1.3.27:

     * mod_proxy fixes:
        - The cache in mod_proxy was incorrectly updating the Content-Length
          value from 304 responses when doing validation.
        - Fix a problem in proxy where headers from other modules were
          added to the response headers when this was already done in the
          core already.

     * In 1.3.26, a null or all blank Content-Length field would be
       triggered as an error; previous versions would silently ignore
       this and assume 0.  1.3.27 restores this previous behavior.

     * Win32: Fix one byte buffer overflow in ap_get_win32_interpreter
       when a CGI script's #! line does not contain a \r or \n (i.e.
       a line feed character) in the first 1023 bytes. The overflow
       is always a '\0' (string termination) character.

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.
