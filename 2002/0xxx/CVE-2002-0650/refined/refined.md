Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2002-0650:

**CVE-2002-0650** relates to a denial-of-service vulnerability in the Microsoft SQL Server 2000 Resolution Service, as indicated by the Microsoft Security Bulletin MS02-039.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the SQL Server 2000 keep-alive mechanism, which operates through the Resolution Service on UDP port 1434. The server responds to a crafted "keep-alive" packet with an identical packet.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- A malformed "keep-alive" packet can be crafted such that the server's response is identical to the request.
- The SQL Server does not properly validate the source and destination of these "keep-alive" packets.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can cause a denial of service condition by creating a loop where two SQL Servers continuously send "keep-alive" packets to each other. This consumes significant resources (CPU and network bandwidth) on both systems, slowing their performance considerably.
- The vulnerability does not allow the attacker to gain privileges or execute code.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack occurs over UDP port 1434.
- The attacker sends a crafted "keep-alive" packet to the SQL Server.
- The attacker spoofs the source address of the packet to initiate the loop between two servers.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send UDP packets to the SQL Server's UDP port 1434.
- The attacker needs to be able to spoof the source IP address of UDP packets.
- No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Microsoft SQL Server 2000 and Microsoft Desktop Engine (MSDE) 2000.
*   The issue is described as a "Network Based Denial of Service" and is reminiscent of the echo and chargen DoS attacks.
*   The vulnerability can be mitigated by restarting the SQL Server service, though this only breaks the attack, not preventing it from restarting.
*   Firewall rules blocking UDP port 1434 can also help mitigate the issue by preventing external access.
*  The vulnerability is separate from the buffer overflow vulnerabilities also present in the same service (CVE-CAN-2002-0649), and the advisory recommends patching for both, even though one can be exploited for remote code execution and the other only for DoS.
*   The patch for this vulnerability eliminates the problematic keep-alive mechanism and uses a different approach for determining active and passive servers, no longer responding to these types of packets.
