- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Sending arbitrary data to the port KICQ is listening on causes the application to crash.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of proper input validation and handling of unexpected data on the listening port.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote crash of the KICQ application.
- **Attack vectors:** Attacker sends arbitrary data via network connection to the port the KICQ application is listening on (default is 1030).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attacker needs network connectivity to the target machine running KICQ, and be able to send data to the port KICQ is listening on.
