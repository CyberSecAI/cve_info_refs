- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A buffer overflow exists in the `CopyOneBull` function of QPopper. Specifically, the `bullName` buffer, which is 256 bytes long, is populated using `sprintf` with a path constructed from the `bulldir` configuration. The user-configurable `bulldir` variable can be set to a value exceeding the `bullName` buffer's size.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A classic stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability is present. The `sprintf` function is used to copy the `bulldir` into `bullName` without proper bounds checking.
- **Impact of exploitation:** By crafting a long `bulldir` value in the `~/.qpopper-options` file, an attacker can overflow the `bullName` buffer, potentially overwriting return addresses and allowing for arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the QPopper process.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by a specially crafted `bulldir` variable within the `~/.qpopper-options` configuration file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to create or modify the `~/.qpopper-options` file for the user that runs the QPopper process. This usually requires local access or access via another vulnerability.
