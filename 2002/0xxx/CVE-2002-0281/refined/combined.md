Summary
-------
DCP-Portal is a content management system with
advanced features like
web-based update, link, file, member management,
poll, calendar, etc.
Its main features include an admin panel to manage
the entire site, a
smart HTML editor to add news, content, and
annoucements, the ability
for members to submit news/content and write
reviews, and much more.
It's an open-source project, which is also supported
by FreshMeat.

A Cross Site Scripting vulnerability exists in Dcp-
Portal.
This would allow a remote attacker to send
information to victims
from untrusted web servers, and make it look as if
the information
came from the legitimate server.

Details
-------
The attacker will first register, with probably an
alphabetically
first-coming username (eg: aaaaa). After registering,
activating and
logging in with the the account, he/she would request
the Change Details
form "<http://www.dcp-portal_host/user_update.php>".
There, he/she may change the job info, inserting
arbitrary codes.
Example:
&lt;script&gt;alert("ALPERz was here!")&lt;/script&gt;
After applying this information, whenever any logged
in member, requests
the members page, this CSS vulnerability will take
effect.

This CSS vulnerability, might also be exploitable,
when a user first registers.

Solution
--------
Suggested Solution:
Strip HTML tags, and possibly other malicious code
within user_update.php
Vendor did not care to reply or was unreachable.
