- **Root cause of vulnerability**: RealPlayer trusts the length of strings indicated in the Real Media file header without validating if the provided length is within the allocated buffer size.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer overflow in RealPlayer when processing strings in Real Media file headers. The vulnerability exists because RealPlayer does not validate the length of the strings against allocated buffer sizes.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can cause RealPlayer to crash, and potentially execute arbitrary code on a victim's machine.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a malicious Real Media file with manipulated string lengths in the header. The user must open the malformed file with RealPlayer
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious Real Media file. The attacker also needs to get the user to open the crafted file with a vulnerable version of RealPlayer.
