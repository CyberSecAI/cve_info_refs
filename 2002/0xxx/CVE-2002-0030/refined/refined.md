The provided content is related to CVE-2002-0030.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a weak digital signature mechanism used by Adobe Acrobat and Adobe Acrobat Reader to verify the authenticity of plug-ins. The mechanism only checks the Portable Executable (PE) header of the plug-in file (dynamic library), which is insufficient for proper verification.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cryptographically weak digital signature verification for plug-ins.
- Failure to properly validate the integrity of plug-ins using robust cryptographic methods.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unsigned plug-ins can be made to appear certified by Adobe, allowing them to be loaded even when the "Certified Plug-ins Only" setting is enabled.
- Execution of malicious code via forged plug-ins.
- Circumvention of security mechanisms designed to restrict the execution of unverified plug-ins.
- Potential execution of malicious code in a trusted environment, leading to arbitrary code execution and other malicious activities.
- Untrusted PDF documents could be opened in an untrustworthy user environment.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker needs to create a malicious plug-in with a forged digital signature.
- The attacker then needs to induce the user to manually install the malicious plug-in in the Acrobat viewerâ€™s plug-ins directory.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to create a malicious plug-in and modify its PE header to mimic a legitimate signature.
- Ability to trick a user into installing the malicious plug-in.
- The attacker needs to have local access to the system in order to place the malicious plug-in in the designated directory.
