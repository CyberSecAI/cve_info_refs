- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A flaw in the Network Product Identification (PID) Checker of Microsoft Office v. X for Mac. The checker does not properly handle a specific type of malformed network announcement, causing the checker to fail and consequently, the application to crash.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability lies in the improper handling of malformed network packets by the Network PID Checker within Microsoft Office v. X.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in a denial-of-service condition. The first instance of Office v. X launched in a session will crash, leading to the loss of any unsaved data. However, the overall system and other applications are not affected.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted, malformed network packet to a victim's machine. This can be done either by directly targeting a specific IP address or by sending the packet to a broadcast or multicast address, affecting all machines on a subnet.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft and send network packets, either directly to a target's IP address or to a broadcast/multicast address of the network they want to attack. For a directed attack, the attacker needs to know the IP address of the target machine, while for a broadcast/multicast attack, knowledge of the target network's broadcast or multicast address is needed. The attacker would also need to be on the same network segment for broadcast/multicast attacks, as these types of packets are typically not routed.
