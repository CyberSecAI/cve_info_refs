- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper handling of AppleScripts within a specific HTML element in Internet Explorer for Macintosh.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Incorrect handling of AppleScripts within a specific HTML element.
    - Failure to recognize that a script resource on the local system is being called, leading to bypassing security checks governing execution of local programs.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could invoke an AppleScript already present on the user's machine. The script would execute as if the user had chosen to run it, potentially leading to actions like system shutdown, sleep, or other automated tasks.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker would craft a web page that calls an AppleScript with the specific HTML element and post it on a website, then entice the user to view the page in Internet Explorer for Macintosh.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to know the full path and filename of an AppleScript already present on the user's local system.
