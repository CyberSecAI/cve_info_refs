## Oracle 9iAS allows anonymous remote users to view sensitive Apache services by default

#### Vulnerability Note VU#168795

Original Release Date: 2002-03-12 | Last Revised: 2003-04-09

---

### Overview

Oracle Application Server 9iAS allows remote users to access several Apache services without authentication.

### Description

| Oracle Application Server 9iAS includes the Apache Web server and several Apache services. In the default install configuration, many of these services, including Dynamic Monitoring Services, can be accessed remotely by anonymous users. |
| --- |

### Impact

| Dynamic Monitoring Services may be used without authentication by attackers to monitor the internal workings of the Oracle server. |
| --- |

### Solution

| The CERT/CC is currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem. |
| --- |

| The following workaround was suggested by David Litchfield and has not been tested by CERT/CC.  Edit the "httpd.conf" file to limit access to the following pages:  http://oracleserver/dms0http://oracleserver/dms/DMSDumphttp://oracleserver/servlet/DMSDumphttp://oracleserver/servlet/Spyhttp://oracleserver/soap/servlet/Spyhttp://oracleserver/dms/AggreSpyhttp://oracleserver/oprocmgr-statushttp://oracleserver/oprocmgr-service |

## History

The CERT Division is the birthplace of cybersecurity. For nearly 30 years, the CERT Division of the SEI has partnered with government, industry, law enforcement, and academia to advance cybersecurity and improve the security and resilience of computer systems and networks.

Originally focused on incident response, we have expanded into cybersecurity areas such as network situational awareness, malicious code analysis, secure coding, resilience management, insider threats, digital investigations and intelligence, workforce development, DevOps, forensics, software assurance, vulnerability discovery and analysis, and risk management.

## Former Director Richard Pethia

[Richard Pethia](/about/leadership/display.cfm?customel_datapageid_2623=3545) was founding director of the SEI's CERT Division. Pethia, who served as director of CERT from 1988 to 2016, guided the organization through tremendous growth and change. Under Pethia's leadership, the unit expanded and evolved from the CERT Coordination Center—a small group focused on computer incident response—to a research organization of more than 200 professionals dedicated to solving problems with widespread cybersecurity implications.

Howdy,
I've written a white-paper, "Hackproofing Oracle Application Server." It
covers vulnerable areas and what must done to secure the box. Anyone
interested may get a copy from <http://www.nextgenss.com/papers/hpoas.pdf> .
