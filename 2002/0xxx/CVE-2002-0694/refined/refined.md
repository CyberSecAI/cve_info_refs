{
  "CVE-2002-0694": {
    "Root cause": "Flaws in the handling of compiled HTML Help (.chm) files, specifically related to shortcuts within these files.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "The HTML Help facility incorrectly determines the Security Zone when a .chm file is delivered via a web page or HTML mail and opened from the Temporary Internet Files folder. It handles the file in the Local Computer Zone instead of the zone associated with the delivery source.",
      "The HTML Help facility does not check the folder location of .chm files when determining whether to allow shortcuts. It should prevent shortcuts from executing when a file is located in untrusted locations like the Temporary Internet Files folder."
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user by exploiting the flawed handling of .chm files and shortcuts. This could enable the attacker to take actions such as adding, deleting, or changing data, running programs, and other potentially destructive operations.",
     "Attack vectors": [
        "Delivery of a malicious .chm file containing a shortcut via an HTML email.",
       "Exploitation of a separate vulnerability that would allow opening the file from the Temporary Internet Files folder."
      ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": [
     "Ability to craft a malicious .chm file containing a shortcut.",
      "Ability to send the malicious .chm file via email, or alternatively, have the file downloaded to the Temporary Internet Files folder." ,
      "Ability to exploit a separate vulnerability to open the file. (Note: the document states this is by design not possible, but acknowledges this could be a vulnerability to be addressed, separate to this issue)"
    ],
