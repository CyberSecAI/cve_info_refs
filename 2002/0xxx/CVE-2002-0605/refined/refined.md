Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper bounds checking in the handling of the "movie" parameter within the Macromedia Flash ActiveX control (Flash.ocx).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Buffer Overflow:**  The primary issue is a buffer overflow in the Flash ActiveX control. Specifically, the "movie" parameter can be supplied with an overly long string causing a write past buffer boundaries.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The ActiveX control doesn't properly validate the size of the input provided via the "movie" parameter, making it susceptible to buffer overflows.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successfully exploiting this vulnerability allows an attacker to overwrite the EIP (Extended Instruction Pointer), giving them the ability to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Web-based Attacks:**  Attackers can embed malicious Flash objects within HTML pages, and when a user views these pages in Internet Explorer, the vulnerable ActiveX control is activated and the overflow can occur.
*   **Email-based Attacks:** Emails containing crafted HTML content can trigger the vulnerability if the email client uses Internet Explorer's rendering engine.
*   **Other Avenues:** Any application that uses Internet Explorer's ActiveX control for rendering HTML content is potentially vulnerable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to Provide Malicious HTML:** The attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted HTML page containing a Flash object with a malicious "movie" parameter value. This could be done by hosting a website, sending an email, etc.
*  **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker would need to know that the Flash ActiveX control is vulnerable to the buffer overflow in the way described, and how to craft the specific input required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerable Flash ActiveX control was signed by Macromedia. This is significant because it means users are more likely to trust and execute the control.
*   The advisory highlights the risk of using legacy ActiveX objects that may contain vulnerabilities, and the dangers of relying solely on Microsoft's ActiveX store for security.
*   The vendor (Macromedia) had already released a patch at the time of this vulnerability disclosure and made it available on their website.
