Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2002-0075:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a cross-site scripting (CSS) issue within Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) when handling redirect response messages. Specifically, when IIS issues a redirect, it includes unsanitized data derived from the URL in the resulting error message.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-site scripting (XSS):** The core weakness is the failure to sanitize user-supplied input (specifically, the URL) before including it in the redirect response message. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code into the response.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can craft a malicious URL that, when processed by IIS and redirected, includes attacker-controlled script. This script executes in the victim's browser within the security context of the targeted website (the one running IIS).
*   **Data Access:** The attacker's script could access cookies and other data associated with the victim's session with the targeted website, potentially leading to unauthorized information disclosure.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Link:** The primary attack vector involves an attacker tricking a user into clicking a specially crafted link. This link contains malicious script within the URL.
*   **HTML Email/Newsgroup Messages:** Attackers could embed malicious links within HTML emails or newsgroup messages, which, when clicked, would trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to create malicious link:** The attacker needs to be able to create a URL that will be processed by a vulnerable IIS server and trigger the redirect response.
*   **User Interaction:**  The attacker needs to convince the victim to click the malicious link or view a page containing it.
*   **Understanding of IIS Redirects**: The attacker needs to understand how IIS processes redirects to construct the malicious link correctly.
*   **No special network position**: The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the victim or the server.

**Additional Notes:**

*   **Internet Explorer Mitigation:**  Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) is not vulnerable because it recognizes the redirect response and displays its own message, rather than rendering the server's HTML. This means only users of other browsers are vulnerable through this particular attack vector.
*   **Vendor Patch:** Microsoft released a patch to address this and other related vulnerabilities. Web site managers using IIS are advised to apply the update (MS02-018) to address this vulnerability.
*   **Cumulative Patch:** The patch released by Microsoft is cumulative, addressing multiple vulnerabilities.
