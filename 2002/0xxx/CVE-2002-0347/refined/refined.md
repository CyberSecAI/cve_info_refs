The provided content describes three vulnerabilities in Cobalt RAQ 4 Server Management: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Directory Traversal, and Denial of Service (DoS).

**a) Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

*   **Root Cause:** The `service.cgi` and `alert.cgi` files incorrectly handle incoming search parameters, HTML tags, and JavaScript. They are included in the result without proper sanitization.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of input validation and output encoding in CGI scripts.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can inject malicious code into web pages, potentially leading to cookie theft, redirection, or other malicious actions performed in the context of the victim's browser.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Crafting malicious URLs with injected JavaScript or HTML code within the `service` parameter of the `service.cgi` and `alert.cgi` scripts.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.

**b) Directory Traversal**

*   **Root Cause:** Vulnerability in file configuration handling.
*   **Weaknesses:** The server does not properly restrict access to files and directories.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can access sensitive files such as `.htaccess` which contains user credentials.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Crafting URLs with directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) to access files outside the intended web root.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.

**c) Denial of Service (DoS)**

*  **Root Cause**: The server crashes when it receives a very long URL.
*  **Weaknesses**: The server is not able to handle an excessively long input to the `service` parameter of `service.cgi` script.
*   **Impact:** The server crashes, requiring a restart of the service, thus causing a denial of service.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Sending a long URL string in the `service` parameter of the `service.cgi` script. The provided perl exploit uses a string of 100,000 'A' characters.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
