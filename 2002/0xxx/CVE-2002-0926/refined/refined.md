- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A directory traversal vulnerability in webMathematica allows an attacker to access arbitrary files on the system.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Directory traversal.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can view arbitrary files, which could lead to further system compromise due to exposure of sensitive data like password files.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a specially crafted request to a web server running webMathematica.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to know or guess the absolute path of the file they want to access.
