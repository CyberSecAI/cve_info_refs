Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2002-0560:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insecure default configurations and exposed procedures within the `OWA_UTIL` PL/SQL package in Oracle9i Application Server (iAS), Oracle9i Database and Oracle8i Database. This package provides web access to stored procedures, and certain procedures can be exploited.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The `OWA_UTIL.signature` procedure discloses version information about the PL/SQL module. The `OWA_UTIL.showsource` procedure returns the source code of specified PL/SQL applications. The `OWA_UTIL.show_query_columns` returns column names of a database table.
*   **SQL Injection:** The `OWA_UTIL.cellsprint` procedure allows an attacker to run arbitrary SQL queries, potentially including those that access the `sys.link$` table, which could provide credentials and access to other database servers. The `OWA_UTIL.listprint` procedure also allows an attacker to run arbitrary SQL queries but only returns specified columns.
*   **Lack of Access Control:** By default, some `OWA_UTIL` procedures are accessible anonymously via the web, which compounds the risk.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Exposure:** Attackers can obtain sensitive version information and source code of PL/SQL applications.
*   **Lateral Movement:** Attackers can use obtained database credentials to gain access to other database servers.
*   **Data Manipulation/Extraction:** Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries to potentially extract, modify, or delete data from the database, or pivot to connected databases.

**Attack Vectors:**

The attack vector is remote, using HTTP requests via a web browser or automated tools by directly accessing the vulnerable procedures exposed by the PL/SQL module (e.g., `OWA_UTIL.showsource` or `OWA_UTIL.cellsprint`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the Oracle Application Server, Oracle9i Database and Oracle8i Database.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability allows access to the vulnerable procedures without prior authentication.

**Additional Notes**
*   The vulnerability was discovered by David Litchfield of NGSSoftware.
*   Oracle has released a security alert to address the issue.
* The issue lies in the misconfiguration of the PL/SQL gateway and that the `OWA_UTIL` package is exposed to the internet without proper access control.

This vulnerability is considered severe due to the ability of an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries and obtain potentially sensitive data including access credentials to other databases.
