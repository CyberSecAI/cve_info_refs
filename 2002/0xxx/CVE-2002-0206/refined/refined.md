- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `index.php` script in PHP-Nuke uses PHP's `include()` function to execute a PHP file specified in the CGI variable "file" without proper validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Lack of input validation on the "file" CGI variable. The `include()` function will execute remote files if a URL is supplied.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can force the server to run arbitrary PHP code, with the same privileges as the PHP server process on the victim host. This could lead to complete compromise of the server.
- **Attack vectors:**  A remote attacker can send a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable PHP-Nuke server, specifying a malicious PHP file hosted on a remote web server in the "file" CGI variable.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server, and they must have a web server that is hosting malicious php code.
