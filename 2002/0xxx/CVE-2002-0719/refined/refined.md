The provided document describes three vulnerabilities in Microsoft Content Management Server (MCMS) 2001. Only one of them, the "SQL Injection via MCMS Resource Request" vulnerability, is associated with CVE-2002-0719.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input validation in a function that handles resource requests (like image files) from the MCMS server. This allows an attacker to inject SQL commands into the database query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability. The function does not sanitize user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands on the server.
- This allows the attacker to add, change, or delete data in the MCMS database.
- The attacker could also potentially run operating system commands on the server through SQL commands, although with the limited privileges of the SQL Server service account.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a specially crafted resource request to the MCMS server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to establish a connection with the affected MCMS server. Any user with network access to the server can potentially exploit the vulnerability.

The document also mentions two other vulnerabilities which are assigned other CVEs:
- **Buffer Overrun in MCMS Authentication Operation (CAN-2002-0700):** A buffer overflow in user authentication that could cause a denial of service or allow remote code execution with system privileges.
- **Program Execution via MCMS Authoring Function (CAN-2002-0718):**  A flaw in how MCMS handles web authoring commands, allowing attackers to upload and execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Web Application Manager account.
