List:       [bugtraq](?l=bugtraq&r=1&w=2)
Subject:    RPC analysis
From:       [Charles Hannum <abuse () spamalicious ! com>](?a=101840023200001&r=1&w=2)
Date:       [2002-08-01 14:54:35](?l=bugtraq&r=1&w=2&b=200208)
[Download RAW [message](?l=bugtraq&m=102821785316087&q=mbox) or [body](?l=bugtraq&m=102821785316087&q=raw)]

The scope of this bug is somewhat limited.  It depends on a particular
multiplication overflowing:

        nodesize = c * elsize;

In order for this to happen, you must have
maxsize>max(nodesize)*elsize; otherwise the c>maxsize check will catch
it.  Hence the patch:

-       if ((c > maxsize) && (xdrs->x_op != XDR_FREE)) {
+       if ((c > maxsize || UINT_MAX/elsize < c) &&
+           (xdrs->x_op != XDR_FREE)) {

In practice, there are only two ways that this constraint is violated:

1) An application explicitly passes in a large maxsize.  I generally
   consider this an application bug, in the same vain as sending bogus
   arguments to calloc(), fread()/fwrite() or qsort().  However, amd
   and various amd utilities -- amd, amq, pawd, and probably others --
   pass in a maxsize ~0 (i.e. all-1s) and are therefore susceptible.

2) A program uses rpcgen with unbounded arrays; e.g. in rex.x:

        rexstring rst_cmd<>;    /* list of command and args */
        rexstring rst_env<>;    /* list of environment */

   (Note that nothing in our source tree actually *uses* rex.x, but
   the same problems occurs in rusers.x.)

There are only a few things in our source tree that actually use
xdr_array():

/usr/src/dist/am-utils/amd/amq_subr.c
/usr/src/dist/am-utils/amq/amq_xdr.c
/usr/src/dist/am-utils/libamu/xdr_func.c
/usr/src/gnu/dist/toolchain/gdb/vx-share/xdr_ld.c
/usr/src/gnu/dist/toolchain/gdb/vx-share/xdr_rdb.c
/usr/src/lib/libc/rpc/authunix_prot.c
/usr/src/lib/librpcsvc/rnusers.x
/usr/obj.i386/lib/librpcsvc/rex.c
/usr/obj.i386/lib/librpcsvc/rnusers.c
/usr/obj.i386/lib/librpcsvc/rusers.c
/usr/obj.i386/usr.sbin/rpc.pcnfsd/pcnfsd_xdr.c

The GDB stuff and rex.c are not actually linked into anything.  The
uses in authunix_prot.c, rnusers.c and pcnfsd_xdr.c are all
sufficiently bounded.  Ergo, the only vulnerable programs are
amd/amq/etc. and rusers (the client, not the server).

## History

The CERT Division is the birthplace of cybersecurity. For nearly 30 years, the CERT Division of the SEI has partnered with government, industry, law enforcement, and academia to advance cybersecurity and improve the security and resilience of computer systems and networks.

Originally focused on incident response, we have expanded into cybersecurity areas such as network situational awareness, malicious code analysis, secure coding, resilience management, insider threats, digital investigations and intelligence, workforce development, DevOps, forensics, software assurance, vulnerability discovery and analysis, and risk management.

## Former Director Richard Pethia

[Richard Pethia](/about/leadership/display.cfm?customel_datapageid_2623=3545) was founding director of the SEI's CERT Division. Pethia, who served as director of CERT from 1988 to 2016, guided the organization through tremendous growth and change. Under Pethia's leadership, the unit expanded and evolved from the CERT Coordination Center—a small group focused on computer incident response—to a research organization of more than 200 professionals dedicated to solving problems with widespread cybersecurity implications.

Internet Security Systems Security Brief
July 31, 2002

Remote Buffer Overflow Vulnerability in Sun RPC

Synopsis:

Internet Security Systems (ISS) X-Force has discovered a buffer overflow
in the xdr_array filter primitive. This function is a part of the Sun RPC
library, and it is used in multiple RPC services. Any native or third party
software that uses the xdr_array function may be vulnerable. Vulnerable RPC
services are installed and enabled by default on the affected software
versions.

Impact:

The buffer overflow vulnerability can allow remote attackers to execute
arbitrary commands on a target system with superuser privileges. Attackers
pose the most serious risk when attacking unprotected networks, or improperly
protected networks

## Integer overflow in xdr\_array() function when deserializing the XDR stream

#### Vulnerability Note VU#192995

Original Release Date: 2002-08-01 | Last Revised: 2006-05-15

---

### Overview

There is an integer overflow present in the [*xdr\_array()*](http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=xdr_array&apropos=0&sektion=3&manpath=FreeBSD+4.6-RELEASE&format=html) function distributed as part of the Sun Microsystems XDR library. This overflow has been shown to lead to remotely exploitable buffer overflows in multiple applications, leading to the execution of arbitrary code. Although the library was originally distributed by Sun Microsystems, multiple vendors have included the vulnerable code in their own implementations.

### Description

| The XDR (external data representation) libraries are used to provide platform-independent methods for sending data from one system process to another, typically over a network connection. Such routines are commonly used in remote procedure call (RPC) implementations to provide transparency to application programmers who need to use common interfaces to interact with many different types of systems. The *xdr\_array()* function in the XDR library provided by Sun Microsystems contains an [integer overflow](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/192995) that can lead to improperly sized dynamic memory allocation. Subsequent problems like buffer overflows may result, depending on how and where the vulnerable *xdr\_array()* function is used.  This issue is currently being tracked as [VU#192995](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/192995) by the CERT/CC and as [CAN-2002-0391](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2002-0391) in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) dictionary. |
| --- |

### Impact

| Because SunRPC-derived XDR libraries are used by a variety of vendors in a variety of applications, this defect may lead to a number of differing security problems. Exploiting this vulnerability will lead to denial of service, execution of arbitrary code, or the disclosure of sensitive information.Specific impacts reported include the ability to execute arbitrary code with root privileges (by exploiting [dmispd, rpc.cmsd, or kadmind, for example](http://sunsolve.sun.com/pub-cgi/retrieve.pl?doc=fsalert%2F46122&zone_32=category%3Asecurity)). In addition, intruders who exploit the XDR overflow in [MIT KRB5](http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/www/advisories/MITKRB5-SA-2002-001-xdr.txt) kadmind may be able to gain control of a Key Distribution Center (KDC) and improperly authenticate to other services within a trusted Kerberos realm. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply a patch from your vendor**Note that XDR libraries can be used by multiple applications on most systems. It may be necessary to upgrade or apply multiple patches and then recompile statically linked applications. Applications that are statically linked must be recompiled using patched libraries. Applications that are dynamically linked do not need to be recompiled; however, running services need to be restarted in order to use the patched libraries.System administrators should consider the following process when addressing this issue:   1. Patch or obtain updated XDR/RPC libraries. 2. Restart any dynamically linked services that make use of the XDR/RPC libraries. 3. Recompile any statically linked applications using the patched or updated XDR/RPC libraries.  Note this is an iterative process for each set of patches being applied. |
| --- |

| **Disable access to vulnerable services or applications**Until patches are available and can be applied, you may wish to disable access to services or applications compiled with the vulnerable *xdr\_array()* function. Such applications include, but are not limited to, the following:     + DMI Service Provider daemon (dmispd) + CDE Calendar Manager Service daemon (rpc.cmsd) + MIT Kerberos 5 Administration daemon (kadmind)  As a best practice, the CERT/CC recommends disabling all services that are not explicitly required. |

 MIT krb5 Security Advisory 2002-001

2002-08-02

Topic: Remote root vulnerability in MIT krb5 admin system

Severity: Remote user may be able to gain root access to a KDC host.

SUMMARY
=======

There is an integer overflow bug in the SUNRPC-derived RPC library
used by the Kerberos 5 administration system that could be exploited
to gain unauthorized root access to a KDC host. It is believed that
the attacker needs to be able to authenticate to the kadmin daemon for
this attack to be successful. No exploits are known to exist yet.

IMPACT
======

A remote attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code on the KDC
with the privileges of the user running the kadmin daemon (usually
root). This can lead to compromise of the Kerberos database.

AFFECTED SOFTWARE
=================

All releases of MIT Kerberos 5, up to and including krb5-1.2.5.

FIXES
=====

Apply the following patch to src/lib/rpc/xdr\_array.c:

Index: xdr\_array.c

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
===============

Thanks to ISS for discovery of the vulnerability.

Thanks to Jeffrey Hutzelman for assistance in discovering the
particulars of this bug.

DETAILS
=======

The xdr\_array() decoder computes the value of the NODESIZE variable in
a way that can lead to integer overflow. An attacker can construct an
XDR encoding that will take advantage of this integer overflow in
order to overflow the allocated heap buffer, depending on the
specifics of the caller of the xdr\_array() function.

The uses of xdr\_array() in the kadm5 library, which implements the
Kerberos 5 adminstration protocol, are unsafe in an environment where
this bug exists. A remote user may be able to use the buffer overflow
to execute arbitrary code on the KDC host, possibly leading to
unauthorized root access. It is believed that the remote user must
first successfully authenticate to the kadmin daemon in order to
exercise this vulnerability, though the user may not need to posess
any special privileges.

Title: Flaw in Services for Unix 3.0 Interix SDK Could Allow
 Code Execution (Q329209)
Released: 02 October 2002
Software: Services for Unix 3.0 Interix SDK
Impact: Buffer overrun and denial of service
Max Risk: Moderate
Bulletin: MS02-057

Microsoft encourages customers to review the Security Bulletin at:
<http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS02-057.asp>.
- ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Issue:
======
All three vulnerabilities discussed in this bulletin involve the
inclusion of the Sun [TM] Microsystems RPC library in Microsoft's
Services for UNIX (SFU) 3.0 on the Interix SDK. Developers who
created applications or utilities using the Sun RPC library from
the Interix SDK need to evaluate three vulnerabilities.

Windows Services for UNIX (SFU) 3.0 provides a full range of cross-
platform services to integrate Windows into existing UNIX environ-
ments. In version 3.0, the Interix subsystem technology is built in
so that Windows Services for UNIX 3.0 can provide platform inter-
operability and application migration in one fully integrated and
supported product from Microsoft. Developers who have integrated
Windows into their existing UNIX environments may have used the
Interix SDK to develop custom applications and utilities so that
applications that only ran on the UNIX platform can now run in a
Windows environment. Developers who used the Interix SDK to develop
applications or utilities should read this bulletin.

The first vulnerability is an integer overflow in the XDR library
that ships with the Sun RPC library on the Interix SDK for
Microsoft's Services for Unix (SFU) 3.0. An attacker could send a
malicious RPC request to the RPC server from a remote machine and
cause corruption in the server program. This can cause the server
to fail and potentially allow the attacker to run code of his or
her choice in the context of the server program.

The second vulnerability is a buffer overrun. An attacker could send
a malicious RPC request to the RPC server with an improper parameter
size check. This could lead to a buffer overrun, causing the server
to fail and preventing it from servicing any further requests from
clients.

The third vulnerability is an RPC implementation error. An app-
Lication using the Sun RPC library does not properly check the size
of client TCP requests. This could result in a denial of service
to a server application using the Sun RPC library. The RPC library
expects client TCP requests to specify the size of the record
that follows. Because there is a flaw in the way RPC detects
client packets, an attacker could send a malformed RPC request to
the RPC server from a remote machine and cause the server to fail
by not servicing any further client requests.

After applying the patch, it is necessary to recompile any Interix
application that is statically linked with the Interix SDK Sun RPC
library.

Mitigating Factors:
====================
\*Only applications or utilities that were created using the
 Interix SDK and specifically that use the Sun RPC library,
 would be affected by these vulnerabilities.
\*If an administrator or developer has only installed the
 Interix SDK but has not actually created applications with
 the SDK that use the Sun RPC library, the systems where the
 SDK was installed would not be vulnerable.

Risk Rating:
============
 - Internet systems: Moderate
 - Intranet systems: Moderate
 - Client systems: Moderate

Patch Availability:
===================
 - A patch is available to fix this vulnerability. Please read the

 NetBSD Security Advisory 2002-011
 =================================

Topic:Sun RPC XDR decoder contains buffer overflow

Version:NetBSD-current: source prior to August 1, 2002
NetBSD-1.6 beta: affected
NetBSD-1.5.3: affected
NetBSD-1.5.2: affected
NetBSD-1.5.1: affected
NetBSD-1.5: affected
NetBSD-1.4.\*: affected

severity:Possible remote root compromise if RPC services

Fixed:NetBSD-current:August 1, 2002
NetBSD-1.6 branch:August 2, 2002 (1.6 includes the fix)
NetBSD-1.5 branch:August 1, 2002
NetBSD-1.4 branch:not yet

Abstract
========

Integer overflows exist in the RPC code in libc. These cause a buffer to
be mistakenly allocated too small, and then overflown.

The Automounter amd(8) and its query tool amq(8), and the rusers(1)
client binary use the flawed code in a way which could be exploitable.

Other uses of the RPC functions have been examined and are believed to
not be exploitable.

No RPC-based services are enabled by default.

Technical Details
=================

Sun RPC is a remote procedure call framework which allows clients
to invoke procedures in a server process over a network somewhat
transparently.  XDR is a mechanism for encoding data structures for
use with RPC.  NFS, NIS, and many other network services are built
upon Sun RPC.

The NetBSD C runtime library (libc) contains an XDR encoder/decoder
derived from Sun's RPC implementation.

Any application using Sun RPC may be vulnerable to a heap buffer
overflow.  Depending upon the application, this vulnerability may be
exploitable and lead to arbitrary code execution.

An error in the calculation of memory needed for unpacking arrays in
the XDR decoder can result in a heap buffer overflow.

Though no exploits are known to exist currently, RPC-based services
often run as the superuser, and the vulnerability in amd(8) could be
exploitable.

Again, no RPC-based services are enabled by default.

Solutions and Workarounds
=========================

The recent NetBSD 1.6 release is not vulnerable to this issue. A full
upgrade to NetBSD 1.6 is the recommended resolution for all users able
to do so. Many security-related improvements have been made, and
indeed this release has been delayed several times in order to include
fixes for a number of recent issues.

If you do not run any of the affected RPC services (amd/amq/rusers)
your system is not affected.  However, we suggest you upgrade your
system to avoid running vulnerable RPC code by mistake.

The following instructions describe how to upgrade your libc (which
includes RPC code) by updating your source tree and rebuilding and
installing a new version of libc.

Note that if you have any statically-linked binaries that uses RPC,
you need to recompile them.

\* NetBSD-current:

Systems running NetBSD-current dated from before 2002-08-01
should be upgraded to NetBSD-current dated 2002-08-01 or later.

The following directories need to be updated from the
netbsd-current CVS branch (aka HEAD):
lib/libc/rpc

To update from CVS, re-build, and re-install libc:
# cd src
# cvs update -d -P lib/libc/rpc

# cd lib/libc
# make cleandir dependall
# make install

\* NetBSD 1.6 beta:

Systems running NetBSD 1.6 BETAs and Release Candidates should
be upgraded to the NetBSD 1.6 release.

If a source-based point upgrade is required, sources from the
NetBSD 1.6 branch dated 2002-08-02 or later should be used.

The following directories need to be updated from the
netbsd-1-6 CVS branch:
lib/libc/rpc

To update from CVS, re-build, and re-install libc:
# cd src
# cvs update -d -P -r netbsd-1-6 lib/libc/rpc

# cd lib/libc
# make cleandir dependall
# make install

\* NetBSD 1.5, 1.5.1, 1.5.2, 1.5.3:

Systems running NetBSD-1.5 branch dated from before 2002-08-02
should be upgraded to NetBSD-1.5 branch dated 2002-08-02 or later.

The following directories need to be updated from the
netbsd-1-5 CVS branch:
lib/libc/rpc

To update from CVS, re-build, and re-install libc:
# cd src
# cvs update -d -P -r netbsd-1-5 lib/libc/rpc

# cd lib/libc
# make cleandir dependall
# make install

\* NetBSD 1.4, 1.4.1, 1.4.2, 1.4.3:

The advisory will be updated to include instructions to remedy
this problem for systems running the NetBSD-1.4 branch.

 OpenAFS Security Advisory 2002-001

Topic: Remote root vulnerability in OpenAFS servers

Issued: 03-Aug-2002
Last Update: 03-Aug-2002
Severity: High
Affected: OpenAFS 1.0 - 1.2.5, OpenAFS 1.3.0 - 1.3.2

A remote user may be able to gain root access to an OpenAFS database
server or fileserver host. In addition, certain administrative clients
may be attacked if they make requests to a rogue server.

SUMMARY
=======

There is an integer overflow bug in the SUNRPC-derived RPC library
used by OpenAFS that could be exploited to crash certain OpenAFS
servers (volserver, vlserver, ptserver, buserver) or to obtain
unauthorized root access to a host running one of these processes.

In addition, it is possible for a rogue server to attack certain
administrative clients (vos, pts, backup, butc, rxstat), but only
if certain RPC requests are made to the rogue server.

The OpenAFS fileserver and cache manager (client) are not vulnerable
to these attacks. No exploits are presently known to be available
for this vulnerability.

IMPACT
======

A remote attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code on an OpenAFS
server host with the privileges of the user running the OpenAFS server
processes (usually root). This can lead to compromise of the OpenAFS
administrative databases, data stored on a compromised server, or
possible root access on a server host. Once a server host has been
compromised, the attacker is able to obtain access to any other OpenAFS
servers in the same cell.

AFFECTED SOFTWARE
=================

All releases of OpenAFS 1.0.x and 1.1.x.
All releases of OpenAFS 1.2.x, up to and including OpenAFS 1.2.5.
All releases of OpenAFS 1.3.x, up to and including OpenAFS 1.3.2.

FIXES
=====

The OpenAFS project recommends that all users upgrade to OpenAFS
1.2.6 or newer. The latest stable OpenAFS release is always available
from <http://www.openafs.org/release/latest.html>.

No update is presently available for the OpenAFS-unstable series.

For those who are unable to upgrade, apply the following patch to
correct the XDR vulnerability, and rebuild your tree.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
===============

Thanks to ISS for discovery of the vulnerability.

Thanks to Nickolai Zeldovich for assistance in discovering the
particulars of this bug and developing a fix.

Thanks also to Tom Yu and the MIT Kerberos Development Team for their
advisory MITKRB5-SA-2002-001, the form and much of the text of which
was shamelessly stolen to produce this alert.

DETAIL
======

The xdr\_array() decoder computes the value of the NODESIZE variable in
a way that can lead to integer overflow. An attacker can construct an
XDR encoding that will take advantage of this integer overflow in
order to overflow the allocated heap buffer, depending on the
specifics of the caller of the xdr\_array() function.

Several uses of xdr\_array() in various AFS protocols are unsafe in an
environment where this bug exists. In particular, any use of a
counted array with unbounded size (represented in the Rx protocol
description with an empty pair of angle brackets '<>') is unsafe. Such
uses appear in input arguments to procedures in the PTS, VLDB, volserver,
and backup database protocols, and output arguments from procedures in all
of these protocols and in the Rx statistics interface implemented by most
OpenAFS servers.

A remote user may be able to use the buffer overflow to execute arbitrary
code on the server under attack, possibly leading to unauthorized root
access. Similarly a rogue server may be able to use the buffer overflow
to attack a client which makes one of the RPC's with unsafe output
arguments.

### [Openwall GNU/\*/Linux](#JSHA-5CRJBC) Affected

Updated:  August 06, 2002

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

The xdr\_array(3) integer overflow was present in the glibc package on
Openwall GNU/\*/Linux until 2002/08/01 when it was corrected for
Owl-current and documented as a security fix in the system-wide change
log available at:

 <http://www.openwall.com/Owl/CHANGES.shtml>

The same glibc package update also fixes a very similar but different
calloc(3) [integer overflow](http://CERT.Uni-Stuttgart.DE/advisories/calloc.php) possibility that is currently not known to
allow for an attack on a particular application, but has been patched
as a proactive measure.  The Sun RPC xdr\_array(3) overflow may allow
for passive attacks on mount(8) by malicious or spoofed NFSv3 servers
as well as for both passive and active attacks on RPC clients or
services that one might install on Owl.  (There're no RPC services
included with Owl.)

         Title:  Sun RPC xdr\_array vulnerability
        Number:  20020801-01-P
          Date:  August 16, 2002
     Reference:  CERT® CA-2002-25

- -----------------------
- --- Issue Specifics ---
- -----------------------

This is a followup to SGI Security Bulletin 20020801-01-A.

It's been reported that there is a buffer overflow vulnerability in the Sun
RPC functions supplied with the IRIX 6.5 operating system.

The portmapper, NFS and NIS RPC services do NOT use the relevant RPC XDR
functions in libc in a manner that makes them vulnerable.  But other RPC
services from IRIX, third-parties, freeware, etc. might use XDR functions.

See <http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2002-25.html> and
<http://bvlive01.iss.net/issEn/delivery/xforce/alertdetail.jsp?oid=20823>
for additional details.

SGI has investigated the issue and recommends the following steps for
neutralizing the exposure.  It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that these measures be
implemented on ALL vulnerable SGI systems.

These issues have been corrected in future releases of IRIX and with a
series of patches.

- --------------
- --- Impact ---
- --------------

The vulnerabilities exist within libc, which is installed by default on
IRIX 6.5 systems as part of eoe.sw.base.

To determine the version of IRIX you are running, execute the following
command:

  # uname -R

That will return a result similar to the following:

  # 6.5 6.5.16f

The first number ("6.5") is the release name, the second ("6.5.16f" in
this case) is the extended release name.  The extended release name is
the "version" we refer to throughout this document.

This vulnerability was assigned the following CVE:
<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2002-0391>

This vulnerability was assigned the following VU:
<http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/192995>

- ----------------------------
- --- Temporary Workaround ---
- ----------------------------

There is no effective workaround available for these problems.  SGI
recommends either upgrading to a minimum of IRIX 6.5.18, or installing the
appropriate patch from the listing below.

- ----------------
- --- Solution ---
- ----------------

SGI has provided a series of patches for these vulnerabilities. Our
recommendation is to upgrade to IRIX 6.5.18 when available, or install the
appropriate patch.

		 MIT krb5 Security Advisory 2002-001

2002-08-02

Topic: Remote root vulnerability in MIT krb5 admin system

Severity: Remote user may be able to gain root access to a KDC host.

SUMMARY
=======

There is an integer overflow bug in the SUNRPC-derived RPC library
used by the Kerberos 5 administration system that could be exploited
to gain unauthorized root access to a KDC host.  It is believed that
the attacker needs to be able to authenticate to the kadmin daemon for
this attack to be successful.  No exploits are known to exist yet.

IMPACT
======

A remote attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code on the KDC
with the privileges of the user running the kadmin daemon (usually
root).  This can lead to compromise of the Kerberos database.

AFFECTED SOFTWARE
=================

All releases of MIT Kerberos 5, up to and including krb5-1.2.5.

FIXES
=====

Apply the following patch to src/lib/rpc/xdr_array.c:

Index: xdr_array.c
===================================================================
RCS file: /cvs/krbdev/krb5/src/lib/rpc/xdr_array.c,v
retrieving revision 1.5
diff -c -r1.5 xdr_array.c
*** xdr_array.c	1998/02/14 02:27:23	1.5

  		return (FALSE);
  	}
  	c = *sizep;
! 	if ((c > maxsize) && (xdrs->x_op != XDR_FREE)) {
  		return (FALSE);
  	}
  	nodesize = c * elsize;
- --- 75,82 ----
  		return (FALSE);
  	}
  	c = *sizep;
! 	if ((c > maxsize || c > LASTUNSIGNED / elsize)
! 	    && (xdrs->x_op != XDR_FREE)) {
  		return (FALSE);
  	}
  	nodesize = c * elsize;

and rebuild your tree.  The patch was generated against krb5-1.2.5;
patches to other releases may apply with some offset.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
===============

Thanks to ISS for discovery of the vulnerability.

Thanks to Jeffrey Hutzelman for assistance in discovering the
particulars of this bug.

DETAILS
=======

The xdr_array() decoder computes the value of the NODESIZE variable in
a way that can lead to integer overflow.  An attacker can construct an
XDR encoding that will take advantage of this integer overflow in
order to overflow the allocated heap buffer, depending on the
specifics of the caller of the xdr_array() function.

The uses of xdr_array() in the kadm5 library, which implements the
Kerberos 5 adminstration protocol, are unsafe in an environment where
this bug exists.  A remote user may be able to use the buffer overflow
to execute arbitrary code on the KDC host, possibly leading to
unauthorized root access.  It is believed that the remote user must
first successfully authenticate to the kadmin daemon in order to
exercise this vulnerability, though the user may not need to posess
any special privileges.

0.   Revision History

v1.0  2002-07-31  Initial release
v1.1  2002-08-01  Corrected patch

I.   Background

Sun RPC is a remote procedure call framework which allows clients
to invoke procedures in a server process over a network somewhat
transparently.  XDR is a mechanism for encoding data structures for
use with RPC.  NFS, NIS, and many other network services are built
upon Sun RPC.

The FreeBSD C runtime library (libc) contains an XDR encoder/decoder
derived from Sun's RPC implementation.

II.  Problem Description

An error in the calculation of memory needed for unpacking arrays in
the XDR decoder can result in a heap buffer overflow.

III. Impact

Any application using Sun RPC may be vulnerable to the heap buffer
overflow.  Depending upon the application, this vulnerability may be
exploitable and lead to arbitrary code execution.

Though no exploits are known to exist currently, many RPC-based
services run as the superuser (such as NFS, the NIS server, rpc.statd,
and others) and thus this vulnerability should be considered
high-risk.

No RPC-based services are enabled by default in FreeBSD installations.

IV.  Workaround

Do not run any RPC-based services.  The RPC-based services running
on a machine may be determined by:

  # rpcinfo -p <hostname>

To disable any RPC-based services at next boot, add (or change if it
is already present) the following lines in /etc/rc.conf:

  portmap_enable="NO"
  nfs_client_enable="NO"
  nfs_server_enable="NO"
  nis_client_enable="NO"
  nis_server_enable="NO"

V.   Solution

Do one of the following:

1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to 4.6-STABLE; or to the RELENG_4_6,
RELENG_4_5, or RELENG_4_4 security branch dated after the correction
date (4.6.1-RELEASE-p6, 4.5-RELEASE-p15, or 4.4-RELEASE-p22).

2) To patch your present system:

The following patch has been verified to apply to FreeBSD 4.4, 4.5,
and 4.6 systems.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

# fetch ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/patches/SA-02:34/rpc.patch
# fetch ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/patches/SA-02:34/rpc.patch.asc

b) Execute the following commands as root:

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch

c) Recompile the operating system as described in
<URL:<http://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/makeworld.html>>.

Note that any statically linked applications that are not part of
the base system (i.e. from the Ports Collection or other 3rd-party
sources) must be recompiled if they use Sun RPC.

All affected applications must be restarted in order to use the
corrected library.  Though it is not required, rebooting may be the
easiest way to accomplish this.

VI.  Correction details

The following list contains the revision numbers of each file that was
corrected in FreeBSD.

## Flaw in Services for Unix 3.0 Interix SDK Could Allow Code Execution (Q329209)

Published: October 02, 2002

**Version:** 1.0

**Originally posted:** October 02, 2002

#### Summary

**Who should read this bulletin:**
Administrators and developers who have deployed applications or utilities using the Sun [TM] Microsystems RPC library on the Services for Unix 3.0 Interix SDK.

**Impact of vulnerability:**
Denial of Service, run code of attacker's choice

**Maximum Severity Rating:**
Moderate

**Recommendation:**
Administrators who have deployed applications or utilities using the Sun Microsystems RPC library on the Interix SDK should apply the patch.

**Affected Software:**
Only applications or utilities running on the following operating systems using the Sun Microsystem RPC library on the Services for Unix 3.0 Interix SDK should consider applying the patch.

* Microsoft Windows NT4
* Microsoft Windows 2000
* Microsoft Windows XP

### General Information

## Technical details

**Technical description:**

All three vulnerabilities discussed in this bulletin involve the inclusion of the Sun RPC library in Microsoft's Services for UNIX (SFU) 3.0 on the Interix SDK. Developers who created applications or utilities using the Sun RPC library from the Interix SDK need to evaluate three vulnerabilities.

Windows Services for UNIX (SFU) 3.0 provides a full range of cross-platform services to integrate Windows into existing UNIX environments. In version 3.0, the Interix subsystem technology is built in so that Windows Services for UNIX 3.0 can provide platform interoperability and application migration in one fully integrated and supported product from Microsoft. Developers who have integrated Windows into their existing UNIX environments may have used the Interix SDK to develop custom applications and utilities so that applications that only ran on the UNIX platform can now run in a Windows environment. Developers who used the Interix SDK to develop applications or utilities should read this bulletin.

The first vulnerability is an integer overflow in the XDR library that ships with the Sun RPC library on the Interix SDK for Microsoft's Services for Unix (SFU) 3.0. An attacker could send a malicious RPC request to the RPC server from a remote machine and cause corruption in the server program. This can cause the server to fail and potentially allow the attacker to run code of his or her choice in the context of the server program.

The second vulnerability is a buffer overrun. An attacker could send a malicious RPC request to the RPC server with an improper parameter size check. This could lead to a buffer overrun, causing the server to fail and preventing it from servicing any further requests from clients.

The third vulnerability is an RPC implementation error. An application using the Sun RPC library does not properly check the size of client TCP requests. This could result in a denial of service to a server application using the Sun RPC library. The RPC library expects client TCP requests to specify the size of the record that follows. Because there is a flaw in the way RPC detects client packets, an attacker could send a malformed RPC request to the RPC server from a remote machine and cause the server to fail by not servicing any further client requests.

After applying the patch, it is necessary to recompile any Interix application that is statically linked with the Interix SDK Sun RPC library.

**Mitigating factors:**

* Only applications or utilities that were created using the Interix SDK and specifically that use the Sun RPC library, would be affected by these vulnerabilities.
* If an administrator or developer has only installed the Interix SDK but has not actually created applications with the SDK that use the Sun RPC library, the systems where the SDK was installed would not be vulnerable.

**Severity Rating:**

|  | Internet Servers | Intranet Servers | Client Systems |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Interix SDK for Microsoft Services for Unix 3.0** | Moderate | Moderate | Moderate |

The above [assessment](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21140) is based on the types of systems affected by the vulnerability, their typical deployment patterns, and the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would have on them. Even though in one of the vulnerabilities described, an attacker could run code, it is only possible to run code in the context of the application.

**Vulnerability identifier:**

* Integer Overflow in XDR library:[CAN-2002-0391](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=can-2002-0391)
* Improper parameter size check leading to buffer overrun:[CAN-2002-1140](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=can-2002-1140)
* RPC implementation error:[CAN-2002-1141](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=can-2002-1141)

**Tested Versions:**

Microsoft tested Microsoft Windows NT, Windows 2000 and Windows XP to assess whether they are affected by these vulnerabilities. Previous versions are no longer [supported](https://support.microsoft.com/directory/discontinue.asp), and may or may not be affected by these vulnerabilities.

## Frequently asked questions

All three vulnerabilities discussed in this bulletin involve the inclusion of the SUN RPC library in Microsoft's Services for UNIX (SFU) 3.0 on the Interix SDK. Developers who created applications or utilities using the SUN RPC library on the Interix SDK need to evaluate the following three vulnerabilities.

**What is RPC?**

[RPC](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/aa378651)(Remote Procedure Call) is a technology that's used extensively to support distributed applications -- that is, applications whose components are located on different computers. The primary purpose of RPC is to provide a way for the components to communicate with each other. This allows the components to levy requests on each other and communicate the results of these requests. This bulletin pertains to the Sun RPC protocol.

**What is SFU?**

SFU stands for Services for UNIX. Windows Services for UNIX version 3.0 provides a full range of cross-platform services for integrating Windows into existing UNIX-based environments.
To get more detailed information regarding Services for Unix, please see <https://www.microsoft.com/windows/sfu/docs/sfuwp.doc>

**How are Microsoft Services for Unix 3.0 and Interix related?**

The Interix technology provides a UNIX environment that runs on top the Windows kernel, enabling UNIX applications and scripts to run natively on the Windows platform alongside Windows applications. With this capability, an installation can continue to get value out of its UNIX scripts and applications-simply reuse them on Windows.
The key difference between Windows Services for UNIX 2.0 and 3.0 is that Microsoft Interix is fully integrated into Windows Services for UNIX 3.0. The Interix subsystem technology provides a universal environment in which to run both Windows and UNIX applications on a single system. For a technical overview of Services for UNIX 3.0 with Interix, click [here](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/interopmigration/unix/sfu/sfu3ovw.mspx).

**What is the Interix SDK?**

The Interix SDK, included with SFU 3.0, provides compilers, tools, libraries & debuggers for migrating applications on UNIX to run in a Windows environment.

**What kinds of applications or utilities are being created using the Interix SDK?**

The application might be any UNIX -based application. Largely the Interix SDK is used to support existing applications that need to be ported to the Windows platform without changing their source code. Developers seldom write applications from scratch using the Interix SDK.

**Doesn't Microsoft ship applications using the Sun RPC protocol along with Services for Unix 3.0? Aren't they vulnerable?**

No. Microsoft shipped Server for NFS, Server for NIS, Server for PCNFS, PortMapper and User Name Mapping Server with Services for Unix 3.0. All of these applications use the Sun RPC protocol; however none of these applications uses the Interix SDK Sun RPC library. They have been verified not to be affected by any of the vulnerabilities discussed in this bulletin.

**Does the SDK go to third party partners or is it generally available?**

The SUN RPC Library ships with SFU 3.0 . Services for Unix 3.0 and Interix are also bundled by some ISV's so they may be providing the SDK with their products.

**How do I tell if a third party product includes SFU 3.0 and the Interix SDK?**

There is no standard way to tell. If you use a 3rd party Interix server application the best thing will be to contact the vendor to verify whether the application uses the Sun RPC library from the Interix SDK.

**Integer Overflow in XDR library(CAN-2002-0391):**

**What's the scope of this vulnerability?**

There is a[buffer overrun](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/glossary)due to an overflow in a variable that contains a parameter. This parameter defines the size of an array for applications that use External Data Representation (XDR). The vulnerability can lead to a denial of service by crashing the application or running code at a higher privilege level in a server application using Sun XDR library. Sun Microsystems distributed this functionality as part of their XDR library. This library ships with Services for Unix (SFU) 3.0 on the Interix SDK.
Remote attackers could exploit this vulnerability to either cause the application to fail or to cause the execution of arbitrary code on a target server. An attacker could send a malicious RPC request to the RPC server from a remote machine. This could cause heap corruption in the server program. The heap corruption in turn could cause the server to crash, thereby preventing it from servicing further requests from other client programs. The attacker could also exploit the heap corruption to run malicious code in the context of the server program.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

There is a buffer overrun in a variable used by applications developed with the Sun XDR library that shipped with SFU 3.0. It is possible to overflow a variable that holds the size of an array parameter.

**What are the XDR libraries?**

The XDR (external data representation) libraries are used to provide platform-independent methods for sending data from one system process to another over a network connection. These libraries shipped with Services For Unix 3.0.
To learn more about XDR please refer to [XDR: External Data Representation Standard](https://technet.microsoft.com/ftp%3A//ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc1832.txt).

**What's wrong with the XDR libraries?**

There is a function in the XDR library that contains overflow which could result in memory being improperly allocated. Because inputs are not properly checked, the misallocation of memory could lead to a buffer overflow.

**Is this issue related to a CERT advisory?**

Yes, this relates to [VU#192995](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/192995).

**What could this vulnerability enable an attacker to do?**

This vulnerability could enable an attacker to send a malformed RPC request that would cause the application to either fail or to run code as system in a server application using the Sun RPC library. If an attacker were able to run code on the RPC server, the attacker would have the same privileges as the application.

**How could an attacker exploit this vulnerability?**

An attacker can send a malicious RPC request to the RPC server from a remote machine. This can cause the heap corruption in the server program. The heap corruption in turn can cause the server to crash, thereby preventing it from servicing further requests from other client programs.

**What does the patch do?**

The patch eliminates the vulnerability by properly checking inputs for the integer overflow that could lead to the denial of service or code execution.

**Improper parameter size check leading to denial of service (CAN-2002-1140):**

**What the scope of this vulnerability?**

The RPC library expects client requests be broken down into variable sized fragments, with each fragment's leading bit specifying whether it is the last fragment. The next bits specify the size of the data to follow.
The RPC library expects that client requests sent to it will be broken into variable sized fragments in a certain format. If a malicious client were to send a particular malformed fragment to a service, the RPC library would go into a "hung" state and be unable to respond to any further requests - leading to a denial of service.
Any RPC server using the Sun RPC library is vulnerable.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The RPC library expects that client requests will be broken down into variable sized fragments with each fragment's leading bit specifying whether it is the last fragment. The next bits specify the size of the data to follow. There is a flaw in the RPC library that will cause the application to hang if the fragmented packets are malformed in a particular way.

**What could this vulnerability enable an attacker to do?**

This vulnerability could enable an attacker to cause an RPC server to stop responding to client requests. In other words, this is a denial of service vulnerability.

**How could an attacker exploit this vulnerability?**

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by writing a program that sent malformed packets to the RPC server and caused it to be unable to service any further client requests.

**Does the attacker need to be an authenticated user?**

No. Anyone who can access a computer through a network could carry out this attack.

**Can a TCP attack be blocked at the firewall?**

An administrator could block TCP port 111 on the firewall and block a remote user from sending malformed packets to a RPC server inside the firewall.

**Is there any way to recover from the denial of service?**

The administrator would normally only need to restart the application. There may be cases where the specific application might require an administrator to reboot the server.

**What does the patch do?**

The patch eliminates the vulnerability by properly checking inputs to the RPC server.

**Denial of service by sending an invalid RPC request(CAN-2002-1141):**

**What's the scope of this vulnerability?**

The third vulnerability is an RPC implementation error. An application using the Sun RPC library does not properly check the size of client TCP requests. This could result in a denial of service to a server application using the Sun RPC library. The RPC library expects client TCP requests to specify the size of the record that follows. Because there is a flaw in the way RPC detects client packets, an attacker could send a malformed RPC request to the RPC server from a remote machine and cause the server to fail by not servicing any further client requests

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The RPC library expects client TCP requests to be broken how into fragments of variable sizes. Because there is a flaw in the way the RPC library performs input validation on the fragmented client packets, an attacker could cause the server to enter a state from which it could not handle client requests.

**What could this vulnerability enable an attacker to do?**

An attacker could create a denial of service for client requests to the RPC server and cause the server to fail.

**How could an attacker exploit this vulnerability?**

An attacker could write a program that invoked the RPC implementation error by sending malformed data packets to the RPC server.

**Does the attacker need to be an authenticated user?**

No. Anyone who can access a computer through a network could carry out this attack.

**Can a TCP attack be blocked at the firewall?**

An administrator could block TCP port 111 on the firewall and block a remote user from sending malformed packets to a RPC server inside the firewall.

**Is there any way to recover from the denial of service?**

The administrator would normally only need to restart the application. There may be cases where the specific application might require an administrator to reboot the server.

**What does the patch do?**

The patch corrects the RPC implementation error by detecting invalid client packets and refusing to service them.
