{
  "CVE-2002-0391": {
    "Description": "The xdr_array() function in Sun's RPC library contains an integer overflow that can lead to improperly sized dynamic memory allocation. Subsequent problems like buffer overflows may result.",
    "Root cause": "Integer overflow in the xdr_array() function when calculating the size of the memory to allocate for an array.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow",
      "Heap buffer overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code on a target system with superuser privileges, cause denial of service, or disclose sensitive information.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Sending malicious RPC requests to a vulnerable server."
    ],
    "Required capabilities": [
      "Ability to send RPC requests",
        "Knowledge of vulnerable RPC services"
    ],
    "Additional Information": "The vulnerability is present in multiple vendor implementations of Sun RPC libraries. Applications that use xdr_array() with unbounded arrays are more likely to be vulnerable. Vulnerable programs include amd/amq and rusers client, various OpenAFS servers, and MIT Kerberos admin systems. Patches may require recompilation of statically linked applications."
