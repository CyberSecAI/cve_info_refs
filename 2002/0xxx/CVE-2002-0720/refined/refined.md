- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Network Connection Manager (NCM) in Windows 2000 allows unprivileged users to configure the handler routine that is executed when a new network connection is established. This handler routine, intended to run in the user's security context, can be manipulated to run in the LocalSystem context due to a flaw.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Privilege escalation. The vulnerability lies in the fact that an unprivileged user can specify a custom handler routine for the NCM which executes with LocalSystem privileges instead of the user's privileges.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability can gain complete control over the system. This includes the ability to take any action on the machine, such as adding, deleting, or modifying data, creating or deleting user accounts, and adding accounts to the local administrators group.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to be able to log onto the system interactively. The attacker would then need to install a custom handler routine for the NCM, followed by creating a network connection to trigger the execution of the malicious handler with elevated privileges.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have the ability to log onto the system interactively, and requires significant technical expertise to craft the malicious handler routine and perform the required configurations.
