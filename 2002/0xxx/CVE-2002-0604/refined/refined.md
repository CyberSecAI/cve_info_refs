Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities found in the Snapgear Lite+ Firewall:

**Root Cause of Vulnerabilities:**
The root cause across all issues stems from improper handling of malicious traffic, leading to resource exhaustion or software crashes when the firewall is subjected to specific types of attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **HTTP:** The firewall crashes when a large number of HTTP connections (50) are opened and cycled, when external web management is enabled. In version 1.5.4, only web management crashes, but the underlying issue is an inability to handle a high number of connections.
*   **PPTP:** Similarly, a large number of PPTP connections (50) can cause the firewall to crash if PPTP is enabled.
*   **IPSEC:** Sending a 0-length UDP packet to UDP port 500 causes the IPSEC component to exit, effectively disabling it.
*   **IP-OPTIONS:** Sending a stream of approximately 7000 packets with malformed IP options results in a complete firewall crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
All of the described issues lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition:
*   The firewall ceases to function, disrupting network connectivity and security.
*   In the case of the HTTP exploit, web management can crash.
*   For the IPSEC exploit, IPSEC functionality is disabled.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP and PPTP:** Attacker sends a high number of connections to the exposed HTTP or PPTP ports of the firewall.
*   **IPSEC:** Attacker sends a specially crafted UDP packet to port 500.
*  **IP-OPTIONS:** An attacker sends a stream of packets with malformed IP options. This stream can originate from inside the network or from external sources.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   For HTTP and PPTP exploits, the attacker needs to be able to establish network connections to the firewall's exposed ports.
*   For the IPSEC exploit, the attacker needs to be able to send UDP packets to port 500 of the firewall.
*   For the IP-OPTIONS exploit, the attacker needs to be able to send a stream of packets to the firewall. This could be from within the network, or externally.
*   No special authentication or privileges are mentioned as necessary to perform these attacks.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerabilities were present in Snapgear Lite+ versions 1.5.3 and 1.5.4 (some issues). Version 1.6.0 was released to correct them.
*   The advisory provides a clear description of how to reproduce each issue.
*   The vendor was notified and released a patch.
