    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2002-0147",
      "source": "docs.microsoft.com_b43d8ca3_20250124_163700.html",
      "root_cause": "A handling error in the allocation of buffers for data transfers within the ASP data transfer mechanism. This vulnerability is related to the chunked encoding transfer vulnerability (CAN-2002-0079) but lies elsewhere within the ASP data transfer mechanism.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Buffer Overflow"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could overrun heap memory, leading to either a denial of service by causing the IIS service to fail or potentially allowing arbitrary code execution on the server.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Specially crafted HTTP request with malformed data transfer operation."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send a request to the server. This requires network access to the server."
    },

      "cve_id": "CVE-2002-0147",
      "source": "www.kb.cert.org_4fd38729_20250124_163700.html",
       "root_cause": "Arithmetic error in how IIS calculates the size of a buffer for incoming chunked data, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow. This error prevents IIS from placing real limits on chunk size, allowing for large memory overwrites.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Heap-based Buffer Overflow",
         "Incorrect buffer size calculation"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can cause a denial of service by crashing the IIS server or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the ASP ISAPI extension (ASP.DLL). This could result in full administrative control on IIS 4.0 or the privileges of the IWAM_computername account on IIS 5.0 and 5.1.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Sending specially crafted requests to an IIS server."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs network access to the server and the ability to send HTTP requests."
    }
