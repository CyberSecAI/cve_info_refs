Guardent Client Advisory
Multiple wordtrans-web Vulnerabilities

September 6th, 2002

Summary:

Guardent has discovered vulnerabilities in the wordtrans-web package.  The
vulnerabilities allow for remote execution of arbitrary code under the
privileges of user running the webserver and a cross-site scripting
vulnerability.

Scope:

Guardent has verified that all versions prior to and including the current
development version of wordtrans-1.1pre9 are vulnerable.

The current distribution of Red Hat Linux 7.3 is vulnerable.
Earlier versions of Red Hat Linux do not contain the vulnerable package.

The Debian wordtrans-web package version 1.0beta-2-2.4 in unstable is
vulnerable.  Note that this package is not present in the stable release,
Debian 3.0 (woody).

Description:

The wordtrans-web package provides an interface to query multilingual
dictionaries via a web browser.  Improper input validation allows for the
execution of arbitrary code or injection of cross-site scripting code by
passing in unexpected parameters to the wordtrans.php script.  The
wordtrans.php script in turn executes the "wordtrans" binary unsafely with
the unexpected parameters.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name CAN-2002-0837 to this issue.

Detection:

Red Hat Linux administrators are encouraged to verify the presence and
version of their wordtrans-web package using the
command:
     rpm -qi wordtrans-web

Guardent has provided the following snort signature to assist users in
detecting accesses of the vulnerable wordtrans-web component.

alert tcp $EXTERNAL_NET any -> $WEB_SERVERS 80 (msg:"WEB-MISC wordtrans-web
access"; flags:A+; uricontent:"/wordtrans.php"; nocase;
classtype:attempted-recon; sid:1082322; rev:1;)

Clients of Guardent's Security Defense Appliance for Managed Intrusion
Detection Security Services are already being monitored for abuses of this
vulnerability.

Recommendations:

Users of the Red Hat Network can update their systems using the 'up2date'
tool.

Users of Debian can download the fixed wordtrans-web package version
1.0beta2-2.5 from <http://packages.debian.org/wordtrans-web>

Guardent has provided the following workarounds for popular versions of the
wordtrans-web package.  These workarounds are not meant to be a substitute
for recommended vendor packages.

The following patch is for version wordtrans-1.1pre8.php:

*** wordtrans-1.1pre8.php.old
- --- wordtrans-1.1pre8.php
***************
*** 15,20 ****
- --- 15,21 ----
  <head>
  <title>
  <?
+ $dict=ereg_replace("[^[:alnum:]-]","",$dict);
  if ($word == "") {
        if ($lang == "es")
                echo "Interfaz Web de Wordtrans";

The following patch is for version wordtrans-1.1pre9.php:

*** wordtrans-1.1pre9.php.old
- --- wordtrans-1.1pre9.php
***************
*** 20,25 ****
- --- 20,26 ----
  <head>
  <title>
  <?
+ $dict=ereg_replace("[^[:alnum:]-]","",$dict);
  if ($word == "") {
        if ($lang == "es")
                echo "Interfaz Web de Wordtrans";
