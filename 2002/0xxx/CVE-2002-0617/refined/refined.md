The provided content is a Microsoft Security Bulletin (MS02-031) that describes multiple vulnerabilities, one of which is related to CVE-2002-0617.

**CVE-2002-0617 relates to the "Hyperlinked Excel Workbook Macro Bypass" vulnerability.**

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability arises from a flaw in how Excel handles macros within a workbook when that workbook is opened through a hyperlink associated with a drawing shape in another workbook. When the destination workbook is opened in this manner, the Macro Security Model fails to detect the presence of macros.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The primary weakness is the failure of the Excel Macro Security Model to recognize and properly handle macros in a workbook opened through a hyperlink on a drawing shape. This bypass allows autoexecute macros in the destination workbook to run automatically without any security restrictions.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to run arbitrary macro code on the user's system, bypassing the intended security restrictions.  Because macros can perform any action the user can, the attacker could potentially add, change, or delete data, interact with websites, or alter security settings.

*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack requires two Excel workbooks: a source workbook containing a drawing shape with a hyperlink, and a destination workbook containing malicious autoexecute macros.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to:
    1.  Create a source Excel workbook with a drawing shape containing a hyperlink that points to a second (malicious) workbook.
    2.  Create a malicious destination workbook containing auto-execute macros.
    3.  Make the destination workbook accessible to the victim (either locally or via a network share).
    4.  Entice the user to open the source workbook and click on the hyperlinked drawing shape.

*   **Additional details**: The document clarifies that this vulnerability specifically occurs when the destination workbook is opened through a hyperlink on a drawing shape, and not when opened via other means.

The document also notes that this vulnerability is rated as **Low** severity for client systems.
