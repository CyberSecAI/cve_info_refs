Thanks for the report!

Here's a patch relative to fileutils-4.1.6

        Don't allow a malicious user to trick another user's rm process into
        removing unintended files.  In one scenario, if root is removing a
        hierarchy that is writable by the malicious user, that user may trick
        root into removing all of `/'.  Reported by Wojciech Purczynski.

        * src/remove.c (remove_dir): After chdir `..', call lstat to get the
        dev/inode of "." and fail if they aren't the same as the old numbers.
        (remove_cwd_entries): New parameter, `cwd_dev_ino'.
        (remove_dir): Likewise.
        (rm): Likewise.
        Adjust all callers.
        * src/mv.c (do_move): The first time we resort to copy/remove,
        call lstat `.' to get the device/inode numbers now required for rm.
        * src/rm.c (main): Call lstat `.' to get the device/inode numbers
        now required for rm.
        * src/remove.h (struct dev_ino): Declare new type.
        (rm): Add a parameter to the prototype.
