Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2002-0662:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `scrollkeeper-get-cl` program creates temporary files in the `/tmp` directory using predictable filenames.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Temporary File Creation:** The program creates temporary files with guessable names in `/tmp`.
- **Lack of Security Checks:** There are no security checks when the content list is written to these temp files.
- **File Overwriting:** An attacker can overwrite existing files in the `/tmp` directory, or create new files with arbitrary names due to insecure temp file handling.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Local Privilege Escalation:** An attacker with local access can exploit this vulnerability to overwrite or create files as another user, potentially gaining elevated privileges.
- **Arbitrary File Creation/Overwrite:** An attacker can create arbitrary files in the system, and possibly overwrite existing files as the user running the vulnerable application, resulting in potential compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:**  The attacker needs local access to the system.
- **Gnome Session/Nautilus Browser:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user logs into a Gnome session as `scrollkeeper` is automatically called. Also, starting the Nautilus browser can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have local access to a vulnerable system running the affected `scrollkeeper` versions.
- The attacker needs to be able to create symlinks or files in `/tmp`.
- Knowledge of `scrollkeeper`'s temporary filename generation scheme is necessary to predict filenames.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability occurs because the `scrollkeeper-get-cl` program cycles through a limited set of temp filenames ( `/tmp/scrollkeeper-tempfile.{0,1,2,3,4}`).
- The program checks if a file exists by calling `stat()` instead of `lstat()`. This allows a symlink pointing to a non-existent file to be considered an empty slot, which can be exploited by creating a symlink pointing to a file the attacker wants to influence, gaining control over what will be written to that specific slot.
- The vulnerability can be exploited if the user runs the X Window System as root.
- The vulnerability is assigned the name CAN-2002-0662 (now CVE-2002-0662).

**Affected Versions:**
- `scrollkeeper` versions 0.3.11 and earlier are vulnerable. Specific mention is made of 0.3.4.

**Mitigation:**
- Upgrade to a patched version of `scrollkeeper` to resolve the vulnerability.
