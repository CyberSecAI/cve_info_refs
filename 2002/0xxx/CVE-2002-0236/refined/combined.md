Several Lucent VitalSuite Customers have advised us that data published by
Security Focus and DefenseOne Command Center (which we believe is operated
by the Meta Security Group) indicates that certain Lucent VitalSuite
software products contain a security vulnerability.

We have analyzed that information and provided a software patch that we
believe will assist customers in addressing this issue; we also prepared the
attached Security Bulletin to advise them of Lucent recommendations and
actions we have taken.

Since we believe you are also communicating with our customers on this
matter, we have provided you a copy of the same bulletin.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.
