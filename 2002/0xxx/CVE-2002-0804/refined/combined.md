| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=129466#c0)• 23 years ago |
|  | |

The logincookies table has a hostname field. This is obtained from the webserver
via REMOTE\_HOST env variable. The webserver gets this by doing a reverse DNS
lookup. Therefore an attacker which can provide reverse dns for their IP can
bypass the IP address checks by providing the hostname of the user they want to
spoof.
Hostname lookups are disabled by default in apache, so this won't affect most
people, which is why if you look at your logincookies table you'll see ip
addresses. Its still an attack, though, and should be fixed for 2.16.
I've been looking for an excuse to get [bug 20122](/show_bug.cgi?id=20122 "RESOLVED FIXED - Bugzilla requires new login if IP changes") in for 2.16, and since fixing
this bug is about 2/3 of the work I'll use this. ;)
An open question which I was thinking about before I realised the security
issues: REMOTE\_ADDR can be ipv4 or ipv6. If its ipv4, then the field is set to
varchar(15) NOT NULL (or int4 NOT NULL) and we're done. If its ipv6, the field
has to be larger. (I don't plan on supporting the netmask stuff for ipv6). If we
want to validate that the string given by the server is actually an IP, then we
have to drag in some more modules.
Thoughts?

DELETE FROM logincookies (or TRUNCATE TABLE logincookies) seems to reset the
primary key count, and then the next entry inserts at 0. Does this matter?
DELETE FROM logincookies where cookie>0 keeps it as is.
Anyone know why that happens?

This was way easier than I thought, and the ipv4 vs 6 issues don't come into
this anyway. (Whoever thought of using base85 (no, thats not a typo) to
represent ip addresses...)
I don't think there is risk to it, and it is a security bug.

<justdave> heck yes, we want that
marking r=gerv from his comment
I'll take better suggestions for a field name, though. ip implies address in
this context, and acceptable\_source isn't really what I want.
Any name needs to allow for the network mask I want (else we'll just have to
have this discussion again later), so src\_addr is out.

The reason I said 'no schema change' was because this is technically a stable
release. Just call it .hostname, and comment that 2.16 changes the column name
to be more correct.
What do others think?

Backported patch for BUGZILLA-2\_14\_1-BRANCH
bbaetz is right - there's no real need to change the schema. However, if we
don't, then we don't know when to do:
$dbh->do("DELETE FROM logincookies");
So the only option would be to execute this every time checksetup runs, which
would suck.
So, unless anyone can think of a better idea, I think we need to change the
schema.

So, the problem is we don't want to make the schema change, but we still want to
make the bug update by storing IPs instead of hostnames, but we have to delete
all the logincookies which contain host names at least \*once\* during the
upgrade, right?
I assume checksetup.pl can query the database while it's running, yes?
We could put an SQL check in there to check for entries in the logincookies
table that contain any text in the "hostname" column; if there's any text (i.e.
a hostname), then run the DELETE to flush everything out; if there's only IPs,
then don't.
Does that sound like it would that give us the DELETE we need during the install
of the patch, but not require a DELET everytime checksetup is run?

Eww. The delete was only really needed to tidy things up. If a system has
HostnameLookups enabled in their apache config, then those entries will be
invalid, and they'll be cleaned out in three day's time anyway. The only
possible security hole after applying this patch would be if this option was
enabled, AND the reverse lookup for a real IP was another IP. In that case, if
you also had their cookie, you could pretend to be from that IP.
Note that its teh real IP which has to have that funny resolution is the person
you're trying to impersonate, not you, so the chances of this are about zero.
Without this patch, it can be you playing with the reverse lookup, which is why
this is a security hole.
Lets forget the deletion, I think.

bbaetz's analysis seems to be correct, but my gut tells me to just invalidate
the entries.
This is a security patch, and while the analysis seems valid, the problem with
security patches is that sometimes there are a lot of unknowns. For instance,
vendors don't always follow the RFCs (a situation could arise where one IP
reverses to a string that has the format of another IP, even though it's
probably against the DNS RFC) and other such craziness exists.
All in all, I think it's better to be safe than get a report a couple weeks
later that someone's BZ installation got hacked because they're using a funky
version of WinNT and they had some weird option setup and we missed something.
I'll attach a new version of the 2\_14\_1-BRANCH patch for comment/review.

Can't you do the matching as part of the select? That will take \_ages\_ to run on
somewhere like bmo. What about deleting if there is \_anything\_ which doesn't
start with [1-9]? The case of all reverse IPs starting with numbers is really
really inprobable, although I suppose its possible if an installation was local
to an organisation. Can we just use the regexp in the search? Do an EXPLAIN on
it, and see how long it takes, maybe?
Maybe we should just do the schema change anyway?

Backported patch, v.2
I'd go for that.

Backported patch, v.2
Changed my mind. Bbaetz is right. We need to either do something faster, or
just make the schema change anyway.

--just like v2, except it puts the regex query in the SQL; we should probably
test this SQL if we choose this patch; I ran it on a mysql server I'm running
(to check against IP addresses, not hostnames) and it worked, but that doesn't
prove it's right (just proves it's not wrong).

I really have no preference on which patch goes in... I don't see that much risk
in changing the schema (as long as we're sure that the code that does that isn't
buggy), but I can see how some people might be, so the other version that checks
the entries in the table for hostnames should work too.
My vote goes for the backported v3 patch, but as I said I don't really care; you
can now choose between the v3 patch and the v1 patch depending on what you
decide; let me know, and I'll check either in.

As much as I hate to make a schema change on a "stable" branch, NOT doing so
means they're going to lose all their stored cookies again if they upgrade to
2.16 later. I'd just as soon go ahead and make the schema change. The
necessity of it for the security fix is a good enough excuse.

Mmm... good point.
I've obsoleted the patch(es) which didn't contain the schema change, which
leaves the first version of the patch; reviews?
A 2.14.2 -> 2.16 upgrade is going to incur other schema changes (dropping
cryptedpassword in logincookies, for one) anyway, but I guess that's to be expected.
We actually could get around the issue by putting a rename column statement in
the 2.16 checksetup, but that could get confusing and messy... it's probably
easier to bite the bullet and just update the schema on the stable branch.

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.
