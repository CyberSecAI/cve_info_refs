Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is that web browsers, specifically Internet Explorer and Opera, allow HTML forms to be submitted to non-HTTP services. These non-HTTP services might echo back the submitted information. The browser then renders this echoed information as HTML, irrespective of the original protocol.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Form Submission to Non-HTTP Services:** The core weakness is the browser's ability to submit forms to non-HTTP services, which can lead to unexpected behaviors due to a lack of protocol handling.
*   **Unvalidated Echoed Response:** The browsers treat the echoed data from non-HTTP services as valid HTML and render it without proper validation or sanitization. This opens up a way for injecting malicious HTML or JavaScript into a victim's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cookie Stealing:** A malicious user can craft a form that, when submitted to a vulnerable non-HTTP service, causes the service to echo back JavaScript code that steals cookies for the target domain.
*  **Internal Network Penetration:** This can be extended for other malicious actions as it also allows penetration of internal networks.
*   **Arbitrary Actions via JavaScript Injection:** The vulnerability allows for the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code, leading to a range of potential attacks beyond just cookie theft.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Form Creation:** An attacker creates a specially crafted HTML form.
*   **Form Submission:** The form is submitted by the victim through either:
    *   **Automated Scripting:** Utilizing Active Scripting (e.g., Javascript) to automatically submit the form on the victimâ€™s browser.
    *   **Social Engineering:** Deceiving the victim into manually submitting the form.
*   **Non-HTTP Service Interaction:** The form is submitted to a non-HTTP service that echoes back the submitted information.
*   **JavaScript Injection & Execution:** The browser interprets the echoed data as HTML and executes the injected JavaScript, granting control to the attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Create Malicious HTML Forms:** The attacker needs to craft malicious HTML forms.
*   **Means to Deliver the Form:** The attacker needs to either lure the victim to a webpage or application controlled by them or be able to inject a form into a vulnerable website.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Non-HTTP Service:** The attacker needs to know how to target the non-HTTP service, which acts as a vector to reflect the malicious javascript.

The advisory mentions that the vulnerability affects Internet Explorer 6 and older, and Opera 6.0 and older versions. It also notes that Microsoft and Opera were informed and are working on a fix. There's also a link provided to an example of an exploit which can steal cookies.
