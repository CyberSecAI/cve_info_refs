Web:

<http://eyeonsecurity.net/papers/> - Extended HTML Form Attack

Background.

Many web browsers such as Internet Explorer allow forms to be submitted to
non-HTTP services. Some non-HTTP
services echo back the information sent, and the web browser renders the
echo as an HTML page, regardless
of the protocol behind the service.

Problem.

A malicious user can create a form which is submitted by the victim
(automatically using Active Scripting
or manually using Social Engineering). This form can cause a non-HTTP
service to echo back JavaScript commands
which in turn allow the malicious user to steal the cookie for that domain.
There are more uses for this attack, other than just stealing cookies.

Exploit Example.
