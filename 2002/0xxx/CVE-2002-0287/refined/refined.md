- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The pforum application relies on PHP's `magic_quotes_gpc` feature to sanitize user inputs for SQL queries. If `magic_quotes_gpc` is disabled in the PHP configuration, the application becomes vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection vulnerability in login and change password forms.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can log in as any user, including administrators, without knowing the correct password. They can also change any user's password. This can lead to complete board takeovers, including deleting boards.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through the web interface. Specifically, by manipulating the username field in the login form, or the ID field in the change password form.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application and have knowledge of SQL injection techniques. The attacker does not need any prior knowledge of the targeted system's user credentials.
