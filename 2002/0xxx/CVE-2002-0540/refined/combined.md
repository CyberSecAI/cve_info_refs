## Nortel Networks CVX 1800 discloses privileged information

#### Vulnerability Note VU#403315

Original Release Date: 2002-05-16 | Last Revised: 2004-01-22

---

### Overview

The Nortel Networks [CVX 1800 Multi-Service Access Switch](http://www.nortelnetworks.com/products/01/cvx/cvx_1800/index.html) discloses privileged information.

### Description

| The CVX 1800 Multi-Service Access Switch is a large modem bank typically used by large carriers and ISP's. When the CVX 1800 is queried with a specially crafted snmpwalk, it will respond with all usernames and passwords for administrator accounts on the vulnerable CVX 1800. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker can gain access to sensitive information such as administrator usernames and passwords. The attacker could then use this information to make unauthorized configuration changes to the CVX 1800. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Upgrade the software on the CVX 1800 to 3.6.3P25. |
| --- |

| If the software cannot be upgraded immediately, consider changing the SNMP community string to something other than it's default value of public. |
