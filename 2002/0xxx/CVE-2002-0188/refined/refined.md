The provided document is a Microsoft Security Bulletin (MS02-023) detailing a cumulative patch for Internet Explorer that addresses six newly discovered vulnerabilities, including the one referenced by CVE-2002-0188.

**CVE-2002-0188 Details (Content Disposition Variant):**

*   **Root Cause:** This is a variant of the "Content-Disposition" vulnerability previously discussed in MS01-058, which arises from improper handling of malformed Content-Disposition and Content-Type headers in downloadable files. The vulnerability occurs when IE incorrectly determines that a file is safe for automatic handling when it is actually executable content.

*   **Weakness:** The primary weakness lies in how IE handles malformed "Content-Disposition" and "Content-Type" headers and the fact that some applications, upon encountering malformed data, hand it back to the operating system instead of raising an error. This bypasses IE's intended checks, enabling malicious code execution.

*   **Impact:** An attacker could execute arbitrary code on the user's system. The code would run with the same permissions as the user.

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker could host a malformed executable file on a server and create a specially crafted web page to initiate its download by the target. The attacker would either need to post the malicious web page on a server or send it via HTML email.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to:
    *   Host a malicious executable file on a server.
    *   Craft a web page with a malformed Content-Disposition and Content-Type header to trigger the vulnerability.
    *   Have the target visit the malicious website or open the malicious email.
    *   Know that the target has a specific application installed that, when passed malformed data, returns it to the operating system instead of raising an error.

**Additional Notes:**

*   This is one of two new variants of the "Content Disposition" vulnerability addressed in this bulletin.
*   This variant requires a specific condition to be exploitable; the registered application for the file type must pass the malformed content back to the operating system instead of handling the error itself.
* The patch ensures that proper checking is instituted for spoofed Content-Disposition and Content-Type headers.
*  The bulletin includes detailed information on other vulnerabilities that are addressed in the same patch.
