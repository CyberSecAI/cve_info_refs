The content describes three vulnerabilities in Cobalt RAQ 4 Server Management: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Directory Traversal, and Denial of Service (DoS).

**a) Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

*   **Root Cause:** The `service.cgi` and `alert.cgi` scripts do not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing injection of arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of input validation and output encoding.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into web pages, potentially leading to cookie theft, session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions on the user's browser.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending crafted URLs containing malicious JavaScript or HTML code to the vulnerable CGI scripts, specifically `service.cgi` and `alert.cgi` using the `service` parameter.
*   **Required Capabilities:**  The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the web server.

**b) Directory Traversal**

*   **Root Cause:** The application allows access to files outside the intended web directory using `../` sequences in the URL.
*   **Weaknesses:** Inadequate input validation.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can access sensitive files, such as configuration files (`.htaccess`) or user profiles. In the example provided, the attacker can access an `.htaccess` file containing administrator credentials.
*   **Attack Vector:** Constructing URLs that use `../` to move up the directory tree and access sensitive files.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the web server.

**c) Denial of Service (DoS)**

*   **Root Cause:** Sending a very long URL to the `service.cgi` script causes a server crash.
*   **Weaknesses:** The application does not handle excessively long URLs properly.
*   **Impact:** The server crashes, and the service becomes unavailable, requiring an administrator restart.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a long string of characters as a value to the `service` parameter in `service.cgi`.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the web server. The included Perl script automates sending the long string.

The document provides detailed examples of exploits for each vulnerability and a proof-of-concept Perl script for the DoS attack. It also includes a workaround to delete the vulnerable cgi scripts.
