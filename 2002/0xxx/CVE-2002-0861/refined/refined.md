Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2002-0861:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability arises from the `Copy()` and `Paste()` methods within the Spreadsheet component of Microsoft Office Web Components (OWC) failing to respect the "Allow paste operations via script" security setting in Internet Explorer (IE).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Bypassed Security Setting:** The core issue is the circumvention of the IE security setting designed to restrict programmatic access to the clipboard. Even when this setting is explicitly disabled by the user, the OWC `Copy()` and `Paste()` methods still allow clipboard manipulation via script.
*   **Unrestricted Clipboard Access:** The vulnerability allows a web page to read and write to the Windows clipboard without user consent, potentially exposing sensitive data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could read any data currently present in the user's clipboard, which could include passwords, confidential text, or other sensitive information.
*   **Clipboard Manipulation:** An attacker can also use this to write data into the clipboard.
*   **Circumvention of Security Policy:** It bypasses the intended security mechanisms implemented by IE.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web-based attack:** By hosting a malicious web page that uses the vulnerable OWC methods, attackers can attempt to exploit the vulnerability when a user visits the site.
*   **HTML email attack:** Attackers can embed the malicious script in an HTML email, which will be executed when the user views the email.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Web page/HTML email creation:** The attacker needs to be able to create a web page containing the malicious script or an HTML email.
*   **User interaction:** The user must either visit the attacker's web page or open the malicious email.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects both OWC 9 (Office 2000) and OWC 10 (Office XP).
*   The provided proof-of-concept code demonstrates how to read clipboard contents and write data to the clipboard using OWC's spreadsheet component.
*   The advisory suggests disabling ActiveX controls as a temporary mitigation.
*   The Microsoft Security Bulletin MS02-044 identifies this vulnerability as CAN-2002-0861.
*   The bulletin also mentions that this vulnerability does not present a threat to the default installation, as the security setting in question is not enabled by default.
