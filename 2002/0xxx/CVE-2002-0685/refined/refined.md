Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   A buffer overflow exists in the NAI PGP Outlook plug-in when processing emails. Specifically, the message decoding functionality is vulnerable to manipulation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The core issue is a buffer overflow vulnerability in the PGP Outlook plug-in's email processing. This occurs when the plug-in receives and decodes a specially crafted email.
*   **Heap Corruption:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to overwrite heap memory structures used by the PGP plug-in.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The code executes within the context of the user running the PGP Outlook plug-in, granting the attacker the same privileges. This could potentially allow reading sensitive data.
*   **System Compromise:** The vulnerability can lead to the complete compromise of the target machine.
*   **Compromised Encrypted Communications:** The attacker can potentially compromise PGP encrypted communications.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Email:** The attack vector is a specially crafted email. The malicious code executes simply by selecting/viewing the malicious email. Opening attachments is NOT required.
*   **Network:** Because of the nature of SMTP protocol, this vulnerability can be exploited anonymously.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Send Emails:** The attacker needs to be able to send emails to the victim.
*   **Understanding of Heap Memory:** The attacker needs to understand how the PGP plug-in utilizes heap memory.
*   **Crafting a Malicious Email:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malformed email that triggers the buffer overflow and allows for the execution of malicious code.

**Technical Details of Exploitation:**

*   The exploit works by overwriting a section of heap memory with addresses of an unused section in the PEB (Process Environment Block).
*   This allows the attacker to manipulate the email parsing process, and eventually reach a function pointer list.
*   By overwriting the function pointer list, the attacker can control a function call.
*   The attacker overwrites this with the address of `SetUnhandledExceptionFilter()` IAT entry, redirecting execution to the attacker controlled address.
*   After this function returns, the program will eventually call the `DefaultExceptionFilter`, which the attacker has also modified, leading to code execution.

**Affected Systems:**
* NAI PGP Desktop Security 7.0.4
* NAI PGP Personal Security 7.0.3
* NAI PGP Freeware 7.0.3

**Patch Information:**
*   The vendor has released a patch to protect against this flaw and can be downloaded from: <http://www.nai.com/naicommon/download/upgrade/patches/patch-pgphotfix.asp>
