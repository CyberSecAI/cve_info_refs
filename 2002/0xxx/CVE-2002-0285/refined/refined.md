- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Outlook incorrectly interprets Carriage Return characters (0x0d or <CR>) in message headers as Carriage Return/Line Feed combinations (0x0d 0x0a or <CRLF>), which are used to delimit the end of headers.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper handling of <CR> characters in message headers.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can craft a message with malicious content or attachments that are not detected by content scanning Mail Transfer Agents (MTAs). Outlook parses the message content and attachments prematurely due to the incorrect interpretation of headers, leading to the execution of malicious attachments that should have been blocked.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending specially crafted emails with headers containing <CR> characters before the attachment data or MIME delimiters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send emails to a vulnerable Outlook client. The attacker needs to craft a malicious email with specific formatting to exploit the vulnerability. The vulnerability can be triggered through email clients that forward email without sanitizing the headers.
