The provided content is related to CVE-2002-0031.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** A buffer overflow exists in the URI handler of Yahoo! Messenger.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   A shared buffer used by parameter functions ("getimv", "sendim", "message", "addview", "adduser", "call", and "chat") is vulnerable to a buffer overflow.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Exploitation could lead to a denial-of-service condition (application crash).
*   More critically, the buffer overflow can be exploited to execute arbitrary code on the local system with the privileges of the current user.

**Attack vectors:**
*   A malicious URI can be sent by another Yahoo! Messenger user.
*   A malicious URI can be embedded in a website.
*   A malicious URI can be included in an HTML-renderable email message.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker can be remote.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send or embed a crafted URI to a vulnerable Yahoo! Messenger client.
