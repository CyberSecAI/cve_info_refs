Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2002-0079:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- An arithmetic error exists in the way Microsoft IIS calculates the buffer size needed to hold a chunk of data during chunked encoding transfers. The incorrect calculation leads to a heap-based buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap-Based Buffer Overflow:**  The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow, which occurs when data is written beyond the allocated buffer on the heap. The arithmetic error allows IIS to allocate a buffer that is too small to hold the incoming data chunk.
- **Lack of Size Limits:** The arithmetic error prevents IIS from properly limiting the size of the data chunk that can be sent, allowing attackers to send overly large chunks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Code Execution:** An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code on the server with the privileges of the ASP ISAPI extension (asp.dll).
  -  On IIS 4.0, this grants full administrative control.
  - On IIS 5.0, it grants the privileges of the IWAM_*computername* account, which has fewer privileges but can still be used to cause significant damage and possibly gain further access.
- **Denial of Service:** Exploiting the vulnerability can cause the IIS service to fail, leading to a denial of service.
- **Memory Corruption:** An attacker can overwrite significant portions of system memory indiscriminately due to the lack of size limits on the chunk.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending a specially crafted HTTP request with a chunked encoding transfer.
- The request must be directed to an IIS server with Active Server Pages (ASP) enabled.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to a vulnerable IIS server.
- No specific prior authentication is required beyond being able to establish a web session.

**Additional Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability lies in the ASP ISAPI extension (asp.dll), which handles chunked encoding data transfers.
- The chunked encoding mechanism is used to transfer variable-sized data from web clients to web servers.
- The error results in the server miscalculating the necessary buffer size for incoming data chunks.
- The attacker can overwrite large portions of system memory indiscriminately, potentially leading to code execution.
- The IIS Lockdown Tool can help mitigate this vulnerability by disabling ASP (version 1.0) or if the "Static Web Server" role is selected (version 2.1).
- URLScan tool can be configured to block chunked encoding requests.

**Mitigating Factors:**

- Disabling ASP will mitigate the vulnerability
- Use of the IIS Lockdown Tool and URLScan tool can prevent exploitation.
