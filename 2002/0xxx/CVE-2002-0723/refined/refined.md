The provided document is a Microsoft Security Bulletin (MS02-047) describing a cumulative patch for Internet Explorer that addresses six vulnerabilities. One of these vulnerabilities is related to CVE-2002-0723.

**Vulnerability:** Cross Domain Verification in Object Tag

*   **Root Cause:** Improper domain verification when the `<object>` tag is used in a specific manner.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The vulnerability allows a malicious website to bypass the cross-domain security model in Internet Explorer.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Reading Local Files:** An attacker can read files on the user's local file system that can be rendered within a browser (e.g., HTML, image, and text files).
    *   **Executing Local Programs:** An attacker can invoke executable files on the user's local system. However, the attacker cannot pass parameters to the executable.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The primary attack vector is a malicious web page with a specially crafted `<object>` tag.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to host or send a malicious web page to the victim.
    *   The attacker needs to know or guess the full path and filename of the local resource they wish to access or execute.
*   **Additional Details:**
    *   The vulnerability is similar in scope to the "Frame Domain Verification" vulnerability (MS02-005) and the "Local Executable Invocation via Object tag" vulnerability (MS02-015), though the underlying flaws differ.
    *   The vulnerability only affects Internet Explorer 5.5 and 6.0. IE 5.01 is not affected.

This document provides more details than the official CVE description which simply states: "Cross-site scripting vulnerability in Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.5 and 6.0 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by using the OBJECT tag to invoke a program on the local computer."
