Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in the marc.info content, which corresponds to CVE-2002-0871:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   File descriptors for the signal pipe, introduced in xinetd version 2.3.4, are leaked into services started by xinetd.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **File Descriptor Leak:** The core issue is that xinetd improperly handles file descriptors, specifically those associated with the signal pipe. These descriptors should be internal to xinetd, but they are passed to child processes (services) spawned by xinetd.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can use the leaked file descriptors to communicate with xinetd directly. This leads to a crash of the xinetd daemon, effectively causing a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Exploiting Leaked File Descriptors:** The attack vector involves using the leaked file descriptors to send malicious input or commands directly to the xinetd process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to interact with a service started by xinetd that has inherited these file descriptors.
*   No specific network location or privilege is mentioned, however, it does imply that the attacker has a user account on the system able to interact with the xinetd service.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was identified by Solar Designer.
*   The vulnerable versions include xinetd 2.3.5 and earlier.
*   The fix involves updating to xinetd version 2.3.7 or later.
*   The Gentoo Security Announcement (GLSA) specifically mentions that only the x86 architecture had the updated package available at the time of the announcement, with sparc and ppc to follow after testing.
