Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2002-0721:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from inappropriately weak permissions on certain extended stored procedures in Microsoft SQL Server 7.0 and 2000. These procedures have the ability to reconnect to the database as the SQL Server service account.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Inappropriate Permissions:** Some extended stored procedures have overly permissive access controls, allowing non-privileged users to execute them.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By exploiting these procedures, an attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries with the elevated privileges of the SQL Server service account.
*   **Arbitrary Query Execution:** The vulnerable extended stored procedures allow execution of arbitrary SQL queries, expanding the potential for malicious actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Administrative Access:** Successful exploitation grants the attacker administrative-level access to the SQL Server database.
*   **Data Manipulation:** An attacker can add, change, or delete data within the database.
*  **System Compromise:** Depending on the configuration of the SQL Server service account, the attacker might be able to perform actions on the operating system, potentially leading to full system compromise, including: reconfiguring the OS, installing new software, or reformatting the hard drive.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Direct Query Execution:** An attacker could directly construct and execute a malicious query that calls one of the vulnerable extended stored procedures.
*  **Indirect Query Exploitation:** An attacker could exploit existing queries, such as those used by a web-based application, by providing malformed parameters to call the vulnerable stored procedures. This is also possible by submitting a job to the SQL Agent.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Database Access:** The attacker needs to have access to the database, either through a direct SQL login or through Windows Authentication (or indirectly via a SQL Agent).
*   **Query Execution Capability:** The attacker needs to be able to execute queries, either directly or by injecting malicious commands into existing application queries.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Procedures:** The attacker needs to know which extended stored procedures are vulnerable (`xp_execresultset`, `xp_printstatements`, `xp_displayparamstmt`).

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability affects Microsoft SQL Server 7.0 and 2000.
*   The identified vulnerable extended stored procedures are `xp_execresultset`, `xp_printstatements`, and `xp_displayparamstmt`.
*   The vulnerability was reported by David Litchfield of NGSSoftware.
*   Microsoft released a patch to address the issue (MS02-043), which sets permissions on the extended stored procedures so that only administrators can invoke them.
*   The security bulletin (MS02-043) advises on the proper installation order of the patch along with hotfix 317748.
*   Mitigating factors include following the principle of least privilege for the SQL Server service account and validating user inputs to prevent malicious query execution.
