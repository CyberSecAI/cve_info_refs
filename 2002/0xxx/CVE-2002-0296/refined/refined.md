- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Tarantella Enterprise installation process creates a symlink to `/etc/passwd` allowing modification of the file during the installation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is due to insecure handling of symlinks during the installation process. By creating a symlink to `/etc/passwd` and waiting for the installation to attempt to write to the file, the attacker can inject arbitrary data.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to gain root access by adding a new user (`tarexp`) with UID 0 to `/etc/passwd` which can then be used to log in as root.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to create symlinks within the file system.
