- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Visual FoxPro 6.0 does not register itself with Internet Explorer, failing to specify how it should handle associated files referenced from a web page. Additionally, a flaw exists in how Visual FoxPro 6.0 evaluates application filenames, allowing specific filenames to be executed.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Lack of registration with Internet Explorer, which would normally allow a product to specify how associated files should be handled from a web page.
    - Vulnerable filename evaluation in Visual FoxPro 6.0, allowing execution of specially crafted application filenames.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the victim's system with the privileges of the logged-in user. This could include actions such as interrogating databases, issuing system commands, loading and running programs, altering data, and reformatting the hard drive.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker could create a web page containing a reference to a malicious Visual FoxPro application and host it on a website or send it to a user as an HTML email. If the user opens the page and has Visual FoxPro 6.0 (or the runtime) installed, the application could execute without warning.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to create a specially crafted web page and a malicious Visual FoxPro application with a specific filename structure. The attacker also needs a victim who has Visual FoxPro 6.0 or its runtime installed on their system and is willing to open the attacker's web page or HTML email.
