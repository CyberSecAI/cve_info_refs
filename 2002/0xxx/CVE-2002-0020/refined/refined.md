- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An unchecked buffer in the Telnet service code that processes telnet protocol options.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer overflow vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Denial of Service (Telnet server failure).
    - Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the Telnet service.
    - On Windows 2000, the Telnet service runs as SYSTEM, allowing for full system compromise.
    - On Interix 2.2, the security context depends on the administrator's configuration, allowing for potentially lower impact if configured with least privilege.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending specially crafted, malformed packets to the vulnerable Telnet service.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Network access to the Telnet service.
    - Ability to send malformed packets.
