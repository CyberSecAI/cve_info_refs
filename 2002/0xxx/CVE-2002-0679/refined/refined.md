Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2002-0679:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A heap buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the Common Desktop Environment (CDE) ToolTalk RPC database server (rpc.ttdbserverd). Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered via an argument to the `_TT_CREATE_FILE()` procedure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap Buffer Overflow:** The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow, meaning the overflow occurs in memory allocated on the heap rather than the stack. This is significant because some operating systems' non-executable stack protection may not prevent exploitation if the payload can be located on the heap.
- **Insecure Handling of RPC Messages**: The ToolTalk RPC database server does not properly validate the size of arguments passed to the `_TT_CREATE_FILE()` procedure, allowing for an overly long argument to cause an overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A remote attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the `rpc.ttdbserverd` process, which usually runs with root privileges. This means an attacker could gain full control of the vulnerable system.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  If arbitrary code execution is not achieved, the buffer overflow could lead to a denial of service by crashing the `rpc.ttdbserverd` service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable via specially crafted RPC messages sent to the ToolTalk RPC database service.
- **Network Access:** An attacker needs to have network access to the ToolTalk RPC database service to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** An attacker needs to have network access to the port on which the ToolTalk RPC database service is listening.
- **Knowledge of RPC:** An attacker must be able to craft an RPC message to exploit the vulnerability.
- **No authentication:** The vulnerability is exploitable without authentication to the ToolTalk RPC database service

**Additional Details:**

- The ToolTalk service is often installed and enabled by default on many common UNIX platforms, increasing the attack surface.
- Vendors like Caldera, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Sun Microsystems, and Xi Graphics were affected.
- The vulnerability is present in various versions of affected operating systems like AIX, HP-UX, Solaris.
- Disabling the `rpc.ttdbserverd` service is provided as a workaround until patches can be applied.
- Blocking access to the RPC portmapper service (ports 111/tcp and 111/udp) and the ToolTalk RPC service via a firewall is a mitigation measure.
- The vulnerability was reported by Sinan Eren of the Entercept Ricochet Team.

This detailed information provides a clear understanding of the vulnerability, its impact, and how it can be exploited, which exceeds the basic CVE description.
