## Common Desktop Environment (CDE) ToolTalk RPC database server (rpc.ttdbserverd) vulnerable to buffer overflow via \_TT\_CREATE\_FILE()

#### Vulnerability Note VU#387387

Original Release Date: 2002-08-12 | Last Revised: 2002-09-09

---

### Overview

The Common Desktop Environment (CDE) ToolTalk RPC database server contains a buffer overflow condition that could let an attacker execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service on a vulnerable system. The ToolTalk RPC database server typically runs with root privileges.

### Description

| A buffer overflow vulnerability has been reported in the CDE ToolTalk RPC database server (rpc.ttdbserverd). A component of CDE, the ToolTalk architecture allows applications to communicate with each other via remote procedure calls (RPC) across different hosts and platforms. The ToolTalk RPC database server manages connections between ToolTalk applications. CDE and ToolTalk are installed and enabled by default on many common UNIX platforms.  The ToolTalk RPC database server is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow via an argument to the procedure \_TT\_CREATE\_FILE(). As noted by the reporter, the non-executable stack feature of some operating systems may not prevent exploitation of this vulnerability if the payload can be located on the heap. An attacker with access to the ToolTalk RPC database service could exploit this vulnerability with a specially crafted RPC message. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker could execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service on a vulnerable system. The ToolTalk RPC database server typically runs with root privileges. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply a Patch**Apply the appropriate patch from your vendor as specified in the **Systems Affected** section below. |
| --- |

| **Disable rpc.ttdbserverd**Until patches are available and can be applied, you may wish to consider disabling the ToolTalk RPC database service. As a general best practice, the CERT/CC recommends disabling any services that are not explicitly required. The ToolTalk RPC database service may be enabled in /etc/rpc or in /etc/inetd.conf. For example, on a Solaris 8 system, comment out the following entry in /etc/inetd.conf to disable the ToolTalk RPC database service (rpc.ttdbserverd):## Sun ToolTalk Database Server#100083/1        tli     rpc/tcp wait root /usr/dt/bin/rpc.ttdbserverd rpc.ttdbserverdThe rpcinfo(1M) and ps(1) commands may be useful in determining if you system is running the ToolTalk RPC database server. On a Solaris 8 system, the following examples indicate that the ToolTalk RPC database server is running:# rpcinfo -p | grep 100083    100083    1   tcp   32773# ps -ef | grep rpc.ttdbserverd    root   355   164  0  19:31:27 ?        0:00 rpc.ttdbserverd**Block or Restrict Access**Until patches are available and can be applied, block or restrict access to the RPC portmapper service and the ToolTalk RPC database service from untrusted networks such as the Internet. Using a firewall or other packet-filtering technology, block the ports used by the RPC portmapper and ToolTalk RPC services. The RPC portmapper service typically runs on ports 111/tcp and 111/udp. The ToolTalk RPC service may be configured to use port 692/tcp or another port as indicated in output from the rpcinfo command. Keep in mind that blocking ports at a network perimeter does not protect the vulnerable service from the internal network. It is important to understand your network configuration and service requirements before deciding what changes are appropriate. |

Notified:  July 04, 2002  Updated: August 20, 2002

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

Caldera Open UNIX and Caldera UnixWare provide the CDE ttdbserverd daemon, and is vulnerable to this issue. Please see Caldera Security Advisory CSSA-2002-SCO.28.1 for more information.

SCO OpenServer and Caldera OpenLinux do not provide CDE, and are therefore not vulnerable.

### Vendor Information

The vendor has not provided us with any further information regarding this vulnerability.

### Addendum

The CERT/CC has no additional comments at this time.

If you have feedback, comments, or additional information about this vulnerability, please send us email.

### [Hewlett-Packard Company](#AAMN-5BRA2E) Affected

Notified:  July 04, 2002  Updated: September 09, 2002

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

Date: 15 August, 2002
CROSS REFERENCE ID: SSRT2274

HP Tru64 UNIX

> At the time of writing this document, Hewlett Packard is currentlyinvestigating the potential impact to HP-UX and HP Tru64 UNIX releasedoperating system software.
>
> HP will provide notice of the availability of any necessary patchesthrough standard security bulletin announcements and be available fromyour normal HP Services support channel.

HP-UX

> A preliminary fix for HP-UX is avaiable:
>
> Originally issued: 12 July 2002
> Last revision: 14 Aug 2002
>
> ftp://ttdb1:ttdb1@hprc.external.hp.com/
> file: rpc.ttdbserver.2.tar.gz
>
> Details can be found in HPSBUX0207-199 at [http://itrc.hp.com](http://itrc.hp.com/)

NOT IMPACTED:

> HP-MPE/ix
> HP OpenVMS
> HP NonStop Servers

HP Recommended Workaround:

A recommended workaround is to disable rpc.ttdbserverd until solutionsare available. This should only create a potential problem for publicsoftware packages applications that use the RPC-based ToolTalkdatabase server. This step should be evaluated against the risksidentified, your security measures environment, and potential impactof other products that may use the ToolTalk database server.

To disable rpc.ttdbserverd:

HP Tru64 Unix:

> Comment out the following line in /etc/inetd.conf:
>
> rpc.ttdbserverd stream tcp swait root /usr/dt/bin/rpc.ttdbserverd rpc.ttdbserverd
>
> Force inetd to re-read the configuration file by executing the inetd -h command.
>
> Note: The internet daemon should kill the currently running rpc.ttdbserver. If not, manually kill any existing rpc.ttdbserverd process.

HP-UX:

> Comment out the following line in /etc/inetd.conf:
>
> rpc stream tcp swait root /usr/dt/bin/rpc.ttdbserver 100083 1 /usr/dt/bin/rpc.ttdbserver [10.20]
>
> > or
>
>  rpc xti tcp swait root /usr/dt/bin/rpc.ttdbserver 100083 1 /usr/dt/bin/rpc.ttdbserver [11.0/11.11]
>
> Force inetd to re-read the configuration file by executing the inetd -c command.
>
> Note: The internet daemon should kill the currently running rpc.ttdbserver. If not, manually kill any existing rpc.ttdbserverd process.

## History

The CERT Division is the birthplace of cybersecurity. For nearly 30 years, the CERT Division of the SEI has partnered with government, industry, law enforcement, and academia to advance cybersecurity and improve the security and resilience of computer systems and networks.

Originally focused on incident response, we have expanded into cybersecurity areas such as network situational awareness, malicious code analysis, secure coding, resilience management, insider threats, digital investigations and intelligence, workforce development, DevOps, forensics, software assurance, vulnerability discovery and analysis, and risk management.

## Former Director Richard Pethia

[Richard Pethia](/about/leadership/display.cfm?customel_datapageid_2623=3545) was founding director of the SEI's CERT Division. Pethia, who served as director of CERT from 1988 to 2016, guided the organization through tremendous growth and change. Under Pethia's leadership, the unit expanded and evolved from the CERT Coordination Center—a small group focused on computer incident response—to a research organization of more than 200 professionals dedicated to solving problems with widespread cybersecurity implications.
