- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A flaw in how Exchange 2000 handles malformed RFC message attributes on received mail. Specifically, when the Exchange 2000 Store Service receives a message with a specially malformed attribute, it attempts to process the message instead of rejecting it. This processing consumes 100% of the available CPU.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper handling of malformed RFC message attributes. The Exchange 2000 Store service does not immediately reject messages with malformed attributes, instead attempting to process them and causing a denial of service.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Denial of service. The Exchange server becomes unresponsive as the Store service consumes 100% of the CPU. Neither restarting the service nor rebooting the server will remedy the issue until the message processing is complete.
- **Attack vectors:** Direct connection to the Exchange server is required to pass a raw, hand-crafted mail message with a specially malformed attribute.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to establish a direct connection to the Exchange server and send a specially crafted, raw email message. The attacker cannot exploit this vulnerability using a standard email client like Outlook or Outlook Express.
