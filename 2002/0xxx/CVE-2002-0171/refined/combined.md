- -----------------------
- --- Issue Specifics ---
- -----------------------

It's been reported that under certain conditions the IRISconsole 2.0 product
will allow login to the "icadmin" account with the wrong password.

This vulnerability could lead to a privileged compromise of the IRISconsole
environment.

SGI has investigated the issue and recommends the following steps for
neutralizing the exposure. It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that these measures be
implemented on ALL vulnerable SGI systems.

These issues have been corrected patch 4038.

- --------------
- --- Impact ---
- --------------

The IRISconsole product is an optional product and is not installed by
default on IRIX systems.

In order to determine if IRISconsole is installed, execute the following
command:

 % versions -b | grep IRISconsole

If a line similar to that shown below is returned, then IRISconsole is
installed:

I IRISconsole 09/27/1999 IRISconsole Administration Software 2.0

This vulnerability was assigned the following CVE:
<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2002-0171>

- ----------------------------
- --- Temporary Workaround ---
- ----------------------------

There is no effective workaround available for these problems.
SGI recommends installing patch 4038.

- ----------------
- --- Solution ---
- ----------------

Install patch 4038 available from <http://support.sgi.com/> and
ftp://patches.sgi.com/support/free/security/patches/6.5/

This patch is for IRISconsole 2.0 and is not tied to a specific
IRIX operating system release.
