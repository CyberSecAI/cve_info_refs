Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2002-0836:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `dvips` utility, part of the `tetex` package, uses the `system()` function insecurely when handling fonts or processing DVI files. Specifically, the `kpathsea` library, used by `dvips`, improperly calls `system()`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Use of `system()`:** The primary vulnerability lies in the unsafe use of the `system()` function. This allows for arbitrary command execution if an attacker can control the input passed to the function.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The software fails to properly sanitize or validate input, particularly font-related data or information contained within the DVI files, before passing it to the `system()` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the affected system.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** If `dvips` is used as part of a print filter, a remote attacker with print access, or a local user with print permissions, can execute commands with the privileges of the printing system user (typically `lp`).
*   **System Compromise:** Depending on the executed commands, this can lead to a full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Printing:** A remote attacker with printing access can send a specially crafted print job containing a malicious DVI file.
*   **Local Printing:** A local attacker with print permissions could also exploit the vulnerability by printing a malicious DVI file.
*   **Malicious DVI Files:** The core vector involves crafting malicious DVI files that contain carefully crafted commands that are then executed through the insecure `system()` call.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Print Access:** The attacker requires either remote printing access to the system, or local permissions to print.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker must be aware of the vulnerability in `dvips` and how to exploit it by creating a malicious DVI file.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability resides in the `kpathsea` library which is used by both `xdvi` and `dvips` programs, but exploitation via `dvips` poses a more serious risk due to its use in print filters.
*   The provided content also includes information on affected versions and solutions for various distributions like Debian, Gentoo and OpenPKG, along with the original advisory from RedHat.
