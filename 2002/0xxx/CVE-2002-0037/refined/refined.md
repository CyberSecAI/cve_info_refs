- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Lotus Notes stores objects associated with documents as separate files. While document access is controlled by the database ACL, Reader, and Author lists, these lists do not restrict access to the associated objects.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the fact that access controls for documents do not extend to the associated objects. An intruder can bypass document-level restrictions using Notes API calls to directly access associated objects if they know the object's unique document ID.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can view objects (like file attachments) that they do not have permission to view based on document access controls.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves using Notes API calls to directly access the desired object using the object's unique document ID. The attacker must be able to access the target database.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have access to the target database and must know the Notes unique document ID of the object they want to access.
