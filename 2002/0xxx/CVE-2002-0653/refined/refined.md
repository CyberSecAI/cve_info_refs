        "vulnerability": {
            "root_cause": "An off-by-one error exists in mod_ssl's ssl_compat_directive() function when handling configuration directives. This function is called for every line read in a configuration file when backward compatibility is enabled.",
            "weaknesses": [
                "The code copies characters from the input `oline` to a buffer `caCmd` with a fixed size of 1024. The loop condition `i < 1024` allows copying 1024 bytes, followed by a null terminator write at `caCmd[i] = NUL;`. This results in an out-of-bounds write, leading to a stack buffer overflow."
            ],
            "impact": "The stack can be smashed, leading to denial of service, adding fake entries to log files, running arbitrary commands as the web server user, and spoofing replies. An attacker can cause an overflow in every child process.",
            "attack_vector": "By crafting a malicious configuration directive in a .htaccess file, an attacker can trigger the vulnerability. The `oline` pointer, which contains the contents of a configuration line, can be controlled by an attacker through .htaccess files, allowing them to supply an overly long directive that causes a buffer overflow during parsing.",
            "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create or modify .htaccess files, which means that they either need to be a user who has write permissions on the web server's document root or a user of a virtual host where AllowOverride is not set to None."
