The provided content describes two separate vulnerabilities in DCP-Portal, both related to path disclosure, but with different attack vectors.  The first advisory (ARL02-A02) is related to `add_user.php` and the second (ARL02-A04) is related to the `new_language` functionality. Since both vulnerabilities refer to the same software (DCP-Portal) and involve the same type of weakness (path disclosure), we'll analyze them together to assess the relation to CVE-2002-0282. However, without the official CVE description, it is hard to say for sure if these are the vulnerabilities covered by the CVE.

**Vulnerability 1 (ARL02-A02): Root Path Disclosure in `add_user.php`**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to an error page being displayed when the `add_user.php` script is accessed. The error message includes the full path to the web root.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Improper error handling leading to information disclosure.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A remote attacker can learn the full path to the web root directory, which can aid further attacks.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Sending an HTTP request to `/add_user.php`
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** A remote attacker can send HTTP requests without authentication.

**Vulnerability 2 (ARL02-A04): System Information Path Disclosure via `new_language` parameter**

*   **Root Cause:** The `new_language` function in DCP-Portal does not properly validate the requested language parameter. This leads to an error message displaying the full path to the web root when an invalid language is requested.
*  **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Input validation error, leading to information disclosure.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A remote attacker can gain knowledge of the full path of the web root, and potentially more system information depending on the output.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Sending a crafted HTTP request with an invalid language parameter in the `new_language` parameter (e.g. `new_language=elvish`) to various php scripts like `contents.php`, `categories.php`, `files.php` etc.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** A remote attacker can send HTTP requests without authentication.

**Summary of Both Vulnerabilities:**

Both advisories describe path disclosure vulnerabilities in DCP-Portal where the full path to the web root is revealed in error messages. The attack vectors are different: the first one uses `add_user.php` while the second one exploits the `new_language` parameter. The impact of both is similar: to provide information that can be used in further attacks.

**Relation to CVE-2002-0282:**

Without the CVE description, a direct correlation is not possible. However, based on the nature of the vulnerabilities, it is plausible that either one of the described path disclosure vulnerabilities in DCP-Portal is related to CVE-2002-0282.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the information provided, the content is relevant to potential path disclosure vulnerabilities that could be related to CVE-2002-0282 if the CVE addresses path disclosure vulnerabilities in web applications.

Since it provides more details than a typical CVE description, which is often short, the information could be considered an addition to an official description, providing concrete examples, vulnerable versions and fixes/workarounds.
