```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability results because the component of the SNMP agent service that parses incoming commands contains an unchecked buffer.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Buffer Overflow",
     "Improper Input Validation"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could cause a denial of service, and potentially execute arbitrary code on the affected system with LocalSystem privileges.",
  "Attack vectors": "By sending a specially crafted SNMP management request to a system running a vulnerable SNMP service.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker would need to be able to deliver SNMP management requests to the SNMP Service. Likely that an attacker located within a network could deliver SNMP management requests to most other systems on the network, since SNMP operates over TCP/IP."
