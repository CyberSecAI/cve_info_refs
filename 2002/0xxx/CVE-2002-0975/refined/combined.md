Hi BugTraq reader,

I would like to inform you about security issue in
DirectX Files Viewer control was available
on ActiveX gallery page
<http://activex.microsoft.com/activex>
site but fixed not so long time ago.

=========================================================
Overview:
Risk: High
Distribution: Low-Medium
Patch available from vendor: True

Systems Affected:
Systems having Microsoft DirectX Files Viewer xweb.ocx (2,0,16,15 and possibly older)

Impact:
A remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the \
current user.

Description:
A buffer overflow exists in the "File" parameter of the Microsoft DirectX Files \
Viewer ActiveX control that may permit a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on \
the system with the privileges of the current user. This vulnerability affects users \
visited ActiveX samples galery at activex.microsoft.com.
Since the control is signed by Microsoft, users of Microsoft's Internet Explorer (IE) \
who accept and install Microsoft-signed ActiveX controls are also affected. This \
control was also available for direct download from the web, but can be uploaded on \
any website.
The <object> tag could be used to embed the ActiveX control in a web page. If an \
attacker can trick the user into visiting a malicious site or the attacker sends the \
victim a web page as an HTML-formatted email message or newsgroup posting then this \
vulnerability could be exploited. This acceptance and installation of the control can \
occur automatically within IE for users who trust Microsoft-signed ActiveX controls. \
When the web page is rendered, either by opening the page or viewing the page through \
a preview pane, the ActiveX control could be invoked. Likewise, if the ActiveX \
control is embedded in a Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, etc.) document, it may be \
executed when the document is opened.

Vendor Information:
secure@microsoft.com was informed on 9.May.2002.
MSRC 1149cb ticket was opened and finaly resolved on 25.Jun.2002

Solution:
Apply a latest IE/OS patches available from Microsoft:
Setting kill bit expected to be included in latest IE Service pack.
Windows 2000 SP3 and Windows XP SP1 expected to solve this problem.

Links:
ActiveX control still available for retrieval from Global Internet "backup copy":
