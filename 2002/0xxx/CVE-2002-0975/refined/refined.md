- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A buffer overflow exists in the "File" parameter of the Microsoft DirectX Files Viewer ActiveX control.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the current user.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Embedding the ActiveX control in a web page, which the attacker then tricks the user into visiting.
    - Sending the victim a web page as an HTML-formatted email message or newsgroup posting.
    - Embedding the ActiveX control in a Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, etc.) document.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious webpage or send a malicious email, or embed the control in a document. The attacker also needs to trick the victim into opening the malicious content. The user would also need to have the vulnerable version of the ActiveX control installed, which could be done by trusting Microsoft signed controls.
