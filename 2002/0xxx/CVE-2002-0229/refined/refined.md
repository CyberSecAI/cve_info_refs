Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from the fact that the PHP safe_mode restrictions, which are meant to prevent scripts from accessing local files, are not enforced on "LOAD DATA INFILE LOCAL" statements within the bundled MySQL client library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Lack of Access Control:** PHP's safe mode relies on wrapper functions around filesystem calls for access checks. The MySQL client library did not have these checks implemented for `LOAD DATA INFILE LOCAL` statements. This allows bypassing the intended access controls of the safe mode.
- **MySQL Client Library Vulnerability:** The vulnerability resides in the bundled MySQL client library, specifically in `libmysql.c` around line 1764.
- **`LOAD DATA INFILE LOCAL` Misuse:** The `LOAD DATA INFILE LOCAL` SQL command can be used to transfer data from the client to the server and can be exploited to load data from the server where the PHP script is running to the attacker's controlled database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary File Read:** An attacker can use a MySQL server as a proxy to download files residing on a safe_mode-enabled web server. This enables an attacker to read any file on the web server that the webserver user has access to.
- **Cross-Client File Access:** In shared hosting environments, this vulnerability allows clients to access each other's files, compromising privacy.
- **Information Disclosure:** Viewing of files on an improperly secured server could also lead to sensitive data being exposed.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **SQL Injection:** An attacker can inject the vulnerable SQL statement through a PHP application that constructs SQL queries using user controlled input.
- **Direct Access to MySQL Server:** If the attacker has direct access to a MySQL server that connects to the vulnerable webserver (provided by the victim or self-hosted), they can use `LOAD DATA INFILE LOCAL` to download arbitrary files from the webserver.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to have access to a MySQL server (either provided by the victim or one they control themselves) that they can use to connect to the victim's webserver MySQL database.
- They must be able to execute SQL queries containing the `LOAD DATA INFILE LOCAL` command.
- The attacker needs the vulnerable web server to be running PHP with safe_mode enabled.
- The webserver needs to have a connection to a MySQL database that the attacker can interact with, where they can read data.
- The MySQL user used by the webserver needs to have the `FILE` privilege, although it is noted that this privilege is not actually required for the exploit.

**Additional Notes:**

- The advisory mentions that this is likely not an isolated problem in PHP and suggests that PostgreSQL and other PHP database extensions may have the same issue.
- A patch was released to address this vulnerability
- The original advisory includes a proof of concept script named `safe_mode.php`.
