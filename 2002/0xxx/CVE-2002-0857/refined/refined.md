Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2002-0857:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Oracle Listener Control Utility (lsnrctl) contains a format string vulnerability. This vulnerability arises when the utility parses commands or configuration files, specifically the `listener.ora` file, which can contain format string specifiers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Format String Vulnerability:** The core weakness is the improper handling of format string specifiers (`%s`, `%x`, etc.) within the `lsnrctl` utility when processing input from the `listener.ora` configuration file or directly supplied commands. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary format specifiers.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** By default, Oracle Listeners can be controlled remotely and anonymously, allowing modification of their configuration files without authentication. This allows an attacker to inject malicious format strings into the `listener.ora` file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can exploit the format string vulnerability to execute arbitrary code or commands on the system where the `lsnrctl` utility is run.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The attacker can cause the `lsnrctl` utility to crash, preventing legitimate users (e.g., DBAs) from using it to manage the Oracle Listener.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Configuration File Modification:** An attacker can modify the `listener.ora` configuration file, inserting format string specifiers into various entries. When the `lsnrctl` utility is run by a DBA to manage the listener, these format strings are parsed leading to exploitation.
- **Direct Command Injection:** An attacker with sufficient privileges can directly supply crafted commands containing format string specifiers to the vulnerable `lsnrctl` utility.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access (for configuration file modification):** The attacker needs to be able to remotely access and modify the `listener.ora` configuration file when the listener is configured for unauthenticated access, or have sufficient privileges to directly interact with the utility.
- **Privileges (for direct command injection):** An attacker needs to have sufficient privileges to supply malicious commands to the `lsnrctl` utility.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Oracle 9i and 8i on all platforms.
- The attacker typically gains control of the DBA's machine, not the database server itself, when the vulnerable utility is executed.
- The attack is considered complex, requiring specific events to occur (such as the DBA using the utility after the config file modification).

**Mitigations:**
- Apply the patch provided by Oracle.
- Restrict access to Oracle Listeners to trusted users, hosts, and networks.
- Enable "TCP valid node checking" using  `tcp.validnode_checking`, `tcp.invited_nodes`, and `tcp.excluded_nodes` in `sqlnet.ora` or `protocol.ora`.
- Configure Oracle listeners with encrypted passwords.
- Set restrictive file permissions on Listener configuration files.
- Disable runtime modification of listener parameters by setting `ADMIN_RESTRICTIONS_listener_name=on` in `listener.ora`.
