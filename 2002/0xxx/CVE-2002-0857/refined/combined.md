NGSSoftware Insight Security Research Advisory

Name: Oracle Listener Control Format Strings
Systems Affected:  Oracle 9i, 8i on all platforms
Severity: Medium
Category: Format String Vulnerabilities
Vendor URL:   <http://www.oracle.com/>
Authors:  David Litchfield (david@ngssoftware.com)
Advisory URL: <http://www.ngssoftware.com/advisories/ora-lsnrfmtstr.txt>
Date:   14th August 2002
Advisory number: #NISR14082002
VNA Reference:  <http://www.nextgenss.com/vna/ora-lsnrctl.txt>

Description
***********
Oracle provide a tool called the Listener Control utility (lsnrctl) to allow
an Oracle DBA to remotely control the Listener. The Listener is responsible
for dealing with client requests for database services. This control utility
contains an indirect remotely exploitable format string vulnerability.

Details
*******
By default the Oracle Listener is not protected against unauthenticated
access and control. The configuration files of Listeners in such a state can
be modified without the user needing to supply a password. By modifying
certain entries in the listener.ora file, by inserting a format string
exploit, an attacker can gain control of a Listener control utility.
Typically an attack would require the attacker to modify the file and wait
for an Oracle DBA to use the Listener control utility to access the Listener
at which point control over the utility's path of execution can be gained.
This will give the attacker the ability only to gain control of the DBA's
machine and not the database server. This is a complex attack and requires
certain "events" to happen and as such the risk is quite low. That said,
Oracle users are urged to apply the patch.

Fix Information
***************
NGSSoftware alerted Oracle to this problem on the 13th May 2002. Oracle have
produced a patch and issued an alert. Please see their bulletin for more
details.

<http://otn.oracle.com/deploy/security/pdf/2002alert40rev1.pdf>

In the intermin NGSSoftware advise that Oracle DBAs ensure that the Listener
can not be controlled remotely and anonymously.

There are several steps one can take to secure the Listener and hence
prevent exploitation of this format string vulnerability.

One can set in the listener.ora

ADMIN_RESTRICTIONS_lsnrname=ON

This will prevent modifications to the Listener config files. Furthe a
password should be set to limit actions a user can take.

## Oracle TNS Listener Control Utility (LSNRCTL) contains format string vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#301059

Original Release Date: 2002-06-04 | Last Revised: 2003-06-02

---

### Overview

The Oracle Listener Control Utility (LSNRCTL) contains a format string vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or commands or cause a denial of service.

### Description

| Oracle Transparent Network Substrate (TNS ) Listeners are processes that receive connection requests from clients and return information for the clients to use to make database connections. The Listener Control Utility (LSNRCTL) is used to administer Listeners, and has the ability to establish an Oracle Net connection to remote Listeners. When used to administer a Listener, the Listener Control Utility parses the Listener's configuration file ($ORACLE\_HOME/NETWORK/ADMIN/LISTENER.ORA for the default Listener).  The Listener Control Utility contains a format string vulnerability that could be exploited when the utility parses commands that are supplied directly to it or read from a Listener configuration file. By default, unauthenticated users can control Oracle Listeners and modify their configuration files. By inserting crafted entries containing format string specifiers into a Listener configuration file, an attacker could cause the Listener Control Utility to execute arbitrary code or commands or crash the utility, preventing its use by legitimate users. An attacker with sufficient privileges can supply crafted commands containing format string specifiers directly to a vulnerable Listener Control Utility.In one possible scenario, an attacker could modify a Listener configuration file and wait for a legitimate user, such as a database administrator (DBA), to run the Listener Control Utility. Any code or commands supplied by the attacker would execute with the privileges of the user who ran the Listener Control Utility. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An unauthenticated remote attacker could execute arbitrary code or commands or cause a denial of service on a vulnerable system. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply a Patch**Apply the appropriate patch as referenced in [Oracle Security Alert #40](http://otn.oracle.com/deploy/security/pdf/2002alert40rev1.pdf). |
| --- |

| **Restrict Access to the Listener Control Utility**Restrict access to Oracle Listeners to trusted users, hosts, and networks. Use firewall or router access control lists (ACLs) to restrict connections to the port(s) used by Oracle Listeners, 1521/tcp by default. Enable the Oracle Net feature called "TCP valid node checking" by modifying $ORACLE\_HOME/NETWORK/ADMIN/SQLNET.ORA ($ORACLE\_HOME/NETWORK/ADMIN/PROTOCOL.ORA in Oracle8i and prior releases) as follows:tcp.validnode\_checking = YEStcp.invited\_nodes = {list of IP addresses}tcp.excluded\_nodes = {list of IP addresses}Configure Oracle listeners with encrypted passwords.Set more restrictive file permissions on Listener configuration files ($ORACLE\_HOME/NETWORK/ADMIN/LISTENER.ORA for the default Listener).Disable the runtime modification of Oracle listener parameters by modifying $ORACLE\_HOME/NETWORK/ADMIN/LISTENER.ORA as follows:ADMIN\_RESTRICTIONS\_listener\_name=onNote that these workarounds are designed to limit access; they may not prevent exploitation of this vulnerability. |
