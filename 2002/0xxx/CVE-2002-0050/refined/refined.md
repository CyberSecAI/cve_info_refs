- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An unchecked buffer exists in the AuthFilter ISAPI filter within Microsoft Commerce Server 2000. This filter handles authentication requests, and a lack of proper bounds checking allows for a buffer overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation**: 
    -  Denial of service: By providing randomly selected data to overflow the buffer, the Commerce Server process could crash.
    - Remote code execution: By carefully crafting the overflowing data, an attacker could overwrite memory within the Commerce Server process and execute arbitrary code. Because the Commerce Server process runs with LocalSystem privileges, the attacker gains complete control of the server.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker sends specially crafted, malformed authentication data directly to the server, bypassing any web forms.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server running Microsoft Commerce Server 2000 and provide authentication data that will overflow the vulnerable buffer.
