# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

In that case, you should drop the other execute permission (o-x) from the archives/private directory. However, the web server process must be able to follow the symbolic link in public directory, otherwise your public Pipermail archives will not work. To set this up, become root and run the following commands:  # cd <prefix>/archives # chown <web-server-user> private # chmod o-x private  You need to know what user your web server runs as. It may be www, apache, httpd or nobody, depending on your server's configuration.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=723584#c2)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-07-20 16:14:25 UTC  ``` This issue affects the versions of the mailman package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, and 6.  --  This issue does NOT affect the versions of the mailman package, as shipped with Fedora release of 14 and 15.

## Topic

Updated mailman packages that fix two security issues and several bugs are
now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Mailman is a program used to help manage e-mail discussion lists.

It was found that mailman did not sanitize the list name before passing it
to certain MTAs. A local attacker could use this flaw to execute arbitrary
code as the user running mailman. (CVE-2015-2775)

It was found that mailman stored private email messages in a world-readable
directory. A local user could use this flaw to read private mailing list
archives. (CVE-2002-0389)

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* Previously, it was impossible to configure Mailman in a way that

Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance (DMARC) would
recognize Sender alignment for Domain Key Identified Mail (DKIM)
signatures. Consequently, Mailman list subscribers that belonged to a mail
server with a "reject" policy for DMARC, such as yahoo.com or AOL.com, were
unable to receive Mailman forwarded messages from senders residing in any
domain that provided DKIM signatures. With this update, domains with a
"reject" DMARC policy are recognized correctly, and Mailman list
administrators are able to configure the way these messages are handled.
As a result, after a proper configuration, subscribers now correctly
receive Mailman forwarded messages in this scenario. (BZ#1095359)

* Mailman used a console encoding when generating a subject for a "welcome

email" when new mailing lists were created by the "newlist" command.
Consequently, when the console encoding did not match the encoding used by
Mailman for that particular language, characters in the "welcome email"
could be displayed incorrectly. Mailman has been fixed to use the correct
encoding, and characters in the "welcome email" are now displayed properly.
(BZ#1056366)

* The "rmlist" command used a hardcoded path to list data based on the

VAR\_PREFIX configuration variable. As a consequence, when the list was
created outside of VAR\_PREFIX, it was impossible to remove it using the
"rmlist" command. With this update, the "rmlist" command uses the correct
LIST\_DATA\_DIR value instead of VAR\_PREFIX, and it is now possible to remove
the list in described situation. (BZ#1008139)

* Due to an incompatibility between Python and Mailman in Red Hat

Enterprise Linux 6, when moderators were approving a moderated message to a
mailing list and checked the "Preserve messages for the site administrator"
checkbox, Mailman failed to approve the message and returned an error.
This incompatibility has been fixed, and Mailman now approves messages as
expected in this scenario. (BZ#765807)

* When Mailman was set to not archive a list but the archive was not set to

private, attachments sent to that list were placed in a public archive.
Consequently, users of Mailman web interface could list private attachments
because httpd configuration of public archive directory allows listing all
files in the archive directory. The httpd configuration of Mailman has been
fixed to not allow listing of private archive directory, and users of
Mailman web interface are no longer able to list private attachments.
(BZ#745409)

Users of mailman are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=745409#c0)  Jan Kaluža    2011-10-12 09:50:19 UTC  ``` +++ This bug was initially created as a clone of [Bug #745012](show_bug.cgi?id=745012 "CLOSED WONTFIX - default httpd config for Mailman offers directory listings for lists with disabled but public archives") +++  Description of problem:  If you ask Mailman to not archive a list but fail to ask it to keep the (disabled) archives private the attachments sent to that list will be placed in a public archive.  This problem is made worse by the default httpd config included in the rpm which turns on directory listings for the public archives:      ...     <Directory /var/lib/mailman/archives/public>         Options Indexes MultiViews FollowSymLinks     ...   Mailman maintains an index of all messages that belong in the archive including links to their attachments so it would make a lot more sense to disable Options Indexes for /var/lib/mailman/archives/public.   Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):  mailman-2.1.9-6.el5_6.1    How reproducible:  Always.   Steps to Reproduce:  * Create a test list with settings: archive = 0 archive_private = 0  * Send a message to the list with an attachment.  * Go to: <http://SITE.ADDRESS/pipermail/TEST-LIST/attachments/> [^]  * Follow the directory listings to your attachment.    Actual results:  Attachment for unarchived list can be found by guessing a constant directory component and then following the directory indexes.   Expected results:  Nothing is archived for unarchived list.

URL : <http://www.list.org/> [^] License : GPL Description: Mailman is software to help manage email discussion lists, much            : like Majordomo and Smartmail. Unlike most similar products, Mailman            : gives each mailing list a webpage, and allows users to subscribe,            : unsubscribe, etc. over the Web. Even the list manager can            : administer his or her list entirely from the Web. Mailman also            : integrates most things people want to do with mailing lists,            : including archiving, mail <-> news gateways, and so on.            :            : Documentation can be found in: /usr/share/doc/mailman-2.1.9            :            : When the package has finished installing, you will need to perform            : some additional installation steps, these are described in:            : /usr/share/doc/mailman-2.1.9/INSTALL.REDHAT   I've already submitted this as Centos [bug 0005123](show_bug.cgi?id=5123 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - netscape 4.6 crashes on webpages with java applets") but they referred to upstream. <http://bugs.centos.org/view.php?id=5123>  --- Additional comment from jkaluza on 2011-10-11 05:13:30 EDT ---  So is it only about disabling indexes in httpd conf, or mailman stores private attachments in public directory for you?  --- Additional comment from ulrik.haugen on 2011-10-11 07:01:08 EDT ---  I've intended for this bug to be about disabling indexes in httpd.conf as it exposes this problem and is not suggested in the Mailman installation documentation.  The root cause of the problem is of course that Mailman stores these attachments in the archive when archiving is disabled so no list admin will think about marking the archive private, but it seems a bigger issue and just disabling the indexes will be a big help.  There is already a bug in the vicinity of the root cause in Mailmans bug tracker: [https://bugs.launchpad.net/mailman/+bug/266317](https://bugs.launchpad.net/mailman/%2Bbug/266317)   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=745409#c18)  Alois Mahdal    2015-05-12 18:00:02 UTC  ``` Note that the test case We'll be using slightly differs from the OP:   1. Create test list,   2. send mail with *binary* attachment to the list   3. set `archive = 0` and `archive_private = 0` for the list,   4. and check <http://site.example.com/pipermail/listname/attachments/>,  while OP sends the mail *after* changing the settings, which in our settings resulted in empty archive in both cases (before and after fix).   Verified on x86_64, and scheduled tests for the rest of architectures.   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=745409#c19)  Alois Mahdal    2015-05-12 20:07:11 UTC  ``` Verified on all architectures now.  (TJ#954912, TJ#954913)   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=745409#c21)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-07-22 07:41:38 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.
