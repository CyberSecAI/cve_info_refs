The provided content describes a vulnerability related to information disclosure in PHP when used with Apache.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

When Apache is configured to use `index.php` as a default index file, and an OPTIONS request is sent to the server, Apache attempts to process the request using PHP. If the cgi-script handler is not correctly configured, an error message containing the full installation path of `php.exe` is included in the server's response.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Information Disclosure: The primary vulnerability is that the server exposes the installation path of `php.exe`, which can provide valuable information to an attacker for planning further attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An attacker can gain knowledge of the server's file system structure, making targeted attacks potentially more effective.
- The full path to `php.exe` can be used to identify specific versions of PHP which may have other vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**

- Sending an OPTIONS request to the webserver.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server.
- No special privileges are required.
