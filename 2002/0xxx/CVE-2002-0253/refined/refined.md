The provided content describes a vulnerability related to how PHP and JSP handle trailing slashes in URLs when including files. This vulnerability is not specifically mentioned in the CVE description placeholder, but it does describe an issue that can lead to information disclosure, so it is potentially relevant.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from how PHP and JSP determine the base path for included files. When a URL with a trailing slash is used, the base path can be incorrectly set to the current script's directory instead of the web root.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect base path resolution:** Trailing slashes in URLs can alter the base path used for include statements in PHP and JSP.
- **Path Disclosure:** When an include file is not found due to the incorrect base path, an error is often thrown revealing the full server path to the missing file.
- **JSP Source Code Disclosure:** In some JSP implementations, a trailing slash in the request can cause the server to return the JSP source code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can uncover the full path to include files by intentionally triggering errors.
- **JSP Source Code Disclosure:** Attackers can gain access to sensitive JSP source code, potentially revealing credentials, business logic, or other vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Adding a Trailing Slash:** The attack involves simply adding a trailing slash to a vulnerable PHP or JSP file's URL. For example, `http://someserver/ShowData.php/`
- **Form submissions:** Submitting forms that redirect to the same JSP page can trigger the disclosure.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target server.
- No special position or prior access is required to exploit this vulnerability.
