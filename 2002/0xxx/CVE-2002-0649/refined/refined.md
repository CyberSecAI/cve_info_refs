Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2002-0649:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a buffer overflow vulnerability within the Microsoft SQL Server 2000 Resolution Service (SSRS). This service listens on UDP port 1434. There are two distinct buffer overflows:

1.  **Stack-based buffer overflow:** Occurs when the SSRS receives a UDP packet with the first byte set to 0x04. The service attempts to open a registry key using user-supplied data from the packet. By sending a large number of bytes, the stack buffer is overflowed, overwriting the saved return address.
2.  **Heap-based buffer overflow:** Occurs when the SSRS receives a UDP packet with the first byte set to 0x08, followed by a long string, a colon character (:), and a number. The overflow corrupts heap structures, allowing attackers to overwrite arbitrary memory locations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflows:** Both stack and heap-based buffer overflows exist in the SQL Server Resolution Service.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The service does not properly validate the size of the user-supplied data in UDP packets before using it to open registry keys or in heap operations.
*   **Missing Error Handling:** The code does not validate the return value of `strtok()` before passing it to `atoi()`, leading to a crash if the colon is missing (DoS condition).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of the buffer overflows can allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on the SQL server with the privileges of the SQL Server service account. This could lead to complete compromise of the target server and its data.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The heap overflow can be triggered to cause the SQL Server to crash and become unavailable, and the third vulnerability allows for a DoS via an infinite loop of ping packets.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is the network, specifically UDP port 1434.
*   **Unauthenticated Remote Exploitation:**  The vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely without requiring any authentication to the server.
*   **UDP Protocol:** The vulnerabilities are exploited via UDP packets, which can be easily spoofed, making firewall protection more difficult.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send UDP packets to port 1434 of the target SQL Server.
*   **Crafted Packets:** The attacker needs the ability to craft specific UDP packets with the correct initial bytes (0x04 or 0x08) and overflow data.
*   **No Authentication:** The attacker does not need any credentials or prior access to the system.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory also mentions a network-based Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability (related to CVE-2002-0650), where spoofed UDP packets can cause a ping storm between two SQL servers.
*   The advisory highlights the ease of spoofing UDP packets, making firewall protection difficult to implement.
*   The SQL Server service runs in a security context determined by the administrator during install. Default is a Domain User, which limits the attacker's OS level access if best practices are followed.

This vulnerability was addressed by Microsoft in Security Bulletin MS02-039, with the recommendation to later apply the patch from MS02-061, which addressed additional vulnerabilities.
