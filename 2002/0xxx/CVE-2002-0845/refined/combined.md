# Oracle Hardware

Oracle hardware includes a full suite of scalable engineered systems, servers, and storage that let enterprises optimize application and database performance, protect crucial data, and lower costs. Organizations improve database performance, simplify management, and lower costs with exclusive features and automated operations that aren’t available with other solutions.

### Oracle hardware benefits

#### Oracle Database runs faster and more efficiently

Oracle hardware lets IT teams deploy optimized solutions in customer data centers and easy-to-manage appliances in remote offices and edge environments. Solutions with full-stack integration and optimizations let customers run Oracle Database up to 10X faster with Oracle Exadata’s Smart Scan query offload.

[Watch NTT DOCOMO’s story (0:48)](?ytid=NHilWEUCINw)

#### Easy integration with Oracle’s public cloud

Built-in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) integrations make it easy for organizations to develop and deploy cloud native applications across OCI and customer data centers, store data in the public cloud, and simplify both data protection and cloud migrations. Oracle Cloud Observability and Management Platform provides IT teams with the information they need to understand and manage all the layers of their IT stack, no matter where it’s located.

#### Enhanced availability and data protection

Oracle IT infrastructure helps organizations increase the availability of their mission-critical Oracle databases and applications. Fault-tolerant, scale-out designs and built-in capabilities simplify the implementation of Oracle Maximum Availability Architecture (MAA) best practices, letting customers achieve up to 99.999% availability with Oracle Exadata in MAA configurations, as described in [IDC’s analysis (PDF).](/a/ocom/docs/database/idc-al4-servers.pdf)

[Watch Exelon’s story (1:28)](?ytid=W5YAcoN1aiI)

#### Lower costs with high performance consolidation

Oracle hardware lowers the cost of running on-premises workloads by reducing the number of systems required, delivering higher performance per software license, and reducing IT staff workloads. Oracle Private Cloud Appliance lets customers consolidate containerized, cloud native applications—and those running natively on multiple operating systems—onto a single platform while [Cloud@Customer](/cloud/cloud-at-customer/) solutions let organizations benefit from consumption-based economics in their own data centers.

### The best Oracle Database platform

Oracle Exadata's full-stack architecture improves the performance, scale, and availability of an enterprise’s Oracle databases. Exadata gives you choice and flexibility in terms of where to run your Oracle Database workloads, with availability on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI); multicloud environments with AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud; a hybrid cloud in your data center; and with on-premises deployments.

[Explore Oracle Exadata](/engineered-systems/exadata/)

##### Features

* A full-stack, integrated solution reduces integration requirements.* A high-availability infrastructure maximizes database uptime.
  * A scalable design enables database consolidation for organizations of any size.
  * Full compatibility across on-premises, hybrid cloud, OCI, and multicloud deployments simplifies moving to the cloud.
  * Intelligent storage increases database performance and controls costs.
  * SQL read latency of less than 14 microseconds improves OLTP responsiveness.
  * Up to 7 TB/sec SQL throughput accelerates data-intensive analytics applications.
  * Up to 22.4 million SQL I/O operations per second per rack increases throughput for consolidated workloads.

### Pre-built and optimized for crucial enterprise workloads

Oracle Engineered Systems are integrated, full-stack solutions that are developed with Oracle Database and applications to run customer workloads faster, at lower costs, and with greater security than multivendor, on-premises solutions. Scalable designs enable enterprises to consolidate existing IT infrastructure and quickly adjust to surges in demand, while management automation reduces administrative workloads and helps control costs.

[Explore Engineered Systems](/engineered-systems/)

[Advantages vs DIY (PDF)](/a/ocom/docs/engineered-systems/database-appliance/dsc-oda-x8-x.pdf)
