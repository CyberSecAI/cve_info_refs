  "cveId": "CVE-2002-0392",
  "date": "2002-06-17",
  "description": "Versions of the Apache web server up to and including 1.3.24 and 2.0 up to and including 2.0.36 contain a bug in the routines which deal with invalid requests which are encoded using chunked encoding. This bug can be triggered remotely by sending a carefully crafted invalid request. This functionality is enabled by default.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "A bug in the routines that handle chunked encoding in HTTP requests leads to a stack overflow or process termination when processing invalid requests.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of chunk-encoded data.",
        "Stack overflow vulnerability in Apache 1.3.x",
        "Process termination in Apache 2.0.x"
    ],
    "impact": "For Apache versions 1.2.2 through 1.3.24: Remote attackers may be able to execute arbitrary code. For Apache versions 2.0 through 2.0.36: This may cause the child process to exit, leading to a potential denial-of-service attack.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Remote exploitation by sending a crafted HTTP request with invalid chunked encoding."
    ],
    "requiredCapabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server."
