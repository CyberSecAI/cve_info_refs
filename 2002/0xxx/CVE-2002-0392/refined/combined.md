How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Apache web servers fail to handle chunks with a negative size

#### Vulnerability Note VU#944335

Original Release Date: 2002-06-18 | Last Revised: 2007-11-02

---

### Overview

There is a remotely exploitable vulnerability in the way that Apache web servers (or other web servers based on their source code) handle data encoded in chunks. This vulnerability is present by default in configurations of Apache web server versions 1.2.2 and above, 1.3 through 1.3.24, and versions 2.0 through 2.0.36. The impact of this vulnerability is dependent upon the software version and the hardware platform the server is running on.

### Description

| Apache is a popular web server that includes support for chunk-encoded data according to the HTTP 1.1 standard as described in [RFC2616](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt). There is a vulnerability in the handling of certain chunk-encoded HTTP requests that may allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code.  The Apache Software Foundation has published an advisory describing the details of this vulnerability. This advisory is available on their web site at<http://httpd.apache.org/info/security_bulletin_20020617.txt> |
| --- |

### Impact

| For Apache versions 1.2.2 through 1.3.24 inclusive, this vulnerability may allow the execution of arbitrary code by remote attackers. Exploits are publicly available that claim to allow the execution of arbitrary code.  For Apache versions 2.0 through 2.0.36 inclusive, the condition causing the vulnerability is correctly detected and causes the child process to exit. Depending on a variety of factors, including the threading model supported by the vulnerable system, this may lead to a denial-of-service attack against the Apache web server. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade to the latest version**The Apache Software Foundation has released two new versions of Apache that correct this vulnerability. System administrators can prevent the vulnerability from being exploited by upgrading to Apache version 1.3.26 or 2.0.39.Due to some unexpected problems with version 1.3.25, the CERT/CC has been informed by the Apache Software Foundation that the corrected version of the software is now 1.3.26. Both 1.3.26 and 2.0.39 are available on their web site at<http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/> **Apply a patch from your vendor**If your vendor has provided a patch to correct this vulnerability, you may want to apply that patch rather than upgrading your version of httpd. The CERT/CC is aware of a patch from ISS that corrects some of the impacts associated with this vulnerability. System administrators are encouraged to ensure that the patch they apply is based on the code by the Apache Software Foundation that also corrects additional impacts described in this advisory.More information about vendor-specific patches can be found in the vendor section of this document. |

                           SGI Security Advisory

         Title:  Apache Web Server Chunk Handling vulnerability
        Number:  20020605-01-I
          Date:  July 12, 2002
     Reference:  SGI Security Advisory 20020605-01-A
     Reference:  CERT CA-2002-17
     Reference:  Apache Security Bulletin 20020617
     Reference:  CAN-2002-0392

- -----------------------
- --- Issue Specifics ---
- -----------------------

This bulletin is an update to SGI Security Advisory 20020605-01-A.

It has been reported that versions of the Apache web server up to and
including 1.3.24 and 2.0 up to and including 2.0.36 contain a bug in the
routines which deal with invalid requests which are encoded using chunked
encoding.  This bug can be triggered remotely by sending a carefully crafted
invalid request. This functionality is enabled by default.

See <http://httpd.apache.org/info/security_bulletin_20020617.txt> for
additional details.

SGI has investigated the issues and recommends the following steps for
neutralizing the exposure.  It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that these measures be
implemented on ALL vulnerable SGI systems.

These issues have been corrected in IRIX 6.5.17, where we are now supplying
a fixed version of Apache.  We are also making the fixed version of Apache
available on our security FTP site for prior releases of IRIX.

- --------------
- --- Impact ---
- --------------

The Apache webserver is supplied with IRIX versions since 6.5.12m/f as a
replacement for the older SGI FastTrack server.  It is installed by default,
and is enabled through "chkconfig" by default.

In order to determine if the Apache webserver is installed, execute the
following command:

  # versions -b | grep apache

If the following line is returned you are OK:

I  sgi\_apache           07/10/2002  SGI Web Server based on Apache, 1.3.26

But if either of these are returned you are vulnerable:

I  sgi\_apache           03/20/2001  SGI Apache Server, 1.3.17
I  sgi\_apache           06/10/2001  SGI Apache Server, 1.3.20
I  sgi\_apache           12/06/2001  SGI Web Server based on Apache, 1.3.22

These vulnerabilities might lead to a root compromise in some
configurations, and no local account is required.

These vulnerabilities have been publicly discussed in Usenet newsgroups
and mailing lists.

This vulnerability was assigned the following CVE:
<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2002-0392>

- ----------------------------
- --- Temporary Workaround ---
- ----------------------------

SGI acknowledges that it may not always be possible to immediately install
patches or upgrade the operating system.  In those cases, we recommend
removing the Apache webserver and associated products by using the following
commands:

  # versions remove sgi\_apache\\*
  # versions remove websetup\\*
  # versions remove gateway\\*

It is not necessary to reboot the system after doing this.  You should
upgrade the operating system as soon as it is possible to do so.

- ----------------
- --- Solution ---
- ----------------

SGI has not provided a patch for these issues, but instead has rolled the
fixed Apache distribution into IRIX 6.5.17 and later releases of the
operating system.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------
THIS DOCUMENT IS SUPERSEDED BY ASF BULLETIN 20020620
See http://httpd.apache.org/info/security\_bulletin\_20020620.txt
- ---------------------------------------------------------------
Date: June 17, 2002
Last Updated: June 18, 2002, 14:21 (-0400)
Product: Apache Web Server
Versions: Apache 1.3 all versions including 1.3.24, Apache 2 all versions
up to 2.0.36, Apache 1.2 all versions 1.2.2 onwards.
Introduction:
While testing for Oracle vulnerabilities, Mark Litchfield discovered a
denial of service attack for Apache on Windows. Investigation by the
Apache Software Foundation showed that this issue has a wider scope, which
on some platforms results in a denial of service vulnerability, while on
some other platforms presents a potential a remote exploit vulnerability.
We were also notified today by ISS that they had published the same issue
which has forced the early release of this advisory.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name CVE-2002-0392 to this issue.
Description:
Versions of the Apache web server up to and including 1.3.24 and 2.0 up to
and including 2.0.36 contain a bug in the routines which deal with invalid
requests which are encoded using chunked encoding. This bug can be triggered
remotely by sending a carefully crafted invalid request. This functionality
is enabled by default.
In most cases the outcome of the invalid request is that the child process
dealing with the request will terminate. At the least, this could help a
remote attacker launch a denial of service attack as the parent process
will eventually have to replace the terminated child process and starting
new children uses non-trivial amounts of resources.
On the Windows and Netware platforms, Apache runs one multithreaded child
process to service requests. The teardown and subsequent setup time to
replace the lost child process presents a significant interruption of
service. As the Windows and Netware ports create a new process and reread
the configuration, rather than fork a child process, this delay is much
more pronounced than on other platforms.
In Apache 2.0 the error condition is correctly detected, so it will not
allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server. However
platforms could be using a multithreaded model of multiple concurrent
requests per child process (although the default preference remains
multiple processes with a single thread and request per process, and most
multithreaded models continue to create multiple child processes). Using
any multithreaded model, all concurrent requests currently served by the
affected child process will be lost.
In Apache 1.3 the issue causes a stack overflow. Due to the nature of the
overflow on 32-bit Unix platforms this will cause a segmentation violation
and the child will terminate. However on 64-bit platforms the overflow
can be controlled and so for platforms that store return addresses on the
stack it is likely that it is further exploitable. This could allow
arbitrary code to be run on the server as the user the Apache children are
set to run as. We have been made aware that Apache 1.3 on Windows is
exploitable in a similar way as well.
Users of Apache 1.3 should upgrade to 1.3.26, and users of Apache 2.0
should upgrade to 2.0.39, which contain a fix for this issue.

## History

The CERT Division is the birthplace of cybersecurity. For nearly 30 years, the CERT Division of the SEI has partnered with government, industry, law enforcement, and academia to advance cybersecurity and improve the security and resilience of computer systems and networks.

Originally focused on incident response, we have expanded into cybersecurity areas such as network situational awareness, malicious code analysis, secure coding, resilience management, insider threats, digital investigations and intelligence, workforce development, DevOps, forensics, software assurance, vulnerability discovery and analysis, and risk management.

## Former Director Richard Pethia

[Richard Pethia](/about/leadership/display.cfm?customel_datapageid_2623=3545) was founding director of the SEI's CERT Division. Pethia, who served as director of CERT from 1988 to 2016, guided the organization through tremendous growth and change. Under Pethia's leadership, the unit expanded and evolved from the CERT Coordination Center—a small group focused on computer incident response—to a research organization of more than 200 professionals dedicated to solving problems with widespread cybersecurity implications.
