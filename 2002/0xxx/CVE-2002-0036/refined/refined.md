Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described, which is related to CVE-2002-0036:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies within the MIT Kerberos V5 implementation's ASN.1 decoder. The decoder fails to perform proper bounds checking on the length fields of data elements in Kerberos messages. Specifically, a large unsigned data element length can be misinterpreted as a negative signed value.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Bounds Checking:** The primary weakness is the absence of validation on the length of data elements before memory allocation. This allows an attacker to send messages with crafted length fields.
*   **Integer Misinterpretation:** The ASN.1 decoder misinterprets large unsigned length values as negative signed values, leading to the allocation of negative or unreasonably large amounts of memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial-of-service condition. When the Kerberos application (e.g., the Key Distribution Center - KDC) attempts to allocate memory based on the malformed length field, it can crash. This can render the Kerberos service unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Networked Messages:** The attack vector is through malformed Kerberos protocol messages sent over the network to vulnerable Kerberos applications, including the KDC and application servers.
*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by an attacker sending a specially crafted Kerberos message.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the target Kerberos service.
*   **Understanding of Kerberos Protocol:** The attacker needs some knowledge of the Kerberos protocol to craft messages with malformed length fields that can trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability can affect both the Kerberos KDC and application servers using the vulnerable MIT Kerberos V5 library.
*   The issue was fixed in MIT Kerberos V5 version 1.2.5.
*   The provided advisory also mentions other vulnerabilities in older Kerberos releases which are listed with their respective CERT VU numbers:
    * VU#661243 - MIT Kerberos V5 KDC vulnerable to denial-of-service via null pointer dereference
    * VU#684563 - MIT Kerberos V5 allows inter-realm user impersonation by malicious realm controllers with shared keys
    * VU#787523 - MIT Kerberos V5 KDC logging routines use unsafe format strings
