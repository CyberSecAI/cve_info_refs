- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability exists because Windows 2000 allows Group Policy files to be opened in an exclusive-read mode. This prevents other users from reading the files, which is necessary for applying new Group Policy settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to lock Group Policy files using exclusive-read access, thus preventing new policy settings from being applied.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can block the application of new Group Policy settings, allowing them to retain older settings or default settings. This affects not only the attacker but also any other users logging in while the files are locked.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves a legitimate user logging onto the domain, opening Group Policy files in exclusive read mode, then logging on a second time, preventing the application of group policy.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be a legitimate user with valid domain credentials and the ability to log on to the network.
