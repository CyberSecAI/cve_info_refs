## Multiple vulnerabilities in SNMPv1 trap handling

#### Vulnerability Note VU#107186

Original Release Date: 2002-01-16 | Last Revised: 2007-11-07

---

### Overview

Multiple vendor [SNMPv1](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1157.txt) *Trap* handling implementations contain vulnerabilities that may allow unauthorized privileged access, denial-of-service conditions, or unstable behavior . If your site uses SNMP in any capacity, the CERT/CC encourages you to read the information provided below.

### Description

| The [Oulu University Secure Programming Group](http://www.ee.oulu.fi/research/ouspg/) (OUSPG) has reported numerous vulnerabilities in multiple vendor SNMPv1 implementations. By applying the [PROTOS c06-SNMPv1 test suite](http://www.ee.oulu.fi/research/ouspg/protos/testing/c06/snmpv1/0100.html) to a variety of popular SNMPv1-enabled products, the OUSPG revealed a number of vulnerabilities across a wide range of products. This vulnerability note focuses on vulnerabilities occurring in code responsible for SNMPv1 trap handling.  SNMPv1 supports five different types of messages: *GetRequest, SetRequest, GetNextRequest, GetResponse,* and *Trap.* A single SNMP message is referred to as a Protocol Data Unit (PDU). These messages are described using Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) and translated into binary format using Basic Encoding Rules (BER). SNMP trap messages are sent from agents to managers. Trap messages are unsolicited (the manager does not issue a request message) and may indicate a warning or error condition or otherwise notify the manager about the agent's state. SNMP managers should reliably decode trap messages and process the resulting application data. OUSPG performed two sets of tests of SNMP trap message handling: one test focused on ASN.1 decoding, the second looked for exceptions in the processing of the decoded data.The results yielded multiple vulnerabilities in both the ASN.1 decoding and the subsequent processing of SNMP trap messages by many different SNMP managers. Vulnerabilities include denial-of-service conditions, format string vulnerabilities, and buffer overflows. Some vulnerabilities do not require the request message to use the correct SNMP community string.**Additional Background Information on the OUSPG**OUSPG is a academic research group located at [Oulu University](http://www.oulu.fi/Welcome.html) in Finland. The purpose of this research group is to test software for vulnerabilities.  History has shown that the techniques used by the OUSPG have discovered a large number of previously undetected problems in the products and protocols they have tested. In 2001, the OUSPG produced a comprehensive test suite for evaluating implementations of the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). This test suite was developed with the strategy of stressing protocol implementations in unsupported and unexpected ways, and it was very effective in uncovering a wide variety of vulnerabilities across several products. This approach can reveal vulnerabilities that would not manifest themselves under normal operating conditions.  After completing its work on LDAP, OUSPG moved its focus to SNMPv1. As with LDAP, they designed a custom test suite, began testing a selection of products, and found a number of vulnerabilities. Because OUSPG's work on LDAP was similar in procedure to its current work on SNMP, you may wish to review the [LDAP Test Suite](http://www.ee.oulu.fi/research/ouspg/protos/testing/c06/ldapv3/) and [CERT Advisory CA-2001-18](http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2001-18.html), which outlined results of application of the test suite.  In order to test the security of protocols like SNMPv1, the [PROTOS](http://www.ee.oulu.fi/research/ouspg/protos/) project presents a server with a wide variety of sample packets containing unexpected values or illegally formatted data. As a member of the PROTOS project consortium, the OUSPG used the [PROTOS c06-snmpv1 test suite](http://www.ee.oulu.fi/research/ouspg/protos/testing/c06/snmpv1/0100.html) to study several implementations of the SNMPv1 protocol. Results of the test suites run against SNMP indicate that there are many different vulnerabilities on many different implementations of SNMP. **Background Information on the Simple Network Management Protocol**  The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is the most popular protocol in use to manage networked devices. SNMP was designed in the late 80's to facilitate the exchange of management information between networked devices, operating at the application layer of the ISO/OSI model. The SNMP protocol enables network and system administrators to remotely monitor and configure devices on the network (devices such as switches and routers). Software and firmware products designed for networks often make use of the SNMP protocol. SNMP runs on a multitude of devices and operating systems, including, but not limited to, Core Network Devices (Routers, Switches, Hubs, Bridges, and Wireless Network Access Points) Consumer Broadband Network Devices (Cable Modems and DSL Modems) Consumer Electronic Devices (Cameras and Image Scanners) Networked Office Equipment (Printers, Copiers, and FAX Machines) Network and Systems Management/Diagnostic Frameworks (Network Sniffers and Network Analyzers) Networked Medical Equipment (Imaging Units and Oscilloscopes) Manufacturing and Processing Equipment  The SNMPv1 protocol is formally defined in [RFC1157](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1157.txt). Quoting from that RFC: *Implicit in the SNMP architectural model is a collection of network management stations and network elements. Network management stations execute management applications which monitor and control network elements. Network elements are devices such as hosts, gateways, terminal servers, and the like, which have management agents responsible for performing the network management functions requested by the network management stations. The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is used to communicate management information between the network management stations and the agents in the network elements.*  Additionally, SNMP is discussed in a number of other RFC documents: [RFC 3000](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3000.txt) *Internet Official Protocol Standards* [RFC 1212](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1212.txt) *Concise MIB Definitions* [RFC 1213](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1213.txt) *Management Information Base for Network Management of TCP/IP-based Internets: MIB-II* [RFC 1215](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1215.txt) *A Convention for Defining Traps for use with the SNMP* [RFC 1270](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1270.txt) *SNMP Communications Services* [RFC 2570](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2570.txt) *Introduction to Version 3 of the Internet-standard Network Management Framework* [RFC 2571](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2571.txt) *An Architecture for Describing SNMP Management Frameworks* [RFC 2572](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2572.txt) *Message Processing and Dispatching for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)* [RFC 2573](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2573.txt) *SNMP Applications* [RFC 2574](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2574.txt) *User-based Security Model (USM) for version 3 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv3)* [RFC 2575](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2575.txt) *View-based Access Control Model (VACM) for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)* [RFC 2576](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2576.txt) *Coexistence between Version 1, Version 2, and Version 3 of the Internet-standard Network Management Framework* |

### Vendor Statement

| **Overview**On February 12, 2002, the CERT® Coordination Center of Carnegie-Mellon University issued an advisory identifying possible security vulnerabilities of multiple vendor products that utilize the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) for management of those products. This advisory was based on research done by the University of Oulu in Finland. The complete advisory may be found on the CERT web site at: <http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2002-03.html>. If your site uses SNMP-based CNT products in any capacity, we encourage you to read this advisory. **I. Description**The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a widely deployed protocol that is commonly used to monitor and manage network devices. Version 1 of the protocol (SNMPv1) defines several types of SNMP messages that are used to request information or configuration changes, respond to requests, enumerate SNMP objects, and send unsolicited alerts. The [Oulu University Secure Programming Group](http://www.ee.oulu.fi/research/ouspg/) (OUSPG, <http://www.ee.oulu.fi/research/ouspg/>) has reported vulnerabilities in SNMPv1 implementations from many different vendors. OUSPG's research focused on the manner in which SNMPv1 agents and managers handle request and trap messages. By applying the [PROTOS c06-snmpv1 test suite](http://www.ee.oulu.fi/research/ouspg/protos/testing/c06/snmpv1/0100.html) (<http://www.ee.oulu.fi/research/ouspg/protos/testing/c06/snmpv1/0100.html>) to a variety of popular SNMPv1-enabled products, the OUSPG revealed the following vulnerabilities:  [VU#107186](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/107186) - **Multiple vulnerabilities in SNMPv1 trap handling**SNMP trap messages are sent from agents to managers. A trap message may indicate a warning or error condition or otherwise notify the manager about the agent's state. SNMP managers must properly decode trap messages and process the resulting data. In testing, OUSPG found multiple vulnerabilities in the way many SNMP managers decode and process SNMP trap messages.  [VU#854306](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/854306) - **Multiple vulnerabilities in SNMPv1 request handling**SNMP request messages are sent from managers to agents. Request messages might be issued to obtain information from an agent or to instruct the agent to configure the host device. SNMP agents must properly decode request messages and process the resulting data. In testing, OUSPG found multiple vulnerabilities in the way many SNMP agents decode and process SNMP request messages.  Vulnerabilities in the decoding and subsequent processing of SNMP messages by both managers and agents may result in denial-of-service conditions, format string vulnerabilities, and buffer overflows. Some vulnerabilities do not require the SNMP message to use the correct SNMP community string.  **II. CNT® Products**CNT has a number of products affected by the SNMP vulnerabilities described above. Each CNT product with SNMP functionality is described below along with the specific vulnerability, or lack thereof, of that product and the recommended procedures to follow with that product.     * **UltraNet® Storage Director**The UltraNet Storage Director (USD) was tested with the PROTOS test suite. Two tests caused snmpd on the USD to abort and restart; the snmpd responded to requests specifying a community string beginning with a null; several minor ASN.1 / BER handling discrepancies related to invalid encodings were noted. Corrective code for the snmpd aborts and the community string handling issue has been developed and successfully tested. This code will be made available in the USD 2.7 software release, currently scheduled for availability in April 2002. The ASN.1 / BER invalid encoding handling issues will be addressed in a future release. CNT recommends upgrading to the USD 2.7 software release as soon as it is available. * **UltraNet Edge Storage Router**The UltraNet Edge Storage Router (Edge) was tested with the PROTOS test suite. Three tests caused the Edge to hang or abort, requiring a reboot. Corrective code for these errors has been developed and successfully tested. The Edge responded to requests specifying a bad SNMP version number; several minor ASN.1 / BER handling discrepancies related to invalid encodings were noted. The responded to bad SNMP version number and the ASN.1 / BER invalid encoding handling issues will be addressed in a future release. This code will be made available in the Edge software release 1.4.1, currently scheduled for release in April 2002. CNT recommends upgrading the Edge to release 1.4.1 as soon as it is available. * **Channelink®**The Channelink product was tested with the PROTOS test suite. All tests ran successfully. No failures occurred. No corrective action is required with the Channelink product. * **WebView**The WebView SNMP-based element manager was tested with the PROTOS test suite. WebView is not affected by the recent SNMP vulnerabilities found by CERT. No corrective action is required with the WebView product. * **UltraNet CMF**The CastleRock software upon which CNT's UltraNet CMF SNMP-based management software is based was tested with the PROTOS test suite. CastleRock has reported two test failures. Corrective code for these errors has been developed and is now being tested within UltraNet CMF. This code will be made available in the CMF release 6.4, currently scheduled for release in early May 2002. CNT recommends upgrading CMF to release 6.4 as soon as it is available.  **III. CNT Product Upgrades**CNT will continue to test new releases of its products against the PROTOS test suite to ensure that additional vulnerabilities are not introduced as a result of any new releases. To determine whether a new CNT product release is available and how to upgrade to that release when available, contact CNT Technical Support (800-752-8061 or 763-268-6600) or contact your company's CNT Technical Account Engineer (TAE). |

These potential vulnerabilities are applicable toSNMPv1 trap handling and SNMPv1 Request handling. The CERT articleoutlines vulnerabilities that can cause SNMP services to stopfunctioning and in some cases may enable "unauthorized access,""denial of service attacks" or may cause system instability.IMPACT:Compaq NonStop Himalaya Servers:Compaq TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS:Compaq Tru64 UNIX:Compaq Insight Management Suite:Compaq Deskpro, Professional Workstation, Armada, Evo:Compaq SANworks Hardware:Compaq StorageWorks ProductsCompaq/Microcom Products:Compaq's findings to date regarding the SNMPv1 issues are asfollows:\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_Compaq NonStop Himalaya Servers:The Compaq Himalaya NonStop Kernel prohibits execution of code on thestack or heap by hardware TLB permissions (read/write only),preventing Trojan horse attacks by embedding code within the bufferoverflow area. However, process ABENDs can occur.The SNMP agent ABENDs in the c06-snmpv1 buffer-overflow tests.This affects forwarding trap messages and/or sending info responsesto SNMP managers.Sub-agents use IPCs to communicate with the SNMP agent, so theycannot be directly attacked.  More importantly, sub-agents areconfined to information only requests, so they cannot be used toconfigure/manage their sub-systems. Our investigation an analysis iscontinuing and further updates will be provided.IPMs to address the ABEND problem of the SNMP are in development andwill be released as soon as verification is complete. Availability ofthese IPMs will be announced in future updates. The exposure toSNMP agent ABENDs can be reduced by running the SNMP agent as aprocess-pair or by configuring auto-restart in the PersistenceManager.\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_Compaq TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS:There is some impact to the SNMP agent provided with Compaq TCP/IPServices for OpenVMS. This problem can cause the SNMP agent to ACCVIOand terminate temporarily denying service to SNMP, but in most casesafter this occurs Compaq TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS will restartthe SNMP agent in response to the next SNMP request. There are noknown risks of compromising system security due to this problem.The SNMP agent executes from a non-privileged process, whichprevents any compromise to system security.Our investigation and analysis has determined the cause of theproblem. The updated images for Compaq TCP/IP Services for OpenVMSare now in final test. Compaq will provide updates to Compaq TCP/IPServices for OpenVMS in the next ECO and also in the next release,Compaq TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS V5.3. Contact Compaq's CustomerSupport Center if an earlier updated is required.\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_Compaq Tru64 UNIX:UPDATE: 02 April, 2002There is no known risk of compromising Tru64 UNIX system securitydue to the recent SNMP attack.  The SNMP agent provided withTru64 UNIX is susceptible to a limited problem - the SNMPagent may stop responding to SNMP requests, or it may incur asegmentation fault, generate a core file, and exit. Either scenariodenies SNMP service to SNMP-based network management applications.However,  we have not found the attack to cause the system to beunstable, vulnerable to "unauthorized access",  or subject to anydenial of service other than to the SNMP service.Impacted Tru64 UNIX operating system versions include:Tru64 UNIX 4.0f, 4.0g, 5.0a, 5.1, 5.1a.SOLUTION:  Until the Tru64 UNIX fixes are available in the mainstream release  patch kits, Compaq is releasing the following Early Release Patch  Kit(s) (ERPs) publicly for use by any customer.  The Early Release Patch kits use dupatch to install and will not  install over any Customer-Specific-Patches (CSPs) which have file  intersections with the ERPs.

No problems were found in this testing.Additionally, Compaq is in the process of evaluating the details ofthe SNMP implementation in this product. Any problems identified thatare determined to pose a risk to customer operations will bedocumented and addressed in future maintenance releases. Note thatthe advisory documented two areas of vulnerability. One area involvesTrap handling on the part of SNMP Management components, and theother area involves the processing of GET, Set and Get Next commandson the part of SNMP Agent components. The director implements onlythe SNMP Agent components, so none of the problems related to Traphandling apply. Also, the SNMP Agent on the director managementserver is disabled by default.  No SNMP messages are processed bythe management server unless the systems administrator has explicitlyenabled the SNMP Agent.  On the director itself, the SNMP Agent isenabled by default, but for read access only.Compaq StorageWorks Modular Data Router:The potential vulnerability has to do with SNMP Set commands.The only Set command the MDR allows is to set the trap address.Compaq StorageWorks 12 Port Fibre Channel Managed Hub:Compaq is in the process of evaluating the SNMP implementationin this product.Compaq StorageWorks 20/40 GB 8 Cassette AutoLoader:Compaq is in the process of evaluating the SNMP implementationin this product.\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_COMPAQ/MICROCOM PRODUCTS:UPDATE: MARCH 08, 2002\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_Microcom Access Integrator (All Versions)Compaq-Microcom 6000 Series Remote Access Concentrators(All Versions)Both products use SNMPv1 protocol as the transport for systemmanagement, either through expressWATCH, or third party SNMP clients.These products are normally managed over the LAN by clients using IPports UDP 161 for SNMP and UDP 162 for SNMP Traps.  The SNMP agentsintegrated in these products cannot be disabled. Access to the systemvia the PRI, T1 or analog modules do not present a security riskrelated to SNMPv1.Incursions may result in instability of the system requiring a hardreset of one or more of the systems modules, which will result intemporary loss of connectivity to dial in clients. Users will beable to reconnect after the systems has reset.RECOMMENDATIONS:Compaq recommends the following precautions in accordance with goodgeneral networking administration practices.1. Apply perimeter filtering to SNMP traffic. Upstreaminternet routers, or Firewall should be configured to filterUDP ports 161 and 162.2. Compaq has always recommended that the associatedengines contained in the CM6000 Series reside on an internalnetwork using a non-routable private addressing scheme.3. The system should not be managed over the internet oran non secure LAN.\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_Microcom ISPorte (All Versions)Compaq Microcom 4000 concentratorThese products make very limited use of the SNMPv1 protocol onthe Ethernet portion of their PRI/T1 modules. In the limitednumber of installations where digital calls are being tunneledto NT servers on the connected LAN, there is a potential forSNMP packets to reach the PRI/T1 card through it's Ethernetport. Access to the system via the analog modem modules donot present security risk related to SNMPv1.Incursions may result in instability of the PRI/T1 card, resultingin a loss of connectivity for dial in users. A hard reset is theonly way to correct these failure, but a hard reset will alsodisconnect all remaining users. Users will be able to reconnectafter the system resets.RECOMMENDATIONS:Compaq recommends the following precautions in accordance with goodgeneral networking administration practices.1. Apply perimeter filtering to SNMP traffic. Upstream internetrouters should be configured to filter UDP ports 161 and 162.2.

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

| All versions of BIG-IP, 3-DNS, GLOBAL-SITE and EDGE-FX are vulnerable if the SNMP agent is enabled. Most versions have the SNMP agent enabled by default. Patches are available for all affected versions. SEE-IT is not affected by this vulnerability.  If a customer is unable to install the patch, the SNMP service may be disabled. Below are instructions for obtaining patches and for disabling the SNMP service for each vulnerable product.  **BIG-IP**  A patch exists to correct this problem. Please see <http://tech.f5.com/home/bigip/solutions/security/sol1622.html> .  Alternatively, you can simply disable the SNMP service using the instructions below:   1.Log in to the BIG-IP Configuration utility.2.Navigate to the SNMP section. For version 4.0 and above this is a tab under **System Administration**.3.De-select the Enable box at the top of the screen and click the **Apply** button.  This will disable the SNMP service on BIG-IP. **3-DNS**  A patch exists to correct this problem. Please see <http://tech.f5.com/home/3dns/solutions/security/sol1624.html> .  Alternatively, you can simply disable the SNMP service using the instructions below:   1.Log in to the 3-DNS Configuration utility.2.Navigate to the SNMP section. This is the tab under **3-DNS Sync** .3.De-select the **Enable** box at the top of the screen and click the Apply button.4.Log in to the Command Line Interface of the 3-DNS.5.Run the following command:   kill -9 `ps -ax | grep snmpd | awk '{print $1}'` This will disable the SNMP service on 3-DNS. **GLOBAL-SITE**  A patch exists to correct this problem. Please see <http://tech.f5.com/home/globalsite/solutions/security/sol1626.html>.  Alternatively, you can simply disable the SNMP service using the instructions below:  **GLOBAL-SITE version 2.2**  To disable the SNMP agent for GLOBAL-SITE version 2.2, type the following command from the command prompt:  ITCMconsole service snmpd stop  This command stops the **snmpd** agent.  ITCMconsole service snmpd disable  This command disables **snmpd** so it does not start again at the next boot.  To verify the status of **snmpd**, enter the following command:  ITCMconsole show snmpd status  **GLOBAL-SITE version 2.1PTF-01 and earlier:**  On versions 2.1 PTF-01 and earlier, **snmpd** is not running by default so the GLOBAL-SITE Controller should not be affected. However, if you have enabled **snmpd** manually, you should disable it.  **EDGE-FX**  A patch exists to correct this problem. Please see <http://tech.f5.com/home/edgefx/solutions/security/sol1625.html> .  Alternatively, you can simply disable the SNMP service using the instructions below:  There are three SNMP daemons running on the cache. By default, the EDGE-FX Cache runs the **snmpd**, the **edgefxsnmpd**, and Inktomi's **snmpdm** . **Disabling snmpd and edgefxsnmpd**  To disable and stop the SNMP agents, you should use the ITCMconsole. Type the following commands from the command prompt:  ITCMconsole service snmpd stop  This command stops the **snmpd** agent.  ITCMconsole service snmpd disable  This command disables **snmpd** so it does not start again at the next boot.    To verify the status of **snmpd**, enter the following command:  ITCMconsole show snmpd status    Once the **snmpd** and **edgefxsnmpd** daemons are disabled, no other snmp traffic will be accepted.  **Disabling snmpdm**  The **snmpdm** agent, is also enabled by default. This Inktomi specific agent can be disabled or killed. In order to avoid traffic server anomalies, you should not kill this this daemon.  According to CERT® Advisory [CA-2002-03](http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2002-03.html) :  "Inktomi Corporation does not believe our [Inktomi] CDS product is vulnerable. Vulnerability would stem from the use of SNMP Research software in the CDS product. However, SNMP Research has stated that their product Emanate, versions 15.x and higher, is not vulnerable. As Inktomi's CDS uses Emanate 15.3, we [Inktomi] conclude that CDS is not vulnerable."  Inktomi's CDS contains the same Traffic Server that EDGE-FX utilizes, which contains the Emanate 15.3 daemon (**snmpdm**).  If you still want to kill this SNMP agent, you can use the Configuration utility or the command line.  To disable the SNMP agent from the Configuration utility:   1.From your browser, access the Configuration utility (refer to [Accessing the Configuration utility](http://tech.f5.com/home/edgefx/manuals/edgefx2_2/edgefx2_2admin/Getstart.html#51335)).2.On the Configure tab, click the **Server** button.3.Scroll to the SNMP section of the Server Basics page.4.Click the **SNMP Agent Off** radio button.5.Click the **Make These Changes** button.   To disable the SNMP agent manually:   1.In a text editor, open the **records.config** file located in the EDGE-FX Cache’s **/config/traffic\_server/config** directory.2.Edit the following variable:   proxy.config.snmp.master\_agent\_enabled  Set this variable to **0** to disable SNMP on the EDGE-FX Cache node.  3.Save and close the **records.config** file.4.Make the **/usr/local/cache/bin** directory the working directory and run the following command to apply the configuration changes.   ./traffic\_line -x **Note:** you can also use the following command to restart the traffic\_server: start\_traffic\_server.  **SEE-IT** It has been determined that SEE-IT is not vulnerable. |

### [Fluke Corporation](#IAFY-59KMPS) Affected

Updated:  April 26, 2002

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

| Fluke Networks' response to CERT Advisory 2002-03           The CERT® Coordination Center recently announced that numerous            vulnerabilities have been reported in multiple vendors' SNMP            implementations. For your information, Fluke Networks has created           the following Q&A which includes a tutorial, Using Fluke Networks            products to manage SNMP risk on your network.            Q&A           What is the actual risk?            The impact of the vulnerability is different for each vendor and            their own products. For SNMP agents and Trap listeners running on            network operating systems, some attacks could bypass system security            controls. Overall, most attacks resulted in a �nial-of-service” in            which the entire product or portions of the product stopped working            properly.            Which Fluke Networks products are affected?            Fluke Networks has tested its products that listen for SNMP Traps or            contain an internal SNMP agent. It has been discovered that some            circumstances exist that could potentially cause a            �nial-of-service” condition for a Fluke Networks product, forcing            the product to “hang” or reboot. However, this situation would only            affect Fluke Networks products and would not compromise our            customers’ networks.            Fluke Networks products that could be affected include the OptiView™            Integrated Network Analyzer, the OptiView™ Workgroup Analyzer and            the OptiView™ Link Analyzer.            As of this writing, there have been no known "denial-of-service"            incidents reported with Fluke Networks products. To reiterate,            should such an event occur involving a Fluke Networks product, this            would not affect the operation of customers' networks or any of            their network infrastructures. Nor would there be any risk of anyone            externally gaining access to customer data.            Future action            At this time, we plan to resolve all known vulnerabilities in the            next scheduled software update for the affected products. Customers            who participate in the Gold Priority Support program will be            eligible to receive these updates as part of their membership.            Customers who do not participate in this program should contact our            Technical Assistance Center (TAC) at 1-800-638-3497 (North America)            or +1-425-446-4519 (Outside North America).            Recommendations            We recommend the following "best practices" to reduce the potential            risk of SNMP related attacks:               1.   Ensure that yourexternal firewalls deny all incoming SNMP traffic.           2.   Change the default community strings for all SNMP devices. Audit                 your network for devices using the community strings of "public"                and "private" as well as for those other community strings that                are set by default by equipment manufacturers.           3.   Analyze SNMP traffic for patterns of attack.           Tutorial: Using Fluke Networks products to manage this risk on your            network           1. Identify SNMP agents on the network           The OptiView Integrated Network Analyzer and OptiView Workgroup            Analyzer have the capability of discovering all devices within a            broadcast domain that are SNMP enabled.            On the Setup/Security screen, configure all known and old community            strings making sure you include strings such as "public", "private"            and "security".            Re-run the tests by selecting the "Rerun Test" tab.            Select the "Discovery" tab and then select the SNMP Agents category            in the left hand pane. The resulting display shows all SNMP agents            discovered by the test.            2. Test your firewall for filtering SNMP traffic           From a LAN segment outside your firewall, use the OptiView            Integrated Network Analyzer to query known SNMP agents on the            protected side of your network. After the "Network-Under-Test"            interface has a proper IP configuration, enter the IP address of a            known SNMP agent on the Tools screen.            Note: Using Fluke Networks’ Protocol Expert™ on the protected side            of your firewall, allows you to see if the firewall is denying any            and all SNMP traffic from flowing through the firewall as well as            preventing SNMP responses from leaving your network.            Using two OptiView Analyzers, one on either side of the firewall,            can be used to easily check this condition. Use the Packet Capture            and Statistics feature to ensure that no SNMP traffic is flowing in            from outside of the firewall.            3. Analyze network patterns for SNMP attacks           Using the OptiView Integrated Network Analyzer, the OptiView            Workgroup Analyzer or the OptiView Link Analyzer, a combination of            packet capture and protocol statistics can be used to gather            evidence of an SNMP attack.            Select the "Top Hosts" tab to look for nodes that should not be            sending SNMP queries. Select the "Top Conversations" to check for            unusual Conversation Pairs within the SNMP traffic.               Fluke Networks' Copper and Fiber taps can be used to access            switch-to-switch links and the Switch-TAP™ capability of the            OptiView™ Inspector Console can be used to program the mirror ports            of a variety of switches.            For more information            For questions, concerns or more information, please contact the            Fluke Networks TAC at 1-800-638-3497 (North America),            +1-425-446-4519 (outside North America) or email us at:            nettech@flukenetworks.com. |

### [IPlanet](#IAFY-55KRE9) Affected

Notified:  October 17, 2001  Updated: August 28, 2002

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

| Update on CERT ALERT CA-2002-03 iPlanet has identified a problem in the CERT Alert CA-2002-03, regarding implementations of its directory server and web proxy server. The SNMP agent (magt) daemon supplied with the Admin Server component of Netscape Directory Server 4.1x,  iPlanet Directory Server 5.0,  iPlanet Directory Server 5.1 and iPlanet Web Proxy Server 3.6 on UNIX platforms is vulnerable to a malformed request. The malformed request will cause the "magt" daemon to abruptly exit, so that it will no longer accept requests.  The "magt" daemon is not included in the Admin Server component of the Netscape Directory Server or iPlanet Directory Server on the Windows NT, Windows 2000 platforms and is not used on AIX platforms, so the Directory Server and Web Proxy Server are not affected on these platforms. This vulnerability is present in the following versions running on Unix platforms: Netscape Directory Server 4.12, 4.13, 4.14, 4.15 and 4.16 iPlanet Directory Server 5.0, 5.0SP1 and 5.1 iPlanet Web Proxy Server 3.6 We do not believe that this vulnerability affects the overall integrity of the directory server or web proxy server  in any way. As a general practice, we recommend disabling all services affected by the "magt" daemon that are not explicitly required until a patch is downloaded and installed. If you are not using SNMP to monitor the directory server, we recommend that you do not run the "magt" daemon process. You can also limit your exposure to this vulnerability by using a firewall to restrict access to the UDP port on which "magt" receives incoming SNMP requests. Patches and Service packs fixing this problem will be posted under <http://www.iplanet.com/downloads/patches/>.   Version Recommended action Directory Server 4.1x Install standalone "magt" patch Directory Server 5.0 Upgrade to 5.0SP2 or install "magt" patch Directory Server 5.0SP1 Upgrade to 5.0SP2 or install "magt" patch Directory Server 5.1 Install standalone "magt" patch iPlanet Web Proxy Server 3.6 Install standalone "magt" patchiPlanet products, such as iPlanet Application Server Enterprise Edition6.x, bundling the above mentioned products are also affected.  Installingthe appropriate Directory Server patches and/or service pack isrecommended.iPlanet customers with questions on this advisory are requested to contact iPlanet Technical Support who will provide full support and up-to-date information. |

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

| Network Harmoni's response to CERT Advisory CA-2002-03The CERT/CC is part of the Networked Systems Survivability (NSS)Program at the Software Engineering Institute (SEI), Carnegie MellonUniversity. The primary goal of the NSS Program is to ensure thatappropriate technology and systems management practices are used toresist attacks on networked systems and to limit damage and ensurecontinuity of critical services in spite of successful attacks.On February 12th, 2002, CERT issued two advisories that warn ofproblems that could arise as the result of improper handling ofmalformed packets by applications using SNMP protocols.  The OuluUniversity Secure Programming Group (OUSPG) had discovered thatimproperly formed packets in the form of trap messages to SMNPmanagers and request messages to SNMP agents had caused problems in anumber of SNMP based products.  A list of vendors, with productsbased on SNMP, was compiled by CERT, and they were notified directlyalong with the press and analyst community covering the NetworkManagement space.Once we were notified of the situation, we immediately beganregression testing our agent software against the entire Protos TestSuite: c06-snmpv1 used by Oulu University to discover these twopacket handling vulnerabilities.  Because we are not currentlyoffering products that accept trap messages, testing was focused onthe ability of our SNMP agents to handle malformed SNMP requestswithout incident.  It was discovered through our testing that bothRMONplus and SLAplus are potentially vulnerable to this method ofdisruption and will exhibit unpredictable behavior as a result ofrunning this test suite. Rather than issue a patch, we have mademodification to both versions of our agent to correct this problem.Customers concerned about vulnerabilities related to CERT AdvisoryCA-2002-03 should contact NETWORK HARMONi atsupport@networkharmoni.com for a new build.Current status (Wednesday 2/20/2002 4:00 PM):RMONplus & SLAplus (Builds 232 and above)Sun Solaris - Passed All testsWindows XP - Passed All testsWindows 2000 - Passed All testsWindows NT - Passed All testsHP-UX - Passed All testsIBM AIX - Passed All testsLinux - Passed All tests |

Affected

### Vendor Statement

| Openwave Systems Inc. ackowledges the potential of SNMP vulnerabilitiesdescribed in [VU#107186 and VU#854306].  Openwave embeds SNMPin their messaging products for the purpose of internal measuring andmonitoring of the messaging system.  The vulnerabilities listed above cancause denial of service of the SNMP service when specific malformed packetsare delivered, but since most customers do not allow SNMP trafficthrough their firewall, and only utilize SNMP inside their firewall forthe purpose of internal monitoring, they should be immuneto the SNMP vulnerabilities listed above.  Even if SNMP trafficis allowed through the firewall, or no firewall is employed, the SNMPvulnerabilities above can at most cause denial of service of the SNMPservices and cannot cause either unprivleged access or denial of serviceof the messaging products themselves.A patch will be made available by Openwave to address the SNMPvulnerabilities.  Customers can determine if a patch is neededby inspecting their version of snmpdm via the following command:  *% ./snmpdm -d*Versions which are 15.3.1.7 or greater have no vulnerability.  Customerswho require upgrades to their version of snmpdm should contact their OpenwaveTechnical Support representative for availability of a patch on theirspecific product line.Some customers additionally use a toolkit delivered by Openwavecalled the "TACPAC".  This toolkit contains a utility calledsnmptrapd which is also vulnerable to the SNMP issues mentionedabove.  Customers who use this tool are encouraged tocontact their Openwave Technical Support representative to obtaina new version of the tool which removes the vulnerabilities. |

### Vendor Statement

| SNMP Request and Trap Handling Security AdvisoryRevision 1.0Release Date: 03/01/02Sniffer Technologies has prepared this advisory regarding SNMP inSniffer Technologies products.  This advisory contains specificinstructions on how to disable these services where security may be anissue.An update regarding this issue will be sent to all Sniffer Technologiescustomers on Wednesday, March 13, 2002.  The Sniffer Technologies teamis working diligently to fully resolve this issue.  If you have furtherquestions in the interim, please contact technical support.What is the SNMP security risk?On February 12, 2002, The CERT Coordination Center issued a warning thata broad array of network equipment used on the Internet -- includingswitches, routers, hubs, printers and operating systems -- may bevulnerable to an SNMP-related attack that could cause equipment to failor allow an attacker to take control of it. Though not mentioned ontheir list of vendors, our Sniffer Distributed product is another suchdevice that may have this inherent SNMP vulnerability because of itsRMON/SNMP capabilities.There are two areas in our product that can be affected by this securityconcern.1. The RMON/SNMP features of our Sniffer Distributed Appliance2. The Trap Capture application at our SniffView ConsoleIn both cases, these SNMP commands can be disabled on our product if notin use.Can I avoid using these features in the Sniffer Distributed Productwithout affecting the capabilities of the Sniffer Product?Yes, you can disable the SNMP/RMON capabilities of the product andutilize our proprietary method of logging network statistics and ExpertSymptom and Diagnosis to disk for reporting with Reporter and/or SnifferWatch.  This method does not utilize SNMP and therefore is notsusceptible to the SNMP vulnerability.  You will still have the samestatistics and reports that are available using the SNMP/RMON featuresof the product, with the addition of the Expert Symptoms and Diagnosiswhich are unique to our method of logging and reporting.How do I turn off these SNMP capabilities in the product?Turning off SNMP at the Sniffer Distributed Appliance:By default, the SNMP and RMON features of the Sniffer DistributedAppliance are enabled.  To turn off these features, follow theprocedures below.1. Either Start Probe Viewer at the Sniffer Distributed Appliance, or"Configure" an Agent from your SniffView Console.2. Select the SNMP tab.3. Disable SNMP Trap4. Disable SNMP/RMON.5. Restart the Sniffer Distributed Appliance for changes to take effect.Turning off the SNMP Trap Capture at the SniffView Console:By default, when you install the SniffView Console a program called TrapCapture automatically gets installed and runs in the background.   Thisprogram can accept SNMP Traps from Sniffer Distributed Appliances aswell as other SNMP devices.  Follow the procedures below to turn it off:1. Start the SniffView Alarm Manager.2. Select Toggle Trap capture.  The Trap capture program will bedisabled. However, if you reboot the PC the SniffView Console is runningon it will turn itself back on.  Therefore you must remember to disableit again.Will these features be disabled in the future?Yes, the SNMP/RMON features of the product will be disabled by defaultstarting with the Sniffer Distributed v4.1 (with Support for WebConsole) version.What if I require these features?If you require these features then there are a few steps that you cantake to protect yourself from this security concern.1.    Under the SNMP Tab (see above) Change Community name from "public" tosomething else.2.    Using routers and/or firewalls, control SNMP access to the SnifferDistributed Appliances or SniffView Console to ensure the trafficoriginates from known management systems and addresses.3.    Filter SNMP services at your network perimeter (ingress/egressfiltering).4.    Segregate network management traffic onto a separate network. (i.e. aVPN) Refer to CERT advisory CA-2002-03(<http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2002-03.html>) for more details andthe most recent information regarding recommended solutions.How will this security concern affect my network?This issue has the potential to create a denial of service attack. Anattacker sending bogus SNMP requests and traps could flood the SnifferDistributed Appliance and/or SniffView console running the Trap Captureapplication.  This might cause the system to hang and may require areboot.An attacker should not be able to configure or take control of eitherthe Sniffer Distributed Appliance or the SniffView Console.Has anyone reported an exploitation of this vulnerability on a SnifferDistributed system?No.Have we notified CERT of our concern?YesWhere can I find out more information regarding this security concern?For more information regarding this vulnerability please refer to thefollowing URLs on CERT's web site:<http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2002-03.html><http://www.cert.org/tech_tips/snmp_faq.html> |

### Vendor Statement

| Since the release of CERT Advisory CA-2002-03, Sonus Networks has reviewed its product offering and determined a potential issue may exist within its management offering.The Sonus PSX6000, SGX2000, and Insight products utilize SNMP Researchsoftware in the SONScia package that has been identified by its vendor as possibly vulnerable to the exploit.  Sonus product versions 3.2.x, 3.3.x, and 3.4.x all have the affected SONScia package.  The issue has beenresolved in the upcoming 4.0 versions of the PSX6000, SGX2000, and Insight products and concerned customers are advised to upgrade as the softwarebecomes available.  Sonus PSX6000, SGX2000, and Insight products run on top of Sun Microsystems's Solaris operating environment (versions 2.6 and 2.8).  Sun Microsystems has identified these operating environments as vulnerable to the exploit IF they are started or used. Given that Sonus Networks software neither starts nor uses the process in question, snmpdx, Sonus products are not vulnerable to the exploit through this Solaris process.The Sonus GSX9000 does not use the same third party software as otherproducts from Sonus Networks and at this time we have not found any problems relating to its SNMP operation.  Negative testing is a routine portion of GSX9000 SQA and to date has not shown any undesired results.  We have recently tested the GSX9000 with OUSPG's PROTOS c06-snmpv1 test suite and those tests passed successfully. |

### [Symantec Corporation](#IAFY-56APHN) Affected

Notified:  January 11, 2002  Updated: April 01, 2003

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

| Symantec verified that the snmptrap.exe on the Intruder Alert (ITA) 3.6 agent, if configured to accept SNMP traps from Symantec NetProwler, is susceptible to a communications Denial of Service when the PROTOS test suite is directed against it. The communicator service will be halted, the halt will be logged and the service requires a restart to reinitiate communications.This should be a very low risk issue to Symantec ITA customers. The snmptrap.exe module is loaded on an ITA agent machine. Depending on customer configuration if the snmptrap module is loaded on an ITA agent located on the internal network of the company then the collector is only vulnerable to an internal attack as long as the firewall rule set blocks snmptrap communications through the firewall.The functionality of the snmptrap.exe allows smooth integrated alert management of both NIDS and HIDS from a single administrator console. Halting the communicator module disrupts the integrated communications only. Both the NetProwler and the ITA IDS systems continue to fuction normally but will require monitoring from separate consoles until the communicator service is restarted.Symantec takes any product issue such as this very seriously. We have developed a patch for Symantec ITA 3.6 that addresses this problem. The patch is available to Symantec ITA 3.6 customers from the Symantec customer ITA ftp download site as ITA3\_6Patch1/061302/. There is a patch for both domestic and international releases.Please contact supportsolutions@symantec.com for questions on product upgrades. |

Tivoli has identified the following products that implement SNMP v1:§         Tivoli NetView for Unix§         Tivoli NetView for Windows§         Tivoli NetView Mid-Level Manager (MLM)§         Tivoli Comprehensive Network Address Translator (CNAT)§         Tivoli NetView for OS/390 §         Tivoli Enterprise Console SNMP Adapter§         Tivoli Storage Network Manager §         Tivoli Risk ManagerAs an interim step, customers should be directed to secure their networks so as to prevent SNMP access from unknown sources.  The CERT advisory contains substantial information on this topic under the heading of “Ingress Filtering”.The following products have been identified for having the potential exposure:This information is current as of March 29, 2002.Identified Loss of ServiceThe following products have been identified as containing issues that can result in loss of service:Tivoli NetView for Unix & WindowsDETAILS Tivoli NetView for Unix & Tivoli NetView for Windows are vulnerable to a loss of service when subjected to certain SNMP get requests or traps as indicated in CA-2002-03.STATUSA fix is available (See the section on 𠆏ix Locations’).Tivoli NetView Mid-Level Manager (MLM) Agent for Solaris, HPUX, Windows and AIXDETAILSThe Tivoli NetView Mid-Level Manager (MLM) on Solaris, HPUX, Windows and AIX (Version 7.1 and earlier) is vulnerable to a loss of service when subjected to certain SNMP get requests or traps as indicated in CA-2002-03.STATUSA fix is currently being tested and will be released.  (See the section on 𠆏ix Locations’).Tivoli Comprehensive Network Address Translator (CNAT)DETAILSThis product is vulnerable to a temporary loss of service of the AIX system, which causes a loss of connectivity to the portion of the network relying on the CNAT system for NAT routing.STATUSA fix is currently being tested and will be released.  The fix will be available on this site (See the section on 𠆏ix Locations’).Tivoli NetView for OS/390 Version 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4  DETAILS: ABEND in E/AS (Event Automation Services) Trap-to-Alert adapter when Enterprise Object Identification (OID) is very large can occur. STATUSA fix is available. Tivoli Enterprise Console SNMP AdapterDETAILSThe Tivoli Enterprise Console SNMP Adapter is vulnerable to a loss of service when subjected to certain SNMP get requests or traps.STATUSA fix is currently being tested and will be released.    Tivoli Risk ManagerDETAILSThe Tivoli Risk Manager utilizes the Tivoli Enterprise Console SNMP Adapter, which is vulnerable to a loss of service when subjected to certain SNMP get requests or traps as indicated in CA-2002-03.STATUSA fix is currently being tested and will be released.    Tivoli Storage Network ManagerDETAILSThis condition only affects TSNM's ability to monitor outband events via SNMP traps.  TSNM is capable of managing SANs via both outband mechanisms (SNMP queries to FC switches for topology discovery and receives SNMP traps for outband event detection) and inband mechanisms (managed hosts connected to the SAN via FC HBAs for topology and attribute discovery, and inband FC event detection).  Outband discovery, inband discovery, and inband event detection are not affected by this condition.STATUSThis will be fixed in the next version of TSNM.PREVENTIONIn addition to the prevention noted above, customers should configure at least one Windows or SUN managed host per SAN to allow inband detection of SAN events.Fix LocationsService fixes to those products that have identified the issue will post the files in the following 2 locations:Web - <http://www.tivoli.com/secure/support/documents/security/ca-2002-03.html>FTP - [ftp.tivoli.com/support/Support\_Notes/SecurityBulletins/](http://www.pre-preview.cert.org/advisories/ftp.tivoli.com/support/Support_Notes/SecurityBulletins/)Questions For any questions, please contact your local call center or open a PMR through the online support page <http://www.tivoli.com/support/reporting/>. |

The information in this TechNote is based upon certainassumptions, including product, operating system and platformversions. You can review this information in theTechNote Summary portion of this document.This document (245634) is provided subject to the disclaimer at theend of this document.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------Symptom:Is VERITAS SANPoint Control affected by the Simple Network ManagementProtocol vulnerabilities cited in CERT Advisory CA-2002-03?Solution:On February 12, the CERT Coordination Center issued a CERT advisoryciting vulnerabilities with multiple vendors Simple NetworkManagement Protocol (SNMP) implementations. VERITAS SANPoint Control(SPC) was tested against the CERT SNMPv1 test suite and it wasdetermined that SPC was affected by VU#107186 having to do withSNMPv1 Trap handling. If SPC is installed on a machine outside of afirewall, or inside of a firewall that does not properly block SNMPtraffic, it could be open to a denial-of-service attack from theoutside.This problem has been fixed in SPC 2.1.1. For information on howdownload the latest release, refer to technote 235218 (link in theRelated sections of this TechNote).If it is not possible to upgrade, but you feel that your SPC hostsare at risk, then it will be necessary to disable SNMP traps whichwill affect SPC monitoring and reporting capabilities. Disablingtraps will also affect some array monitoring that is done throughtraps and may slightly delay status notifications if hardware isbeing monitored through SNMP polls. For more information on SPCmonitoring capabilities, refer to the Monitoring and ResolvingProblems on the SAN guide in your SPC documentation set. To disableSNMP traps, modify the sal.conf file as shown here:[Exp.SNMPTRAP]DisableTrap=1In addition to disabling SNMP traps through the sal.conf file, it isalso necessary to disable the VERITAS Trap Processor.On Windows:1. Go to Control Panel>Administrative Tools>Services2. Double-click on VERITAS Trap Service3. If the Service Status shows "Started", click the stop button.4. Change the Startup Type to Disabled5. Click OKOn Solaris:Modify the /opt/VRTSspcs/vxspcs script as follows to keep the vxtrapddaemon from starting (location of this file may vary depending on theinstallation directory of the VRTSspcs package):start\_trap (){SAVEDIR=´pwd´# cd $BASE\_DIR/VRTSspcs/trap/bin# ./vxtrapdstart.sh > /dev/nullcd $SAVEDIR}For any additional information on CERT Advisory CA-2002-03, go to thefollowing link: <http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2002-03.html>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------TechNote Summary:TechNote Title: Is VERITAS SANPoint Control affected by the SimpleNetwork Management Protocol vulnerabilities cited in CERT AdvisoryCA-2002-03?TechNote ID: 245634Last Updated: April 03 2002 01:37 AM GMTRelated Documents: TechNote: 235218 - What is the latest version ofVERITAS SANPoint Control?TechPDF: 242640 - VERITAS SANPoint Control 2.1 - Monitoring andResolving Problems on the SAN with SANPoint Control 2.1This information in this TechNote applies to:Products: SANPoint Control (UNIX Platforms)    1.0, 1.0.1, 2.0,2.0.1, 2.1, 2.1.1SANPoint Control for Windows 2000Subject: SANPoint Control (UNIX Platforms) - Application -InformationalLanguages: EnglishOperating Systems: Windows 2000 Professional    5.00.2195Windows 2000 Server    5.00.2195, 5.00.2195 SP 1, 5.00.2195 SP 2,Windows Powered, Windows Powered SP1, Windows Powered SP2Windows 2000 Advanced Server    5.00.2195, 5.00.2195 SP 1, 5.00.2195SP 2, Windows Powered, Windows Powered SP1, Windows Powered SP2Windows 2000 Datacenter Server    5.00.2195, 5.00.2195 SP 1,5.00.2195 SP 2Solaris    2.6, 7, 8Windows NT    4.0 Serv SP4, 4.0 Serv SP5, 4.0 Serv SP6a----------------------------------------------------------------------------------VERITAS Software, 1600 Plymouth Street, Mountain View, California94043 World Wide Web: <http://www.veritas.com>Tech Support Web: <http://support.veritas.com>E-Mail for Classic VERITAS Products: support@veritas.comE-Mail for Classic Seagate Software Products:helpdesk@support.veritas.comFTP:ftp://ftp.support.veritas.com or <http://ftp.support.veritas.com>THE INFORMATION PROVIDED IN THE VERITAS SOFTWARE KNOWLEDGE BASE ISPROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.

Affected

### Vendor Statement

| World Wide PacketsProduct notes and recommendations:LE-2X and 3X portals, LE-2XX and LE-4XX concentratorsFuture software releases of WWP Products will address the vulnerabilities identified in the following CERT vulnerability advisories.  Current target is to provide patch builds by Q2 � that permanently address these issues.  Please contact support@wwp.com for details and status.VU#854306 (Multiple vulnerabilities in SNMPv1 request handling)VU#107186 (Multiple vulnerabilities in SNMPv1 trap handling) Until these releases become available, we recommend that the following steps may be taken to help reduce exposure to these vulnerabilities.In all concentrators:\*Disable SNMP from interfaces through which SNMP commands should not be received, such as those providing connection from the Internet or Extranets.\*Use management VLANs or out-of-band management to contain SNMP traffic and multicasts. These do not prevent an attacker from exploiting these vulnerabilities, but they may make it more difficult to initiate the attacks.In the snmp.cfg file of all devices, define the community with the IP address of the Management Station.Example: Instead of !snmp\_cs\_1=1, public, 0.0.0.0, read!snmp\_cs\_2=1, private, 0.0.0.0, writeUse!snmp\_cs\_1=1, <new public string>, <Mgmt Station Ip Address>, read!snmp\_cs\_2=1, <new private string>, <Mgmt Station Ip Address>, writeNote: Even when community strings are changed from their defaults, they will still be passed in plaintext and are therefore subject to packet sniffing attacks. SNMPv3 offers additional capabilities to ensure authentication and privacy as described in RFC2574.LE-3700 Distributor\*Disable SNMP from interfaces through which SNMP commands should not be received, such as those providing connection from the Internet or Extranets \*Use Access Control Lists at the access edge to prevent SNMP traffic from unauthorized internal hosts from entering the network. \*Use management VLANs or out-of-band management to contain SNMP traffic and multicasts. These do not prevent an attacker from exploiting these vulnerabilities, but they may make it more difficult to initiate the attacks. \*Enable 802.1X port-locking and RADIUS to prevent unauthenticated users from attaching to the network. |

### Status

Not Affected

### Vendor Statement

| The Astracon Stinger NetConnect is safe against the vulnerability reported by VU#107186. The Stinger NetConnect processes SNMP responses only. Since the trap demon is never invoked, the Stinger NetConnect will never receive a trap; it is always safe. The Stinger NetConnect doesn't accept SNMP requests, but can send SNMP version 1 or version 3 requests. By configuring the NetConnect to use only SNMP version 3, the vulnerabilities caused when using SNMP version 1 in the network will be avoided.  In order to ensure safety against the vulnerability reported by VU#854306 and VU#107186, the test cases at <http://www.ee.oulu.fi/research/ouspg/protos/testing/c06/snmpv1/> were executed, with no adverse effect on the NetConnect. The Stinger NetConnect passed all of the test cases. |

Not Affected

### Vendor Statement

Check Point Statement on SNMP Vulnerability Test Suite

Recently, an automated suite has been released which tests products for known SNMP vulnerabilities.

FireWall-1, by default, blocks all SNMP communication to, from, or across a FireWall-1 gateway. SNMP communication is enabled only if the administrator writes a specific rule which allows the communication.

SNMP communication is not required for correct functionality of any Check Point products.

If SNMP monitoring of Check Point firewalls is needed, Check Point recommends that the FireWall-1 rule base tightly restrict SNMP communication and that all relevant operating system security patches be applied.

Check Point knows of no SNMP-related security issues in any of its products, and has conducted an extensive review to ensure that none exist.

### [Muonics](#IAFY-5NEHTN) Not Affected

Updated:  June 11, 2003

### Status

Not Affected

### Vendor Statement

Muonics added SNMP management-role (request originator) capabilities to its MIB Smithy series of products starting with version 2.0. Notification (trap/inform) processing was added in version 2.1 (the current version as of this report). Neither version supports agent-role (request processor) capabilities at this time. However, all PDU types are fully parsed by both versions, including requests, before unsupported PDU types are discarded by the dispatcher layer.

Both versions of MIB Smithy SDK, from which all of the MIB Smithy series are derived, have been fully tested with all four of the PROTOS c06-SNMPv1 Test Suites. Version 2.0 binds to any available port for sending requests and receiving responses. Since this was not conducive to testing, a special build was required, with the only difference from the official 2.0 release being a hard-coded binding to ports 161 and 162 as appropriate. Version 2.1 allows configuration of a bind port for receiving notifications, so it was not an issue for that version.

After running the full series of tests we found both versions to behave as expected, with no signs of failure. We have thus concluded that Muonics' past and current product versions are not susceptible to the security vulnerabilities associated with CA-2002-03.

Updated:  March 13, 2002

### Status

Not Affected

### Vendor Statement

| Quick Eagle Networks, Inc. is a provider of intelligent WAN access solutions for IP and frame relay networks, and the world leader in multilink access devices. Quick Eagle Networks continues to be committed to ensure a high level of security and reliability of our customer’s networks. Part of this commitment includes prompt responses to security issues discovered by organizations such as the CERT® Coordination Center.I. OverviewOn February 12, 2002 the CERT®/CC released an advisory related to security vulnerabilities that may exist in network devices using SNMPv1 as the management protocol. In response to this advisory (CERT Advisory CA-2002-03: Multiple Vulnerabilities in Many Implementations of the Simple Network Management Protocol), Quick Eagle Networks Inc. began immediately investigating whether these vulnerabilities impact Quick Eagle's products. II. Test ProceduresQuick Eagle Networks is currently applying the PROTOS c06-SNMPv1 test suite to all products and its variations that feature SNMPv1 capability. The tests evaluate the robustness of the application logic of the SNMPv1 implementation as well as the robustness of the BER decoder of the SNMPv1 implementation.III. ImpactPreliminary test results have not indicated any vulnerability that will allow anattacker to gain access. In general, Quick Eagle Networks' products use out ofband management, eliminating the chances of an attacker to gain access from theoutside of a network. While most of Quick Eagle Networks' newer WAN accessdevices have already passed the test, some of Quick Eagle Networks' olderproducts are still under investigation.IV. SolutionUntil Quick Eagle Networks has completed testing on all of its products and provided patches or fixes to eliminate these vulnerabilities, Quick Eagle Networks recommends considering one or more of the following solutions, as also identified in CERT® Advisory CA-2002-03, to minimize your network’s potential exposure to these vulnerabilities:· Disable SNMP on the device· Change the default community strings· Disconnect the management port. This won’t have any impact on your network traffic as Quick Eagle’s solutions use out of band management.The recommendations above apply only for those products that are still under evaluation. Please refer to our status report for further information.IV. Status ReportsFor more information please visit <http://www.quickeagle.com/support/cert.asp> |

### [Standard Networks Inc.](#IAFY-57KS4D) Not Affected

Updated:  February 21, 2002

### Status

Not Affected

### Vendor Statement

| Standard Networks offers a "mainframe connectivity" family of products under the "UniGate" brand name. These products contain SNMP agents. After reviewing the recent information regarding SNMP vulnerabilities, performing a source code audit and running a variety of publicly available SNMP exploit suites (including the OUSPG test suite), we believe the UniGate product is not vulnerable to the problems described in VU#854306.SNMP agent services are enabled by default on UniGate after version 3.6.07. (This version was released in late 1995; anyone with a "Year 2000 Compliant" version runs SNMP services.) It is not currently possible to turn on and shut off SNMP services on a UniGate, but it is possible to change the "inquiry" and "update" strings to unusual values (i.e. "m2H9j3s4")to prevent unauthorized access to the machine. Alternatively, a current version of the UniGate software with SNMP "hardcoded off "(3.99.31) is available from Standard Networks directly for customers who feel they need to have this service disabled immediately. (A future version will allow users to toggle SNMP services on and off.)Attempts to find or exploit SNMP vulnerabilities on a UniGate platform will often cause the UniGate to log those attemptsas "Community Errors" or "Misc Errors" on the "SNMP Statistics" screen and/or as "IP: Fragment Msg too big" errors on the main status screen.Standard Networks' "OpenIT mainframe connectivity" product will also act as an SNMP agent if SNMP is enabled under Windows NT (rare). OpenIT customers are encouraged to follow "Microsoft Corporation's" latest recommendations regarding WindowsNT SNMP issues if they are using this service. It is however possible to immediately disable any active SNMP services onany OpenIT platform by stopping the "SNMP" service from the "Services Control Panel."No other Standard Networks products (i.e. "EMU Terminal Emulator", "ActiveHEAT Host Access", the "MOVEit" family of secure file transfer products) are affected by this issue.Customers are encouraged to call Standard Networks immediately (+001 608.227.6100) with any questions or concerns about their specific configuration. |

Updated:  February 21, 2002

### Status

Not Affected

### Vendor Statement

| The Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) has issued last week anadvisory regarding numerous vulnerabilities affecting most vendors'SNMP implementations. This advisory, which can be accessed on<http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2002-03.html>, specifically addressedvulnerabilities on the implementations' handling of SNMPv1 trap andrequest PDUs (more specifically, the handling of the Trap, Get, Set,and GetNext PDUs).TMP would like to state that we have evaluated the impact of thosevulnerabilities on our WANView line of network management solutions,and that we are in NO WAY vulnerable to any of the issues reported,as follows:VU#854306 - Multiple Vulnerabilities in SNMPv1 Request Handling: Thisadvisory is not applicable to WANView, because WANView does not acceptor process in any way SNMP Get/Set/GetNext PDUs; rather, WANView sendsthose requests to the monitored equipment, and process subsequentresponses.VU#107186 - Multiple Vulnerabilities in SNMPv1 Trap Handling: Thisadvisory is not applicable to WANView either, because WANView currentlydoes not accept SNMP traps (this has been a product design decision)WANView can be configured to send SNMP traps to other systems, and isnot affected in this regard.In case you have any questions or need further assistance regardingthese matters, please contact us at <wanview@tmp.com.br>. |

### [Top Layer Networks](#IAFY-58SS59) Not Affected

Updated:  April 01, 2002

### Status

Not Affected

### Vendor Statement

| Both of Top Layer's focused security appliances, the IDS Balancer and the Attack Mitigator, do not exhibit the SNMP vulnerabilite(s) Outlined by CERT Advisory CA-2002-03.Neither of these products require any modification at all in order to be protected. The AppSwitch/AppSafe product is also capable of being so protected, but it may require that one configuration change be made to ensure total protection based on the TopPath version of firmware it is running.The detail of the configuration change required in the AppSwitch/AppSafe product is discussed below.CERT's recommended restrictions are as follows:1.  Disable SNMP V1 access to all applicable network devices2.  Filter SNMP traffic from non-authorized internal hosts3.  Segregate SNMP traffic onto a separate management networkTop Layer is well positioned to provide immediate solutions for our customers.  There are two options that users can immediately choose from to protect their TLN security systems from SNMP V1 attacks:OPTION 1All currently shipping Top Layer products come pre-configured from the factory or can be configured to meet CERT restriction # 1.  For example, Top Layer's focused security appliances, the IDS Balancer and the upcoming Attack Mitigator products have, as their factory default settings, Access Restrictions for SNMP set to -Denied- thus meeting CERT restriction # 1.NOTE: The AppSwitch/AppSafe Release 4.1 factory default is for SNMP disabled. Models running Release 3.55 must be explicitly configured to deny access as described above.OPTION 2Option #2 is to implement restrictions # 2 and # 3 simultaneouslyRestriction # 2To meet CERT restriction # 2, network managers can set access restrictions for SNMP to an allowed IP host address range via the Web Management Interface supplied with the AppSwitch/AppSafe 3500, the IDS Balancer, and upon general release, the Attack Mitigator. Existing customers can implement this protection themselves in the field today.Restriction #3The currently shipping AppSwitch/AppSafe 3500 security device can be configured to restrict SNMP to a single management port via its web management interface.  This meets CERT restriction # 3.Both the IDS Balancer and the Attack Mitigator are designed with separate management ports for that exclusive use.  These management ports cannot be accessed via "outside" (public network) or "inside" (internal network) LAN connections for greater security and management system integrity. These products meet CERT restriction # 3 -out of the box-.BOTTOM LINETop Layer's standard offerings meet the criteria that allow users to protect against SNMP V1 vulnerability exploits. This is all part of Top Layer's continued commitment to provide our customers with improved performance and greater security against cyber threats. |

### [nCipher Corp.](#IAFY-57KPD3) Not Affected

Updated:  March 01, 2002

### Status

Not Affected

### Vendor Statement

| nCipher Corp. supplies two SNMP products:1) a SNMP agent bundled with the nForce/nShield and older nFast products(nFast 75, 150 and 300)2) The SNMP support software bundled with the newer nFast800 products.The first product (bundled with the nForce, nShield and nFast 75/150/300range) is a customised NET-SNMP agent version 4.2.1.  This is vulnerableto VU#854306 but not VU#107186.  nCipher has upgraded this software tothe NET-SNMP release 4.2.3 and this is now available as a patch release(see below).The second product (bundled with the nFast800 product) has two operatingmodes, one for Linux (and, in the near future, Solaris) and one forWindows NT/2000.  In each case, the only agent used is the one currentlyinstalled on the OS (NET-SNMP for Linux/Solaris and the Microsoft SNMPagent for Windows); the nCipher-supplied software runs in a separateprocess.Customers using this product should therefore ensure that theiroperating system SNMP agent is patched against this vulnerability.On Linux or Solaris , this requires installation of the NET-SNMP version4.2.2 or greater.  Running 'snmpd -v' (make sure it is in your path) willtell you the version of the NET-SNMP agent you are currently running.On Windows, this will require installation of the forthcoming patch fromMicrosoft.  If you have not installed the patch from Microsoft and the'SNMP Service' is running then you are affected.Again, if upgrading is not currently possible customers are advised todisable the SNMP service if it might be exposed to hostile networktraffic, or make use of other suggestions supplied elsewhere in CERTadvisory CA-2002-03.nCipher has released a specific advisory, which may be obtained from<http://www.ncipher.com/support/advisories/> - this includes a patch todownload that upgrades the nCipher agent to version 4.2.3 of theNET-SNMP kit and fixes the issues listed above.  Installation instructions arecontained within the patch file. |

### [Enterasys Networks](#IAFY-569SQF) Unknown

### Status

Unknown

### Vendor Statement

On 12-February-2002, CERT (<http://www.cert.org>) announced serious vulnerabilities in the SNMP implementations of virtually every networking vendor’s equipment. These vulnerabilities were discovered by a Finnish research group known as OUSPG, associated with Oulu University, and are documented in advisory CA-2002-03.

These vulnerabilities exist in all versions of SNMP (v1/v2c/v3) and can be used to cause SNMP implementations to behave in an unpredictable manner, resulting in denials of service or system failures.

Given the serious nature of these vulnerabilities, Enterasys is testing our product line to determine which products are affected. Patches for affected products will be made available to our customers. Please check the [Enterasys Support](http://www.enterasys.com/support) web site periodically for further details and patch information.

Until these patches become available, Enterasys recommends that the following steps be taken to help reduce exposure to these vulnerabilities.

+ Disable SNMP from interfaces through which SNMP commands should not be received, such as those providing connection from the Internet or Extranets
+ Use Access Control Lists at the access edge to prevent SNMP traffic from unauthorized internal hosts from entering the network.
+ Use management VLANs or out-of-band management to contain SNMP traffic and multicasts. These do not prevent an attacker from exploiting these vulnerabilities, but they may make it more difficult to initiate the attacks.
+ Enable 802.1X port-locking and RADIUS to prevent unauthenticated users from attaching to the network.
+ Use NetSight Policy Manager to automatically restrict the use of SNMP to authenticated, SNMP-authorized personnel.
+ Update Dragon IDS signatures to help identify when these attacks are being used.

Notified:  October 17, 2001  Updated: December 19, 2001

Unknown

### Vendor Statement

NetBSD does not ship with any SNMP tools in our 'base' releases. We do provide optional `packages' which provide various support for SNMP. These packages are not installed by default, nor are they currently provided as an install option by the operating system installation tools. A system administrator/end-user has to manually install this with our package management tools.

These SNMP packages include:

netsaint-plugin-snmp-1.2.8.4**SNMP monitoring plug-in for netsaint**
p5-Net-SNMP-3.60**perl5 module for SNMP queries**
p5-SNMP-3.1.0**Perl5 module for interfacing to the UCD SNMP library**
p5-SNMP\_Session-0.83**perl5 module providing rudimentary access to remote SNMP agents**
ucd-snmp-4.2.1**Extensible SNMP implementation (conflicts with ucd-snmp-4.1.2)**

ucd-snmp-4.1.2**Extensible SNMP implementation (conflicts with ucd-snmp-4.2.1)**

We do provide a software monitoring mechanism called 'audit-packages', which allows us to highlight if a package with a range of versions has a potential vulnerability, and recommends that the end-user upgrade the packages in question.

Notified:  January 11, 2002  Updated: March 05, 2002

### Status

Unknown

### Vendor Statement

| A recent alert issued by CERT states that any device connected to the Internet has potential security vulnerability. The specific root cause relates to SNMP v1, which is implemented in many Paradyne products.  This alert has caused a number of Paradyne customers to call and request an official statement and risk assessment associated with Paradyne's equipment.  The purpose of this document is to inform you that Paradyne engineering staff is currently assessing the situation to determine if any vulnerabilities exist.  The analysis will take into consideration product features, SNMP v1 issues and the typical usage of our products in DSL and Frame Relay network topologies. In typical configurations, direct connection to the Internet with Paradyne devices and/or management systems is extremely rare. Please note that while no device is completely secure, Paradyne has implemented several safeguards that protect against intrusion such as that identified by CERT Advisory CA-2002-03.  Prior to the time that Paradyne releases a more comprehensive statement, we recommend that you take the following actions as appropriate:·  Change community string from public; choose obscure names·  Use device SNMP access list capability·  Use firewall at NOC if NOC has access to Internet, same for CEU central site products  (FrameSaver)·  Utilize inband management (dedicated management PVC) when possibleTaken together, these methods provide a robust security feature set which should minimize the impact of the concerns raised in the CERT alert.  With this said, Paradyne will release a more complete assessment as soon as possible.  This response will consist of an analysis of the overall security risks, recommendations to mitigate these risks and, if necessary, plans for the introduction of new code to close any identified security breaches. |

### General Information

## Technical details

**Technical description:**

On February 12 2002, Microsoft released the original version of this bulletin. In it, we detailed a work-around procedure that customers could implement to protect themselves against a publicly disclosed vulnerability. An updated version of this bulletin was released on February 15, 2002, to announce the availability of the patch for Windows 2000 and Windows XP and to advise customers that the work-around procedure is no longer needed on those platforms. Patches for additional platforms are forthcoming and this bulletin will be re-released to announce their availability.

On March 5, 2002, Microsoft released an updated version of the bulletin announcing the availability of a patch for Windows NT 4.0 and to advise customers that the work-around procedure is no longer needed for that platform. Patches for additional platforms are forthcoming and this bulletin will be re-released to announce their availability.

On March 11, 2002, Microsoft released an updated version of the bulletin announcing the availability of a patch for Windows NT 4.0 Terminal Server Edition and to advise customers that the work-around procedure is no longer needed for that platform. Patches for additional platforms are forthcoming and this bulletin will be re-released to announce their availability.

On March 14, 2002, Microsoft discovered that the English and German patches for Windows NT 4.0 Terminal Server Edition contained incorrect files. We have corrected this error and posted updates versions of this patch for these languages. We recommend that customers who have downloaded the Windows NT 4.0 Terminal Server Edition patch in English or German prior to March 14, 2002 install the updated version. Customers who have installed the Windows NT 4.0 Terminal Server Edition patches in any language other than English or German do not need to take any action: these patches do not contain the error.

On April 26, 2002, Microsoft released an updated version of the bulletin announcing the availability of a patch for Windows 98 and Windows 98SE and to advise customers that the work-around procedure is no longer needed for that platform.

Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is an Internet standard protocol for managing disparate network devices such as firewalls, computers, and routers. All versions of Windows except Windows ME provide an SNMP implementation, which is neither installed nor running by default in any version.

A buffer overrun is present in all implementations. By sending a specially malformed management request to a system running an affected version of the SNMP service, an attacker could cause a denial of service. In addition, it is possible that he could cause code to run on the system in LocalSystem context. This could potentially give the attacker the ability to take any desired action on the system.

**Mitigating factors:**

* The SNMP service is neither installed nor running by default in any version of Windows.
* Standard firewalling practices recommend blocking the port over which SNMP operates (UDP ports 161 and 162). If these recommendations have been followed, the vulnerability could only be exploited by an intranet user.
* Standard security recommendations recommend against using SNMP except on trusted networks, as the protocol, by design, provides minimal security.

**Severity Rating:**

|  | Internet Servers | Intranet Servers | Client Systems |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Windows 95** | None | None | Moderate |
| **Windows 98** | None | None | Moderate |
| **Windows 98SE** | None | None | Moderate |
| **Windows ME** | None | None | None |
| **Windows NT 4.0** | Low | Moderate | Moderate |
| **Windows NT 4.0 Terminal Server Edition** | Low | Moderate | None |
| **Windows 2000** | Low | Moderate | Moderate |
| **Windows XP** | None | None | Moderate |

The above [assessment](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/rating) is based on the types of systems affected by the vulnerability, their typical deployment patterns, and the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would have on them. The SNMP service does not install by default on any version of Windows. Additionally, following well-known best practices for using SNMP (blocking at the router) protects against attempts to exploit this vulnerability.

**Vulnerability identifier:** [CAN-2002-0053](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=can-2002-0053)

**Tested Versions:**

Microsoft tested Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows 98SE, Windows ME, Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000, and Windows XP to assess whether they are affected by this vulnerability. Previous versions are no longer [supported](https://support.microsoft.com/directory/discontinue.asp), and may or may not be affected by these vulnerabilities.

## Frequently asked questions

**Why is Microsoft re-releasing this bulletin?**

Microsoft originally released this bulletin to advise customers of a workaround procedure that could be used while a patch was under development. Microsoft has completed the patches for all platforms, and have updated the bulletin to advise customers of their availability.
After releasing the patches for Windows NT 4.0 Terminal Server Edition, it was discovered on March 14, 2002 that the patches for English and German contained incorrect files. We have corrected the error and provided an updated patch.

**What's the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a buffer overrun vulnerability. If a particular service had been installed and was running on an affected system, it could be possible for an attacker to cause a denial of service on the system. In addition, it is possible that they could run code of their choice.
The service at issue in this vulnerability is neither installed nor running by default on any version of Windows. In addition, the circumstances under which the vulnerability could be exploited would likely prevent it from being exploited by an Internet-based attacker.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability results because the component of the SNMP agent service that parses incoming commands contains an unchecked buffer. By sending a specially malformed request, it could be possible conduct a buffer overrun attack against an affected system.

**What is SNMP?**

[SNMP](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/aa377993.aspx) (Simple Network Management Protocol) is a protocol that allows administrators to remotely manage network devices such as servers, workstations, routers, bridges, firewalls, and so forth. SNMP is an [industry-standard protocol](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1157.txt), which allows devices made by many different vendors to be managed via the protocol.

**How does SNMP work?**

In order for an administrator to use SNMP, there has to be an agent - that is, a service that listens for commands and executes them - on every machine that needs to be managed. Next, the administrator needs to know a password (known in SNMP parlance as a community name) that provides either read-only or read-write access, as appropriate. When the administrator issues a management command, the SNMP software on his system refers to a database (called the Management Information Base) that translates those commands to one that will be meaningful to the other machine.

**How secure is SNMP?**

SNMP is, by design, not a secure protocol. For instance, all communications in SNMP take place in plaintext, so community names and other potentially sensitive information could potentially be determined by monitoring the network. Microsoft has long recommended using other, more secure methods of managing networks, and this is why the SNMP agent service that ships with Windows platforms is neither installed nor running by default.

**What Windows products provide SNMP support?**

An SNMP agent service is included in Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows 98SE, Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000, and Windows XP. However, it's neither installed nor running by default in any of them. Windows ME doesn't provide an SNMP service of any kind.

**Which products' SNMP services are affected by the vulnerability?**

All SNMP services are affected. This includes: Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows 98SE, Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000, and Windows XP.

**What's wrong with the SNMP implementations in the affected products?**

The SNMP implementations in the affected products have an unchecked buffer in a part of the software that processes management requests. If the SNMP agent service received a management request that's malformed in a particular way, the effect would be to overrun the buffer. If the data in the management request were carefully chosen, it would have the effect of altering the operation of the SNMP service while it was running.

**What would this enable an attacker to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause a denial of service in the SNMP service. In addition, it is possible that they could change the operation of the SNMP service. Because it runs as part of the operating system, this would potentially give the attacker complete control over the system.

**Who could exploit the vulnerability?**

To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker would need to be able to deliver SNMP management requests to the SNMP Service.

**How difficult would it be for the attacker to deliver SNMP Management requests to an affected system?**

It's likely that an attacker located within a network could deliver SNMP management requests to most other systems on the network, since SNMP operates over TCP/IP. However, if normal firewalling has been performed, it might be impossible for an attacker located on the Internet to deliver management requests to a system behind the firewall, as standard firewalling recommendations include blocking UDP ports 161 and 162, the ports over which SNMP traffic travels.

**How likely is it that a web server or other Internet-exposed system would be vulnerable?**

If best practices have been followed, SNMP wouldn't be used on an Internet-exposed machine. As we discussed above, SNMP is not a secure protocol, and as a result it's never appropriate to use SNMP to manage a system on the Internet.

**How do I disable the SNMP service?**

Just follow the steps for the system you're using.

  5. Click OK to close the dialogue.
  6. Right-click and select Start.
  7. Close the Computer Management window.

**I haven't installed the SNMP service on my system. Am I at any risk?**

No. You're only at risk if the SNMP service is running.

**What does the patch do?**

The patch eliminates the vulnerability by instituting proper input checking on the command parser in the SNMP agent service.

**I downloaded the Windows NT 4.0 Terminal Server Edition patch for English or German prior to March 14, 2002, what should I do?**

You should download the updated patches and use those to update your system.

**I installed the earlier version of these patches on my system, what do I need to do?**

Once you've downloaded the updated patch, you can apply that to your system. It will overwrite the previous version of the patch. There is no need to uninstall the previous version.

**I've downloaded a Windows NT 4.0 Terminal Server Edition patch in a language other than English or German, do I need to do anything?**

No. The problem only affects the patches in English and German. Patches in other languages do not suffer from this problem and do not need to be re-downloaded or re-applied.

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.
