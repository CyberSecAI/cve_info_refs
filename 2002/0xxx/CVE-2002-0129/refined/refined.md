The provided content relates to CVE-2002-0129.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the `-x` function of the `efax` program. This occurs when the program attempts to create a lock file with a filename derived from user-supplied input, without proper bounds checking.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Buffer overflow vulnerability in the `-x` function when creating lock files.
- Lack of input validation for the filename used to create lock files.
- The program is sometimes installed as setuid root, which exacerbates the issue.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Allows for arbitrary code execution by overwriting the return address on the stack, which occurs when the program crashes with a segmentation fault, due to the overflow.
- When `efax` is setuid root, this could lead to privilege escalation.

**Attack vectors:**
- Passing a long string to the `-x` option of the `efax` command.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker must be able to execute the `efax` command and be able to pass arguments to it.
- If `efax` is setuid root, a local unprivileged user can exploit the vulnerability and gain root privileges.
