Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the inconsistent handling of network address translation (NAT) by the Symantec Enterprise Firewall (SEF) SMTP proxy. When NAT is configured for an SMTP connection, the proxy doesn't consistently use the NATed address within the SMTP protocol exchange. Instead, it uses the physical interface's address and name.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Information Leak:** The SMTP proxy includes the firewall's physical interface name and address in the SMTP protocol exchange, even when a different (NATed) address is intended for external communication. This exposes internal network configuration details.
2.  **SMTP Protocol Inconsistencies:** The discrepancy between the NATed address and the address used by the SMTP proxy can cause issues with receiving/sending hosts configured to enforce strict checks on SMTP exchanges, potentially leading to connection denial or mail delivery failures.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can gain insights into the firewall's internal configuration by analyzing the SMTP protocol exchange, which might assist them in further attacks.
*   **Denial of Service (Potential):** Due to inconsistencies, strict SMTP servers might refuse connections originating from or destined to the firewall, causing mail delivery failures.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Passive Information Gathering:** An attacker can passively monitor SMTP traffic to gather information about the firewall's internal configuration.
*   **SMTP Connection Attempts:** An attacker can attempt SMTP connections to trigger the inconsistent behavior.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be in a position to monitor or interact with SMTP traffic that passes through a vulnerable Symantec Enterprise Firewall configured with NAT for SMTP connections. This could be an external attacker sending an email or a malicious host on the internet.
*   No specific privileges are needed for exploitation, just network access.

**Additional Details:**

*   The issue affects Symantec Enterprise Firewall versions 6.5.x and 7.0.
*   Symantec acknowledged the issues and provided temporary workarounds until a fix could be implemented in version 8.0.
*   Workarounds include ensuring the firewall name matches the external interface name and/or utilizing the SMTP wizard for rule setup instead of NAT.
