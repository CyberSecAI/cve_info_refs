- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The BPM Studio Pro 4.2 HTTP server does not properly sanitize user-supplied URLs, allowing directory traversal.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Directory traversal vulnerability. The software does not prevent the use of ".." sequences in the URL to access files outside the intended web root directory.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can download arbitrary files from the server's file system. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors**: By sending a crafted HTTP request containing "../" sequences in the URL. For example, `<http://BPM-HOST/../../../../autoexec.bat>`
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs network access to the BPM Studio Pro 4.2 HTTP server. The server is not enabled by default.
