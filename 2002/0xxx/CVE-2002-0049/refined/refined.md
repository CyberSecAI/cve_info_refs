- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Microsoft Exchange System Attendant incorrectly adds the "Everyone" group to the security permissions of the `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurePipeServers\winreg` registry key.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the System Attendant granting the "Everyone" group privileges to the WinReg key, which controls the ability to remotely connect to the Registry. By default, only Administrators have this ability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The vulnerability allows unprivileged users to remotely connect to the Registry. While it does not directly grant the ability to change registry settings, it can be combined with inappropriately permissive registry settings to gain access and modify the system's Registry. This could lead to an attacker being able to modify the Exchange server's configuration settings.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker would connect remotely to the target machine's Registry over the network via TCP ports 139 or 445. The Remote Registry Service needs to be running.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send SMB traffic to and from the target system. Firewalling best practices that block ports 139 and 445 would mitigate remote exploitation from the internet.
