- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Slashcode.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is present in all versions prior to 2.2.5. The vulnerability lies in the way Slashcode handles user input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can steal a user's Slash cookie, which contains their username and password. This enables the attacker to take over the user's account. If the compromised user has administrator privileges, the attacker gains nearly full control of the Slash website. This includes the ability to post and delete stories, edit users, and post as other users.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker persuades the victim to click on a crafted URL on the vulnerable Slash website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL and persuade a user of the vulnerable website to click on it. The victim must have JavaScript enabled in their browser.
