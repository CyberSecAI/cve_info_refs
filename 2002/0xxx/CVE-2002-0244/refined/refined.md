- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The chroot() implementation in AtheOS does not properly check relative paths against the chroot jail.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper input validation of relative paths after a chroot() call. The system allows directory traversal outside of the intended chroot jail.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can bypass the chroot jail and access files and directories outside of the restricted environment. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information, modification of system files, and potentially complete system compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can use relative path specifiers (e.g., "../") to traverse out of the chroot jail.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have a process running within the chroot jail environment, which is common in applications such as FTP and HTTP servers that use chroot for security. The attacker needs to be able to execute system calls that operate on files and directories.
