Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2002-0371:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- An unchecked buffer exists in the code responsible for handling responses from Gopher servers. This code is used by Microsoft Internet Explorer, Internet Security and Acceleration (ISA) Server 2000, and Proxy Server 2.0.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a buffer overflow. A specially crafted, oversized response from a Gopher server can overwrite adjacent memory, potentially leading to code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system.
    -   **Internet Explorer:** Code runs with the privileges of the user browsing the malicious content.
    -   **ISA and Proxy Servers:** Code runs with LocalSystem privileges, granting the attacker complete control over the server. This could lead to formatting the hard drive, adding administrators, and loading network services.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Gopher Server Response Manipulation:** The attacker must control the response from a Gopher server.
- **User Interaction (IE):**
    -   An attacker could create a malicious web page that triggers a request to their controlled Gopher server and host it on a web site or send it as an HTML email.
    -   When the victim views this page or email, IE will connect to the malicious Gopher server. The crafted oversized response triggers the overflow.
-  **Proxy Server Client Request:**
    - A proxy client would need to submit a request through the affected proxy server to the attackers server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to control a Gopher server.
- The attacker must be able to send information from the malicious gopher server to the target, either directly (for IE) or via a proxy server (for ISA and Proxy servers).
- For Internet Explorer attacks, the attacker has to entice the victim to access a malicious page or open a malicious email.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability affects Internet Explorer versions 5.01, 5.5, and 6.0
-  The vulnerability affects Microsoft Proxy Server 2.0 and Microsoft ISA Server 2000.
- A work-around was initially released to mitigate the vulnerability by disabling the Gopher protocol within IE, followed by official patches for ISA Server 2000, Proxy Server 2.0, and Internet Explorer.
- The Gopher protocol is described in RFC 1436.
