Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2002-0860:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the `LoadText()` method of the spreadsheet component within Microsoft Office Web Components (OWC). This method is intended to load text files into a spreadsheet, but it doesn't properly validate the source of the text.

**Vulnerability/Weakness:**

- **Insufficient Domain Validation:**  The `LoadText()` method checks if the URL is in the same domain as the current document. However, this check can be bypassed using a server-side redirect. By specifying a URL within the same domain that redirects to a local file, an attacker can trick OWC into loading the content of that file.
- **Lack of Local File Access Restriction:** The `LoadText` method allows specifying a file located on the user's own system rather than on a remote file share. When this is done, and the file is read, the data is loaded into the web page.
- **Information Disclosure:** Once the data is loaded into the web page, the hosting site can manipulate that data, including sending it back to the hosting site, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Local File Read:** An attacker can read the contents of any file on the victim's computer that the user has access to.
- **Information Disclosure:** The attacker can exfiltrate the content of the file to a remote server.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Web-based attack:** An attacker can create a malicious webpage that exploits the `LoadText()` method. When a user visits this page, the attacker's script can read local files from the user's machine.
- **HTML Email:** The malicious code can also be embedded within an HTML email. When the user opens the email, the script can execute and attempt to read files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to create a malicious web page or HTML email:** The attacker needs to be able to craft the malicious content containing the exploit.
- **Knowledge of file path:** The attacker needs to know the full path and name of the file on the user's system to be able to read it.
- **User interaction:** The attacker needs to trick the user into visiting the malicious website or opening the malicious email.
