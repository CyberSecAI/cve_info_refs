```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The PHP interpreter on Windows discloses its installation path when a request with a path extension is made.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
Information disclosure. PHP reveals its installation path, which can be considered sensitive information.

Impact of exploitation:
Disclosure of the installation path of PHP on a Windows server. This information could potentially aid an attacker in further reconnaissance or targeted attacks.

Attack vectors:
By appending `/123` (or similar) to the end of a PHP file's URL, such as `http://somehost/database.php/123`.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to a vulnerable server hosting PHP on Windows.
