The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in Phusion Webserver v1.0.

**a) Directory Traversal:**
*   **Root cause:** The webserver improperly handles directory traversal sequences in the URL.
*   **Weaknesses:**  The server does not correctly sanitize or validate user-supplied paths, allowing access to files outside the intended webroot. The server also fails to properly handle HTTP encoded character representations substituted for "/" and "\".
*   **Impact:** An attacker can access arbitrary files on the server, potentially including sensitive information.
*   **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted HTTP GET request with directory traversal sequences such as `.../` or encoded representations of `/` and `\` within the URL.
*   **Required attacker capabilities:** The attacker only needs to send a malicious HTTP request.

**b) Denial of Service (DoS):**
*   **Root cause:** The server crashes when processing a very long URL.
*  **Weaknesses**: The server's handling of URL length is inadequate and leads to a crash.
*   **Impact:** The webserver becomes unavailable, requiring a restart of the service.
*   **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted HTTP GET request with a very long URL, typically containing repeated characters, especially in the `cgi-bin` path.
*   **Required attacker capabilities:** The attacker only needs to send a malicious HTTP request with a long URL.

**c) Buffer Overflow:**
*   **Root cause:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the webserver.
*   **Weaknesses**: The server does not properly validate the length of the input when handling specific requests, leading to buffer overflows.
*  **Impact:** An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Attack vectors:** Sending a specially crafted GET request containing a large payload to trigger a buffer overflow.
*   **Required attacker capabilities:** The attacker needs to send a specific crafted request.

The provided information includes proof-of-concept exploits written in Perl and C for each of these vulnerabilities. These exploits demonstrate how an attacker can leverage the vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access, cause a denial of service, or execute arbitrary code.
