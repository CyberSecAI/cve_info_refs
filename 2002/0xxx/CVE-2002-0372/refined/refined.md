This document provides details for MS02-032, a cumulative patch for Windows Media Player, which addresses three vulnerabilities including the one related to CVE-2002-0372.

**Vulnerability Details (CVE-2002-0372)**

*   **Root Cause:** A flaw in how Windows Media Player handles licenses for secure media files when the media file is stored in the IE cache. Specifically, when a secure Windows Media file using WM DRM version 1.0 is opened, the media player erroneously returns the obfuscated location of the IE cache to the license server.
*   **Weakness:** Information disclosure vulnerability. The obfuscated location of the IE cache is revealed, which bypasses IE's security mechanisms and enables direct access to the cache.
*  **Impact:** An attacker could learn the location of the IE cache and potentially execute malicious code stored in the cache. This could lead to arbitrary code execution with the same privileges as the user.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Hosting a specially crafted media file on a website and enticing the user to visit it.
    *   Sending the specially crafted media file as an attachment in an HTML email.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Ability to create a specially formed Windows Media file that uses WM DRM version 1.0.
    *   Ability to host the file on a website or send it as an email attachment.
    *   User interaction is required to open the media file from the IE cache.

**Mitigating Factors:**
*   Users who have applied MS02-023 and read HTML email in the Restricted Sites zone are protected against automatic exploitation via email.
*   The vulnerability doesn't affect media files opened from the local machine.

**Patch:** The patch eliminates the vulnerability by ensuring that Windows Media Player does not return information regarding the location of the cache in IE when playing secure media files.
