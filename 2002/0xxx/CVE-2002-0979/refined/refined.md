Based on the provided content, here's an analysis regarding CVE-2002-0979:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the "Java logging" feature in the Microsoft Virtual Machine (MSVM) shipped with Internet Explorer. When enabled, this feature logs Java `System.out.println()` and `System.err.println()` output to a file: `%WINDIR%\java\javalog.txt`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerability stems from the fact that the output file location is fixed and known (`%WINDIR%\java\javalog.txt`), creating a potential avenue for exploitation
- This fixed location, in combination with the ability to trigger Java output through `System.out.println()` etc., can be used by attackers.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The main impact of exploitation, as alluded to in the content's reference to "HTTP-EQUIV's discovery", is that arbitrary code execution becomes possible. The document doesn't go into the exact details of how this is achieved, but the underlying mechanism likely involves manipulating the contents of the `javalog.txt` file and potentially tricking some other process into executing it as a script.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector would be through malicious Java applets or code running within the context of the browser that can write to `System.out`. This requires the logging feature to be enabled, which is disabled by default.
- By manipulating a web page to include a Java applet, the attacker could force the execution of their code by printing it to the `javalog.txt` file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to serve a web page that executes malicious Java code via the MSVM. This could be achieved by hosting the page on a compromised server or by sending a crafted HTML email.
- The user would need to have the Java logging feature explicitly enabled in Internet Explorer's advanced settings, increasing the attack's difficulty since it is disabled by default.

**Additional Notes:**
- The content explicitly states that the feature is disabled by default, thus reducing the risk.
- The content mentions "HTTP-EQUIV's discovery", which suggests that this vulnerability is likely tied to techniques discovered within that context.
