## SGI IRIX rpc.xfsmd uses weak authentication mechanism for RPC authentication

#### Vulnerability Note VU#521147

Original Release Date: 2002-08-08 | Last Revised: 2002-08-08

---

### Overview

The XFS file system on SGI systems allows anonymous remote users to call xfs-related RPC functions.

### Description

| XFS is a 64-bit compliant journaling file system. The XFS journaling filesystem daemon (*rpc.xfsmd*) on SGI systems uses the default AUTH\_UNIX authentication mechanism (a client-based security option) for its RPC service. This means the rpc.xfsmd daemon trusts that the remote system calling its RPC interface has already authenticated the remote client process via standard UNIX user id mechanisms (i.e., if a daemon only allows UID 0 [root] access to its RPC interface, it trusts remote RPC clients to be running with UID 0 [root] privileges).  As a result, any remote system able to forge UID 0 in its RPC call to vulnerable SGI rpc.xfsmd daemons can bypass the RPC authentication mechanism altogether. When exploited in conjunction with [VU#195371](http://www/kb.cert.org/vuls/id/195371), this could lead to the execution of arbitrary commands on vulnerable SGI systems. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker can bypass the default AUTH\_UNIX authentication mechanism for this RPC service, allowing anonymous RPC function calls |
| --- |

### Solution

| SGI has reported they will not be providing a patch for this issue. Sites are strongly urged to disable the XFS daemon and related subsystems as soon as their service requirements permit. |
| --- |

| Per SGI Security Advisory 20020606-02-I:There is no effective workaround available for these problems.SGI recommends either disabling or uninstalling the product.To disable the product from running, perform the following steps:  # killall /usr/etc/xfsmd  # vi /etc/inetd.conf  Look for a line in inetd.conf that looks like this:    sgi\_xfsmd/1 stream  rpc/tcp wait    root    ?/usr/etc/xfsmd     xfsmd  ...and comment it out by putting a "#" at the beginning of the line:    #sgi\_xfsmd/1 stream  rpc/tcp wait    root    ?/usr/etc/xfsmd     xfsmd  ...or simply remove the line from the file.  # killall -HUP inetdTo remove the product from the system, perform the following command:  # versions remove eoe.sw.xfsmserv |

                          SGI Security Advisory

        Title:      xfsmd vulnerability
        Number:     20020605-01-I
        Date:       June 20, 2002
        Reference:  CAN-2002-0359
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

- -----------------------
- --- Issue Specifics ---
- -----------------------

It's been reported that the /usr/etc/xfsmd daemon has security
vulnerabilities which can lead to a remote root exploit.

See <http://www.lsd-pl.net/> for more information.

SGI has investigated the issue and recommends the following steps for
neutralizing the exposure.  It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that these measures be
implemented on ALL vulnerable SGI systems.

Since the xfsmserv product is being retired, SGI has no plans to fix the
xfsmd security issue.

- --------------
- --- Impact ---
- --------------

The /usr/etc/xfsmd daemon is part of the optional eoe.sw.xfsmserv package,
and is not installed by default on IRIX 6.5 systems. but if it is installed,
it will run by default.

To determine the version of IRIX you are running, execute the following
command:

  # uname -R

That will return a result similar to the following:

  # 6.5 6.5.15f

The first number ("6.5") is the release name, the second ("6.5.15f" in this
77case) is the extended release name.  The extended release name is the
"version" we refer to throughout this document.

To see if xfsmd is installed, execute the following command:

  # versions eoe.sw.xfsmserv
  I = Installed, R = Removed

   Name                 Date        Description

   I  eoe                  08/28/2001  IRIX Execution Environment, 6.5.13f
   I  eoe.sw               08/28/2001  IRIX Execution Environment Software
   I  eoe.sw.xfsmserv      08/28/2001  XFSM Server Software

If the output resembles the above, then the package is installed and the
system is vulnerable.

This vulnerability was assigned the following CVE:
<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2002-0359>

- ----------------------------
- --- Temporary Workaround ---
- ----------------------------

There is no effective workaround available for these problems.
SGI recommends either disabling or uninstalling the product.

To disable the product from running, perform the following steps:

  # killall /usr/etc/xfsmd
  # vi /etc/inetd.conf

  Look for a line in inetd.conf that looks like this:

    sgi\_xfsmd/1 stream  rpc/tcp wait    root    ?/usr/etc/xfsmd     xfsmd

  ...and comment it out by putting a "#" at the beginning of the line:

    #sgi\_xfsmd/1 stream  rpc/tcp wait    root    ?/usr/etc/xfsmd     xfsmd

  ...or simply remove the line from the file.

  # killall -HUP inetd

To remove the product from the system, perform the following command:

  # versions remove eoe.sw.xfsmserv

- ----------------
- --- Solution ---
- ----------------

SGI will not be providing a fix or patches for this issue, as the product is
being retired. Our recommendation is to follow the instructions in the
Temporary Workaround section above.
