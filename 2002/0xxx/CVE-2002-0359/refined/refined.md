- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `rpc.xfsmd` daemon on SGI systems uses the default `AUTH_UNIX` authentication mechanism, which relies on the client's claimed UID. This allows a remote attacker to forge a UID 0 (root) in an RPC call, effectively bypassing authentication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Weak RPC authentication using `AUTH_UNIX`.
    - Trusting client-provided UIDs.
    - Allowing anonymous RPC function calls to `rpc.xfsmd`.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Bypassing authentication for the `rpc.xfsmd` service, allowing anonymous RPC function calls.
    - Potential for remote root exploit by combining with another vulnerability (VU#195371).
    - Execution of arbitrary commands on the vulnerable SGI system.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Network-based exploitation by sending forged RPC calls to the vulnerable `rpc.xfsmd` service.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Ability to send network packets to the vulnerable system.
    - Ability to forge a UID 0 in RPC calls.
