The content is related to the vulnerability described in CVE-2002-0319.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The pforum application fails to properly sanitize user input, specifically the username field during registration. This allows a malicious user to inject JavaScript code into their username.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application does not sanitize user-controlled input when displaying the username on various pages, allowing the injected JavaScript to execute within the context of other users' browsers.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A malicious user can steal other users' session IDs by executing malicious JavaScript code. With the session ID, an attacker can impersonate the victim and gain access to their account. This can also lead to an attacker gaining admin privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
A malicious user registers an account with a username containing JavaScript code. When other users visit pages that display the infected username, the malicious script executes in their browsers.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to register a new account on the vulnerable pforum instance. The attacker doesn't require any special privileges. The attacker can be remote.
