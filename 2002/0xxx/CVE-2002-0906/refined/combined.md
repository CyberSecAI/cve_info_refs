# Sendmail Open Source

## Email Security and Threat Protection

---

The sendmail Sentrion platform is specifically designed for large, complex environments, but we make a subset of that solution available as an open-source offering. Sentrion is not for everyone, but if you are using open source email for a large complex environment and need an enterprise platform that will enable your messaging roadmap for years to come (virtualization, consolidation, cloud migration, etc.), [speak with a specialist](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/contact) to see if Sendmail Sentrion is right for you.

[Frequently Asked Questions](/us/sendmail/faq)

### Current Sendmail Open Source Release

Sendmail [8.18.1](https://ftp.sendmail.org/sendmail.8.18.1.tar.gz) is available from [ftp.sendmail.org](https://ftp.sendmail.org/). The release has a [gzipped tar](https://ftp.sendmail.org/sendmail.8.18.1.tar.gz) file and a [PGP signature](https://ftp.sendmail.org/sendmail.8.18.1.tar.gz.sig) file. The compressed/gzipped tar files are [signed](#Signing_Keys) by the [2024 signing key](https://www.proofpoint.com/sites/default/files/signing-keys/sendmail2024.asc). See the Security and PGP Signing Keys section for more information about how releases are signed.

### Signing Keys

Security advisories are issued by The Computer Emergency Response Team [CERT](http://www.cert.org/). Sendmail server related security problems should be sent to:

**sendmail-security-*YYYY*@support.sendmail.org**

Replace YYYY with the current year, e.g., 2015. This address is only for reporting security problems in sendmail. When reporting security problems, please use PGP-the public key is available in the file PGPKEYS of the sendmail distribution.

**Please do not use this address to report problems that are not related to the security of the sendmail server.**Questions about [avoiding spam risk](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-reference/spam), how to set up your own certificate authorities, etc. should be posted in comp.mail.sendmail, and Unix-related security in the comp.security.unix newsgroup.

All sendmail distributions are signed with a PGP key named "Sendmail Signing Key/*YYYY*" where *YYYY* is the year of release.

### Contact Us

These addresses are for contributing patches or reporting problems about V8 sendmail. The members of these lists do not have the resources to support vendor versions. Before sending to any of these addresses, please check the [FAQ](/us/sendmail/faq "Sendmail FAQ") and the files README, sendmail/README (on this web-site as Compiling Sendmail) and cf/README (on this web-site as the Configuration README pages) to see if they are already answered; about half of the questions received can be answered in this way.

**Notes**

* Do not send us mail in HTML format, use plain text only (even multipart/alternative with an HTML part will be classified as spam by some of our members and hence an answer will most likely be delayed).
* Do not use 8bit characters in the Subject: nor use some encoding, e.g., =?GB2312?B?, but only plain 7bit ASCII without any charset encoding.
* If you send e-mail to sendmail.org, the answer will most likely not come from a system in the sendmail.org domain. If you use some anti-spam techniques (e.g., challenge-response systems) or you block hosts that are connected via DSL then please do not expect an answer. More and more often replies are blocked which is very annoying. Do not block this address or make sure that your system accepts at least STARTTLS secured mail. A list of IPs is available in the sendmail.org SPF record.
* If you use a challenge/response system, make sure that it does NOT send us a challenge when we reply to your question or when you receive mail from the announce list. We will not reply to those annoying mails.
* If you are using the blacklist from spamlist.org then please do not send us e-mail, the reply of the sendmail maintainer will not reach you.
* Do not send us mail in proprietary formats.
* The mailservers for support.sendmail.org now (2004-11-24) use the following DNSBLs:
  + sbl-xbl.spamhaus.org
  + dnsbl.sorbs.net
  + list.dsbl.org
  + bl.spamcop.net
* The mailserver for support.sendmail.org performs strict RFC checks, for example, it does not accept mail if the domain part has an [MX record](/us/threat-reference/mx-record "MX Record") that points to an IP address (instead of hostname as required).

If you have a question about sendmail, then please post it to the Usenet group comp.mail.sendmail. This newsgroup is dedicated to sendmail. Please make sure you check the usual resources before posting and follow the netiquette.

E-mail addresses to contact sendmail.org are (do *not* send questions about sendmail to these addresses, see above instead; replace YYYY with the current year, e.g., 2006, in all of these addresses):

* sendmail-YYYY@support.sendmail.org for contributing patches, feature requests, and general comments but not questions how to use, install, or configure sendmail;
* sendmail-bugs-YYYY@support.sendmail.org to report implementation bugs;
* sendmail-faq-YYYY@support.sendmail.org only for comments / questions about the FAQ. Please mark your mail clearly with "FAQ: item" where item is the entry in the faq to which you are referring. If it is a general comment about the FAQ, use "FAQ: general", if it is an addition, use "FAQ: new".
* sendmail-security-YYYY@support.sendmail.org (use this only to report related bugs or problems in sendmail). Please do not use this to ask about problems with your configuration, including how to stop spam, how to set up your own certificate authority, how to make sendmail work with S/MIME, etc. All such questions should be asked in comp.mail.sendmail. Also, please do not tell us that you were able to forge mail by using telnet to connect to port 25; this is fundamental to the Internet design for [SMTP](/us/threat-reference/smtp-relay "SMTP Relay"), and not a sendmail bug. Please use encryption to send mail to this address.
* sendmail-mirror-YYYY@support.sendmail.org for updates about a mirror (e.g., a new mirror or an address change).
* webmaster-YYYY@support.sendmail.org for comments about the website.

These are not open lists, meaning that subscription is by invitation only.

### DKIM

The [Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM)](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/corporate-blog/post/what-is-dkim) Internet standard enables email senders to digitally sign their messages so that receivers can verify that those messages have not been forged. The DKIM sender authentication scheme allows the recipient of a message to confirm a message originated with the sender’s domain and that the message content has not been altered. A cryptography-based solution, DKIM provides businesses an industry-standard method for mitigating [email fraud](/us/products/email-protection/email-fraud-defense "Email Fraud Defense") and [protecting an organization’s brand](/us/solutions/digital-risk/digital-brand-protection "Digital Brand Protection") and reputation at a relatively low implementation cost.

DKIM has been approved by the IETF as a draft standard (RFC 4871). The protocol was developed through the cooperation of Sendmail, Cisco Systems and Yahoo!

Since being approved by the IETF, a new open source project was started. The OpenDKIM Project is a community effort to develop and maintain a C library for producing DKIM-aware applications and an open source milter for providing DKIM service.

The project started from a code fork of version 2.8.3 of the open source [dkim-milter](http://sourceforge.net/projects/dkim-milter/) package developed and maintained by Sendmail, Inc.

The Sendmail [Sentrion Message Processing Engine](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/products/email-protection/open-source-email-solution) comes standard with OpenDKIM. More information is available at [opendkim.org](http://opendkim.org/) and [dkim.org](http://dkim.org/)

## Sendmail vulnerable to buffer overflow when DNS map is specified using TXT records

#### Vulnerability Note VU#814627

Original Release Date: 2002-06-28 | Last Revised: 2004-12-20

---

### Overview

A remotely exploitable buffer overflow exists in Sendmail, versions 8.12.0 through 8.12.4. This vulnerability only exhibits itself if you have modified the configuration file to look up TXT records in DNS.

### Description

| The buffer overflow occurs in the portion of code that process responses from DNS servers. **Please note that the Sendmail Consortium has indicated that this vulnerability is not present in the standard Sendmail distribution because the option that can trigger the exposure is not enabled**. For more details, please see the [Sendmail announcement](http://www.sendmail.org/8.12.5.html). |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Sendmail daemon, typically root. Note that there is no known exploit for this vulnerability. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Upgrade to Sendmail 8.12.5 or apply the appropriate vendor-supplied patch. |

parse\_xml.cgi application to authenticate and interface with the user.
This CGI
can pass unvalidated input which could allow a remote attacker to
execute
arbitrary code on the server and to gain root privileges.  Credit to
Dave G.
from @stake, Inc. for finding this vulnerability.

\* QuickTime Streaming Server: Fixes CAN-2003-0051 QTSS Physical path
revelation.
  The QuickTime Streaming Administration Server relies on the
parse\_xml.cgi
application to authenticate and interface with the user.  This CGI
could be used
to reveal the physical path upon which the Darwin/Quicktime
Administration
Servers are installed within.  Credit to @stake, Inc. for finding this
vulnerability.

\* QuickTime Streaming Server: Fixes CAN-2003-0052 QTSS Directory
listings. The
QuickTime Streaming Administration Server relies on the parse\_xml.cgi
application to authenticate and interface with the user.  This CGI
could be used
to reveal arbitrary directory listings due to the lack of user input
validation
within the application.  Credit to Ollie Whitehouse from @stake, Inc.
for
finding this vulnerability.

\* QuickTime Streaming Server: Fixes CAN-2003-0053 QTSS Login
credentials.  The
QuickTime Streaming Administration Server relies on the parse\_xml.cgi
application to authenticate and interface with the user.  A
vulnerability in the
handling of error messages from this CGI could be used in a cross-site
scripting
attack to gain valid login credentials.  Credit to Ollie Whitehouse
from @stake,
Inc. for finding this vulnerability.

\* QuickTime Streaming Server: Fixes CAN-2003-0054 Arbitrary command
execution
when viewing QTSS logs. If an unauthenticated user of QuickTime
Streaming Server
makes a request to the streaming port, the request is then written to
the log
file.  It is possible to craft the request such that arbitrary code can
be
executed when the logs are viewed by the system administrator via a
browser.
Credit to Ollie Whitehouse from @stake, Inc. for finding this
vulnerability.

\* QuickTime Streaming Server: Fixes CAN-2003-0055 Buffer overflow in MP3
Broadcasting application.  There is a buffer overflow in the stand-alone
MP3Broadcaster application.  An MP3 file which has a filename of over
256 bytes
will cause a buffer overflow to occur. This could be used by local/ftp
users to
obtain elevated privileges.  Credit to Ollie Whitehouse from @stake,
Inc. for
finding this vulnerability.

\* Sendmail:  Fixes CAN-2002-0906 Buffer overflow in Sendmail before
8.12.5, when
configured to use a custom DNS map to query TXT records, could permit a
denial
of service attack and possibly allow execution of arbitrary code.  Mac
OS X
10.2.4 contains Sendmail 8.12.6 with the SMRSH fix applied to also
address
CAN-2002-1165 .

\* AFP:  Fixes CAN-2003-0049 "AFP login permissions for the system
administrator".  Provides an option whereby a system administrator may
or may
not be allowed to log in as a user, authenticating via their admin
password.
Previously, administrators could always log in as a user,
authenticating via
their own admin password.

\* Classic:  Fixes CAN-2003-0088 , where an attacker may change an
environment
variable to create arbitrary files or overwrite existing files, which
could lead
to obtaining elevated privileges.  Credit to Dave G. from @stake, Inc.
for
discovering this issue.

\* Samba: Previous releases of Mac OS X are not vulnerable to
CAN-2002-1318 , an
issue in Samba's length checking for encrypted password changes.  Mac
OS X
currently uses Directory Services for authentication, and does not call
the
vulnerable Samba function. However, to prevent a potential future
exploit via
this function, the patch from Samba 2.2.7 was applied although the
version of
Samba was not changed for this update release.  Further information is
available
from: <http://samba.org/samba/whatsnew/samba-2.2.7.html>

\* Integrated WebDAV Digest Authentication: The mod\_digest\_apple Apache
module
has been added to more easily enable digest authentication for an
existing
WebDAV realm.  This eliminates the need to maintain a separate digest
file
containing the list of authorized users, passwords, and realms.
mod\_digest\_apple works in coordination with Open Directory for user
authentication.  For further details, open the Help Viewer after
installing Mac
OS X Server version 10.2.4, select Mac OS X Server Help in the drawer,
and
search for "New: Enabling Integrated WebDAV Digest Authentication."
