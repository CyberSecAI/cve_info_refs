Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2002-0691:

**Vulnerability:** Variant of Cross-Site Scripting in Local HTML Resource.

*   **Root Cause:** A flaw in how Internet Explorer handles local HTML resources, allowing scripts to run in the Local Computer zone with fewer restrictions than the Internet Zone. This is a new variant of the vulnerability discussed in MS02-023.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Improper handling of local HTML resources allows a script to execute with the privileges of the Local Computer Zone.
    *   The vulnerability allows HTML scripts to execute as if they were run locally on the user's system.

*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker can create a web page that, when opened, runs in the Local Computer zone, allowing it to run with fewer restrictions than it would in the Internet Zone.
    *   Scripts could take any action on the local system as if it were run locally, which could include actions such as reading files, sending data to remote sites, or modifying system settings.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attacker can host a malicious web page on a website.
    *   The attacker can send the malicious web page as an HTML email.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to create a specially crafted HTML page.
    *   The attacker needs to entice the user to open the malicious HTML page, either by visiting a website or opening an HTML email.

**Additional Details:**

*   The document clarifies that while Internet Explorer 5.01, 5.5, and 6 were all affected by the original vulnerability, the patch in MS02-023 already fixed both the original and new variants for Internet Explorer 6. However, this new variant impacts IE 5.01 and 5.5, and the current patch fixes it for those versions.
*   The document also notes that Outlook 98, 2000, 2002, and Outlook Express 6, all open HTML mail in the Restricted Sites Zone which would prevent attacks via email (unless user clicks on a link within the email).
*   Mitigating factors include the user having limited rights on the system or using the "Read as Plain Text" feature in Outlook.
