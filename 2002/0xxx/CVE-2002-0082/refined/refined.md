  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2002-0082",
    "description": "A buffer overflow has been found in `mod_ssl` in all versions prior to 2.8.7-1.3.23 (February 23rd 2002). All versions of Apache-SSL prior to 1.3.22+1.4.6 are [also vulnerable](http://www.apache-ssl.org/advisory-20020301.txt) to this issue. This overflow can occur in the `dbm` and `shm` shared memory session cache. The default configuration of `mod_ssl` is not vulnerable, and in practice it is unlikely to be a security problem for many sites. To exploit the overflow, the server must be configured to allow client certificates, and an attacker must obtain a carefully crafted client certificate that has been signed by a Certificate Authority which is trusted by the server. Only the `dbm` and `shm` (also known as `shmht`) session caches are vulnerable.",
    "root_cause": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists within the `dbm` and `shm` shared memory session cache in `mod_ssl` and Apache-SSL.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability could allow an attacker to potentially execute arbitrary code on the server.",
      "attack_vectors": [
          "The overflow occurs during client certificate authentication when the server is configured to allow client certificates.",
           "Exploitation requires a crafted client certificate."
       ],
       "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must obtain a carefully crafted client certificate signed by a Certificate Authority trusted by the server. The server also needs to be configured to use client certificates and the `dbm` or `shm` session cache."
