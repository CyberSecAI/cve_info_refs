- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A flaw in the Windows Certificate Enrollment Control allows for the deletion of digital certificates.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The Certificate Enrollment Control, designed to install new certificates, can be exploited to delete existing certificates on the user's system, bypassing its intended restrictions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could delete any or all certificates on a user's system, preventing them from using features reliant on those certificates, such as email encryption/signing, secure website access (SSL), network security features using smart cards, and Encrypting File System (EFS).
- **Attack vectors:**
    - A malicious web page could exploit the vulnerability when visited by a user.
    - A malicious HTML email could exploit the vulnerability when opened by a user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to create a malicious web page or HTML email that invokes the Certificate Enrollment Control in a specific way to delete certificates. They don't need to have any specific access to the user's system other than the user visiting the malicious web page or opening the email.
