- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An integer overflow in the calculation of the maximum permitted FFS file size. This allows users to create files larger than what the virtual memory system can handle. Accessing these oversized files leads to memory mapping issues, potentially mapping filesystem metadata into the user file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Integer overflow leading to incorrect file size calculations and subsequent mapping of file system metadata into user space
- **Impact of exploitation:** Local attackers can cause a denial of service by corrupting the file system or potentially gain superuser privileges by reading and writing arbitrary files.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access is required. Specifically, a user must have write access to at least one file in the file system. The vulnerability is only exploitable on FFS file systems with a block size of 16k or greater on i386 architecture or 32k or greater on alpha architecture and when there are at least 6 free blocks available
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Local user with write access to a file on a vulnerable file system.
