The provided content describes a vulnerability in Bugzilla where users could see and select product options in the product dropdown menu that they did not have access to.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper access control when displaying the product list during bug modification. The system was not filtering the product options based on the user's permissions, allowing users to see and potentially select products they were not authorized to access.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Inadequate access control on the product dropdown in `show_bug.cgi`. Specifically, the product list was not filtered based on user permissions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially reassign a bug to a product that they do not have access to, circumventing intended access controls.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability could be exploited by navigating to a bug report view (`show_bug.cgi`) and attempting to modify the bug's product through the dropdown menu.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need to be a valid Bugzilla user with access to at least one product and the ability to view and edit bugs. They would need to be able to access the bug report in order to attempt the exploit.
