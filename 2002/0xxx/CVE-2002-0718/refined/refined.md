- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability exists due to a combination of two flaws in how Microsoft Content Management Server (MCMS) handles web authoring commands, specifically for uploading files. The first flaw lies in the authentication process, where MCMS uses the wrong identity when confirming user permissions, effectively allowing any user to submit an upload request. The second flaw enables an attacker to override the temporary upload location, directing it to a directory where the uploaded files can be executed.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Authentication bypass: MCMS fails to properly authenticate the user making the upload request, allowing unauthorized users to proceed.
    - Insecure file upload: MCMS allows the attacker to specify the temporary upload location, bypassing intended restrictions that prevent execution of uploaded files.

- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Remote code execution: By exploiting these flaws, an attacker can upload and execute arbitrary code (e.g., ASP files) on the server.
    - Limited privileges: The attacker's code executes within the security context of the Web Application Manager (IWAM_computername), which has privileges similar to a user who can log onto the server interactively. This doesn't grant full system control, but it does provide a foothold for further attacks and privilege escalation attempts.

- **Attack vectors:**
    - Network access: Attackers need network connectivity to the affected server to submit a web authoring request.
    - Crafted HTTP requests: Attackers send specially crafted requests to the server using the web authoring interface.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
   - Network connectivity: The attacker must have the ability to send requests to the affected server.
   - Knowledge of the vulnerable web authoring command: The attacker must be aware of the specific web authoring command and the method to bypass authentication and control the temporary upload location.
