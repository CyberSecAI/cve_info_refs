      "vulnerabilityDetails": {
        "rootCause": "A logic error in a function that handles server-side file includes for Active Server Pages (ASP). The function could incorrectly conclude that it's safe to store a user-specified filename in a buffer, even if the filename is too long.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Buffer Overflow"
        ],
        "impact": "An attacker could cause a denial of service by corrupting program code, or potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the ASP ISAPI extension (ASP.DLL). In IIS 4.0, this could lead to full system control, while in IIS 5.0 and 5.1, it would grant the privileges of the IWAM_*computername* account (similar to an unprivileged user).",
        "attackVectors": "An attacker could send a specially crafted request to a vulnerable server with a long, invalid filename that is processed as a server-side include.",
         "requiredCapabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to establish a web session with the affected server."

       "vulnerabilityDetails": {
        "rootCause": "A logic error when processing server-side include files with long, invalid file names. IIS incorrectly checks the file name length, leading to a buffer overflow.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Buffer Overflow"
        ],
         "impact": "An attacker could either disrupt the server's normal operation (DoS) or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the ASP ISAPI extension (ASP.DLL). This means full administrative control on IIS 4.0 or IWAM account privileges on IIS 5.0 and 5.1.",
        "attackVectors": "An attacker sends a request that includes a long, invalid file name, which then triggers a server-side include.",
        "requiredCapabilities": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. Active Server Pages (ASP) must be enabled on the server."
