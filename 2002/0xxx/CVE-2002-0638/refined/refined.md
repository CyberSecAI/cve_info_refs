{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a race condition in the util-linux package's setpwnam.c file when handling file locking during modifications to /etc/passwd. The chfn and chsh utilities, which are setuid root, use this code. The locking mechanism involves creating a temporary file (/etc/ptmptmp), linking it to /etc/ptmp, and then removing /etc/ptmptmp. The issue arises because the temporary file is opened without O_EXCL, and if the process is stopped between steps 2 and 3 (linking and removing), the /etc/ptmp lock file may be left dangling. If an admin removes this dangling lock, a second instance of chfn can then be triggered while the first instance is still running, allowing for a crafted modification of /etc/passwd",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Inadequate file locking mechanism in setpwnam.c: The absence of O_EXCL when creating the temporary lock file allows for a race condition.",
      "Lack of proper error handling and checks when reopening /etc/ptmptmp and using open file descriptors.",
        "Buffered output with fputs() makes it possible to truncate the /etc/passwd file on a 4kB boundary."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation can lead to local privilege escalation by allowing an attacker to modify the /etc/passwd file. This can result in the creation of new root accounts, the modification of existing account passwords or other similar privilege escalation scenarios.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is local. A local user can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the chfn (or chsh) utility.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to execute the chfn or chsh commands, and they must be able to stop/continue processes using signals like SIGSTOP and SIGCONT. The attacker also needs to cause the administrator to remove a dangling lock file (/etc/ptmp), which can be achieved through repeated attempts to create the lock."
