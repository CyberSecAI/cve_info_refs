## PHP fails to properly parse the headers of HTTP POST requests

#### Vulnerability Note VU#929115

Original Release Date: 2002-07-22 | Last Revised: 2003-05-30

---

### Overview

A vulnerability has been discovered in PHP. This vulnerability could be used by a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or crash PHP and/or the web server.

### Description

| PHP is a popular scripting language in widespread use. For more information about PHP, see <http://www.php.net/manual/en/faq.general.php>.  The vulnerability occurs in the portion of PHP code responsible for handling file uploads, specifically multipart/form-data. By sending a specially crafted POST request to the web server, an attacker can corrupt the internal data structures used by PHP. Specifically, an intruder can cause an improperly initialized memory structure to be freed. In most cases, an intruder can use this flaw to crash PHP or the web server. Under some circumstances, an intruder may be able to take advantage of this flaw to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the web server.You may be aware that freeing memory at inappropriate times in some implementations of malloc and free does not usually result in the execution of arbitrary code. However, because PHP utilizes its own memory management system, the implementation of malloc and free is irrelevant to this problem.Stefan Esser of e-matters GmbH has indicated that intruders cannot execute code on x86 systems. However, we encourage system administrators to apply patches on x86 systems as well to guard against denial-of-service attacks and as-yet-unknown attack techniques that may permit the execution of code on x86 architectures.This vulnerability was discovered by e-matters GmbH and is described in detail in their advisory. The PHP Group has also issued an advisory. A list of vendors contacted by the CERT/CC and their status regarding this vulnerability is available in VU#929115.Although this vulnerability only affects PHP 4.2.0 and 4.2.1, e-matters GmbH has previously identified vulnerabilities in older versions of PHP. If you are running older versions of PHP, we encourage you to review <http://security.e-matters.de/advisories/012002.html>. |

### Impact

| A remote attacker can execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system. An attacker may not be able to execute code on x86 architectures due to the way the stack is structured. However, an attacker can leverage this vulnerability to crash PHP and/or the web server running on an x86 architecture. |

### Solution

| **Apply a patch from your vendor**   | [Appendix A](http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2002-21.html#vendors) contains information provided by vendors for this advisory. As vendors report new information to the CERT/CC, we will update this section and note the changes in our revision history. If a particular vendor is not listed below, we have not received their comments. Please contact your vendor directly. **Upgrade to the latest version of PHP**If a patch is not available from your vendor, [upgrade](http://www.php.net/downloads.php) to version 4.2.2. **Deny POST requests**  Until patches or an update can be applied, you may wish to deny POST requests. The following workaround is taken from the [PHP Security Advisory](http://www.php.net/release_4_2_2.php):     If the PHP applications on an affected web server do not rely on HTTP POST input from user agents, it is often possible to deny POST requests on the web server. In the Apache web server, for example, this is possible with the following code included in the main configuration file or a top-level .htaccess file:  <Limit POST>   Order deny,allow   Deny from all</Limit>  Note that an existing configuration and/or .htaccess file may have parameters contradicting the example given above.  **Disable vulnerable service** Until you can upgrade or apply patches, you may wish to disable PHP. As a best practice, the CERT/CC recommends disabling all services that are not explicitly required. Before deciding to disable PHP, carefully consider your service requirements. | | --- | |

     Advisory: Remote Compromise/DOS Vulnerability in PHP
 Release Date: 2002/07/22
Last Modified: 2002/07/22
       Author: Stefan Esser [s.esser@e-matters.de]

  Application: PHP 4.2.0, 4.2.1
     Severity: A vulnerability within the multipart/form-data handler
               could allow remote compromise of the web server.
         Risk: Critical
Vendor Status: Patches Released.
    Reference: <http://security.e-matters.de/advisories/022002.html>

Overview:

   We have discovered a serious vulnerability within the default version
   of PHP. Depending on the processor architecture it may be possible for a
   remote attacker to either crash or compromise the web server.

Details:

   PHP 4.2.0 introduced a completely rewritten multipart/form-data POST
   handler. While I was working on the code in my role as PHP developer
   i found a bug within the way the mime headers are processed.
   A malformed POST request can trigger an error condition, that is not
   correctly handled. Due to this bug it could happen that an uninit-
   ialised struct gets appended to the linked list of mime headers.
   When the lists gets cleaned or destroyed PHP tries to free the pointers
   that are expected in the struct. Because of the lack of initialisation
   those pointers contain stuff that was left on the stack by previous
   function calls.

   On the IA32 architecture (aka. x86) it is not possible to control what
   will end up in the uninitialised struct because of the stack layout. All
   possible code paths leave illegal addresses within the struct and PHP
   will crash when it tries to free them.

   Unfortunately the situation is absolutely different if you look on a
   solaris sparc installation. Here it is possible for an attacker to free
   chunks of memory that are full under his control. This is most probably
   the case for several more non IA32 architectures.

   Please note that exploitability is not only limited to systems that are
   running malloc()/free() implementations that are known to be vulnerable
   to control structure overwrites. This is because the internal PHP memory
   managment implements its own linked list system that can be used to
   overwrite nearly arbitrary memory addresses.

Proof of Concept:

   e-matters is not going to release the exploit for this vulnerability to
   the public.

Vendor Response:

   22th July 2002 - An updated version of PHP which fixes this
                    vulnerability was released and can be downloaded at:

                       <http://www.php.net/downloads.php>

                    The vendor announcement is available at:

                       <http://www.php.net/release_4_2_2.php>

Recommendation:

   If you are running PHP 4.2.x you should upgrade as soon as possible,
   especially if your server runs on a non IA32 CPU. If you cannot upgrade
   for whatever reason the only way to workaround this, is to disable all
   kinds of POST requests on your server.

## Former Director Richard Pethia

[Richard Pethia](/about/leadership/display.cfm?customel_datapageid_2623=3545) was founding director of the SEI's CERT Division. Pethia, who served as director of CERT from 1988 to 2016, guided the organization through tremendous growth and change. Under Pethia's leadership, the unit expanded and evolved from the CERT Coordination Center—a small group focused on computer incident response—to a research organization of more than 200 professionals dedicated to solving problems with widespread cybersecurity implications.

   PHP Security Advisory: Vulnerability in PHP versions 4.2.0 and 4.2.1

Issued on: July 22, 2002
Software:  PHP versions 4.2.0 and 4.2.1
Platforms: All

   The PHP Group has learned of a serious security vulnerability in PHP
   versions 4.2.0 and 4.2.1. An intruder may be able to execute arbitrary
   code with the privileges of the web server. This vulnerability may be
   exploited to compromise the web server and, under certain conditions,
   to gain privileged access.

Description

   PHP contains code for intelligently parsing the headers of HTTP POST
   requests. The code is used to differentiate between variables and files
   sent by the user agent in a "multipart/form-data" request. This parser
   has insufficient input checking, leading to the vulnerability.

   The vulnerability is exploitable by anyone who can send HTTP POST
   requests to an affected web server. Both local and remote users, even
   from behind firewalls, may be able to gain privileged access.

Impact

   Both local and remote users may exploit this vulnerability to compromise
   the web server and, under certain conditions, to gain privileged access.
   So far only the IA32 platform has been verified to be safe from the
   execution of arbitrary code. The vulnerability can still be used on IA32
   to crash PHP and, in most cases, the web server.

Solution

   The PHP Group has released a new PHP version, 4.2.2, which incorporates
   a fix for the vulnerability. All users of affected PHP versions are
   encouraged to upgrade to this latest version. The downloads web site at

      <http://www.php.net/downloads.php>

   has the new 4.2.2 source tarballs, Windows binaries and source patches
   from 4.2.0 and 4.2.1 available for download.

Workaround

   If the PHP applications on an affected web server do not rely on HTTP
   POST input from user agents, it is often possible to deny POST requests
   on the web server.

   In the Apache web server, for example, this is possible with the
   following code included in the main configuration file or a top-level
   .htaccess file:

      <Limit POST>
          Order deny,allow
          Deny from all
      </Limit>

   Note that an existing configuration and/or .htaccess file may have
   parameters contradicting the example given above.

Credits

   The PHP Group would like to thank Stefan Esser of e-matters GmbH for
   discovering this vulnerability.
