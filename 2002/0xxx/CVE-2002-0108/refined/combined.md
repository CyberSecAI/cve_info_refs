## Allaire Forums does not verify user information stored in hidden form fields

#### Vulnerability Note VU#575619

Original Release Date: 2002-09-26 | Last Revised: 2002-09-26

---

### Overview

Allaire Forums does not verify user information submitted in hidden fields on a web form, allowing attackers to impersonate other users.

### Description

| Allaire Forums is a web-based bulletin board system that runs on Cold Fusion. When a user wishes to post a message, Allaire Forums dynamically generates a web form including the user's name and email address in hidden fields. Attackers may easily change these fields to specify a different user, and Alliare Forums does not check the submission to authenticate the user. Therefore, attackers may post messages to the bulletin board signed by a different user's name and email address. |
| --- |

### Impact

| Malicious users of Allaire Forums may impersonate other users. |
| --- |

### Solution

| The CERT/CC is currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem. |
