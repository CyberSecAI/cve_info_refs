Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the identified vulnerabilities:

**CVE-2002-0010:**

*   **Root Cause:**  The `editusers.cgi` script in Bugzilla versions prior to 2.16 does not properly validate input when modifying user group sets, allowing users with `blessgroupset != 0` to manipulate the groupset of any user.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The script directly uses raw form values without proper validation or sanitization before using them in SQL queries.
    *   **Inadequate Privilege Checks:** Users with `blessgroupset != 0` were allowed to modify any user's groupset, regardless of their privileges for those groups.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could modify any user's groupset, potentially granting themselves or others administrative privileges or access to sensitive information/functions.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Form Manipulation:** An attacker modifies form elements (specifically, the value of bit fields) on the `editusers.cgi` page to inject malicious SQL code.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs a Bugzilla account with `blessgroupset != 0`, which grants the ability to manage some groups.

**CVE-2002-0010 (additional notes from bug report):**

*   The initial patch attempts using `detaint_natural()` were insufficient because attackers could bypass the sanitization by doing the math themselves and submitting the result.
*   The vulnerability was exploitable by inserting a crafted value like `-$fudge+9223372036854775807` into a form field. The value of `$fudge` could be determined by looking at the SQL error output.
*   The fix involved using a combination of approaches to validate and sanitize the input properly to ensure that only valid bits were used.

**Bug 109679 (fieldx-x-x values not validated):**

*   **Root Cause:** The `buglist.cgi` script does not validate the `fieldx-x-x` parameters used in advanced queries. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL into the query.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** By manipulating the `fieldx-x-x` parameters in a URL, an attacker could inject arbitrary SQL code into the generated SQL query.
    *   **Lack of Input Validation:** The script does not check if the provided `fieldx-x-x` values are valid column names in the database.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could potentially read or modify sensitive data within the database, or create denial-of-service conditions.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **URL Manipulation:** By crafting a malicious URL that includes SQL code in the `fieldx-x-x` parameters, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker can be any user capable of crafting and submitting a URL.

**Bug 109679 (additional notes from bug report):**

*   The vulnerability was found while enabling taint mode, which is a feature in Perl to help identify security issues related to untrusted data.
*   The fix involves validating the field names against the `fielddefs` table, which contains the list of valid fields, before using them in the query.
*  The `long_desc` field was an exception and had to be manually added to the validation list.
*  The final fix validates only user-submitted values, and exempts values that are internally generated as part of the query building process.

**Bug 109690 (longlist.cgi doesn't check that $bug is valid):**

*   **Root Cause:** The `longlist.cgi` script does not validate the `$bug` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The script directly uses the `$bug` parameter in a SQL query without validation.
    *   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The script fails to sanitize or validate the `$bug` parameter before constructing the SQL query.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could potentially read or modify sensitive data within the database or create a denial-of-service condition.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **URL Manipulation:** An attacker crafts a malicious URL that includes SQL code in the `buglist` parameter, which is then passed into the `$bug` variable.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    * The attacker can be any user capable of crafting and submitting a URL.

**Bug 109690 (additional notes from bug report):**
* An exploit using `INTO OUTFILE` was possible, potentially allowing attackers to write files to the server.
* The fix uses `detaint_natural($bug) || next;` to sanitize and validate the `$bug` variable, which prevents the injection by ensuring that the value is numeric.

**Bug 108822 (Any user can change their groupset!):**

*   **Root Cause:** The `userprefs.cgi` script is vulnerable to SQL injection by not sanitizing user provided data in the `mybugslink` parameter.
*  **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The script uses the `mybugslink` form value directly in a SQL query, enabling SQL injection.
    *  **Lack of Input Validation:** The script does not sanitize or validate the  `mybugslink` parameter before using it in the SQL query.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could modify their own groupset or potentially other user's groupset, gaining unauthorized access.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Form Manipulation:** By manipulating the `mybugslink` value in the user preferences form, an attacker can inject SQL.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    * The attacker needs a Bugzilla account, that can access user preferences page.

**Bug 108822 (additional notes from bug report):**

*   The vulnerability is exploitable by setting `mybugslink` to a value like  `1', groupset='9223372036854775807`
*  The fix sanitizes the value using  `SqlQuote`

**Bug 108812 (We allow the user to send arbitrary SQL!!!!!):**

*   **Root Cause:** The `buglist.cgi` script allows users to provide an arbitrary SQL query through the `sql` parameter in a URL.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The script executes the `sql` parameter without any sanitization or validation.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can execute any SQL query against the database, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or denial-of-service conditions.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **URL Manipulation:** An attacker can craft a URL with a malicious `sql` parameter to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker only needs the ability to make HTTP requests to the `buglist.cgi` script.

**Bug 108812 (additional notes from bug report):**

*   The `sql` parameter was presumably added for advanced query support.
* The fix involves commenting out the vulnerable code with a warning, rather than deleting it outright.

In summary, all of these vulnerabilities involve inadequate input validation in various Bugzilla components, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities and potential privilege escalation. The patches address these issues by either validating, sanitizing or removing the vulnerable code.
