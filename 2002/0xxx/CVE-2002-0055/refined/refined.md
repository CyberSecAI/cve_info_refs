CVE-2002-0055
```

- **Vulnerability:** A denial of service vulnerability exists in the Windows 2000 SMTP service due to how it handles a specific type of SMTP command used for transferring incoming mail data.
- **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a malformed version of the BDAT command to the SMTP service, causing it to fail. This can crash the `inetinfo.exe` process, which hosts the SMTP service, as well as other services like IIS, FTP, and Gopher.
- **Attack Vector:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by establishing a connection with the SMTP service and sending a malformed BDAT command within the data stream that is purported to be an incoming mail.
- **Impact:** Successful exploitation leads to a denial of service, disrupting mail services and potentially other internet services running under `inetinfo.exe`. Although the services should automatically restart, established sessions will be dropped.
- **Affected Systems:** Windows 2000, Windows XP Professional, and Exchange 2000 (which uses the native Windows 2000 SMTP service).
- **Mitigation:**
  - Apply the patch provided by Microsoft (MS02-012).
  - Disable the SMTP service if it is not needed.
- **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to establish a network connection to the affected system's SMTP service (typically port 25).
