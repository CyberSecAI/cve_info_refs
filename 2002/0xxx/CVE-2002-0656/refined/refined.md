  "CVE-2002-0656": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the OpenSSL server's SSLv2 handshake process due to a malformed key from the client.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Buffer overflow",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution on the server with the privileges of the exploited service/application.",
      "Attack vectors": "A malicious SSL client sends a malformed key to the server during the SSLv2 handshake.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker must be able to connect to an OpenSSL server using SSLv2 protocol.",
     "More Info": "This vulnerability is also present in the OpenSSL client's SSLv3 handshake process by a malicious server sending a large session ID to the client."
    },
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The SSL2 client master key could be oversized, leading to a buffer overflow.",
       "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Buffer Overflow",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Remote root exploit",
      "Attack vectors": "Oversized client master key during the SSL2 handshake.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to connect to vulnerable service using SSL2."

    {
       "Root cause of vulnerability": "The session ID supplied to a client in SSL3 could be oversized and overrun a buffer.",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Buffer overflow",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution on the client system with the privileges of the current user",
      "Attack vectors":"A malicious server sending an oversized session ID to the client during the SSL3 handshake.",
