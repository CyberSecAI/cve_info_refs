The provided content is related to CVE-2002-0830.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A flaw in the NFS server code, specifically in handling incoming RPC messages, causes a loop in the message chain. When the server receives a zero-length payload, it references the payload from the previous message, leading to an infinite loop when another part of the server code attempts to traverse the chain.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper handling of zero-length RPC payloads.
- A message chain loop due to incorrect pointer management.
- An infinite loop in the NFS server code when traversing the corrupted message chain.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service. The server locks up or becomes unresponsive when receiving malicious RPC messages.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending crafted RPC messages with zero-length payloads to the vulnerable NFS server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position to send RPC messages to the target FreeBSD system. This could be a client on the same network, or a machine capable of reaching the server.
