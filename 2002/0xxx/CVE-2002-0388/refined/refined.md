Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Mailman 2.0.11 release addresses two cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
Two cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities were found:
1. In the admin login page, reported by "office".
2. In the Pipermail index summaries, reported by Tristan Roddis.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these XSS vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the affected web pages. This could potentially lead to:
* Session hijacking
* Cookie theft
* Defacement of the web page
* Redirection to malicious sites
* Other malicious actions depending on the injected script

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vectors are through the web interfaces of Mailman:
1. The admin login page.
2. The Pipermail index summaries.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker would need to be able to inject malicious script code into the vulnerable input fields of the affected pages. Specifically for these XSS issues, it's not stated if it's persistent or reflected XSS. The attacker would need to get the admin to visit the admin page, or a user to view the pipermail index to execute the injected scripts.

The provided text provides more details than a basic CVE description by identifying the specific vulnerable components (admin login, Pipermail index summaries) and the impact (script injection).
