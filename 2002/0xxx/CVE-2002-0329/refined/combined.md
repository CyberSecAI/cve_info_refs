## Snitz Forums 2000 vulnerable to cross-site scripting via crafted IMG tag

#### Vulnerability Note VU#132011

Original Release Date: 2002-06-13 | Last Revised: 2002-06-13

---

### Overview

Snitz Forums 2000 does not adequately check "IMG" tag "SRC" attributes and thus contains cross-site scripting vulnerability.

### Description

| Snitz Forums is an automated bulletin-board program for web sites. Snitz Forums allows users to submit images by specifying the URL of the image. In versions 3.3.03 and earlier of Snitz Forums, the program does not check the image URL to make sure that it does not contain JavaScript code. The program may then serve the script to any user viewing the post, where the JavaScript may be executed to perform unauthorized commands as the viewing user. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker may perform arbitrary commands with the privileges and identity of other users of the Snitz Forums installation. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Upgrade to version 3.3.04 or later of Snitz Forums 2000. For more information, see  <http://forum.snitz.com/forum/link.asp?TOPIC_ID=23660> |
