This document describes multiple vulnerabilities addressed by Microsoft Security Bulletin MS02-005. This specific entry refers to **CAN-2002-0023**, which is:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A vulnerability exists in the `GetObject` scripting function within Internet Explorer. The function performs security checks before providing a handle to an operating system object. However, by requesting a handle to a file using a specially malformed representation, it's possible to bypass some of these checks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper validation of input to the `GetObject` function, allowing an attacker to bypass security checks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can read files on the user's system that are not locked by the operating system. The attacker cannot create, change, delete, or execute these files.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Web-based attacks:** An attacker could host a malicious web page that, when visited by the user, would exploit the vulnerability to read files.
- **Email-based attacks:** An attacker could send a specially crafted HTML email to the user, and upon opening the email, the vulnerability would be exploited.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious webpage or send a crafted email to the target.
- The attacker must know or be able to guess the exact path and filename of the target files to be read.
