- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Entrust Authority Security Manager (EASM) does not enforce the multiple authorization requirement for changing a master user's password under certain conditions, possibly involving the command line interface (CLI).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper enforcement of multiple authorization for a sensitive operation (master user password change).
- **Impact of exploitation:** A single master user can change another master user's password and then impersonate that user to perform sensitive operations that require multiple authorizations, potentially leading to a denial of service by stopping EASM services.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation likely involves the command-line interface (CLI) and requires a valid master user account.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attacker must have a valid master user account on the affected EASM system.
