The provided content is related to CVE-2002-0341.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an input validation error in Novell GroupWise Web Access. When a web request containing unexpected arguments for script variables is submitted, it causes an error message to be displayed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper input validation. Specifically, the application doesn't properly handle unexpected arguments in a web request.
- Path disclosure vulnerability: The error message reveals the full server path to the webroot directory, exposing internal system information.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The attacker can learn the full path to the webroot directory.
- This information can be used to further probe the server for additional vulnerabilities or to assist with other attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the server. The specific vector is using unexpected arguments for script variables. For example: `GET /cgi-bin/GW5/GWWEB.EXE?GET-CONTEXT&HTMLVER=AAA HTTP/1.0`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No authentication is required.
