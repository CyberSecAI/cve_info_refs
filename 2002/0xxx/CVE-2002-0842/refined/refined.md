**Analysis of CVE-2002-0842**

Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2002-0842:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a format string flaw in the `ap_log_rerror()` function within certain implementations of the `mod_dav` module. This flaw occurs when user-controlled input is used as a format string argument to a logging function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Format String Vulnerability:** The core issue is that the `ap_log_rerror()` function in affected versions of `mod_dav` uses data derived from user input as the format string, instead of a fixed format string. This allows an attacker to inject format specifiers like `%s`, `%x`, or `%n` into the log message. Specifically, the vulnerable code exists in Oracle's implementation where  `lookup.err.desc` could be influenced by an intruder through the parameters comp.scheme, comp.port, scheme, and port.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privileged Access:** Successful exploitation can allow a remote attacker to gain privileged access to the web server running the vulnerable `mod_dav` module. This is due to the ability to write arbitrary data to memory through the `%n` format specifier, potentially enabling the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the web server process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** A remote attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to the web server. This request needs to manipulate parameters that are later incorporated into the log message through  `lookup.err.desc`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the server running `mod_dav`.
- The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the components of the destination URI (comp.scheme, comp.port, scheme, and port), which are used to construct an error message and subsequently logged.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was initially found in Oracle's 9iAS/9.0.2 implementation of `mod_dav`.
*   The original open-source version of `mod_dav` did not contain the format string vulnerability directly in the code path that was originally analysed. However, the CERT/CC recommended an explicit format specifier be added for all calls to `ap_log_error` as a defense in depth measure against future vulnerabilities.
*   Oracle's implementation introduced a modification allowing user-controlled data to reach `ap_log_rerror` as format string, leading to the vulnerability.
*   A patch to the `mod_dav.c` was provided where a format string specifier (`%s`) was added to the `ap_log_rerror` call, thus mitigating the format string issue.
*   Several vendors were contacted to verify if they were affected by this vulnerability.
