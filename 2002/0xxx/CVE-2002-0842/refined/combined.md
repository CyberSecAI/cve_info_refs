## History

The CERT Division is the birthplace of cybersecurity. For nearly 30 years, the CERT Division of the SEI has partnered with government, industry, law enforcement, and academia to advance cybersecurity and improve the security and resilience of computer systems and networks.

Originally focused on incident response, we have expanded into cybersecurity areas such as network situational awareness, malicious code analysis, secure coding, resilience management, insider threats, digital investigations and intelligence, workforce development, DevOps, forensics, software assurance, vulnerability discovery and analysis, and risk management.

## Former Director Richard Pethia

[Richard Pethia](/about/leadership/display.cfm?customel_datapageid_2623=3545) was founding director of the SEI's CERT Division. Pethia, who served as director of CERT from 1988 to 2016, guided the organization through tremendous growth and change. Under Pethia's leadership, the unit expanded and evolved from the CERT Coordination Center—a small group focused on computer incident response—to a research organization of more than 200 professionals dedicated to solving problems with widespread cybersecurity implications.

## Some implementations of mod\_dav contain a format string vulnerability in "ap\_log\_rerror()" function

#### Vulnerability Note VU#849993

Original Release Date: 2003-02-14 | Last Revised: 2003-07-24

---

### Overview

A vulnerability in some implementations of [mod\_dav](http://www.webdav.org/mod_dav/) may permit a remote attacker to gain unauthorized access to a web server running mod\_dav.

### Description

| [mod\_dav](http://www.webdav.org/mod_dav/) is a module designed to provide [DAV capabilities](http://asg.web.cmu.edu/rfc/rfc2518.html) for a web server. A format string vulnerability in some implementations may permit a remote attacker to gain unauthorized access to a web server running mod\_dav.  Here is a brief primer for those unfamiliar with format string vulnerabilities:*A format string vulnerability occurs when a call to a function in the printf family is made with a format string under the control of an attacker. The most basic case arises when a programmer uses printf as follows:**\tprintf(s);**where s comes from the attacker's input. There are a variety of attacks based on this flaw, many of which can lead to the ability to execute code with the privileges of the vulnerable program. Most of the attacks leverage the %n conversion character, which has the somewhat unusual effect of writing to memory, as opposed to most conversion characters which only read from memory. If the attacker can cause the above printf statement to be issued as follows (by providing %n as input):**\tprintf("%n");**he can write to the stack, and by carefully choosing his input he can control what gets written, and where it goes.*David Litchfield found some problems in Oracle's 9iAS/9.0.2 implementation of mod\_dav. Examination of Greg Stein's [open source mod\_dav](http://www.webdav.org/mod_dav/) (often used by Apache installations) suggested the problem may be broader than just Oracle's implementation. The following code is from the function dav\_lookup\_uri in the module dav\_util:if (strcasecmp(comp.scheme, scheme) != 0 ||        comp.port != port) {        result.err.status = HTTP\_BAD\_GATEWAY;        result.err.desc = ap\_psprintf(r->pool,                                      "Destination URI refers to different "                                      "scheme or port (%s://hostname:%d)\"                                      "(want: %s://hostname:%d)",                                      comp.scheme ? comp.scheme : scheme,                                      comp.port ? comp.port : port,                                      scheme, port);You can see that in at least one case, result.err.desc gets filled in with values under the control of the caller. Specifically, comp.scheme, comp.port, scheme, and port, can be influenced by an intruder. The result variable is returned to the function dav\_method\_copymove in the module mod\_dav as "lookup":lookup = dav\_lookup\_uri(dest, r);    if (lookup.rnew == NULL) {2:       if (lookup.err.status == HTTP\_BAD\_REQUEST) {            /\* This supplies additional information for the default message. \*/            ap\_log\_rerror(APLOG\_MARK, APLOG\_ERR | APLOG\_NOERRNO, r,1:                           lookup.err.desc);            return HTTP\_BAD\_REQUEST;        }You can see that on the line labeled "1:" if lookup.err.desc could be influenced by an intruder, a format string vulnerability would exist. However, that section of code only gets executed if lookup.err.status is HTTP\_BAD\_REQUEST and the dav\_lookup\_uri function sets err.status to be HTTP\_BAD\_GATEWAY, so this code doesn't get executed.Based on these observations, we concluded that a format string vulnerability does not exist in the open source mod\_dav. However, we believe that it would be more "correct" to include an explicit format string specifier in all calls to ap\_log\_error (and indeed any functions that ultimately use the printf family or other var\_args-like functions). We recommended to Greg Stein that this change be made, though we see no immediate security concern -- just a future problem waiting to happen. Oracle is vulnerable because they allow the user to gain control of the format string through a minor change to their implementation of the mod\_dav routines. Other vendors may have made similar changes.Based on our recommendations, Greg Stein made the following change to revision 1.91 of mod\_dav.c:Code a bit more defensively. If dav\_lookup\_uri() ever placed user input into lookup.err.desc for the HTTP\_BAD\_REQUEST case, then we could have problems (via a format string attack). This change frees us from \*future\* worries.Until you apply a patch from Oracle, you may consider disabling mod\_dav functionality on Oracle 9iAS/9.0.2. If you are making use of another implementation of mod\_dav, you may wish to make the changes to the source yourself. Here is an example:-\t    ap\_log\_rerror(APLOG\_MARK, APLOG\_ERR | APLOG\_NOERRNO, r,+    ap\_log\_rerror(APLOG\_MARK, APLOG\_ERR | APLOG\_NOERRNO, r, "%s", |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker may be able to gain privileged access to a web server running mod\_dav. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Apply a vendor patch. |
| --- |

| You may wish to disable mod\_dav until a patch can be applied. |
