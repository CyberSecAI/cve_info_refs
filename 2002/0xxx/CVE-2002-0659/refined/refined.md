  "CVE-2002-0659": {
    "Description": "The ASN.1 library used by OpenSSL has several parsing errors which allow malformed certificate encodings to be parsed incorrectly. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely to cause a denial of service or potentially execute arbitrary code, depending on the circumstance under which the vulnerable parser is exercised. Routines affected include those supporting SSL and TLS applications, as well as S/MIME (PKCS#7) and certificate creation.",
    "Root cause": "Improper validation of lengths of structures in the SSL protocol data stream during ASN.1 parsing.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "ASN.1 parsing errors",
      "Malformed certificate encodings processed incorrectly",
      "Invalid length parameter handling"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of Service (DoS), potentially arbitrary code execution, disclosure of sensitive information.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Sending malformed certificate encodings during SSL/TLS handshake",
      "Sending invalid data to S/MIME (PKCS#7) routines",
      "Manipulating certificate creation"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to craft and send malformed data to a vulnerable application/service using OpenSSL.",

          "Debian 3.0 (woody)",
          "EnGarde Secure Linux Community Edition"
    ],
    "More detail": "The vulnerability is related to how OpenSSL's ASN.1 parser handles invalidly encoded data, specifically with incorrect length parameters. The incorrect interpretation of data could lead to undefined behavior, potentially enabling remote code execution, service termination, or disclosure of sensitive information. An error in the initial patch from the OpenSSL team which could still allow buffer overflows is also addressed by the fix.",
      "Additional Notes": "The advisory indicates that both client and server applications are affected and recommends a system reboot after applying the update. A mistake in the original patch from OpenSSL could also still lead to buffer overflows; therefore, the fix addresses that issue also."
