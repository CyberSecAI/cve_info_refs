RHSA-2002:161 - Security Advisory

Issued:
2003-02-06
Updated:
2003-02-05
# RHSA-2002:161 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

openssl security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

Updated OpenSSL packages are available for Red Hat Linux Advanced Server.
These updates fix multiple protocol parsing bugs, which may cause a denial
of service (DoS) attack or cause SSL-enabled applications to crash.

[Updated 06 Jan 2003]
Added fixed packages for the ia64 architecture.

[Updated 06 Feb 2003]
Added fixed packages for Advanced Workstation 2.1

## Description

OpenSSL is a commercial-grade, full-featured, and open source toolkit
which implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3) and Transport Layer
Security (TLS v1) protocols as well as a full-strength general purpose
cryptography library.

Portions of the SSL protocol data stream, which include the lengths of
structures which are being transferred, may not be properly validated.
This may allow a malicious server or client to cause an affected
application to crash or enter an infinite loop, which can be used as a
denial of service (DoS) attack if the application is a server. It has not
been verified if this issue could lead to further consequences such as
remote code execution.

These errata packages contain a patch to correct this vulnerability.
Please note that the original patch from the OpenSSL team had a mistake in
it which could possibly still allow buffer overflows to occur. This bug
is also fixed in these errata packages.

NOTE:

Please read the Solution section below as it contains instructions for
making sure that all SSL-enabled processes are restarted after the update
is applied.

Thanks go to the OpenSSL team for providing patches for these issues.

## Solution

Because both client and server applications are affected by these
vulnerabilities, we advise users to reboot their systems after installing
these updates.

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

Please note that this update is only available via Red Hat Network. To
use Red Hat Network, launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following
command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

## Affected Products

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 2 ia64
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux Workstation 2 ia64

## Fixes

* [BZ - 70111](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=70111)
  - RHSA-2002:161 - OpenSSL protocol parsing bugs

## CVEs

* [CVE-2002-0659](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2002-0659.html)

## History

The CERT Division is the birthplace of cybersecurity. For nearly 30 years, the CERT Division of the SEI has partnered with government, industry, law enforcement, and academia to advance cybersecurity and improve the security and resilience of computer systems and networks.

Originally focused on incident response, we have expanded into cybersecurity areas such as network situational awareness, malicious code analysis, secure coding, resilience management, insider threats, digital investigations and intelligence, workforce development, DevOps, forensics, software assurance, vulnerability discovery and analysis, and risk management.

## Former Director Richard Pethia

[Richard Pethia](/about/leadership/display.cfm?customel_datapageid_2623=3545) was founding director of the SEI's CERT Division. Pethia, who served as director of CERT from 1988 to 2016, guided the organization through tremendous growth and change. Under Pethia's leadership, the unit expanded and evolved from the CERT Coordination Center—a small group focused on computer incident response—to a research organization of more than 200 professionals dedicated to solving problems with widespread cybersecurity implications.

## ASN.1 parsing errors exist in implementations of SSL, TLS, S/MIME, PKCS#7 routines

#### Vulnerability Note VU#748355

Original Release Date: 2002-07-30 | Last Revised: 2002-09-30

---

### Overview

Abstract Syntax Notation number One (ASN.1) is an [international standard](http://www.asn1.org/) used to describe and transmit data packets between applications and across networks. There is a vulnerability related to ASN.1 that could permit an attacker to cause a denial of service or potentially execute arbitrary code.

### Description

| The ASN.1 library used by OpenSSL has several parsing errors which allow malformed certificate encodings to be parsed incorrectly. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely to cause a denial of service or potentially execute arbitrary code, depending on the circumstance under which the vulnerable parser is exercised. Routines affected include those supporting SSL and TLS applications, as well as S/MIME (PKCS#7) and certificate creation.  Specifically, the parser implemented in various ASN.1 libraries accepts certain invalidly encoded data (in this case with an invalid length parameter) leading to improper interpretation of the data. This leads to undefined behavior which may lead to other security-related impacts (data executed as code, service termination, disclosure of sensitive information). |
| --- |

### Impact

| Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely to cause a variety of impacts, including denial of service, arbitrary code execution, and disclosure of sensitive information. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Apply the patches made available by your vendor, or upgrade to the recommended version. The ["Systems Affected"](#systems) section contains a list of vendors and details about the status of their products. Clicking on the vendor name will provide you with any statements that the vendor has made.The OpenSSL team has recently released OpenSSL 0.9.6g to completely remove all known instances of this vulnerability. |

Debian Security Advisory DSA-136-1                   security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                         Wichert Akkerman
July 30, 2002
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : openssl
Problem type   : multiple remote exploits
Debian-specific: no
CVE            : CAN-2002-0655 CAN-2002-0656 CAN-2002-0657 CAN-2002-0659

The OpenSSL development team has announced that a security audit by A.L.
Digital Ltd and The Bunker, under the DARPA CHATS program, has revealed
remotely exploitable buffer overflow conditions in the OpenSSL code.
Additionaly, the ASN1 parser in OpenSSL has a potential DoS attack
independently discovered by Adi Stav and James Yonan.

CAN-2002-0655 references overflows in buffers used to hold ASCII
representations of integers on 64 bit platforms. CAN-2002-0656
references buffer overflows in the SSL2 server implementation (by
sending an invalid key to the server) and the SSL3 client implementation
(by sending a large session id to the client). The SSL2 issue was also
noticed by Neohapsis, who have privately demonstrated exploit code for
this issue. CAN-2002-0659 references the ASN1 parser DoS issue.

These vulnerabilities have been addressed for Debian 3.0 (woody) in
openssl094\_0.9.4-6.woody.0, openssl095\_0.9.5a-6.woody.0 and
openssl\_0.9.6c-2.woody.0.

These vulnerabilities are also present in Debian 2.2 (potato), but no
fix is available at this moment.

We recommend you upgrade your OpenSSL as soon as possible. Note that you
should restart any daemons running SSL. (E.g., ssh or ssl-enabled
apache.)

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

  EnGarde Secure Linux is a secure distribution of Linux that features
  improved access control, host and network intrusion detection, Web
  based secure remote management, complete e-commerce using AllCommerce,
  and integrated open source security tools.

OVERVIEW
- --------
  There are several potentially exploitable vulnerabilities in the OpenSSL
  toolkit.  A security review of OpenSSL is being done by A.L. Digital Ltd
  and The Bunker (<http://www.thebunker.net/>) under the DARPA program
  CHATS.  Through this review, the following vulnerabilities were
  discovered:

    1. The client master key in SSL2 could be oversized and overrun a
       buffer. This vulnerability was also independently discovered by
       consultants at Neohapsis (<http://www.neohapsis.com/>) who have
       also demonstrated that the vulnerability is exploitable.

    2. The session ID supplied to a client in SSL3 could be oversized and
       overrun a buffer.

    3. Various buffers for ASCII representations of integers were too
       small on 64 bit platforms.

    4. The ASN1 parser can be confused by supplying it with certain
       invalid encodings.

  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
  assigned the name CAN-2002-0656 to issues 1-2, CAN-2002-0655 to issue 3,
  and CAN-2002-0659 to issue 4.

SOLUTION
- --------
  Users of the EnGarde Professional edition can use the Guardian Digital
  Secure Network to update their systems automatically.

  EnGarde Community users should upgrade to the most recent version
  as outlined in this advisory.  Updates may be obtained from:

    ftp://ftp.engardelinux.org/pub/engarde/stable/updates/
    <http://ftp.engardelinux.org/pub/engarde/stable/updates/>

  Before upgrading the package, the machine must either:

    a) be booted into a "standard" kernel; or
    b) have LIDS disabled.

  To disable LIDS, execute the command:

    # /sbin/lidsadm -S -- -LIDS\_GLOBAL

  To install the updated package, execute the command:

    # rpm -Uvh files

  You must now update the LIDS configuration by executing the command:

    # /usr/sbin/config\_lids.pl

TEXT

---------------------------------------------------------------
    HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY SECURITY BULLETIN: HPSBTL0207-055
    Originally issued: 30 July '02
    \*\* Rev. 1 \*\* 06 August '02
---------------------------------------------------------------

The information in the following Security Bulletin should be acted
upon as soon as possible.  Hewlett-Packard Company will not be
liable for any consequences to any customer resulting from the
customer's failure to fully implement instructions in this Security
Bulletin as soon as possible.

Because the vulnerability does not require a HP Secure OS
1.0 patch or re-packaging of the RPM affected by the bulletin, the
RPMs have not been produced or tested by Hewlett-Packard Company.

---------------------------------------------------------------
PROBLEM:  Updated OpenSSL packages fix several vulnerabilities

PLATFORM: Any system running HP Secure OS Software for Linux Release 1.0

DAMAGE:   Potential for remotely exploitable buffer overflow

SOLUTION: Apply the appropriate RPMs (see section B below)

MANUAL ACTIONS: None

AVAILABILITY: The RPMs are available now.

CHANGE SUMMARY: Rev. 1 Updated OpenSSL packages are available
                       (RHSA-2002:160)
---------------------------------------------------------------
 A. Background

    OpenSSL is a commercial-grade, full-featured, and Open Source
    toolkit which implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)
    and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols as well as a
    full-strength general purpose cryptography library. A security
    audit of the OpenSSL code sponsored by DARPA found several
    buffer overflows in OpenSSL which affect versions 0.9.7 and
    0.9.6d and earlier.

\*\* Rev. 1 \*\*
>>> Additional OpenSSL security vulnerabilities were found,
    corrected and updated in the RPM packages previously made available
    under Red Hat Security Advisory number RHSA-2002:155.

 B. Fixing the problem

    Hewlett-Packard Company recommends that customers install the RPMs
    listed in the following Red Hat Security Advisory in the section
    labeled "Red Hat Linux 7.1 i386".

\*\* Rev. 1 \*\*
>>> 2002-08-05 RHSA-2002:160  Updated openssl packages fix protocol
                              parsing bugs

>>> <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2002-160.html>

    To install the security bulletin RPMs, use the following sequence
    of commands:

    1. If you use the tripwire product, we recommend that you run a
       a consistency check and fix any violations before installing
       the security bulletin RPM.

           tripwire --check --interactive

    2. Install the bulletin RPM from the root account.

           rpm -F <bulletin RPM name>

    3. Update the tripwire database

           tripwire --check --interactive

    NOTE:
    The rpm -q <package name> command can be used to determine if the
    package is installed. Hewlett-Packard Company recommends applying the
    Security Bulletin fixes to installed packages only. The -F option
    to the RPM installer will only apply the fix if the package is
    currently installed on the system. Dependent RPMs can be found by
    using the "Find Latest RPMs" search facility at
    <http://www.redhat.com/apps/download>. To find the latest dependent
    RPM enter the RPM's name in the "By Keyword" box.

 C. To subscribe to automatically receive future HP Security
    Bulletins from the HP IT Resource Center via electronic
    mail, do the following:

    Use your browser to access the HP IT Resource Center page
    at:

       <http://itrc.hp.com>

    Use the 'Login' tab at the left side of the screen to login
    using your ID and password.  Use your existing login or the
    "Register" button at the left to create a login. Remember to
    save the User ID assigned to you, and your password. This
    login provides access to many useful areas of the ITRC.

    In the left most frame select "Maintenance and Support".

    Under the "Notifications" section (near the bottom of
    the page), select "Support Information Digests".

    To -subscribe- to future HP Security Bulletins or other
    Technical Digests, click the check box (in the left column)
    for the appropriate digest and then click the "Update
    Subscriptions" button at the bottom of the page.

    or

    To -review- bulletins already released, select the link
    (in the middle column) for the appropriate digest.

 D. To report new security vulnerabilities, send email to

    security-alert@hp.com

    Please encrypt any exploit information using the
    security-alert PGP key, available from your local key
    server. You may also get the security-alert PGP key by
    sending a message with a -subject- (not body) of
    'get key' (no quotes) to security-alert@hp.com.

    Permission is granted for copying and circulating this bulletin to
    Hewlett-Packard Company (HP) customers (or the Internet community)
    for the purpose of alerting them to problems, if and only if, the
    bulletin is not edited or changed in any way, is attributed to HP,

 NetBSD Security Advisory 2002-009
 =================================
 (updated 2002/9/22)

Topic:Multiple vulnerabilities in OpenSSL code

Version:NetBSD-current: source prior to August 10, 2002
NetBSD-1.6 beta: affected
NetBSD-1.5.3: affected
NetBSD-1.5.2: affected
NetBSD-1.5.1: affected
NetBSD-1.5: affected
NetBSD-1.4.\*: not applicable
pkgsrc: prior to openssl-0.9.6f

Severity:Potential for remote root exploit

Fixed:NetBSD-current:August 10, 2002
NetBSD-1.6 branch:August 11, 2002 (1.6 includes the fix)
NetBSD-1.5 branch:August 31, 2002
pkgsrc:openssl-0.9.6f (or later)

NOTE: previous advisory had fixed dates prior to August 10.
There were errors found in the vendor-supplied fix, therefore
the fixed dates were modified.  Sorry for the confusion and
thanks for the patience.

NOTE: previous revision of advisory suggested that 1.5 branch
was fixed on August 1, however the fix was found to be
insufficient.  Therefore, users of 1.5 should apply the fix
presented in this revised advisory.  Sorry for the confusion
and thanks for the patience.

NOTE: previous revision of advisory suggested that 1.5 branch
can be fixed by rebuilding part of the source code tree (shared
library).  However, it was incorrect.  Follow the instruction below
and perform a full build.  Sorry for the confusion and thanks for
the patience.

Abstract
========

There are multiple vulnerabilities found in openssl 0.9.6e and prior
releases.  There are four remotely-exploitable buffer overruns in SSL2/3
code.  The ASN1 parser can be confused by invalid encodings (SSL/TLS
code affected).

None of these services are enabled by default in NetBSD, however, by
enabling services built with these libraries, a system would become
vulnerable.

- From the OpenSSL advisory:

  "Everyone using OpenSSL 0.9.6d or earlier, or 0.9.7-beta2 or earlier or
  current development snapshots of 0.9.7 to provide SSL or TLS is
  vulnerable, whether client or server. 0.9.6d servers on 32-bit systems
  with SSL 2.0 disabled are not vulnerable."

After the above advisory was published,
  - 0.9.6e was found to be vulnerable, and 0.9.6f was released.
  - 0.9.6f had some build framework errors, and 0.9.6g was released.

The NetBSD fix includes OpenSSL 0.9.6g.

<http://CERT.Uni-Stuttgart.DE/advisories/c-integer-overflow.php>

Solutions and Workarounds
=========================

The recent NetBSD 1.6 release is not vulnerable to this issue. A full
upgrade to NetBSD 1.6 is the recommended resolution for all users able
to do so. Many security-related improvements have been made, and
indeed this release has been delayed several times in order to include
fixes for a number of recent issues.

The following instructions describe how to upgrade your libcrypto/libssl
binaries by updating your source tree and rebuilding and
installing a new version of libcrypto/libssl.

Be sure to restart running instances of programs that use crypto libraries
(like sshd) after upgrading shared libraries.

If you have any statically-linked binaries that linked against a
vulnerable libcrypto and/or libssl, you need to recompile them.

\* NetBSD-current:

Systems running NetBSD-current dated from before 2002-08-10
should be upgraded to NetBSD-current dated 2002-08-10 or later.

The following directories need to be updated from the
netbsd-current CVS branch (aka HEAD):
crypto/Makefile.openssl
crypto/dist/openssl
lib/libcrypto
lib/libssl

To update from CVS, re-build, and re-install libcrypto and libssl:
# cd src
# cvs update -d -P crypto/Makefile.openssl crypto/dist/openssl \
lib/libcrypto lib/libssl

# make includes
# cd lib/libcrypto
# make cleandir dependall
# make install
# cd ../../lib/libssl
# make cleandir dependall
# make install

\* NetBSD 1.6 beta:

Systems running NetBSD 1.6 BETAs and Release Candidates should
be upgraded to the NetBSD 1.6 release.

If a source-based point upgrade is required, sources from the
NetBSD 1.6 branch dated 2002-08-11 or later should be used.

The following directories need to be updated from the
netbsd-1-6 CVS branch:
crypto/Makefile.openssl
crypto/dist/openssl
lib/libcrypto
lib/libssl

To update from CVS, re-build, and re-install libcrypto and libssl:
# cd src
# cvs update -d -P -r netbsd-1-6 crypto/Makefile.openssl \
crypto/dist/openssl lib/libcrypto lib/libssl

# make includes
# cd lib/libcrypto
# make cleandir dependall
# make install
# cd ../../lib/libssl
# make cleandir dependall
# make install

\* NetBSD 1.5, 1.5.1, 1.5.2, 1.5.3:

Systems running NetBSD-1.5.x dated from before 2002-08-31
should be upgraded to NetBSD-1.5 branch dated 2002-08-31 or later.

The following directories need to be updated from the
netbsd-1-5 CVS branch.  Due to the shlib major bump in libcrypto/libssl
large number of shared libraries has to be rebuilt:
crypto/Makefile.openssl
crypto/dist/openssl
lib/libasn1
lib/libcom\_err
lib/libcrypto
lib/libgssapi
lib/libhdb
lib/libkadm
lib/libkadm5clnt
lib/libkadm5srv
lib/libkafs
lib/libkdb
lib/libkrb
lib/libkrb5
lib/libkstream
lib/libroken
lib/libsl
lib/libss
lib/libtelnet
usr.bin/openssl

All userland tools that use openssl needs to be rebuilt, due to the
shlib major bump.  Therefore, full rebuild is suggested.  Make sure to
rebuild all binaries installed by pkgsrc as well.

To update from CVS, re-build, and re-install libcrypto and libssl:
# cd src
# cvs update -d -P -r netbsd-1-5 <directories listed above>

# make build

\* NetBSD 1.4, 1.4.1, 1.4.2, 1.4.3:

OpenSSL was not included in the base system in NetBSD-1.4.\*
Follow the directions for pkgsrc if you have installed it from
pkgsrc.

\* pkgsrc:

openssl (pkgsrc/security/openssl) prior to 0.9.6f are
vulnerable.  Upgrade to openssl-0.9.6f or later; pkgsrc
currently contains 0.9.6g at time of this writing.

Packages which require openssl can be found by running 'pkg\_info
openssl'. Depending on the method you choose to update pkgsrc
packages, a rebuild of the packages on that list may be
performed for you by the package system. If you update using the
experimental 'make replace' target, you will need to manually
update any packages which build static binaries with libssl.a
and libcrypto.a

        If you have statically linked binaries in pkgsrc, they have to be
        rebuilt.  Statically linked binaries can be identified by the
        following command (note: be sure to include the directory you install
        pkgsrc binaries to, if you've changed LOCALBASE from the default of
        /usr/pkg)

                file /usr/pkg/{bin,sbin,libexec} | grep static

Description:
  According to an official security advisory from the OpenSSL team,
  there are four remotely exploitable buffer overflows that affect
  various OpenSSL client and server implementations [5]. There are
  also parsing problems in the ASN.1 library used by OpenSSL. The
  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project assigned the
  ids CAN-2002-0655 [6], CAN-2002-0656 [7], CAN-2002-0657 [8] and
  CAN-2002-0659 [9] to the problems. Several of these vulnerabilities
  could be used by a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the
  target system. All could be used to create a denial of service.

  Please check whether you are affected by running "<prefix>/bin/rpm -q
  openssl". If you have the "openssl" package installed and its version
  is affected (see above), we recommend that you immediately upgrade it
  (see Solution). Additionally, you have to rebuild and reinstall all
  dependent OpenPKG packages, too. [2]

Solution:
  Select the updated source RPM appropriate for your OpenPKG release
  [4], fetch it from the OpenPKG FTP service [3] or a mirror location,
  verify its integrity [1], build a corresponding binary RPM from it
  and update your OpenPKG installation by applying the binary RPM [2].
  For the latest OpenPKG 1.0 release, perform the following operations
  to permanently fix the security problem (for other releases adjust
  accordingly).

  $ ftp ftp.openpkg.org
  ftp> bin
  ftp> cd release/1.0/UPD
  ftp> get openssl-0.9.6b-1.0.1.src.rpm
  ftp> bye
  $ <prefix>/bin/rpm --checksig openssl-0.9.6b-1.0.1.src.rpm
  $ <prefix>/bin/rpm --rebuild openssl-0.9.6b-1.0.1.src.rpm
  $ su -
  # <prefix>/bin/rpm -Fvh <prefix>/RPM/PKG/openssl-0.9.6b-1.0.1.\*.rpm

  Now proceed and rebuild and reinstall all dependent OpenPKG packages,
  too (see list above).

Description:

   There are remotely exploitable buffer overflow vulnerabilities in
   OpenSSL versions prior to 0.9.6e.
   These vulnerabilities may allow a remote attacker to execute
   arbitrary code or perform a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.

   These problems are described in the OpenSSL Security Advisory [30
   July 2002]:

     [25]<http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20020730.txt>

   These problems are also described in CERT Advisory CA-2002-23:

     [26]<http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2002-23.html>

Workarounds:

   There are no workarounds against the potential denial-of-service
   attack.  Disabling SSL should prevent remote execution of code.

   Users of Corporate Time Outlook Connector can disable TLS by adding
   the following section to the CTOC.INI file:
   [CTOC]
   allow-tls=FALSE

1)  problem description, brief discussion, solution, upgrade information

    This advisory is issued in an attempt to clarify any issues
    surrounding the recently discovered Apache/mod\_ssl worm.

    On July 30, we released a security advisory concerning vulnerabilities
    in OpenSSL, including a buffer overflow in the SSL code. This
    vulnerability (CVE CAN-2002-0656, also discussed in CERT Advisory
    <http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2002-23.html>) is currently being
    exploited by a worm called Slapper, propagating through Apache's
    mod\_ssl module.

    It is worth noting that even though the worm infects Apache through
    mod\_ssl, this is not a vulnerability in mod\_ssl or Apache, but in
    the OpenSSL library used by mod\_ssl.

    This also means that Apache may not be the only service vulnerable
    to an attack via the SSL bug. Similar exploits may be possible
    against cyrus-imapd, sendmail with TLS support, or sslwrap-enabled
    services.

    As a workaround, it is also possible to disable SSLv2 in mod\_ssl
    (as described in our previous advisory SuSE-SA:2002:027;
    <http://www.suse.com/de/security/2002_027_openssl.html>), but you
    should be aware that this does not protect other SSL based servers
    that may be running on your machine.

    We have received numerous inquiries from SuSE users on whether the
    update packages provided by SuSE as part of SA:2002:027 fix this bug
    even though they do not contain the latest OpenSSL version recommended
    in various advisories.

    To clarify this, we would like to state that these packages DO FIX
    the bug exploited by the Slapper worm. Following established policy,
    we did this by applying a source code patch instead of upgrading to
    a newer version, because the latter usually causes serious problems
    for many users (in particular, different versions of OpenSSL libraries
    are not always API compatible).

    However, it turns out that a number of packages were statically
    linked against OpenSSL libraries:

    mod\_ssl (SuSE Linux 7.0):
    We have released rebuilt mod\_ssl packages linked against the
most recent OpenSSL libraries.

If you run mod\_ssl on SuSE Linux 7.0, you must upgrade mod\_ssl,
too.

    sendmail-tls (SuSE Linux 7.1, 7.2, 7.3):
Sendmail-tls, the SSL enabled version of sendmail, was linked
statically against OpenSSL on SuSE 7.1, 7.2 and 7.3. The security
impact of this problem is probably the same as with Apache and
mod\_ssl.

We are releasing rebuilt packages linked against the most
OpenSSL libraries.

Sendmail-tls is not part of the default installation profile.

If you are using sendmail-tls, we strongly recommend you upgrade
to the latest packages provided on our FTP servers.

    openssh (SuSE Linux 7.1, 7.2 and 7.3):
        Ssh and sshd do not use any SSL functionality, and thus are not
susceptible to the type of attack carried out by the Slapper worm.

To date, we are not aware of any way to exploit them. We nevertheless
recommend to upgrade to the latest versions provided on our FTP site.

    freeswan (SuSE Linux 7.1, 7.2):
    FreeSWAN includes a utility named fswcert for creating and
manipulating X.509 certificates, which is also linked statically
against libcrypto.

To date, we are not aware of any way to exploit them. We
nevertheless recommend to upgrade to the latest versions provided
on our FTP site as soon as they become available (2002 Sep 20).

2)  Pending vulnerabilities in SuSE Distributions and Workarounds:

    mod\_php4:
    we are preparing an update of mod\_php4 addressing various
vulnerabilities that have been published recently.

3)  standard appendix: authenticity verification, additional information

  - Package authenticity verification:

    SuSE update packages are available on many mirror ftp servers all over
    the world. While this service is being considered valuable and important
    to the free and open source software community, many users wish to be
    sure about the origin of the package and its content before installing
    the package. There are two verification methods that can be used
    independently from each other to prove the authenticity of a downloaded
    file or rpm package:
    1) md5sums as provided in the (cryptographically signed) announcement.
    2) using the internal gpg signatures of the rpm package.

    1) execute the command
        md5sum <name-of-the-file.rpm>
       after you downloaded the file from a SuSE ftp server or its mirrors.
       Then, compare the resulting md5sum with the one that is listed in the
       announcement. Since the announcement containing the checksums is
       cryptographically signed (usually using the key security@suse.de),
       the checksums show proof of the authenticity of the package.
       We disrecommend to subscribe to security lists which cause the
       email message containing the announcement to be modified so that
       the signature does not match after transport through the mailing
       list software.
       Downsides: You must be able to verify the authenticity of the
       announcement in the first place. If RPM packages are being rebuilt
       and a new version of a package is published on the ftp server, all
       md5 sums for the files are useless.

    2) rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the authenticity
       of an rpm package. Use the command
        rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
       to verify the signature of the package, where <file.rpm> is the
       filename of the rpm package that you have downloaded. Of course,
       package authenticity verification can only target an uninstalled rpm
       package file.
       Prerequisites:
        a) gpg is installed
        b) The package is signed using a certain key. The public part of this
           key must be installed by the gpg program in the directory
           ~/.gnupg/ under the user's home directory who performs the
           signature verification (usually root). You can import the key
           that is used by SuSE in rpm packages for SuSE Linux by saving
           this announcement to a file ("announcement.txt") and
           running the command (do "su -" to be root):
            gpg --batch; gpg < announcement.txt | gpg --import
           SuSE Linux distributions version 7.1 and thereafter install the
           key "build@suse.de" upon installation or upgrade, provided that
           the package gpg is installed. The file containing the public key
           is placed at the toplevel directory of the first CD (pubring.gpg)
           and at ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/suse/pubring.gpg-build.suse.de .

Addition to Trustix Secure Linux Bugfix Advisory #2002-0063

Package name:      openssl
Summary:           Restart services
Date:              2002-08-01
Affected versions: TSL 1.1, 1.2, 1.5

Problem description:
  I really hope all of you have updated the openssl package. :)

  Most of you know this already, and I'm sorry I didn't include this in
  the openssl advisory earlier this week. But here it goes:

  Since openssl is a shared library, all services linked against this
  library must be restarted for the changes to take affect.

  The list of services is long and includes (but are not limited to):

   httpd (mod\_php4 is linked against libssl)
   httpsd
   simap
   pop3s
   postfix
   postgresql
   smb (maybe also winbind)
   sshd

Action:
  We recommend that all services that are linked against openssl are
  restarted.

GENTOO LINUX SECURITY ANNOUNCEMENT

PACKAGE        :openssl
SUMMARY        :denial of service / remote root exploit
DATE           :2002-07-30 16:15:00

- --------------------------------------------------------------------

OVERVIEW

Multiple potentially remotely exploitable vulnerabilities has been found in
OpenSSL.

DETAIL

1. The client master key in SSL2 could be oversized and overrun a
    buffer. This vulnerability was also independently discovered by
    consultants at Neohapsis (<http://www.neohapsis.com/>) who have also
    demonstrated that the vulerability is exploitable. Exploit code is
    NOT available at this time.

2. The session ID supplied to a client in SSL3 could be oversized and
    overrun a buffer.

3. The master key supplied to an SSL3 server could be oversized and
    overrun a stack-based buffer. This issues only affects OpenSSL
    0.9.7 before 0.9.7-beta3 with Kerberos enabled.

4. Various buffers for ASCII representations of integers were too
    small on 64 bit platforms.

The full advisory can be read at
<http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20020730.txt>

SOLUTION

It is recommended that all Gentoo Linux users update their systems as
follows.

emerge --clean rsync
emerge openssl
emerge clean

After the installation of the updated OpenSSL you should restart the services
that uses OpenSSL, which include such common services as OpenSSH, SSL-Enabled
POP3, IMAP, and SMTP servers, and stunnel-wrapped services as well.

Also, if you have an application that is statically linked to openssl you will
need to reemerge that application to build it against the new OpenSSL.
