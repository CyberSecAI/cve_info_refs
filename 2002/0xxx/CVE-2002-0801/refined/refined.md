### Vulnerability Details:
- **Root Cause:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the ISAPI filter/application of Macromedia's JRun version 3.1 on Win32 platforms. The overflow occurs within the code that handles the host header field.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** The application server's ISAPI filter/application lacks proper bounds checking when processing the Host header.
- **Impact of Exploitation:** A remote attacker can exploit the overflow to overwrite a return address on the stack and execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges on the vulnerable server. This is because the vulnerable DLL runs in the web server process's address space, which has elevated privileges.
- **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted request with a long Host header field to the application server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable server.
