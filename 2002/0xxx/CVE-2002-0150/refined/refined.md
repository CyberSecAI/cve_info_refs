Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2002-0150:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an error in how Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) parses HTTP header information within Active Server Pages (ASP).
*   Specifically, before processing the header fields, IIS performs a safety check to ensure expected delimiter fields are present and in valid locations. However, this check can be "spoofed", causing IIS to incorrectly believe that the delimiters are present even when they are not.
*   This flawed check allows an attacker to craft an HTTP request with header field values that overrun a buffer during processing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The core vulnerability is a buffer overflow. By manipulating the HTTP header, an attacker can write data beyond the intended boundaries of a buffer used by IIS, potentially overwriting adjacent memory.
*   **Inadequate Input Validation:** The vulnerability highlights a lack of proper validation of HTTP header fields before processing. The safety check mechanism, intended to prevent overflows, is flawed and can be bypassed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the ASP ISAPI extension (ASP.DLL).
    *   On IIS 4.0, the ASP.DLL runs as part of the operating system, meaning a successful exploit could grant the attacker complete administrative control over the server.
    *   On IIS 5.0 and 5.1, the ASP.DLL runs with the privileges of the `IWAM_*computername*` account. While not full administrative privileges, this still allows significant control over the system.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Even without executing arbitrary code, an attacker can cause a denial of service by overrunning the buffer with random data, leading to the failure of the IIS service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious HTTP Request:** The attack vector involves sending a crafted HTTP request containing carefully constructed header fields designed to bypass the safety check and cause a buffer overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable IIS server.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerability and possess the skill to craft a malicious HTTP request that exploits the flawed safety check.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability requires that Active Server Pages (ASP) be enabled on the system to be exploited.
*   The `URLScan` tool, if using its default ruleset, would likely limit the attacker to using this vulnerability for denial of service attacks only.

This vulnerability was addressed by Microsoft Security Bulletin MS02-018, which included a patch to correct the flawed checking mechanism in IIS.
