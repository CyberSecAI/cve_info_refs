Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stemmed from the `order` parameter in the `buglist.cgi` script of Bugzilla not being properly sanitized. This allowed an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL into the `ORDER BY` clause of the SQL query, leading to potential database errors and possible data exposure or manipulation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness was the lack of input validation on the `order` parameter, which directly included user-supplied data into the SQL query without proper sanitization or escaping.
*   **Arbitrary SQL injection:** Specifically, the `order` parameter was not sufficiently checked to prevent the injection of arbitrary SQL statements within the `ORDER BY` clause.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Errors:** An attacker could trigger database errors by injecting invalid SQL.
*   **Data Exposure:** Although not explicitly confirmed to be exploitable for data exposure, it was suggested that with MySQL 4 and its support for `UNION` queries, an attacker might be able to perform a `UNION` query to extract data. This was not confirmed.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** It was also noted that this vulnerability could potentially be used to construct a DoS attack.
*   **Sorting Manipulation:** At the very least, an attacker could manipulate the sorting of bug lists by injecting arbitrary SQL into the `ORDER BY` clause.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability was exploitable via the `order` parameter in a GET request to `buglist.cgi`.
    An attacker could craft a malicious URL with a specially crafted `order` parameter.
    For example, `http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?field0-0-0=reporter&type0-0-0=substring&value0-0-0=jrud&order=bugs.bug_id%20AND%20ALLYOURBASEAREBELONGTOUS`
    `order=bugs.bug_id%20AND%20ALLYOURBASEAREBELONGTOUS` was used as an example in the bug report.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needed to be able to send HTTP requests to the Bugzilla instance.
*   **Basic Understanding of SQL:** The attacker required a basic understanding of SQL syntax to inject malicious SQL queries through the `order` parameter.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was initially found in Bugzilla 2.14.1 and was not deemed serious enough to fix at the time.
*   A patch was created which was backported to 2.14.2.
*   The original fix for the issue involved input validation on the parameter, checking for valid column names in the form `identifier.identifier`, instead of checking that the columns existed in the database.
*   The initial patch was found to be flawed and a new patch was created.
*   The issue was fully fixed in the template rewrite of the `buglist.cgi` script in 2.16.
*   A follow up bug was created due to the initial patch breaking sorting on more than one field: [bug 152138](/show_bug.cgi?id=152138)
