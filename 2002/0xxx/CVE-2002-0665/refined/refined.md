- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper handling of URLs by the JRun administration server, specifically related to the parsing of double slashes (`//`) in the URL path.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Authentication bypass. The vulnerability lies in the fact that the server does not correctly enforce authentication checks when a URL with an extra slash is used. By inserting an extra "/" in the URL, the login form can be bypassed, and by specifying an action within the initial URL, administrative functions can be accessed without logging in.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to access administrative functions, including stopping server instances, without needing authentication. This can lead to a complete denial of service and potential modification of the server.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending crafted HTTP requests to the JRun administration server by including an extra '/' in the URL and specifying the desired administrative function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the JRun administration server (typically listening on port 8000).
