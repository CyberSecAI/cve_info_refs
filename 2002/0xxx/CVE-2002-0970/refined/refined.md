**CVE-2002-0970**

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The KDE SSL implementation fails to check basic constraints on certificates.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of proper validation of certificate constraints, specifically basic constraints.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful man-in-the-middle attacks, where a malicious actor can intercept and alter communications without the user noticing, impersonating a trusted site.
- Users might connect to a fraudulent site believing it is a secure connection to a legitimate one.

**Attack vectors:**
- Man-in-the-middle attack

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to intercept network traffic between the user and the intended server.
- Ability to present a certificate signed by an unauthorized issuer.
