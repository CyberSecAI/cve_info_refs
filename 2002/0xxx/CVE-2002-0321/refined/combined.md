## History

The CERT Division is the birthplace of cybersecurity. For nearly 30 years, the CERT Division of the SEI has partnered with government, industry, law enforcement, and academia to advance cybersecurity and improve the security and resilience of computer systems and networks.

Originally focused on incident response, we have expanded into cybersecurity areas such as network situational awareness, malicious code analysis, secure coding, resilience management, insider threats, digital investigations and intelligence, workforce development, DevOps, forensics, software assurance, vulnerability discovery and analysis, and risk management.

## Former Director Richard Pethia

[Richard Pethia](/about/leadership/display.cfm?customel_datapageid_2623=3545) was founding director of the SEI's CERT Division. Pethia, who served as director of CERT from 1988 to 2016, guided the organization through tremendous growth and change. Under Pethia's leadership, the unit expanded and evolved from the CERT Coordination Center—a small group focused on computer incident response—to a research organization of more than 200 professionals dedicated to solving problems with widespread cybersecurity implications.

 All versions of Yahoo messenger version 5. Listens on port 5101 on client
machine.  (obviously to
 offload server traffic for IMs)

 problems:
 (for all of the problems listed below, the traffic is sent to the yahoo
messenger opened port, 5101)

 1.  One can crash yahoo messenger by overflowing the message field in the
 yahoo protocol.
 2.  One can crash yahoo messenger by overflowing the IMvironment field in
 the yahoo protocol.
 3.  One can send a message as a spoofed name.
 4.  One can send many many messages from different names, flooding the
 person.
 5.  One can add a person to their buddy list (without their consent even),
 then message them a few times and that persons IP address will be sent in a
 message over yahoo's server.

 I would imagine there are many many more security problems to be found.
