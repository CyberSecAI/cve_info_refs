- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Perl script "Penguin Traceroute" fails to sanitize user input, specifically the 'host' parameter, allowing for command injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Remote command execution vulnerability due to insufficient input sanitization. The script does not filter out special characters like ';', '|', etc., which allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server with the privileges of the web server user (e.g., 'apache'). This can lead to information disclosure (e.g., reading password files), defacement (e.g., modifying web pages), or potentially more severe system compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the 'host' parameter of the Penguin Traceroute script, sent via a web request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server and has no special privileges required.
