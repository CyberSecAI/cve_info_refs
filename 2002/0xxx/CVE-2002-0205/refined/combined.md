Plumtree Corporate Portal Cross-Site Scripting (Patch Available)
----------------------------------------------------------------

SYNOPSIS

Plumtree ([www.plumtree.com](http://www.plumtree.com)) Corporate Portal versions 4.5, 4.0, 4.0SP1, 4.0i, \
4.0iSP1, and 3.5 should be modified to remediate potential cross-site scripting \
attacks directed against existing Corporate Portal installations.

IMPACT

If the appropriate patch/remediation from Plumtree is not applied, a malicious user \
may craft a link containing rogue JavaScript, which could potentially lead to \
disclosure of state-maintenance or other critical data.  Further information on \
cross-site scripting may be found in CERT advisory CA-2000-01 \
(<http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2000-02.html>).

CAUSE

Plumtree Corporate Portal supplies an error information page named error.asp, which \
by default is accessed through URI=http://<PORTALSITE>/<PORTALNAME>/common/error.asp. \
The second parameter supplied to error.asp is a textual description of the error \
message that will be shown in the resulting error web page.  This textual parameter \
may be modified to include rogue script on affected installations.

STATUS

Plumtree has been notified and has issued a knowledge base article with information \
and a fix.  Plumtree will incorporate the fix into Corporate Portal 4.5 Service Pack \
1 and 4.0 SP1 Hotfix 6.  Plumtree supportnet article number is #11012 and may be \
accessed from the supportnet community on the Plumtree website.  The Plumtree \
supportnet community is available via: \
<http://www.plumtree.com/company/technical_support.htm>

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Affected Plumtree Corporate Portal version numbers are reproduced here from the \
Plumtree knowledge base article.  Thanks specifically to Andrew Morris and Philip \
Soffer (both Plumtree representatives) for their consistently prompt responses and \
thorough attention to this matter.
