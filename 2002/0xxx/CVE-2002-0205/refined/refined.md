- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Plumtree Corporate Portal's `error.asp` page reflects user-supplied input without proper sanitization. Specifically, the second parameter supplied to `error.asp`, intended for a textual description of the error message, can be modified to include malicious JavaScript.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization on the error.asp page.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious user can craft a link with embedded JavaScript. When a victim clicks on this link, the script will execute in the context of the user's session, potentially leading to disclosure of sensitive information (state-maintenance or other critical data), session hijacking, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious user crafts a URL with malicious JavaScript as the second parameter to the `error.asp` page. This URL is then sent to a victim via email, instant message, or any other means.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to construct a URL and persuade the victim to visit it while being authenticated to the Plumtree Corporate Portal.
