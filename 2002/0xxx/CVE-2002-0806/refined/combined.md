|  | |

If I'm a user with the ability to edit other users then I have the ability to
delete other users regardless of the allowuserdeletion parameter flag. I simply
select a user, then change 'edit' to 'del' in the URL.
This is due to two missing "exit;" lines in editusers.cgi. To find them do a
search for "PutTrailer" in editusers.cgi - after every occurence of PutTrailer
(except the definition) there should be an exit on the next line.
Cheers,

I just audited every instance of PutTrailer() in edit\* - there are no other
instances where exit; is missing.
