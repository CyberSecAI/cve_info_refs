 Change History for MHonArc
==========================

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
| PLEASE READ RELNOTES FOR CHANGES THAT CAN HAVE COMPATIBILITY IMPACTS |
| FOR ARCHIVES CREATED FROM PAST RELEASES OF MHONARC. |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some change notes are brief; consult the documentation for further
information/clarification. It is possible that some changes to
MHonArc are not documented here, but every effort is made to list
all visible changes.
YYYY/MM/DD
============================================================================
2014/04/21 (2.6.19)
\* Security Fixes:
Bug ID Summary
------ ------------------------------------------------------------
35388 commentized subjects allow PHP code injection

32987 Lots of deprecation warnings with Perl 5.12
42155 MHonArc crashed with message/external-body and RFC 2231
encoded parameters
------ ------------------------------------------------------------
============================================================================
2011/01/09 (2.6.18)
\* Update to HTML filter to improve filtering of event-based
attributes.
============================================================================
2011/01/09 (2.6.17)
\* Security Fixes:
Bug ID Summary
------ ------------------------------------------------------------
32013 CVE-2010-4524: Improper escaping of certain HTML
sequences (XSS)
32014 CVE-2010-1677: DoS when processing html messages with deep
tag nesting
32080 Specially crafted  can lead to XSS exploit
------ ------------------------------------------------------------
\* Bug Fixes:
Bug ID Summary
------ ------------------------------------------------------------
13853 Creation of archive with attachments writes over symlinks
14747 major (10X) memory savings possible in some situations
15433 relative attachmentdir is relative to current working dir,
not outdir
17660 Threaded index resource ordering doesn't allow well formed
XML output
17860 incorrect nested HTML Tags for references
17904 FieldOrder affects AddressModifyCode
18113 Inconsistant thread slices w/ poor man's windowing
18908 X-Subject data get split in separate lines
20074 extra space in subject
20142 strip backslash in rfc822 From: field
23198 Incorrect Setting Installation Directory
24247 iso2022jp.pl: unneeded ESC ( B remains in message body
25225 dir\_create() fails to make temporary directories (PATCH)
25486 Resource FieldStore causes .mhonarc.db to grow over bounds
26577 Changed semantic for unpack breaks UTF-8
32032 TextEncode related resource information not saved correctly
in db file
------ ------------------------------------------------------------
\* Added FOLLOWSYMLINKS resource (Bug #13853).
\* When KEEPONRMM is enabled, messages that are removed from
the archive do not cause linked messages to be updated. This allows
for pages that use $TSLICE$ to maintain thread links for messages
that "fall off" of the maintained list of archived messages.
\* Added pre-extraction of From name and From address. This
provides a performance improvement for archives that make use of
the $FROMADDR$ and $FROMADDRNAME$ resource variables along with
author sorting.
\* Added mapping of message index keys to time stamp. This should
provide some performance gain since parsing out of time stamp from
index is no longer required.
\* Cache last message number in db to avoid directory scan of archive
each time an add operation is performed. This provides a performance
improvement for large archives and on file systems where directory
reading with many files may not be optimal. Thanks go to Christopher
Lindsey for patch.
\* Added References and In-Reply-To to as-is fields list to avoid
automatic modification of message IDs if address-rewriting is
in effect.
\* Simplified regular expression for detecting addresses.
New expression performs significantly better than the previous
expression, but still matches the vast majority of addresses
used today.
============================================================================
2006/06/09 (2.6.16)
\* Bug Fixes:
Bug ID Summary
------ ------------------------------------------------------------
14704 HTML mail does not get its charset converted (patch
included)
14713 qprint.pl should be able to handle a soft line break at
the end of the string
14813 MIMEFILTERS settings not retained in database
16368 in urlize change %X to %02X
------ ------------------------------------------------------------
============================================================================
2005/07/27 (2.6.15)
\* Removed debugging statement introduced during v2.6.14 development
which caused the filename of each message to be printed to stderr
when processing MH-style folders.
\* Fixed META.yml for CPAN: YAML is picky about tab characters, and
there was a couple of tab characters causing CPAN's YAML parser to
abort with an error.
============================================================================
2005/07/23 (2.6.14)
\* Bug Fixes:
Bug ID Summary
------ ------------------------------------------------------------
2641 Additional Callbacks
3225 CHARSETCONVERTERS not reset across multi-archive process
11759 email address exposed in subject line
------ ------------------------------------------------------------
\* New resources:
PRINTXCOMMENTS Print  comments in generated pages.
\* Added "Performance Tips" document: Provides configuration tips
to improve the execution performance of mhonarc.
============================================================================
2005/07/06 (2.6.13)
\* Bug Fixes:
Bug ID Summary
------ ------------------------------------------------------------
12314 linebreak not utf-8 aware
------ ------------------------------------------------------------
\* mha-preview example script changes:
- If preview data not available for message, the empty string
is used. Before, undef was returned to mhonarc, causing
warning messages and $X-MSG-PREVIEW$ to show up on index pages.
- Beefed up preview text extraction to skip past quoted text.
Someday, mha-preview functionality will be intrinisic to mhonarc.
============================================================================
2005/06/08 (2.6.12)
\* Bug Fixes:
Bug ID Summary
------ ------------------------------------------------------------
11761 spammode causes broken mailto: links in message body
13316 No warning generated when RCFILE set to non-existent file
13317 POSIX::setlocale() not invoked with LANG resource setting
------ ------------------------------------------------------------
\* New resources:
MIMEINCS Content-types to allow.
\* Beefed up filtering of UTF-8 messages: "Malformed UTF-8
..." warnings are now suppressed with such sequences being converted
to U+FFFD (�), which should normally cause an HTML viewer
to render a question-mark-like glyph.
Earlier version passed malformed utf-8 sequences through.
No bug/security problems have been reported against this, but it
was a bad practice that has now been corrected.
\* The return value for $mhonarc::CBMessageBodyRead and
$mhonarc::CBRawMessageBodyRead is no longer N/A. If the return
value evaluates to false, the current message will be excluded from
the archive and further processing. A true value must be returned
if the message is to not be excluded.
============================================================================
2005/05/20 (2.6.11)
\* Bug Fixes:
Bug ID Summary
------ ------------------------------------------------------------
9050 Regex abort error in mhmimetypes.pl under Win32
11187 incorrectly parsing UTF-8 encoded messages
11207 usenameext option to m2h\_external::filter has no effect
11760 spammode false positives on some HTML mail
11762 rel=nofollow attribute support in message body hyperlinks
11977 TSLICETOPBEGCUR ignored
12512 Consecutive spaces not displayed in some cases
12802 SubjectStripCode not working on message file
12930 Cross site scripting bug in m2h\_text\_html::filter
------ ------------------------------------------------------------
============================================================================
2004/05/17 (2.6.10)
\* Bug Fixes:
Bug ID Summary
------ ------------------------------------------------------------
8982 Can't use global $1 in "my" at base64.pl
------ ------------------------------------------------------------
============================================================================
2004/05/07 (2.6.9)
\* Bug Fixes:
Bug ID Summary
------ ------------------------------------------------------------
5473 directory separator for attachments on W2K
5643 New ressource - newsserver
5758 MULTIPG and NOSAVERESOURCES cause archive to be rewritten
5905 Modification of non-creatable array value attempted
6208 Mhonarc creates slightly incorrect HTML-code
7571  element doesn't look for resource files in
$OUTDIR$
7628 typo in mhrcfile.pl
------ ------------------------------------------------------------
\* New resources:
ATTACHMENTDIR Directory to save attachments.
ATTACHMENTURL Web URL to attachment directory.
NEWSURL URL template for linking to newsgroups.
\* Attachment filenames have changed from the numeric-style
<#####>. to . where
is a random string. The change corresponds with a change to the
API to mhonarc::write\_attachment() function in mhmimetypes.pl.
\* m2h\_text\_plain::filter:
. Changed default quoting styles: Left rule changed from 0.1em
to 0.2em and the color changed from #0000FF to #5555EE.
. Minor changes to flowed formatting in order to provide
consistancy with how Mozilla's Gecko engine renders flowed text.
\* base64.pl will use MIME::Base64 module if present. MIME::Base64
uses an underly C implementation for decoding, so it is noticably
faster than the pure-Perl approach.
============================================================================
2003/08/12 (2.6.8)
\* Bug Fixes:
Bug ID Summary
------ ------------------------------------------------------------
4719 Spurious read\_fmt\_file call
------ ------------------------------------------------------------
============================================================================
2003/08/07 (2.6.7)
\* Bug Fixes:
Bug ID Summary
------ ------------------------------------------------------------
4569 Problem with unfolding can mess up boundary processing in
multipart messages.
4594 Initial space on lines removed when using fancyquote.
------ ------------------------------------------------------------
\* Added LANG resource to define locale. Affects resource filename
resolution and message subject and author sorting.
\* readmail.pl updated to define the following special header field
keys passed to filter routines:
x-mha-content-type The media type of the entity extracted from
content-type entity header
x-mha-part-number The relative part number of the entity with
respect to parent entity. To get the
absolute part number, use
readmail::get\_full\_part\_number($fields).
x-mha-parent-header Reference to parent header fields hash.
This, and other data structures, are now mentioned in the MIMEFILTERS
resource page.
\* Text/richtext tag, , is quietly dropped in mhtxtenrich.pl.
============================================================================
2003/07/21 (2.6.6)
\* Bug Fixes:
Bug ID Summary
------ ------------------------------------------------------------
4387 m2h\_text\_plain::filter maxwidth usage can lead to crash
with a certain kind of input
------ ------------------------------------------------------------
============================================================================
2003/07/19 (2.6.5)
\* Bug Fixes:
Bug ID Summary
------ ------------------------------------------------------------
4126 Typo in mhopt.pl causes error message for big5
character set
4315 allowcomments' directive to filter() is ignored
------ ------------------------------------------------------------
\* An architecture independent RPM package is now provided for
installation. Because of this, the package name format has slightly
changed to be consistent RPM, and other, package managers:
Old format New Format
------------- -------------
MHonArcX.X.X MHonArc-X.X.X
Installation document has been updated to reflect this change.
If you create third-party distribution bundles for MHonArc, you may
need to update your bundling process to take account of this change,
mainly because the directory created when extracting the tar or
zip bundles now include the hyphen.
============================================================================
2003/06/20 (2.6.4)
\* Bug Fixes:
+ Official:
Bug ID Summary
------ ------------------------------------------------------------
3478 Quoted-Printable decoding should also work with
lowercase hex numbers
------ ------------------------------------------------------------
+ Unoffical:
- It appears that the UTF8 mapping table for cp1252,
MHonArc::UTF8::CP1252, had bad data. This has been
fixed.
\* Management of character mapping tables have been changed. The
various .pm module tables are now auto-generated by ucm, and
similiar, map files. For the end-user, the change should be
transparent. The change only affects how developers maintain
the tables, and the change should make it much easier to make
fixes to any mappings.
============================================================================
2003/04/05 (2.6.3)
\* Bug Fixes:
Bug ID Summary
------ --------------------------------------------------------------
3020 Trailing \ in regex
3128 XSS Vulnerabilies
2971 spammode option interferes with iso-2022-jp
------ --------------------------------------------------------------
============================================================================
2003/03/11 (2.6.2)
\* Bug Fixes:
Bug Resolution Fixed Summary
ID Release
2738 Fixed 2.6.2 An illegal From: address can cause MHonArc
to hang
============================================================================
2003/02/22 (2.6.1)
\* Bug Fixes: See
\* Corrected character mapping tables for VISCII based on a
message to the perl-unicode mailing list.
\* Added FASTTEMPFILES resource which causes MHonArc to use
non-random temporary files. This is less secure, but provides
a little bit of speed improvement.
============================================================================
2003/02/10 (2.6.0)
\* Bug Fixes: See
\* New resources:
DEFCHARSET Default character set of message text data.
CHARSETALIASES Define aliases for base charset names.
DBFILEPERMS File permissions for DBFILE.
FIELDSTORE Message header fields to store in database.
FILEPERMS File permissions for archive files.
ICONURLPREFIX URL string to prepend to ICONS URLs.
MODIFYBODYADDRESSES Apply ADDRESSMODIFYCODE to text message bodies.
RECONVERT Reconvert existing messages.
TENDBUTTON Button to last message in thread.
TENDBUTTONIA Inactive button to last message in thread.
TENDLINKIA Inactive link to last message in thread.
TENDLINK Link to last message in thread.
TEXTENCODE Encode message text to given character encoding.
TTOPBUTTON Button to first message in thread.
TTOPBUTTONIA Inactive button to first message in thread.
TTOPLINKIA Inactive link to first message in thread.
TTOPLINK Link to first message in thread.
\* New resource variables:
$ICONURLPREFIX$ Value of ICONURLPREFIX resource.
$MSGHFIELD$ Retrieve header field value stored via
FIELDSTORE.
\* MHonArc::CharEnt:
+ Several charset mappings added to MHonArc::CharEnt with the
default value for CHARSETCONVERTERS updated to reflect the new
mappings. New charset supported include UTF-8, various Cyrillic
sets, VISCII, Chinese sets, Japanese (iso-2022-jp and euc-jp),
Korean, Apple-based charsets, etc. See the documentation for
the CHARSETCONVERTERS and CHARSETALIASES for complete list of
character sets supported.
Note: Sets that have bidirectional rendering (Hebrew, Arabic)
exist, but automatic directional re-ording for rendering is
currently not supported.
. Some existing mappings have been updated to use Unicode numeric
character entity references (&#xHHHH;) instead of standard SGML
character entity references (eg. &Aelig). Most, if not all,
web browsers only support the set of SGML entity references
defined in the HTML 4.0 specification.
All existing tables should now generate entity references
recognized by all HTML 4.0 compliant browsers.
\* MHonArc::UTF8:
. Module completely redone to support various versions of Perl.
utf8 support code added to all conversion to utf8 with perl
installations that do not have utf8 support, but to also
leverage perl installations with utf8-related modules.
\* Default filter for iso-8859-1 and iso-2022-jp changed to
MHonArc::CharEnt::str2sgml. This helps keep MHonArc locale
neutral in its default configuration. Special note added
to release notes for Japanese users about the change.
\* m2h\_text\_plain::filter (mhtxtplain.pl):
+ Added more robust handling of format=flowed data. By default,
all text is rendered in a monospaced font to provide visual
consistency between flowed and fixed text. Proportional spaced
font can be generated using the "nonfixed" option (where
"keepspace" option should also be used to help preserve the
formatting characteristics of the data).
+ Added "fancyquote" option to provide highlight of quoted text
similiar to text/plain;format=flowed data.
+ Added "disableflowed" option to disable the flowed data
conversion. Data will be converted as regular text/plain.
This option is useful for archives that cater to text-based
browsers.
+ Added "quoteclass=" option to specify a CSS classname
to assign to BLOCKQUOTE elements added when processing flowed
data or when "fancyquote" is active. This suppresses inline
style generation.
+ Added "subdir" option for use when "uudecode" is enabled.
- Reduced set of quote characters to just '>'. Other characters
are used by some people (eg. '}', '|', '+'), especially on the
USENET, but supporting them tends to produce undesirable
results, especially when using fancyquote.
(Maybe make it configurable?)
+ If uudecode and usename specified, check if file ends in
.s?html?, and if so, pass data to HTML filter.
. Make sure to return a non-empty string for an empty body
when in uudecode mode. Avoids bogus warning message that
data could not be converted.
\* MIMEEXCS automatically handles unofficial version of a media type.
For example:
text/html

Will exclude text/html and text/x-html data.
\* m2h\_text\_html::filter (mhtxthtml.pl):
+ CHARSETCONVERTERS is used for converting character data.
- Removed default=charset option. This option is no longer
needed with new character encoding processing features and
CHARSETALIASES resource.
+ Convert javascript:... URLs to "\_javascript\_:..." when scripting
is disabled (the default). This is an extra measure ontop of
element and attribute stripping.
\* 's are now preserved when cid: only URLs enabled (the
default). This prevents regular hyperlinks in HTML messages from
getting stripped, which I think most people desire. Otherwise,
the allownoncidurls option must be used, and then this opens one
up to potential XSS attacks.
Due to the javascript: URL munging, preserving 's should
be safe from auto-XSS attacks. Readers should still be careful
about any links they activate.
+ Added "subdir" option to specify that MHTML referenced data
(e.g. images) are saved in a subdirectory.
+ Added "disablerelated" to disable cid: URL resolution.
. STYLE and CLASS attributes stripped if nofont argument specified.
\* m2h\_text\_enriched::filter (mhtxtenrich.pl):
+ CHARSETCONVERTERS is used for converting character data.
+ lang is now mapped to .
+ Added handling of some text/richtext tags.
. Escape unrecognized tags.
\* Archive file creation modified to minimize the local symlink exploits:
1. A temp file with a random name is first created and written to.
2. Temp file is compressed if GZIPFILES is active.
3. Temp file is renamed to final filename.
4. File permissions are set according to FILEPERMS/DBFILEPERMS.
Using a random temp filename makes it difficult for someone to
predict filenames to execute a symlink exploit. The rename operation
is immune to symlink exploits, hence trying to using well-known names
(e.g. maillist.html, threads.html) for exploitation will not work.
A similiar technique is used for directory creation for filters
that support the "subdir" option.
Generation of temp files is done via the File::Temp module, if
installed. If not installed, a homegrown implementation is used.
Although not as secure and robust as File::Temp, it's better than
nothing and should provide a decent deterrent.
\* Setuid/setgid execution causes mhonarc to terminate with an error.
Mhonarc does not pass taint checks, so we abort with an error that
setuid/setgid execution is not supported. MHonArc is too insecure
for setuid operation and trying to make it setuid-safe would require
alot of work and potentially limit a large amount of functionality.
\* More robust parsing used for determining $FROMNAME$ and $FROMADDR\*$
resource variables.
\* rfc822.pl library removed and replaced with MHonArc::RFC822 module.
\* Warning message, "Unable to process data..." removed from message
page when unable to convert any part of a message (usually due to
user-defined MIMEFILTERS settings). Instead, a warning message
is generated to standard error (like other mhonarc warnings) and
the resulting message page will have a blank message body.
\* m2h\_msg\_extbody::filter: (mhmsgextbody.pl)
+ Added support for http/x-http access type. This appears to
be an experimental access type since the general URI type can be
used instead.
. Properly sanitize parameter data.
. Some minor cosmetic changes in the HTML generated.
\* m2h\_text\_tsv::filter (mhtxttsv.pl):
. Sanitize field data.
\* m2h\_text\_setext::filter (mhtxtsetext.pl) has been removed. It
appears this media-type is part of document history.
============================================================================
2002/12/21 (2.5.14)
\* Security patch release: This release fixes a cross-site scripting
(XSS) vulnerability in m2h\_text\_html::filter (the HTML filter).
A specially crafted HTML message can have scripting markup get
by the script filtering done by m2h\_text\_html::filter.
============================================================================
2002/10/21 (2.5.13)
\* Bug Fixes: See
\* DBFILE resource can now be set to an absolute pathname. This
allows the database file to be located in a separate location than
in the archive directory. If not an absolute pathname, then
value is treated relative to OUTDIR.
\* readmail.pl updated to handle MHTML messages better. mhtxthtml.pl
changed accordingly.
\* readmail.pl handling of malformed multipart messages improved.
Cases were a the terminating boundary delimiter did not exist would
generate a warning message in the converted message body that data
could not be converted. This case should now be handled so that
end of entitiy implies a terminating boundary delimiter,
(Thanks goto Randy Blaustein for providing real-world test cases).
\* Fixed problem where some message attachments were "lost". This
mainly occurs when using mha-decode with the -dcd-digest option,
or if you have registered the m2h\_external::filter for message/\*
data types.
(Thanks goto Steve Johnson for finding this problem.)
\* m2h\_external::filter will now include the subject of a message
in the attachment link if saving message/\* data to a file.
\* m2h\_external::filter properly escapes the filename parameter
when displaying it in the attachment link. This is done to
avoid any possible XSS exploits. Note, no exploits have been
reported by using the filename parameter in messages, so this
change is more of a preemptive measure.
\* m2h\_external::filter will fall back to a "txt" extension for
unknown text types instead of a "bin" extension.
\* m2h\_text\_plain::filter: Removed hardcoded 'as-is' for US-ASCII
data. This is so a user could define a converter if having to deal
with mislabeled character data.
(Thanks goto Mooffie for finally finding a real-world case to not
hardcode us-ascii).
============================================================================
2002/09/03 (2.5.12)
\* Strip more tags and attributes that could potentially be used for
XSS exploits in the HTML filter. This is a more of a preemptive
change since no new exploits have been reported.
\* DATEFIELDS resource now supports indexed field names. For example:
received[1]:received[0]:date

The example says that mhonarc should check the second received
field, then the first received field, and then the first date field
to determine the date of a message.
============================================================================
2002/08/03 (2.5.11)
\* Bug Fixes: See
\* Applied Takashi P.KATOH's patch for iso\_2022\_jp::clip function
to support $has\_tag flag as defined by TEXTCLIPFUNC resource.
\* The following mail header fields added to list of fields that can
contain mail addresses: mail-reply-to, original-bcc, original-cc,
original-from, original-sender, original-to, resent-bcc, x-envelope.
Applicable to MAILTO, MAILTOURL, and ADDRESSMODIFYCODE resources.
\* Added documentation for TEXTCLIPFUNC resource. Forgot to add it
for v2.5.10 release.
============================================================================
2002/07/28 (2.5.10)
\* Bug Fixes: See
\* Added TEXTCLIPFUNC resource: Defines the text clipping function
that should be used by MHonArc. This function is mainly used
in resource variable expansion where clipping has been specified,
for example, "$SUBJECT:72$".
\* Added clip() function in MHonArc::UTF8 that can be registed via
TEXTCLIPFUNC resource to handling clipping of UTF-8 text.
\* Example utf-8.mrc updated to include some corrections and to
define TEXTCLIPFUNC resource.
\* Improved navigation links to resource reference pages which should
help their usability.
============================================================================
2002/07/19 (2.5.9)
\* Bug Fixes: See
\* Added MHonArc::UTF8 CHARSETCONVERTER module as recommended at
.
However, module redone to use utf8 pragma in Perl where appropriate
and to remove unnecessary code. Use of module does require that
the Unicode::MapUTF8 module is installed and the utf8 pragma is
supported in the version of Perl you are using.
A example resource file, "utf-8.mrc", has been added to the
resource file example appendix section on how UTF-8 output can
be done in MHonArc.
NOTE: The MHonArc core is still not UTF-8-aware, so some text
processing may not work as expected on UTF-8 data.
Possible problem points:
. Auto-URL hyperlinking in text/plain messages in
mhtxtplain.pl.
. Auto-message-id detection in messages.
. Resource variable text clipping.
There may be others, but in general, if there is a problem,
it should be uncommon and should not affect the overall
functionality of MHonArc. Problems can be avoided by
not using, or disabling, various resources.
\* mhtxtplain.pl:
. Removed exception case of iso-2022-jp character data since it
does not allow alternative iso-2022-jp character set conversion
functions via CHARSETCONVERTERS.
NOTE: This does eliminate the smart handling of URL detection
for the variable-width character set. Hence, the URL
detection could technically match non-URLs, or munge
a character at URL boundaries, but it is unknown on how
likely this is. If it is a problem, the "nourl" argument
should be specified to this filter.
NOTE: The old-style "smart" URL functionality can be re-enabled by
writing a custom CHARSETCONVERTER for iso-2022-jp that
just calls iso\_2022\_jp::jp2022\_to\_html in iso2022jp.pl.
. Minor modification to flowed text/plain formatting that hopefully
makes quoted text look better than before.
\* FAQ changes:
+ Added, "Does MHonArc support Unicode?"
\* Changed, "Can MHonArc create non-English archives?"
+ Added, "Can MHonArc process Evolution folders?"
============================================================================
2002/06/28 (2.5.8)
\* Added MIMEALTPREFS resource: Content-type preferences for
multipart/alternative data. You can now tell MHonArc to use the
text/plain part over a text/html part in multipart/alternative
messages.
\* Added the following resources:
IDXPGSSMARKUP Markup at the beginning of all index pages.
MSGPGSSMARKUP Markup at the beginning of all message pages.
TIDXPGSSMARKUP Markup at the beginning of all thread index pages.
Each resource will default to the value of the SSMARKUP resource
if not defined.
\* Removed  resource element since it useless since an archive
database is read before any resource files are parsed. The proper
way to specify an alternative DBFILE is via the -dbfile command-line
option or the M2H\_DBFILE envariable.
\* Release notes updated about upgrading from v2.1.x, or earlier archive.
Running a later version is safe, but all MIME-related resources will
be reset to default values. For v2.5.8, and later, the MIMEARGS
setting will preserved.
\* Removed references to HEADER and FOOTER resources in the docs.
Resources removed in v2.5.0.
\* Updated default resource layout settings in docs to use lowercase
tag names since MHonArc changed to use lowercase in defaults
in v2.4.7.
\* FAQ updates:
. Mention MIMEALTPREFS.
. Added MIMEARGS examples in MIME section.
============================================================================
2002/06/21 (2.5.7)
\* Bug Fixes: See
\* Updated docs to reflect address change of users' mailing list:
mhonarc@ncsa.uiuc.edu -> mhonarc-users@mhonarc.org.
\* Some minor FAQ changes, mainly mentioning mharc as a possible
solution to some questions.
============================================================================
2002/06/18 (2.5.6)
\* Bug Fixes: See
\* Added NOSUBJECTTXT resource: Defines raw subject text to use
for messages that do not have a subject.
============================================================================
2002/05/28 (2.5.5)
\* Bug Fixes: See
\* Incorporated format=flowed support into mhtxtplain.pl contributed
by Ken Hirsch, with some minor improvements.
\* MODTIME resource is set to off if setting modification date on files
is not supported for given platform. A warning message will be
generated.
\* Added mha-preview program in examples/: A front-end program to
MHonArc that provides support for the resource variable
$X-MSG-PREVIEW$ that expands to first part of a message body.
This program illustrated the usage of the callback API.
NOTE: It is probable that support for message preview text
may become a supported feature within the standard mhonarc
program. There are no guarantees that when implemented,
it will be compatible with how mha-preview does it.
\* Added blog.mrc in examples/: A resource file that generates
a page containing the content of all messages. This example
is also listed in the resource file examples appendix.
\* Some documentation updates and enhancements.
============================================================================
2002/05/03 (2.5.4)
\* Added more API callback functions:
$CBDbPreLoad
Right before database file is loaded.
$CBDbPreSave
Right before database file is written.
$CBDbSave
When data has been written.
$CBRawMessageBodyRead
After message body is read from input
$CBRcVarExpand
When a resource variable is being expanded.
See API appendix of the documentation for more information.
\* mha-decode now supports the following option: -dcd-digest. This
tells mha-decode to not recursively process attached message/rfc822
and message/news entities. This option is useful to extract
out all the individual messages of a message digest.
\* Added message/rfc822 and message/news to mhmimetypes.pl
content-type => extension/description hash. The extension used
is ".822".
\* Added ISO-8859-15 to default value of CHARSETCONVERTERS. This should
have been done in the previous release.
\* A readmail:: variable is not written to database file if it is
the default value. The readmail:: variables that can be saved
are controled by the CHARSETCONVERTERS, MIMEFILTERS, and MIMEARGS
resources.
============================================================================
2002/04/18 (2.5.3)
\* Added 'use locale' pragmas to be applied when sorting messages.
This is considered experimental, but it appears to give better
results when sorting text that contains 8-bit-non-English
characters. This is far from any real locale support, but
hopefully it is better than nothing.
\* Beefed up HTML filtering in mhtxthtml.pl to eliminate some
security exploits.
CAUTION: If you are worried about security, it is recommended
that you disable support of text/html messages in
your mail archives. There is no guarantee that
the mhtxthtml.pl library is robust enough to
eliminate all possible exploits that can occur with
HTML data.
Thanks goto Jason Molenda and Hiromitsu Takagi for spotting
more exploit cases.
\* mhtxtplain.pl checks MIMEXCS if text/html data is excluded
when the htmlcheck option is specified. Seems unnecessary
because someone use excludes HTML data will probably not use
the htmlcheck option to m2h\_text\_plain::filter.
\* Modified mail address extraction for $FROMADDR$ resource
variable to help deal with malformed From: header fields.
Thanks to Eugene Eric Kim for the recommendation.
\* Fixed uudecoding support in mhtxtplain.pl to handle spaces
in filenames and \r\n EOLs. Thanks to Jordan Russell for
spotting this.
\* Added ISO-8859-15 mappings. Thanks goto Jan Kraeber for the
contribution.
\* Removed GIF images from distribution. All GIF images
have been converted to PNG format. Transparency of PNG
images may only be supported in the latest versions of various
graphical web browsers.
See  for reasons
why GIF images should not be used.
\* Source code imported into CVS. CVS respository is currently
not available publicly. Stilling wondering if a site like
savannah.gnu.org should be used or if the respository should
be hosted independently, like at www.mhonarc.org.
\* Fixed regex patterns in readmail.pl to avoid Perl warning
messages.
\* Created a contrib/ directory to contain any contributed
programs imported into the MHonArc distribution. Moved
prsfrom.pl from extras/ to contrib/.
\* Added Security section to FAQ. Provided more information to
question, "Why does a message get split into mulitple messages
with no headers?", mainly information contributed by users.
============================================================================
2001/11/24 (2.5.2)
o mha-dbrecover new options:
-dbr-startnum #
The starting message number to recover data from. This
option is useful if you have many message files in a
directory, but you only want to recover a subset of the
files. If this option is not specified, the starting
number is 0.
-dbr-endnum #
The ending message number to recover data from. This
option is useful if you have many message files in a
directory, but you only want to recover a subset of the
files. If this option is not specified, all messages
starting from -dbr-startnum will be recovered.
o MSGPGBEGIN default value changed where $SUBJECTNA:72$ has
been replaced with $SUBJECTNA$. This is so default values
do not have any possible conflicts with variable-width
character sets.
============================================================================
2001/11/13 (2.5.1)
o Added special note within the release notes about
downgrading.
o Some documentation corrections.
============================================================================
2001/10/14 (2.5.0)
[This is non-beta release of 2.5.0. See the change notes
below and for the various beta release for a complete list of
changes from the last v2.4 release.]
o The ICONS resource has been updated to support the association
of icons at the base type level (e.g. text/\*) and to specify
width and height hints. The example icon resource file
listed in an appendix of the documentation updated to
to use changes to ICONS resource.
o Formatting of attachment links within the m2hexternal.pl
filter has been updated to provide more verbose information.
Description of the format provided in the MIMEFILTERS
documentation. Also, a 'frame' filter argument is now
supported to instruct the filter to draw a frame around
the link.
o Default value for MIMEArgs has been changed to the following:
m2h\_external::filter; inline

This is more concise then previous default value.
On a resource file maintenance standpoint, it is generally
best to specify filter arguments at the filter level and
not at the content-type level.
o Value of Perl's $^O variable printed with version information
for -V, -v, -help command-line options.
o The count of new messages added to archive are now printed
along with the total message count when QUIET is not active.
============================================================================
2001/09/05 (2.5.0b2)
o Long overdue update of ACKNOWLG file.
o New resources:
TSLICELEVELS -- Maximum depth for thread slices.
o New resource variables:
$TLEVEL$ -- Numeric level of message in thread.
o Added recognition of windows-1250 and windows-1252 charsets
into MHonArc::CharEnt and to default value of CHARSETCONVERTERS
resource. To apply to existing archives, use mha-dbedit
with examples/def-mime.mrc resource file.
o SUBJECTREPLYRXP now used to determine if "Re: " is added
when $SUBJECT$ is used within MAILTOURL.
o Code cleanup to eliminate perl -w warnings. Cleanup not
required for running MHonArc, but convenient for those that
use MHonArc with perl's -w option.
============================================================================
2001/08/26 (2.5.0b)
o API for MIMEFILTERS has been changed. Content filters are
now called as follows:
($html, @files) =
&filter($fields\_hash\_ref, $body\_data\_ref, $is\_decoded,
$filter\_args);
Paramaters:
$fields\_hash\_ref
A reference to hash of message/part header
fields. Keys are field names in lowercase
and values are array references containing the
field values. For example, to obtain the
content-type, if defined, you would do:
$fields\_hash\_ref->{'content-type'}[0]
Values for a fields are stored in arrays since
duplication of fields are possible. For example,
the Received: header field is typically repeated
multiple times. For fields that only occur once,
then array for the field will only contain one
item.
$body\_data\_ref
Reference to body data. It is okay for the
filter to modify the text in-place.
$is\_decoded
Boolean flag if body data has been decoded.
This is normally true unless some non-standard
content-transfer-encoding is used.
$filter\_args
String containing filter args as defined by
MIMEARGS resource.
Return:
The return value is still treated in the same manner as
previous releases. The first item in the return list is
the text that should printed to the message page. Any
other items in the return list are derived filenames created
by the filter. If undef, or the empty string, is returned,
readmail.pl assumes the filter was unable to filter the
data.
All the filters provided in the MHonArc distribution have
been modified to use the new calling convention.
o The HEADER and FOOTER resources are no longer supported.
o The default value of DEFRCNAME is now ".mhonarc.mrc"
("mhonarc.mrc" for Win/DOS).
o ISO8859 character set data processing now defaults to using
the MHonArc::CharEnt module. The old iso8859.pl library
is still provided for compatibility with older archives.
To update archives to use the new settings, you can run
the following command,
mha-dbedit -rcfile examples/def-mime.mrc \
-outdir /path/to/archive
where "examples/def-mime.mrc" represents the default MIME
processing resources for MHonArc provided within the MHonArc
distribution.
The new module is more efficient in memory usage by only
loading mappings for character sets actually processed. The
old iso8859.pl library preloads all mappings. Also, the
module is designed to be easily extensible for processing
any 8-bit-based character sets.
o Reference, follow-up, and derived file information of a
message is now stored in a different format in the database
(and internally). MHonArc will auto-update older archives
to the new format. The newer format should provide some
performance improvement.
o Messages with no subjects are now stored with no subjects.
In previous releases, the text "No Subject" was automatically
added as a message was parsed, hence there was no real
indicator that a message had no real subject.
A related change is that messages without subject text
are skipped in subject-based thread detection. Therefore,
a no-subject message will never be a possible follow-up,
but it is still possible for it to be an explicit follow-up
if it includes reference message-ids.
NOTE: This functionality does not apply to messages
processed by earlier versions where the text "No Subject"
was auto-applied to messages when parsed. A recreation
of an archive from the original message data would
have to be done to have new behavior applied to message
processed by earlier releases.
A messages with no subject will now have the string
"[no subject]" displayed any time the $SUBJECT$ resource
variable is used for the message.
o New resources:
FIRSTPGLINK Link markup for first page of main index.
LASTPGLINK Link markup for last page of main index.
TFIRSTPGLINK Link markup for first page of thread index.
TLASTPGLINK Link markup for last page of thread index.
TNEXTINBUTTON Button markup for next message
within a thread.
TNEXTINBUTTONIA Inactive button markup for next
message within a thread.
TNEXTINLINK Link markup for next message within
a thread.
TNEXTINLINKIA Inactive link markup for next
message within a thread.
TNEXTTOPBUTTON Button markup for first message in
the next thread.
TNEXTTOPBUTTONIA Inactive button markup for first
message in the next thread.
TPREVINBUTTON Button markup for previous message
within a thread.
TPREVINBUTTONIA Inactive button markup for previous
message within a thread.
TPREVINLINK Link markup for previous message
within a thread.
TPREVINLINKIA Inactive link markup for previous
message within a thread.
TPREVTOPBUTTON Button markup for first message in the
previous thread.
TPREVTOPBUTTONIA Inactive button markup for first
message in the previous thread.
TSLICECONTBEGIN Thread slice markup before the
continuation of a broken thread.
TSLICECONTEND Thread slice markup after the
continuation of a broken thread.
TSLICEINDENTBEGIN Thread slice markup for opening a level
when continuing a broken thread.
TSLICEINDENTEND Thread slice markup for closing a level
when continuing a broken thread.
TSLICELIEND Ending markup for a thread slice
message listing.
TSLICELIENDCUR Ending markup for a thread slice
message listing.
TSLICELINONE Thread slice markup for a missing
message in thread slice.
TSLICELINONEEND Ending markup for a missing message in
thread slice.
TSLICELITXT Markup for a thread slice message
listing.
TSLICELITXTCUR Markup for a thread slice message
listing if current message.
TSLICESINGLETXT Markup for a thread slice listing with
no follow-ups.
TSLICESINGLETXTCUR Markup for a thread slice listing with
no follow-ups if current message.
TSLICESUBJECTBEG Markup before a subject based thread
slice listing.
TSLICESUBJECTEND Markup after a subject based thread
slice listing.
TSLICESUBLISTBEG Thread slice markup for starting a
sub-thread.
TSLICESUBLISTEND Thread slice markup for ending a
sub-thread.
TSLICETOPBEGIN Thread slice markup for the root/start
of a thread.
TSLICETOPBEGINCUR Thread slice markup for the root/start
of a thread.
TSLICETOPEND Thread slice markup for the end of a
thread.
TSLICETOPENDCUR Thread slice markup for the end of a
thread if current message.
o $TSLICE$ resource variable can now take up to three arguments:
$TSLICE(;;)$
where,
 : Number indicated the maximum number of
message to print before the current message.
If empty, the before value specified in
TSLICE resource will be used.
 : Number indicated the maximum number of
message to print after the current message.
If empty, the after value specified in
TSLICE resource will be used.
 : If `1', only messages within the current
thread will be printed. If `0', messages
from the previous and next threads can
be printed if the values for  and
 would go beyond the current thread.
o TSLICE resource updated to allow specification of default
value of inclusive flag.
o The following new message specifications can be used for
message data-related resource variables:
TNEXTIN Next message within current thread.
TNEXTTOP Start of next thread.
TPREVIN Next message within current thread.
TPREVTOP Start of previous thread.
When used as arguments to the the $BUTTON$ and $LINK$ resource
variables, the TNEXTINBUTTON(IA), TNEXTTOPBUTTON(IA),
TPREVINBUTTON(IA), TPREVTOPBUTTON(IA), TNEXTINLINK(IA),
TNEXTTOPLINK(IA), TPREVINLINK(IA), TPREVTOPLINK(IA) resources
are respectively applied.
o The use of TNEXT, TPREV (and new TNEXTTOP and TPREVTOP)
message specifications in resource variables behave more
intuitively when TREVERSE is active. If at the boundaries
of a thread, TNEXT and TPREV will reference the first
message of the next thread by date and the first message
of the previous thread by date, respectively.
o Version of MHonArc and Perl are printed when MHonArc starts
unless QUIET is active.
o mhtxtplain.pl (text/plain) filter changes:
. If the htmlcheck option is set and it is detected that
the data is HTML, an attempt is first made to use the
registered text/html filter via MIMEFILTERS. If none
is defined, mhtxthtml.pl will be used.
. When uudecode option is set, an attempt is to use
the registered decoder for uuencode via MIMEDECODERS.
If not defined, then base64::uudecode is used from
base64.pl.
o mhtxthtml.pl (text/html) filter changes:
. Elements that have URL attributes that auto-load data --
IMG, BODY, IFRAME, FRAME, OBJECT, SCRIPT, INPUT -- have the
atributes converted to 'javascript:void(0);' URLs. See new
'allownoncidurls' filter argument below for more details.
. The follow filter arguments have been added:
allownoncidurls Preserve URL-based attributes that are not
cid: URLs. Normally, any URL-based
attribute -- href, src, background,
classid, data, longdesc -- will be
converted to 'javascript:void(0);'
if it is not a cid: URL. This is to
prevent malicious URLs that verify mail
addresses for spam purposes, secretly set
cookies, or gather some statistical data
automatically with the use of elements
that cause browsers to automatically
fetch data: IMG, BODY, IFRAME, FRAME,
OBJECT, SCRIPT, INPUT.
notitle Do not print title.
o Searching for OTHERINDEXES resource files has been modified.
The following lists the search order for an OTHERINDEXES
resource file:
1. Current working directory.
2. Same directory that the first resource file was read as
specified by the RCFILE resource.
3. User's home directory.
4. Archive directory.
5. Perl's @INC.
o FIRST, LAST, TFIRST, and TLAST idx\_page\_spec arguments to
$PGLINK$ are now supported via the FIRSTPGLINK, LASTPGLINK,
TFIRSTPGLINK, and TLASTPGLINK resources.
o $PGLINKLIST$ resource variable changed to print entire
list of page links if no arguments are provided. To get
the entire list for thread indexes, use: $PGLINKLIST(T)$.
o Date parsing routine updated to recognize dates in the
following format: Weekday, Month DD, YYYY HH:MM Zone.
Apparently, this is useful if converting mail saved to
a file in text format from MS Outlook.
o Support for defining Perl function callbacks when a
new message header is read and just after a message body
has been converted. Documentation about the callbacks is
provided in a new API appendix section in the documentation
and is provided in comments in the example mhasiteinit.pl
provided in the examples/ directory.
o Various internal changes have been made to try to eradicate
Perl 4-based conventions. For example, the use of typeglobs to
pass by "reference" has been replaced by using real references.
Assuming nothing was screwed up, this change should be
transparent to most users (with the notable exception of the
API changes to MIMEFILTERS registered routines). However,
if you have mucked with MHonArc internals, or created custom
modifications, you may need to be aware that changes have
been made.
============================================================================
2001/06/10 (2.4.9)
o Added the following resources:
MIMEEXCS List of content-types to exclude
from processing. Exclusion occurs
before data is passed to filters.
o mhtxtplain.pl: If decoding uuencoded data, the data will
be excluded if application/octet-stream is listed the
MIMEEXCS resource.
o mhtxthtml.pl: If a CID URL is not available, the CID URL
is no longer preserved in the converted output. The CID
URL is stripped.
o Added the following to mhmimetypes.pl content-type table:
application/ms-excel => xls:MS-Excel spreadsheet
application/ms-powerpoint => ppt:MS-Powerpoint presentation
application/ms-project => mpp:MS-Project file
The "vnd." official versions are already present, but
some application use the above.
o TODO list added to distribution.
=======================================================================
2001/04/13 (2.4.8)
o Added the following resources:
KEEPONRMM Do not remove message files from disk
when messages are removed from the
archive.
o m2h\_text\_plain::filter now uses CHARSETCONVERTERS for
translating text data with a specified charset parameter.
The only exception is iso-2022-jp, which is handled directly
to properly support nourl flag.
o m2h\_external::filter new arguments:
excludeexts=ext1,...
A comma separated list of message specified filename
extensions to exclude. I.e. If the filename
extension matches an extension in excludeexts, the
content will not be written. The return markup
will contain the name of the attachment, but no
link to the data. This option is best used with
application/octet-stream to exclude unwanted data
that is not tagged with the proper content-type.
The m2h\_null::filter can be used to exclude content
by content-type.
o m2h\_null::filter will now output a one line description
of the excluded content. This is so the reader knows that
there was message content not saved within the archive.
o m2h\_text\_plain::filter new arguments:
usename If extracting uuencoded data, the filename
specified should be used.
o m2h\_text\_html::filter new arguments:
allowcomments Preserve any comment declarations. Normally
Comment declarations are munged to prevent
SSI attacks or comments that can conflict
with MHonArc processing. Use this option
with care.
(NOTE: Comment declarations were completely stripped before,
but the regex used was known to crash perl on large comment
declarations, so a simplier expression is now used to
modify comment declarations to prevent possible attacks.)
=======================================================================
2000/10/28 (2.4.7)
o Added the following options to m2h\_text\_plain::filter:
attachcheck Honor attachment disposition. By default,
all text/plain data is displayed inline on
the message page. If attachcheck is specified
and Content-Disposition specifies the data as
an attachment, the data is saved to a file
with a link to it from the message page.
htmlcheck Check if message is actually an HTML message
(to get around abhorrent MUAs). The message
is treated as HTML if the first non-whitespace
data looks like the start of an HTML document.
o FROMFIELD resource default value is now:
from:mail-reply-to:reply-to:return-path:apparently-from:
sender:resent-sender
The change is the addition of "mail-reply-to."
o Added the following resource variables:
$MSGTORDNUM$ Ordinal number of message in current
thread.
o Added the following resource variable message specificiers:
TEND Last message of current discussion
thread.
TTOP Top/root message of current discussion
thread.
o Changes to readmail.pl:
- %Cid hash keys are now URLs. Content-Ids are denoted
as "cid:..." Hash also contains Content-Location values
of message parts. This allows filters (like the HTML
filter) to check for external URL references where
the data for the reference is included with the message.
- More robust handling of malformed multipart messages.
o The null filter is applied to application/ms-tnef by default.
o Lowercase tag names are now used in default resource values
that contain HTML markup.
o Bug fixes to the documentation.
=======================================================================
2000/04/24 (2.4.6)
o Stricter check is made when decoded quoted-printable data.
An escape sequence is only converted to a raw character if
a it is a valid escape sequence. I.e. Any '=' not followed
by two hexadecimal characters is left as-is.
o Call to Digest::MD5::md5\_hex() wrapped in eval block in
case of bad installations of Digest::MD5 module.
=======================================================================
2000/02/14 (2.4.5)
o Following changes to m2h\_text\_html::filter:
- All comment declarations are removed. This avoid
potential SSI attacks and declarations that may conflict
with MHonArc.
- Additional tags have been added to the to-strip list
to avoid potential client-side scripting attacks. See
MIMEFILTERS docs for list.
- Added "nofont" option to strip out any  tags.
o Added application/x-bzip2 to known mime types (mhmimetypes.pl).
o Simple modification to get\_time\_from\_date() in mhutil.pl to
handle abhorrent case of message date using a 2 digit year.
o Under VMS, the default lock file name has been changed to
"mhonarc\_lck" for directory based locking will work.
o mhonarc::htmlize/entify now translates the double-quote
character (") to ".
o Added VARREGEX resource to allow customization of resource
variable matching. Mainly for use with resource files written
on multibyte charsets like SJIS. Use with caution.
=======================================================================
1999/10/01 (2.4.4)
o Added the following resources:
MIMEDECODERS Content-Transfer-Encoding decoding
functions.
o Added the following resource variables:
$PGLINKLIST$ Print out a list of index page links.
o New content filter for message/external-body.
o Message/delivery-status content handled by mhtxtplain.pl
o Support for "Zone[+-]DDDD" timezone specification.
o MAILparse\_parameter\_str() function added to readmail.pl.
Function supports parsing parameter value strings with support
for RFC 2184 extensions. Function added to provide
support for message/external-body filter.
=======================================================================
1999/08/15 (2.4.3)
o Added the following resources:
POSIXSTRFTIME Use POSIX::strftime() or not for
processing time format strings
o The "latin[1-6]" character sets defined in the default
value of CHARSETCONVERTERS. iso8859::str2sgml modified
to use proper iso8859 map for specified latin[1-6]
specification.
o The text/html filter now strips out scripting markup by
default. To allow scripting markup to be preserved, the
"allowscript" option can be used.
o Unknown media-types are now treated as application/octet-stream,
which will invoke the application/octet-stream filter.
Because of this, an explicit entry for application/octet-stream
has been added to the default value of MIMEFILTERS.
o If in a multipart/alternative entity, and no known media-types
exists, the last part is treated as application/octet-stream.
=======================================================================
1999/08/11 (2.4.2)
o Added the following resources:
STDIN Source for standard input
o Added the following resource variables:
$ENV$ Print an environment variable
o Added support for decoding uuencoded data within text
messages in mhtxtplain.pl. Decoding activated via the
"uudecode" option.
o For processing time format strings, POSIX::strftime() is
used, if available. If not, MHonArc implementation is
used.
o The default value of FROMFIELDS now includes "return-path".
o Description section moved before Options section in -help
message.
=======================================================================
1999/07/25 (2.4.1)
o Added the following resources:
MSGEXCFILTER Perl expressions for excluding
messages from archive.
SAVERESOURCES Flag if resource values should be
saved in database.
o Added the following resource variables:
$HTMLEXT$ Value of HTMLEXT resource.
o Documentation corrections an additions.
o Use of typeglobs removed from mhdb.pl.
o mhtime.pl explicitly defined in mhonarc package.
=======================================================================
1999/06/25 (2.4.0)
o Added the following resources:
ADDRESSMODIFYCODE Perl expressions to apply to addresses
during message header conversion.
CHECKNOARCHIVE Check "no archive" flag in messages.
LOCKMETHOD The type of archive locking performed.
SPAMMODE Perform actions to deter email address
harvesters.
SSMARKUP Markup at the \*very\* beginning of any
generated page.
STDOUT Destination of stdout messages/data.
STDERR Destination of stderr messages/data.
SUBJECTTHREADS To check, or not to check, subjects when
computing threads.
o Added the following resource variables:
$FROMADDRNAME$ Username portion of From email address.
$FROMADDRDOMAIN$ Domain portion of From email address.
$TOADDRNAME$ Username portion of an email address
(applicable in MAILTOURL only).
$TOADDRDOMAIN$ Domain portion of an email address
(applicable in MAILTOURL only).
o A new utility program: mha-decode. The program functions
as a MIME message decoder. Can be used against mail folders
or single messages.
o The "PARENT" argument to applicable resource variables is now
called "TPARENT". This change should not affect anyone since
the "PARENT" argument did not work properly in previous
releases.
o SUBJECTHEADER and HEADBODYSEP resource changes will now affect
existing messages that are edited during normal operations or
via EDITIDX. Note, messages created from old versions of
MHonArc may not be affected.
o The default TIMEZONES settings now has a more complete list.
o Timezone acronym settings now support [+-]HHMM specifications.
o Support for ISO-2022-JP encoded strings in message headers
is now supported. It does assume that HTML viewer supports
ISO-2022-JP.
o If Digest::MD5 is installed, md5\_hex() will be used to create
message-ids for messages without message-ids. This allows
MHonArc to ignore non-message-id archived messages in ADD mode.
The MD5 digest is computed only on message header for efficieny.
If Digest::MD5 is not installed, a message-id will still be
assigned if none present, but MHonArc will not be able to
detect if message has already been archived in subsequent ADD
operations.
o Text/html filter supports the "noscript" option. If
specified, any script-related markup will be removed.
This provides added security to avoid sites being compromised
with foreign client-side scripting.
o Added the following options to mhexternal.pl (the save-to-file
filter): forceattach, forceinline, and inlineexts.
o Recognize mailing list headers as defined by RFC 2369 and
hyperlink URLs listed.
o If no boundaries exist in a multipart message (even though
a boundary is defined in the header), MHonArc will treat
the entire body as the first part. This prevents "unable
to process" warnings.
o The "" is
now inserted between the message header and body. Helps
in the building of some search indexes to restrict searches
on message data.
o Many resource settings are no longer stored in database if
the resource is the default value. Save some disk space and
allows resources to self adjust when a dependent resource is
changed.
o The text/plain filter in mhtxtplain.pl has the following
enhancements:
- Check for charset to control character conversion.
- Integrated iso-2022-jp filter (keys off charset)
- Filter option "quote" cause quoted text in message
to be italicized.
- Filter option "asis" defines a list of charsets to
not convert to sgml entitites. Example usage:
asis=iso-8859-1:iso-8859-2
o mhtxt2022.pl has been removed since the code has been
integrated into mhtxtplain.pl.
o Resource file elements that have textual content (ie. no
line oriented content) can specify the "chop" attribute
to have the last end-of-line stripped from the content.
Example usage:
[Next]

o Fixed bug in creating links of message-ids. Mhonarc blindingly
made links of message-ids when editting messages w/o
consideration that the message-ids may already be linked. This
caused markup like the following to occur:
[[<...>](...)](...)...
Browsers handle the invalid markup with no problems, causing
the bug to go unnoticed for a long time. Now, only new
added message-ids are scanned for when creating links.
o $readmail'FieldSep should now be used instead of $FieldSep
for separating duplicate fields in a parsed message header.
o The -scan output now prints a 4 digit year.
o Bogus space no longer appears in subjects and dates.
o Outdir permissions are not checked if -single specified.
o Some internal changes to how data is stored in databases
(needed for 1522 support). v2.0 will automatically
modify 1.x databases to the 2.0 format.
o The -single option utilizes the same mail output routine
utilized by regular archive processing.
o MhonArc will now handle numbers with leading zeros when
the -rmm option is specified.
o New resources:

separated
NOTE
1522 processing is done when creating HTML output and
the (relevant) data stored in the database stays in
encoded form. The DECODEHEADS resource can be set
to decode decode-only charsets when message headers
are read. Hence, the decode-only charsets will be
stored in decoded form. Regular 1522 processing is
still done to still-encoded data when generating output.
The default is NODECODEHEADS.
o List of removed resources:
NOTSUBSORT, TSUBSORT

o Removed resources:
NOTSUBSORT, TSUBSORT
o Some changes to default resource settings.
o Reorganized code. Some new libraries have been created
to help in maintenance.
o Source code has been put under SCCS revision control.
=======================================================================
1996/07/12 (1.2.3)
o Extracted initialization of data structures into mhinit.pl.
The file is just required from the main source.
o Use q{} instead of qq{} when trying to read database file.
Should fix require problem under MS-DOS.
o Added  comments at beginning
of messages. May aid in database recovery techniques.
o ';'s are now deleted in filenames in mhexternal.pl
(applicable only when "usename" option specified)
o Added recognition of '/' when converted e-mail addresses
to mailto links in message headers.
o Simple fix to mhtxt2022.pl for execution under Perl 5.
=======================================================================
1996/04/18 (1.2.2)
o Increased the speed performance of base64 decoding. Speed
increase is much greater under Perl 4 than Perl 5.
o Added -time option to print out total CPU execution time.
Mainly used for debugging reasons (like checking on
base64 decoding times). Time information is sent to
standard error.
o Added M2H\_LOCKDELAY envariable and -lockdelay option.
Either can be used to adjust the sleep time between
attempts to lock the archive.
o Added -force option to override a lock on an archive if
attempts to lock fail.
o Added image/x-bmp and image/x-pcx to the default supported
MIME types.
o Ignore "Sv:" at the beginning of subjects when sorting by
subject. "Sv:" is Danish for "Re:".
o Fixed bug in mhutil.pl where TIDXPGEND actually set
TIDXPGBEG.
o Dynamically define exclude\_field routine after reading
user options. exclude\_field is utilized when formatting
a message header in HTML. Defining the routine at run-time
helps reduce the regular expression overhead the old version
of the routine entailed. There should be an increase in
overall execution time.
=======================================================================
1996/03/22 (1.2.1)
o Added support for x-uuencode content-transfer-encoding.
o Added -locktries command-line option.
o Added the resource variable $OUTDIR$.
o mhexternal.pl filter will use the name parameter string
on the content-type field as the anchor text to the file
if there is no content-description.
o application/x-patch is recognized and processed by the
text/plain filter (mhtxtplain.pl).
o Fixed bug in install.me and osinit.pl where setting
$'PROG caused perl to terminate if $'DIRSEP was a backslash
(occured under MS-DOS usage).
o Fixed bug in install.me in the create\_dir routine.
If $DIRSEP was a backslash, the regular expression setting
@a would cause perl to abort with an error.
o Fixed database bug where the MIMEARGS resource setting
was not being stored.
o Fixed index listing bug where a reverse listing was not
correct if an index size was specified less than the
current size of the archive.
=======================================================================
1996/03/01 (1.2.0)
o Rewrote message parser routine so it will work under Perl 5
for multipart messages. The rewrite also allows some
additional features that are mentioned below.
o The -mbox and -mh options are no longer required. MHonArc
will automatically determine which mode to operate in
based upon the file arguments. Hence, one can specify
MH folders and mailbox files on the same command-line.
Both options are ignored if specified.
o An HTML index of an archive contents can be generated to
standard output (-genidx).
o Message header lines not conforming to RFC 822 are ignored.
(Eg: Those pesky "From " lines should not show up anymore --
please do not confuse this with the regular "From:" lines;
note the colon vs the space).
o New resources:
BOTLINKS - May be used to completely customize
the links at the bottom of messages.
IDXPGBEGIN - Opening markup for main index page.
Allows one to redefine opening HTML
element, HEAD element, TITLE element,
opening BODY element, etc.
IDXPGEND - Closing markup for main index page.
IDXSIZE - Set the maximum number of messages
listed in index. This is different
in MAXSIZE where MAXSIZE will remove
older messages when the MAXSIZE limit
is reached in the archive.
MIMEARGS - Define arguments to filters
MSGPGBEGIN - Opening markup for message pages.
Allows one to redefine opening HTML
element, HEAD element, TITLE element,
opening BODY element, etc.
MSGPGEND - Closing markup for message pages.
NEXTBUTTON - Defines the 'Next' button.
NEXTBUTTONIA - Defines the 'Next' button when it is
inactive.
NEXTLINK - Defines the 'Next' link.
NEXTLINKIA - Defines the 'Next' link when it is
inactive.
NOTSUBSORT - Do not sort threads by subject.
OTHERINDEXES - List other resource files defining
other indexes to create when creating,
or updating, an archive.
PREVBUTTON - Defines the 'Prev' button.
PREVBUTTONIA - Defines the 'Prev' button when it is
inactive.
PREVLINK - Defines the 'Prev' link.
PREVLINKIA - Defines the 'Prev' link when it is
inactive.
TIDXPGBEGIN - Opening markup for thread index page.
Allows one to redefine opening HTML
element, HEAD element, TITLE element,
opening BODY element, etc.
TIDXPGEND - Closing markup for thread index page.
TOPLINKS - May be used to completely customize
the buttons at the top of messages.
TSUBSORT - Sort threads listed by subject.
o Removed resources:
INDEXBL, INDEXFL, MBOX, MH, NEXTBL, NEXTFL, PREVBL,
PREVFL, TINDEXBL, TINDEXFL
Resource were removed because they were no longer applicable
and/or have been superceded by other resources. MHonArc
will still honor old resource settings (where applicable) of
older archives and incorporate them into the new resource
settings.
o When specifying the resource file, mhonarc will now do
the following to determine its location:
1. If its an absolute pathname, mhonarc uses it.
2. If it is a relative pathname, mhonarc checks for
it relative to the current working directory.
3. Otherwise, mhonarc checks for it relative to
location of the archive as specified by outdir.
This resolution will allow you to place resource files with
the archive if desired (can be useful when using the
OTHERINDEXES resource element).
o Because of the new resources available, many

---

's are no
longer hard-coded and are controllable by resources.

---

's
are still used in message pages to separate message data
from mhonarc data.
o Added resource variables:
(NOTE: Some variables are only valid in certain contexts)
$DDMMYY$ - Date of message in dd/mm/yy format
$IDXSIZE$ - Max size of index list
$MMDDYY$ - Date of message in mm/dd/yy format
$MSGID$ - Message id
$NEXTBUTTON$ - Next button markup
$NEXTFROM$ - From field of next listed message
$NEXTFROMADDR$ - From e-mail address of next listed message
$NEXTFROMNAME$ - From name of next listed message
$NEXTLINK$ - Next link markup
$NEXTMSGNUM$ - Number of next listed message
$NEXTSUBJECT$ - Subject text of next listed message
$NUMOFIDXMSG$ - Number of messages in index list
$PREVBUTTON$ - Previous button markup
$PREVFROM$ - From field of previous listed message
$PREVFROMADDR$ - From e-mail address of prev listed message
$PREVFROMNAME$ - From name of previous listed message
$PREVLINK$ - Previous link markup
$PREVMSGNUM$ - Number of previous message
$PREVSUBJECT$ - Subject text of previous listed message
$YYMMDD$ - Date of message in yy/mm/dd format
o Can specify a 'U' with variable length specifier to denote
replacement string is to be used in a URL. Examples:
$SUBJECTNA:40U$
$MSGID:U$
The 'U' causes the replace text to have special characters
escaped as denoted by the URL spec. NOTE: Specify ":U"
should NOT be used in the MAILTOURL resource; the variables
will automatically be expanded according to the URL spec.
Specifyind ":U" or a length specifier in the MAILTOURL
resource will prevent mhonarc from detecting the variable.
o New command-line options:
-genidx - Generate HTML index of archive contents
to stdout.
-idxsize - Maximum number of messages shown in indexes
-notsubsort - Do not sort threads listed by subject.
-savemem - Write message data while processing
-tsubsort - Sort threads listed by subject.
o The library mhtxt2022.pl has been added that provides
a filter to process ISO-2022 (Japanese) encoded mail messages.
See mhtxt2022.pl on how to hook it in.
o The mhexternal.pl filter by default ignores any filename
specification in the message for creating derived files.
This avoids name conflicts and security problems.
The "usename" filter option may be used to override this.
o Mime filters are now called with two additional arguments:
$converted\_data = &function(
$header, \*parsed\_header\_assoc\_array,
\*message\_data, $decoded\_flag,
$optional\_filter\_arguments);
The $decoded\_flag is set to 1 if the \*message\_data has been
decoded. $optional\_filter\_arguments contains an optional
argument string as determined by the filter.
o Mime filters can now be registered for multipart types
and message types. This allows one to override mhonarc's
conversion of these types, and completely replace mhonarc's
message->HTML conversion process.
o Mime filters should now use $'FieldSep instead of $'X for
accessing parsed message headers.
o Mime filters can be registered for a base type. Ie.
It is no longer required to explicitly list each possible
subtype if a single filter is to be used for them all.
Example:
image/\*:myfilter'imagefilter:myfilter.pl

Registers "myfilter'filter" for all image data types,
regardless of subtype. However, if an explicit entry
exists for a subtype, then that filter is called.
Example:
image/\*:myfilter'imagefilter:myfilter.pl
image/gif:myfilter'giffilter:myfilter.pl

"myfilter'giffilter" is called for all image/gif data.
"myfilter'imagefilter" is called for all other image data.
o A new resource, MIMEARGS, may be used to pass optional arguments
to filters to control their behavior. The format of the
argument string is controlled by the various filters. The
arguments can be specified by a specific content-type, or
for the filter routine in general. A content-type argument
will be used over any arguments specified for a filter.
Example usage:
image/gif:inline usename
m2h\_external'filter:usename

See the documentation for possible arguments to filters.
o Installation program can now be invoked in batch mode.
o Thread index properly includes docurl as main index.
-nodocurl will prevent the inclusion as with the main index.
o Fixed bug in mhtxthtml.pl on properly propogating a base
URL to relative URLs starting with a "/".
o Fixed bug where single quotes, and backslashed in keys of
associative arrays in the database file were not getting
escaped.
o Fixed bug where spaces and special characters were not
properly escaped in URL strings: spaces were left as-is,
and special characters were deleted.
o Removed illegal invocation choices in the Synopsis of the
documentation.
=======================================================================
1995/04/24 (1.1.1)
o Fixed bug in -scan output where month in date was off by
one.
=======================================================================
1995/04/21 (1.1.0)
o Made modifications to make MHonArc suitable to run
under MS-DOS without modification. MHonArc will
automatically detect if it is running under Unix or MS-DOS.
o Added support for a thread index. MHonArc will create a
complimentary index to the main index showing message
threads.
o Archive messages can be deleted.
o A listing to stdout of an archives contents can be
generated.
o Maximum number of messages for an archive can be set.
Older messages (based on sort method) are removed
automatically during add operations.
o MHonArc will now recognize if you try to add in a message
that already exists in an archive.
o The -editdx option will now also cause a updating of all
mail messages. Guarantees resource changes to affect all
messages.
o Added the following resource file elements:
MSGFOOT -- Footer text for converted messages
MSGHEAD -- Header text for converted messages
NODOC -- Do not put link to documentation
NOTHREAD -- Do not create thread index
TFOOT -- Text at bottom of thread index page
THEAD -- Text at top of thread index page
THREAD -- Create thread index
TLEVELS -- Depth of thread listing
TLITXT -- Template text for entry in thread
index
TIDXFNAME -- Thread index filename
TINDEXBL -- Top button label in messages to
thread index
TINDEXFL -- Verbose label in message to thread
index
TTITLE -- Title of thread index page
o Added the following command-line options:
-maxsize -- Maxinum # messages in an archive
-nodoc -- Do not put link to documentation
-nothread -- Do not create thread index
-rmm -- Remove messages from an archive
-scan -- Listing of archive to stdout
-thread -- Create thread index
-tidxfname -- Thread index filename
-tlevels -- Depth of thread listing
-ttitle -- Title of thread index page
o Added the following environment variables:
M2H\_MAXSIZE -- Maxinum # messages in an archive
M2H\_THREAD -- If non-zero, create thread index
M2H\_TIDXFNAME -- Thread index filename
M2H\_TLEVELS -- Depth of thread listing
M2H\_TTITLE -- Title of thread index page
o Added the following variables for template resources
(applicability of variables vary depending on the resource):
$DOCURL$ -- URL to documentation
$IDXFNAME$ -- Main index page filename
$IDXTITLE$ -- Main index page title
$NEXTMSG$ -- Next message filename
$PREVMSG$ -- Previous message filename
$PROG$ -- Program name
$TIDXFNAME$ -- Thread index page filename
$TIDXTITLE$ -- Thread index page title
$VERSION$ -- Version number of the program
o Added $FROM$, $MSGID$, and $SUBJECT$ variables to be used
in the MAILTOURL resource.
o The string `$$' in template resources will produce a `$' in
the output.
o Fixed problem with messages (with follow-ups) getting
unnecessarily updated when messages are added to an archive.
o Only a CR/LF, or LF, pair will terminate a message head.
Before, MHonArc was terminating message heads when
encountering an empty line or a line that only contained
whitespace (which was incorrect behavior).
o Fixed bug in mhexternal.pl dealing with the `name' parameter
in the content-type field. Surrounding "s or 's were not
being deleted causing filenames with quotes to be written.
o mhexternal.pl: The head of a pathname in the `name'
parameter in the content-type field is stripped off before
writing the external file. I.e. Only the base filename is
used.
o Only one

---

 after the H1 subject in messages will appear
if no message header fields are printed.
o Added recognition of the following content-types in
mhexternal.pl:
application/mac-binhex40
o Added a extras/ directory containing useful programs for
MHonArc. See README in the directory for information on
the programs contained in there.
o To support -rmm, MIME filters now return an array. The
first array value is the HTML for the message, and any other
array values are filenames of files generated by the
filter. This allows MHonArc to know of any extra files that
must be deleted when a message is removed.
o Some routines from the main mhonarc source file have been
moved into a separate librarys: readmail.pl, mhdb.pl,
mhutil.pl
o The default URL to the documentation is now,
http://www.oac.uci.edu/indiv/ehood/mhonarc.html
The old URL,
http://www.oac.uci.edu/indiv/ehood/mhonarc.doc.html
is still valid.
o There's probably other stuff, but I cannot remember.
=======================================================================
1994/10/01 (1.0.0)
o First release -- See RELNOTES about compatibility issues
with mail2html.
