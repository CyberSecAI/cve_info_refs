The provided content is related to CVE-2002-0357.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `/usr/etc/rpc.passwd` binary, which is part of the `nfs.sw.nis` subsystem on SGI IRIX 6.5. The specific nature of the vulnerability is not detailed, but it is acknowledged that it could allow a user to compromise root access.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary weakness is within the `rpc.passwd` binary, which is part of the Network Information Service (NIS) functionality.  The vulnerability is present if the `nfs.sw.nis` subsystem is installed, and the system is configured as a YP master (with `rpc.passwd` running).

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to an intruder gaining complete root access to the affected system.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is related to the `rpc.passwd` program, which is used in the NIS system. While the specific attack vector is not detailed, it is implied that a user (likely on the local network) could leverage the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would need to have a user account on a vulnerable system and the system would need to be configured as a NIS master with the `nfs.sw.nis` subsystem installed.

The content provides more detail than the CVE description by specifying the affected software (`rpc.passwd` binary on SGI IRIX 6.5 systems with `nfs.sw.nis`), the conditions under which it is vulnerable (system is a YP master), and the impact of the vulnerability (full root access). It also provides a workaround (disabling rpc.passwd) and recommends applying patches or upgrading to IRIX 6.5.16.
