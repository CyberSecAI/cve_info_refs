Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- During the installation of Microsoft SQL Server 7 and 2000 (including MSDE 1.0) and their service packs, the installation process creates setup files (specifically `setup.iss`) and log files that are not properly removed after installation.
- These files can contain sensitive information such as:
    - SQL Server administrator password (sa account) if Mixed Mode authentication is used.
    - Windows user account and password if the SQL Server service is set to run under a specific Windows account.
- Passwords are either stored in clear text (SQL Server 7.0 prior to SP4) or weakly encrypted (SQL Server 7.0 SP4 and later, and all SQL Server 2000 versions)

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Insecure Storage of Credentials:** Passwords are stored in files (setup.iss, sqlstp.log, sqlspX.log, remsetup.ini) in clear text or using weak encryption.
- **Inadequate File Permissions:** The `setup.iss` file created by SQL Server 7.0 and MSDE 1.0 is stored with "Full Control" permissions for the "Everyone" group in the `%windir%` directory. Log files are also typically stored in world-readable directories, such as %windir%\temp. While the `setup.iss` file created by SQL Server 2000 is stored in a directory that is only accessible by administrators and the user installing SQL Server, the other files do not have these protections
- **Failure to Remove Temporary Files:** The installation files are not automatically removed after the installation process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Elevation of Privilege:** An attacker who gains access to the setup files can potentially:
    - Decrypt or obtain clear text passwords for the SQL Server "sa" account, gaining complete control over SQL Server.
    - Obtain Windows user account credentials used to run SQL Server services, potentially gaining access to the system with those privileges.
    - Gain unauthorized access to the SQL Server and potentially other resources on the network if the compromised account has further privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** An attacker must be able to interactively log on to the affected server to access the files. Note, however that one of the files is stored in a world readable location.
- **File System Access:** The attacker needs to have access to the file system where the setup and log files are stored.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Interactive Login:** The attacker needs the ability to log in to the system interactively (e.g., via the console).
- **File Access:** The attacker needs the ability to read the `setup.iss` file and/or the log files.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects SQL Server 7.0, MSDE 1.0, and SQL Server 2000. MSDE 2000 is not affected because it uses a different installer that does not create the vulnerable files.
- Passwords in the setup files are snapshots from installation time; if passwords have been changed, the files do not contain the current passwords.
