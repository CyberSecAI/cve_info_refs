## History

The CERT Division is the birthplace of cybersecurity. For nearly 30 years, the CERT Division of the SEI has partnered with government, industry, law enforcement, and academia to advance cybersecurity and improve the security and resilience of computer systems and networks.

Originally focused on incident response, we have expanded into cybersecurity areas such as network situational awareness, malicious code analysis, secure coding, resilience management, insider threats, digital investigations and intelligence, workforce development, DevOps, forensics, software assurance, vulnerability discovery and analysis, and risk management.

## Former Director Richard Pethia

[Richard Pethia](/about/leadership/display.cfm?customel_datapageid_2623=3545) was founding director of the SEI's CERT Division. Pethia, who served as director of CERT from 1988 to 2016, guided the organization through tremendous growth and change. Under Pethia's leadership, the unit expanded and evolved from the CERT Coordination Center—a small group focused on computer incident response—to a research organization of more than 200 professionals dedicated to solving problems with widespread cybersecurity implications.

## Sun Solaris cachefsd vulnerable to heap overflow in cfsd\_calloc() function via long string of characters

#### Vulnerability Note VU#635811

Original Release Date: 2002-05-06 | Last Revised: 2002-05-14

---

### Overview

Sun's NFS/RPC cachefs daemon (cachefsd) is shipped and installed by default with Sun Solaris 2.5.1, 2.6, 7, and 8 (SPARC and Intel architectures). Cachefsd caches requests for operations on remote file systems mounted via the use of NFS protocol. A remotely exploitable heap overflow exists in cachefsd that could permit a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the cachefsd, typically root.

### Description

| A remotely exploitable heap overflow exists in the cachefsd program shipped and installed by default with Sun Solaris 2.5.1, 2.6, 7, and 8 (SPARC and Intel architectures). A remote attacker can send a crafted RPC request to the cachefsd program to remotely exploit the vulnerability.  Logs of exploitation attempts may resemble the following:May 16 22:46:08 victim-host inetd[600]: /usr/lib/fs/cachefs/cachefsd: Segmentation Fault - core dumpedMay 16 22:46:21 victim-host last message repeated 7 timesMay 16 22:46:22 victim-host inetd[600]: /usr/lib/fs/cachefs/cachefsd: Bus Error - core dumpedMay 16 22:46:24 victim-host inetd[600]: /usr/lib/fs/cachefs/cachefsd: Segmentation Fault - core dumpedMay 16 22:46:56 victim-host inetd[600]: /usr/lib/fs/cachefs/cachefsd: Bus Error - core dumpedMay 16 22:46:59 victim-host last message repeated 1 timeMay 16 22:47:02 victim-host inetd[600]: /usr/lib/fs/cachefs/cachefsd: Segmentation Fault - core dumpedMay 16 22:47:07 victim-host last message repeated 3 timesMay 16 22:47:09 victim-host inetd[600]: /usr/lib/fs/cachefs/cachefsd: HangupMay 16 22:47:11 victim-host inetd[600]: /usr/lib/fs/cachefs/cachefsd: Segmentation Fault - core dumpedSun Microsystems has released a [Sun Alert Notification](http://sunsolve.Sun.COM/pub-cgi/retrieve.pl?doc=fsalert%2F44309) which addresses this issue as well as the issue described in [VU#161931](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/161931).According to the [Sun Alert Notification](http://sunsolve.Sun.COM/pub-cgi/retrieve.pl?doc=fsalert%2F44309), failed attempts to exploit this vulnerability will leave core dumps in the root directory. The presence of the core file does not preclude the success of subsequent attacks. Additionally, if the file /etc/cachefstab exists, it may contain unusual entries.This issue is also being referenced as [CAN-2002-0033](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2002-0033):   <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2002-0033> |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker can execute code with the privileges of the cachefsd process, typically root. |
| --- |

### Solution

| The CERT/CC is currently unaware of patches for this problem. |
| --- |

| According to a [Sun Alert Notification](http://sunsolve.Sun.COM/pub-cgi/retrieve.pl?doc=fsalert%2F44309) a workaround is as follows:  *Comment out cachefsd in /etc/inetd.conf as shown below:*  *#100235/1 tli rpc/tcp wait root /usr/lib/fs/cachefs/cachefsd cachefsd*  *Once the line is commented out either:*  *- reboot, or* *- send a HUP signal to inetd(1M) and kill existing cachefsd processes, for example,* *on Solaris 2.5.1 and 2.6 do the following:* *$ kill -HUP <PID of inetd>* *$ kill <PIDs of any cachefsd processes>* *Solaris 7 and 8 do the following:* *$ pkill -HUP inetd* *$ pkill cachefsd*  *The possible side effects of the workaround are:*  *- for systems not using cachefs:* *There is no impact.* *- for systems using cachefs:* *Only a "disconnected" operation is known to be affected by*  *disabling cachefsd. This feature is rarely used outside of AutoClient.* *Mounts and unmounts should still succeed though an error message*  *may be seen, "mount -F cachefs: cachefsd is not running".* *There is no performance impact.* *- for systems using AutoClient:* *The impact is unknown. Again, only "disconnected" mode is likely*  *to be affected.* |
