Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from how Mozilla handles `javascript:` URLs when setting and reading cookies. The browser incorrectly extracts the host and path from these URLs, leading to improper cookie domain and path assignments. Specifically, the browser was parsing the "host" from the javascript URL (everything between the colon and the first /), which is wrong. The correct behavior is to use the principal of the page the javascript: URL originated from (the attacker's site).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Incorrect URL Parsing:** The browser's URL parsing logic for `javascript:` URLs was flawed, allowing an attacker to specify arbitrary host and path values for cookies.
2.  **Inadequate Principal Handling:** The browser failed to correctly associate the cookie with the originating page's principal when dealing with javascript URLs, particularly after using `location.reload()` or `history.back()`.
3. **Lack of Protocol Whitelisting:** The cookie handling code did not restrict or validate the URL protocols allowed to set cookies, allowing the use of `javascript:` URLs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cookie Stealing:** An attacker can read cookies from other domains by crafting a malicious `javascript:` URL, allowing them to potentially steal session identifiers and other sensitive information.
*   **Cookie Spoofing:**  An attacker can set arbitrary cookies for other domains, potentially leading to account hijacking, information manipulation, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Javascript URLs:** The primary attack vector is the use of crafted `javascript:` URLs opened in a new frame, iframe, or window.
*   **`location.reload()` and `history.back()`:**  The vulnerability can be triggered by using `location.reload()` or `history.back()` on a page loaded with a `javascript:` URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Website/Code control:** An attacker needs to be able to inject malicious HTML/JavaScript code into a website or get a victim to open a malicious HTML page.
*   **JavaScript Execution:** The attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
*  **Victim Interaction:** The victim needs to interact with the malicious link, which could be through clicking on the link or visiting the malicious page.

**Additional Details (from the provided text):**

*   The vulnerability was initially discovered in Mozilla 1.0, and the fix was included in Mozilla 1.1 Beta.
*   The vulnerability could be exploited using tricks such as `javascript:function f(){com=1} google=new f();location='javascript:google.com/1;setTimeout("alert(document.cookie);close()",2000);""'` or `javascript://www.google.com/\n'<body>'onload=alert(document.cookie)>'`, where `www.google.com` is a spoofed host.
*   The fix involved changes to how Mozilla handles document principals and how cookies are set, using nsIURIs to extract host and port.
*   There was a discussion about whether to use a faster but potentially risky fix (using `nsIURI`) vs. a safer but slower fix (additional checks in the cookie code), with the safer fix being recommended for the branch and the faster one for the trunk.
