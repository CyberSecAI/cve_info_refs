The provided content is related to CVE-2002-2224.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Multiple vulnerabilities exist in various vendors' Internet Key Exchange (IKE) implementations due to improper handling of exceptional IKE response packets.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Buffer overflows triggered by overly large Security Parameter Index (SPI) values in response packets.
- Buffer overflows caused by a large number of payloads or oversized payloads in response packets.
- Denial-of-service (DoS) conditions caused by response packets with zero-length payloads, which consume excessive CPU resources.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution with the privileges of the IKE service.
- Denial of service (DoS).

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending manipulated IKE response packets to a vulnerable IKE implementation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must act as an IKE responder, requiring:
    - Control over the IKE responder
    - Ability to spoof IKE response packets
    - Ability to redirect the IKE initiator to a responder controlled by the attacker

**Additional details:**
- Vulnerabilities were found in IPSec-based VPN client software operating in Aggressive Mode during a phase 1 IKE exchange. Other software and exchange types might also be affected.
- Specific products known to be affected include: Cisco VPN Client 3.5, PGPFreeware 7.03, SafeNet VPN client software, NetScreen products, OpenBSD isakmpd, and SonicWALL firmware.
