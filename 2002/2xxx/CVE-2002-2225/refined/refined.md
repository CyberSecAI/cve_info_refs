The provided content is related to CVE-2002-2225.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the improper handling of IKE response packets by multiple vendors' IKE implementations. Specifically, the vulnerabilities stem from:
  - Overly large SPI payload values
  - IKE response packets with a large number of payloads or overly large payload
  - IKE response packet with a payload length of zero

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Buffer overflows
- Denial-of-service conditions

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the IKE service
- Denial of service

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending crafted IKE responses to a vulnerable IKE implementation.
- The attacker must act as an IKE responder. This means that either the attacker has control over the IKE responder or has the ability to spoof IKE response packets, or redirect the IKE initiator to a responder controlled by the attacker.
- The vulnerabilities have been shown to exist in IPSec-based VPN client software operating in Aggressive Mode during a phase 1 IKE exchange.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to act as an IKE responder
- Ability to send solicited IKE responses
- Ability to spoof IKE response packets or redirect the IKE initiator to a responder controlled by the attacker
