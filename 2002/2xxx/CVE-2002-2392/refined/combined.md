# WINAMP also allows execution of arbitrary code (probably a lot more programs aswell)

```
It would seem that I opened up a can of worms when i created my icq +
msie advisory the other day
Wich presented a new way to execute arbitrary code on a users machine
winamp is equally vulnerable

Winamps starts skin files with the extention wsz and the mime type
interface/x-winamp-skin automaticly
and saves it in a know location on the users harddisk namely :

C:\Program Files\Winamp\Skins

example at :

<http://kuperus.xs4all.nl/winamp.htm>

tested on version 2.80 of winamp, but other versions are likely to be
affected aswell

I believe a great number of programs to be vulnerable to this exploit
and would currently recommend
going through the filetypes (open windows explorer not internet explorer
, then goto tools > folder options > file types and disable ALL
extentions that have their default action set to open. I really can't
tell how many programs are affected but there seem to be quite a few.

This is really quite a severe vulnerability as basicly anyone with basic
computer knowlage can exploit this
