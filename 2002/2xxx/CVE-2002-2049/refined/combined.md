| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=38716#c0)  dominic\_marks    2002-05-30 00:40:02 UTC  ``` 	The previous checksum for the tarball should be changed, monkey.org 	was cracked and the fragroute application backdoored (in the same 	was as irssi). To avoid wrongly identifying the current (corrected) 	tarball as incorrect this patch is required. I have communicated to 	the author (Dug Song) myself and confirmed the md5 in this diff is 	valid. I have also bumped the PORTREVISION.  	Anyone who installed this port should conduct an IMMEDIATE security 	audit of their systems. I imagine this includes the port build 	cluster.  How-To-Repeat: 	NA. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=38716#c1)  dominic\_marks    2002-05-30 00:58:47 UTC  ``` Hi,   <http://www.irssi.org/?page=backdoor>  Describes the compromise, it only affects machines on which the configure script is executed. The binary itself is unmodified.  Thanks! --  Dominic ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=38716#c2)  Ying-Chieh Liao   freebsd_committer freebsd_triage  2002-05-30 06:53:10 UTC  ``` State Changed From-To: open->feedback  could you please submit a diff about the old src against the new one ?  I dont know where to get the old tarball ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=38716#c3)  Jacques Vidrine   freebsd_committer freebsd_triage  2002-05-30 17:22:25 UTC  ``` Responsible Changed From-To: freebsd-ports->security-officer  At Cy's suggestion, change responsibility to make it blatant that  care is needed. ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=38716#c4)  Jacques Vidrine   freebsd_committer freebsd_triage  2002-05-30 20:37:37 UTC  ``` State Changed From-To: feedback->closed  The new distfile has been verified to NOT contain the  trojan, and the port has been updated appropriately.  Thank you very much! ``` |  |
