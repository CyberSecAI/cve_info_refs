```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The Snoopy library before version 2.0.0 had an injection vulnerability in its handling of exec cURL calls. Specifically, the library failed to properly sanitize URLs before passing them to the cURL command.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Command injection due to insufficient sanitization of URL inputs.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker could inject arbitrary commands into the cURL execution, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.
- Attack vectors: Injecting malicious commands into a URL that is processed by the vulnerable Snoopy library. Example: <https://example.com>;id or <https://example.com/foo.html;id>
- Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to be able to control or influence the URL passed to the Snoopy library's cURL execution.
