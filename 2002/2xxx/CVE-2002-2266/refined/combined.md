Title: NetScreen Security Alert 52020

Date: 25 November 2002

Description: Potential H.323 Denial of Service

Impact: Complete Denial of Service

Affected Products: All firewall/VPN appliances and systems

Affected Software Releases: ScreenOS 2.8, 3.0, 3.1, 4.0

Summary:

A vulnerability has been reported and confirmed regarding the processing of H.323 \
control sessions that can lead to the consumption of all firewall session table \
entries, resulting in denial of service to the protected network resources.

This vulnerability only exists in ScreenOS versions 2.8 and later.

Half-open sessions were not reclaimed at normal garbage collection intervals, but \
persisted in the session table until the defined H.323 session timeout interval, \
typically 36 hours.

This vulnerability only affects configurations which explicitly permit the forwarding \
of traffic identified using the predefined services named H.323 or Netmeeting. The \
attack must match the permitted traffic flow, constraining the attacker to security \
zones permitted to initiate H.323 traffic. Since the source IP can easily be spoofed, \
matching the exact attacker within the permitted security zone can be difficult to \
impossible.

Recommended Actions:

Any or all of

(1) Install one of the maintenance releases indicated below.

(2) Upgrade to ScreenOS 4.0.1

(3) Block H.323 traffic. If this is not feasible, carefully re-examine your defined \
security policies using H.323 to minimize exposure to unanticipated sessions.

(4) Adjust the H.323 session timeout to the lowest feasible value for your \
environment and tolerances.
