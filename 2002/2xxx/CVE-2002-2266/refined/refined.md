- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper handling of H.323 control sessions leading to a consumption of firewall session table entries. Half-open H.323 sessions were not reclaimed at normal garbage collection intervals, persisting until the H.323 session timeout (typically 36 hours).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insufficient garbage collection of half-open H.323 sessions leading to resource exhaustion.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Complete denial of service due to the exhaustion of the firewall's session table. This prevents legitimate traffic from passing through the firewall.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker must initiate H.323 traffic that matches the permitted traffic flow defined in the firewall's security policies. This constrains the attacker to security zones allowed to initiate H.323 traffic. The source IP can be easily spoofed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to send H.323 traffic from a zone permitted by the firewall's rules, however spoofing the source IP address is possible.
