The provided content is a security advisory detailing a buffer overflow vulnerability in BannerWheel v1.0.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the C source code of the CGI package, specifically in `badmin.c`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in `badmin.c`. This allows an attacker to overwrite memory by providing overly long input, leading to a segmentation fault and potentially arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Exploitation of the vulnerability could lead to a segmentation fault, meaning that the program crashes.
- More critically, the attacker could potentially achieve arbitrary code execution by overwriting return addresses on the stack using the buffer overflow.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when the `badmin.cgi` executable is called and provided with over-long input to the "rcmd" parameter.
- The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, as the program is accessible via CGI.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to call the `badmin.cgi` program. This likely requires access to the web server hosting the vulnerable script.
- The attacker needs the ability to provide the CGI program input with an over-long string, specifically for the "rcmd" parameter.
