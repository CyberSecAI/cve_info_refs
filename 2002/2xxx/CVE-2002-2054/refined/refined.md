Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Affected Products:** Tracking Online 1.0 and Teekai's forum full 1.2 (both by Teekai).
*   **Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Both Products):** The products store sensitive information (like IP addresses) in an encoded/encrypted form.  A provided PHP script demonstrates how to decode these IP addresses, revealing the original IPs. Also, log files such as `/data/member_log.txt` and `/data/userlog/log.txt` are accessible.
    *   **Teekai's Forum Specific:**
        *   **Admin Access:** By setting specific cookies (`valid_level=admin` and `valid_username_online=[VALUE e.g. JScript ]`), an attacker can gain administrative access.
    *   **Tracking Online Specific:**
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** A XSS vulnerability exists.
*   **Root Cause:**
    *   **Weak Encryption/Encoding:** The IP addresses are not properly secured, allowing easy decoding using a simple PHP script.
    *   **Insecure Cookie Handling:** The forum relies on easily manipulated cookies for authentication and authorization.
    *   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The XSS vulnerability in Tracking Online is caused by a lack of proper input sanitization, allowing for injection of malicious scripts.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Direct Access:** Attackers can directly access log files and decode information using the provided PHP script.
    *   **Cookie Manipulation:** Attackers can set specific cookies to gain administrative privileges within the forum.
    *   **XSS via User Input:** Attackers can inject XSS payloads into the Tracking Online application.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can gain access to sensitive data, including user IPs and potentially other personal information.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers can obtain administrative access to the forum.
    *   **XSS Attacks:** Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of other users' browsers.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Basic understanding of web technologies (PHP, cookies, HTML, JavaScript).
    *   Ability to send HTTP requests and potentially manipulate cookies.
    *   For XSS, the ability to provide malicious input to the application.

**Additional Details:**

*   The message also mentions a separate XSS vulnerability in Netscape's mail service, ncmail.netscape.com. This allows injection of HTML within email subjects, leading to potential cookie theft. This is unrelated to the Teekai software issues.
*   The author indicates that vendors were informed but did not fix the problems.
