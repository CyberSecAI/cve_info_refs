Why do you need **data wiping**? If not thoroughly cleaned, residual data known as [Data Remanence](/blog/what-data-remanence-how-remove-it-5-easy-steps), continues to exist after common activities, such as ‘deleting’ or moving a file.

Standard file deletion only removes references to files while the contents remain intact on your hard drive in various places like free space and file slack. Confidential files you intended to erase could easily be restored with widely available undelete tools.

Wiping is a term used to describe the process of shredding contents of a file or disk space beyond recovery. Routine use of wiping tools can remove the pain of Data Remanence and truly protect your sensitive data from unwanted eyes.

Keep your data safe and out of the wrong hands… [Contact us](/about-us/contact-us) to get started today!

## How to Permanently Delete Files with BCWipe

BCWipe by Jetico is the most powerful and trusted data wiping utility, engineered for a wide range of users: from experts at large organizations handling national security to people at home concerned with personal privacy.

Wiping solutions from Jetico securely erase all traces of unwanted data beyond recovery.

Use [BCWipe](/data-wiping/wipe-files-bcwipe) to wipe files selectively on active systems, such as for cleaning up [data spills](/blog/data-spill-security-violation-response-guide-secure-data-handling).

 [![Data wiping with BCWipe](/sites/default/files/styles/1x_small_embed_image_half/public/2018-01/BCWipe-Blue.png?itok=aq6G9ABJ)](/data-wiping/wipe-files-bcwipe)

Selective wiping with BCWipe surgically removes unwanted files while still preserving your operating system and other data you want to keep. Residual data, known as Data Remanence, continues to exist after common activities, such as ‘delete’ a file. Be forensically clean with BCWipe.

Use [BCWipe – Enterprise](/data-wiping/wipe-files-bcwipe/jetico-central-manager) for central management of wiping activities and tracking of [key cybersecurity metrics](/blog/cybersecurity-kpi-dashboards-ultimate-guide-monitoring-security-performance). The [remote data wipe feature](/news/remote-data-wipe-feature-jeticos-bcwipe-boosts-security-work-home) allows admins to run wiping tasks using a simple web browser - all without end-user intervention.

Use [BCWipe Total WipeOut](/data-wiping/wipe-hard-drives-bcwipe-total-wipeout) to erase entire hard drives before disposal, decommission or repurpose.

 [![Wipe hard drives with BCWipe Total WipeOut](/sites/default/files/styles/1x_small_embed_image_half/public/2018-01/BCWipe%20Total%20WipeOut-Blue.png?itok=JW0wBKqH)](/data-wiping/wipe-hard-drives-bcwipe-total-wipeout)

Run from a bootable disk (CD/DVD or [USB](/blog/usb-external-eraser-how-securely-wipe-data-computers-drives)), BCWipe Total WipeOut completely wipes out all hard drive data – including boot records, filesystem structures, operating system files and service areas like Host Protected Area (HPA) and Device Configuration Overlay (DCO).

[BCWipe Total WipeOut – Enterprise](/data-wiping/wipe-hard-drives-bcwipe-total-wipeout/enterprise-edition) includes remote wiping and ability to wipe unlimited hard drives. Jetico's solution can generate tamper-proof [Certificates of Erasure (CoE)](/blog/certificate-destruction-hard-drive-what-it-how-obtain-one) for compliance and auditing purposes.

## Wiping Schemes

BCWipe complies with U.S. Department of Defense ([DoD 5220.22-M](/blog/dod-522022-m-explained-data-erasure-standards)) standard, U.S. Department of Energy (DoE M 205.1-2) standard and a set of other standard wiping schemes. You can also create and use your own customized wiping scheme to securely erase sensitive information from storage devices. Learn more about [data erasure standards](/blog/data-erasure-software-uses-standards-are-called-wiping-schemes-what-they-are-how-use-them) or review all [schemes supported by BCWipe](/serve/bcwipe-wiping-schemes-jetico-support).
