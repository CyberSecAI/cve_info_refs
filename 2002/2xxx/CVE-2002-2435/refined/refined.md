{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `:visited` CSS pseudo-class allows websites to query a user's browsing history. This is achieved by using `:visited` styles to apply different styling (e.g., colors, layout modifications) based on whether a link has been visited or not, which can reveal if a user has visited a particular URL.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Privacy leak. The ability to query a user's browsing history without consent violates user privacy. The `:visited` style can be exploited using different techniques including:\n    -   `GetComputedStyle` to obtain styling information of visited links.\n    -   Generated content or `display:none` to cause server hits for visited URLs.\n    -   Modifying layout of other elements to determine visited state.\n    -   Client-side timing tests to infer link state.\n    -   Image loading to detect visited links.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can gather information about a user's browsing history, including visits to specific URLs. This information can be used for targeted snooping, such as phishing attacks or identifying if a user has visited competitor's sites. This can lead to potential loss of privacy and could be used for social engineering attacks.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited by a malicious website using CSS `:visited` styles and JavaScript, possibly combined with other techniques to test for the visited status of certain links.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have the ability to load a malicious webpage in the victim's browser. No specific position or other capabilities required."
