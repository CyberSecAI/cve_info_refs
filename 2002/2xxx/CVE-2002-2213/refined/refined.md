{
  "vulnerability_information": {
    "root_cause": "Vulnerable DNS service implementations generate multiple simultaneous queries for the same resource record (RR). This allows an attacker to perform a 'birthday attack', significantly increasing the probability of successful DNS spoofing.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The vulnerability lies in how some DNS implementations handle multiple requests for the same RR, leading to multiple outstanding queries.",
      "Insufficient randomness or predictability of transaction IDs (TIDs) and UDP source ports used in DNS queries"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation leads to DNS cache poisoning, allowing an attacker to redirect users to malicious websites by spoofing DNS responses.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack is performed remotely by sending multiple legitimate queries to a vulnerable DNS resolver for the same RR, inducing it to generate multiple open queries. The attacker then sends spoofed responses to the resolver.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send UDP packets to the target DNS resolver. They do not need to sniff network traffic between the resolver and legitimate DNS servers. The attacker's position can be anywhere on the network with a route to the target DNS server."
