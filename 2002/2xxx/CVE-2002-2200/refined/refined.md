```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The dobermann FORUM software includes files using a variable that can be controlled by a user, without proper sanitization. Specifically, the `$subpath` variable is directly included in the `include` statement, which allows remote file inclusion.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Unsanitized user input: The `$subpath` variable in `entete.php`, `enteteacceuil.php`, and `topic/entete.php` is taken from user-supplied input without sanitization.
- Remote File Inclusion (RFI): The `@include $subpath."banniere.php";` statement allows an attacker to include a remote file.

Impact of exploitation:
An attacker can inject arbitrary PHP code by including a malicious file from a remote server, leading to potential remote code execution on the server.

Attack vectors:
The vulnerability is exploitable through HTTP GET requests by manipulating the `subpath` parameter in vulnerable PHP files.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker needs to have a web server to host the malicious PHP file. They must be able to send HTTP requests to the target server where the vulnerable dobermann FORUM is installed.
