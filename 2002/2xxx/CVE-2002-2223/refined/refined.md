{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The root cause lies in the improper handling of IKE response packets by various vendor implementations of the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocol.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Buffer overflows due to overly large SPI payload values in IKE response packets.",
    "Buffer overflows caused by a large number of payloads or an overly large payload in IKE response packets.",
    "Denial-of-service (DoS) condition triggered by IKE response packets with a payload length of zero, leading to excessive CPU resource consumption."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the IKE service or cause a denial of service on the affected system.",
  "Attack vectors": "Attackers need to be able to send crafted IKE response packets.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attackers must be able to act as an IKE responder, requiring control over the responder, the ability to spoof IKE response packets, or the ability to redirect the IKE initiator to a responder under their control."
