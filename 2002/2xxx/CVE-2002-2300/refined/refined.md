Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the FTP server running on the 3Com NBX IP phone system, which uses the VxWorks embedded real-time operating system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** Sending a long string (2048 bytes) via the `CEL` command to the FTP server triggers a buffer overflow. The FTP server is vulnerable to a boundary condition error.
- The FTP server is an internal one, and is used for debugging and diagnostics.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploiting this vulnerability crashes the FTP server.
- **System Instability:** The crash also disables the integrated web-based administrative console and the call manager. This prevents diagnostics, control, and all incoming/outgoing/internal calls.
- **Call Disruption:** Active calls cannot be disconnected.
- **Potential Financial Impact:** Long distance calls in progress cannot be terminated, potentially resulting in excessive long-distance bills.
- **Extended Outage:** System recovery requires a hard reboot (power off/on). Abrupt power off could result in loss or corruption of voice mail data and logs.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted FTP command over the network. This can be done via:
    - Netcat.
    - A Windows client using telnet on port 21.
    - Running the `vxworks_ftpd.nasl` Nessus test.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs network access to the 3Com NBX system on port 21 (FTP). This could be:
    - External access if the call manager is exposed on the internet or in a DMZ.
    - Internal access for an attacker on the internal network.
- **Basic FTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know how to send the `CEL` command with a long string to the FTP server.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability is present in 3Com NBX firmware versions 4_0_17 (ftpd version 5.4), 4_1_4 (ftpd version 5.4.2) and 4_1_21 (ftpd version 5.4.2).
- A field patch (TSR(296292)) from WindRiver addresses the problem.
- There is no way to disable the built in FTP server or to use access controls.
- Placing the 3Com NBX behind a firewall and limiting FTP access is recommended as a workaround.
- The vulnerability is similar to an AIX ftpd vulnerability reported in CVE-1999-0789.
-  Bugtraq ID is 6297
-  CERT VU# is 317417
