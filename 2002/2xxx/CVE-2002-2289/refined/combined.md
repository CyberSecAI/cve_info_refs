BadBlue is a P2P/Web server offered for Microsoft Windows operating systems
by Working Resources. It has a bad security record -- file disclosure,
remote administration, denials of service, buffer overflows, directory
traversals, and more cross-site scripting flaws than I care to count. We
can add information disclosure to that list, and add a new XSS hole to the
count.
\* soinfo.php - Massive Information Leak
If running with PHP enabled, the BadBlue server's default soinfo.php script
can be made to cough up substantial amounts of information, including ODBC
passwords:
-- soinfo.php --
<?php
phpinfo();
?>
-- soinfo.php --
Yielding this data to an attacker, in combination with access to the
database allows for a compromise of the database.
\* Cross-Site Scripting in ext.dll Search Page -- Again
I've discovered another flaw in BadBlue's search engine allowing for
cross-site scripting:
');alert(document.cookie);//
')" style="left:expression(eval('alert(document.cookie)'))">
Either of these two queries will execute the alert(document.cookie) command.
You get the idea. :-)
