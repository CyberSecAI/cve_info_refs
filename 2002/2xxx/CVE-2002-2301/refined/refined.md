This content is related to the specified CVE.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
Lawson Financials stores database credentials in world-readable files or relies on operating system authentication with insufficient access controls. This allows unauthorized access to the database.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure storage of database credentials:** In one configuration, database usernames and passwords are stored in a world-readable text file.
- **Lack of granular access control:** All Lawson users are granted full DML (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) rights to all objects in the Lawson schema, regardless of their actual needs.
- **Insufficient auditing and logging:** Default configurations lack proper database auditing and logging, making it difficult to track malicious activities.
- **Reliance on single-user database accounts:** Some setups use a single database account, making it difficult to identify which user is making changes and undermining accountability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breaches:** Attackers with access to database credentials can read, alter, or destroy sensitive financial data.
- **Unauthorized modifications:** Attackers can modify financial data, leading to fraud or data corruption.
- **Database compromise:** Full DML rights mean an attacker can fully compromise the database.
- **Lack of accountability:** Single database accounts and inadequate logging/auditing make it challenging to track or identify malicious actors.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File system access:** Attackers who gain shell access to the Lawson server can read the world-readable credential files.
- **Database connectors:** Users with database credentials can connect using standard connectors like ODBC or JDBC to exploit the database.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Shell access:** An attacker needs shell access to the Lawson server to access the credential file if setup #1 is used.
- **User account:** An attacker needs a valid user account with Lawson privileges.
- **Network access:** To connect to the database server via connectors like JDBC or ODBC the attacker needs network access to the database server.
