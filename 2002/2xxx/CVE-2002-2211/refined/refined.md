  "vulnerability_information": {
    "overview": "Various implementations of DNS services may allow multiple simultaneous queries for the same resource record, allowing an attacker to apply probabilistic techniques to improve their odds of successful DNS spoofing.",
    "description": "Some implementations of DNS services contain a vulnerability whereby multiple requests for the same resource record (RR) will generate multiple outstanding queries for that RR. As a result, it is possible for an attacker to apply a 'birthday attack' technique to dramatically improve the probability of a successful DNS spoofing attack. When performed against a caching nameserver, this can result in cache poisoning; however, similar techniques could be applied to some stub resolvers as well. The only distinction between this attack and the traditional brute-force approach (1 query with multiple spoofed replies) is the generation of multiple simultaneous queries. The attacker need not sniff any packets between the victim resolver and the legitimate nameservers for the RR being spoofed. An attacker's success against any particular resolver instance will be probabilistic in nature, with a persistent attacker always being able to achieve a reasonable probability of success given enough attempts. By rapidly generating multiple queries for an RR to a vulnerable resolver, the attacker can induce a condition whereby the vulnerable resolver has multiple open queries for that RR. The attacker then sends a number of spoofed responses to the vulnerable resolver. Given the right combination of open queries and spoofed responses, the attacker can achieve a high probability of success with far fewer packets (by several orders of magnitude) than the traditional brute-force approach would require.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from how DNS resolvers handle multiple requests for the same resource record (RR), leading to multiple outstanding queries. This behavior allows attackers to exploit the 'birthday paradox' to increase the probability of successful DNS spoofing.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Generation of multiple outstanding queries for the same resource record.",
      "Susceptibility to birthday attack techniques."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to remotely spoof DNS responses, which may lead to DNS cache poisoning.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote attack via sending multiple DNS queries to vulnerable resolvers.",
      "Sending spoofed responses to the resolver."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send DNS queries and spoofed responses to the target DNS server. No packet sniffing is required.",
    "additional_details": "The number of packets required for a successful attack is significantly reduced by inducing the resolver to generate multiple queries for the same RR, versus the traditional brute-force method. The success probability depends on the number of open queries and the predictability of transaction IDs and UDP ports. The attack is particularly effective against caching nameservers providing recursive services.",
