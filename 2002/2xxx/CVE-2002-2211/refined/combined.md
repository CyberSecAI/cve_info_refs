## Various DNS service implementations generate multiple simultaneous queries for the same resource record

#### Vulnerability Note VU#457875

Original Release Date: 2002-11-19 | Last Revised: 2004-10-18

---

### Overview

Various implementations of DNS services may allow multiple simultaneous queries for the same resource record, allowing an attacker to apply probabilistic techniques to improve their odds of successful DNS spoofing.

### Description

| Some implementations of DNS services contain a vulnerability whereby multiple requests for the same resource record (RR) will generate multiple outstanding queries for that RR. As a result, it is possible for an attacker to apply a '[birthday attack](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/BirthdayAttack.html)' technique to dramatically improve the probability of a successful DNS spoofing attack. When performed against a caching nameserver, this can result in cache poisoning; however, similar techniques could be applied to some stub resolvers as well.  The only distinction between this attack and the traditional brute-force approach (1 query with multiple spoofed replies) is the generation of multiple simultaneous queries. The attacker need not sniff any packets between the victim resolver and the legitimate nameservers for the RR being spoofed. An attacker's success against any particular resolver instance will be probabilistic in nature, with a persistent attacker always being able to achieve a reasonable probability of success given enough attempts. By rapidly generating multiple queries for an RR to a vulnerable resolver, the attacker can induce a condition whereby the vulnerable resolver has multiple open queries for that RR. The attacker then sends a number of spoofed responses to the vulnerable resolver. Given the right combination of open queries and spoofed responses, the attacker can achieve a high probability of success with far fewer packets (by several orders of magnitude) than the traditional brute-force approach would require.This attack is quite effective against caching nameservers that provide recursive services. Recent research by Gummadi, Saroiu, and Gribble [GUMMADI] indicates that a large proportion of nameservers are configured to provide recursive services to the Internet at large, thereby laying them open to this kind of attack.The specific number of packets required to exploit any particular DNS resolver vary by implementation, but the following table lists a few of the more common scenarios found in a number of implementations   | **If the attacker has to guess...** | **...and is limited to the following number of open requests...** | **...it will take the following number of packets to achieve a 50% success rate**(includes both requests and responses) | | --- | --- | --- | | TID only (16bits) | 1 | 32.7 k (215) | | TID only (16bits) | 4 | 10.4 k | | TID only (16bits) | 200 | 427 | | TID only (16bits) | unlimited | 426 | | TID and port (32 bits) | 1 | 2.1 billion (231) | | TID and port (32 bits) | 4 | 683 million | | TID and port (32 bits) | 200 | 15 million | | TID and port (32 bits) | unlimited | 109 k | *Table 1: Number of packets required to reach 50% success probability for various numbers of open queries*  As expected, the traditional brute-force case where the attacker tries to guess the transaction ID or TID/port pair based on a single open request requires the attacker to search half the search space (15 or 31 bits, respectively) to achieve a 50% probability of success. However, when the attacker is able to induce the resolver into generating multiple simultaneous requests, the total number of packets required falls off rapidly.There are, of course, more effective methods to achieve DNS spoofing in certain cases, including sniffing query packets directly or the predictable transaction ID issues discussed in [CA-1997-22](http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-1997-22.html) "BIND - the Berkeley Internet Name Daemon". Additionally, Michal Zalewski's paper "Strange Attractors and TCP/IP Sequence Number Analysis" [ZALEWSKI] describes a method for analyzing the predictability of transaction IDs which we believe could be extended to analyze Transaction ID / UDP port pairs as well. Zalewski's paper was also discussed in [CA-2001-09](http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2001-09.html) "Statistical Weaknesses in TCP/IP Initial Sequence Numbers".The 'birthday attack' method described here appears to be reasonably well known in the DNS developer community, but we have been unable to find significant public discussion of it and are thus documenting it here.**Further discussion of the probability calculations**Assume that the transaction IDs generated by the vulnerable resolver are unpredictable by the attacker (if they're not, then the attack is far simpler than what we describe here; see [CA-1997-22](http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-1997-22.html) for more). The attacker does not know what the transaction IDs are, but can control how many transaction IDs the vulnerable resolver has open for a particular query at a given time by generating a series of otherwise legitimate queries. (The total number of transaction IDs open on the vulnerable resolver does not factor into this -- only the transaction IDs resulting from the attacker's queries count.)Let *m* = the number of possible transaction ID / UDP port combinations *q* = the number of open queries initiated by the attacker*r* = the number of bogus replies generated by the attacker Note that if the UDP ports are predictable, *m* *= 2**16*. If they are not predictable, *m* *= 2**32*. Of course, if both the transaction IDs and UDP ports are predictable, *m* approaches *1*.The goal for the attacker, therefore, is to find the smallest possible sum of (*q + r*) with a maximum probability of success.The first bogus reply sent by the attacker will have a probability of success given by *P**1* *= q / m*The attacker does not need to care whether any particular reply was successful or not. The only thing the attacker has to keep track of is what IDs have been sent in the bogus replies so there will not be any duplicates. Thus, since the attacker knows what the ID was in the first reply and doesn't want to repeat IDs, he only has a pool of (*m - 1*) IDs to pick from on the second reply. Therefore, the second reply has a probability of success of*P**2* *= q / (m - 1)*Likewise, for each successive iteration, the number of possible IDs the attacker will pick from shrinks by 1. In the generic case,*P**n* *= q / (m - (n - 1))* Each *P**n* represents the probability of success in the *n*th iteration, independently of all previous iterations. We can therefore represent the probability of a miss in the *n*th iteration as Qn where*Q**n* *= 1 - P**n* *= 1 - (q / (m - (n - 1)))* The cumulative probability of having missed in all iterations up to and including the *n*th iteration is*CumulativeMiss**n* *= Q**1**\*Q**2**\*...\*Q**n* and therefore the cumulative probability of at least one success with *r* bogus replies is*CumulativeHit**r* *= 1 - CumulativeMiss**r* Thus we can calculate the probability of compromise given *q* queries and *r* replies. We do this by iteratively fixing *q* and incrementing *r* until we reach the desired *P**r*. To find the optimal combination of *q* and *r*, we repeat the process for a number of values of *q*. "Optimal" is defined as the minimum sum of (*q + r*).When one considers cases where *q > 1*, it quickly becomes evident that the attacker's advantage grows significantly with relatively small numbers of queries (*q << m*). For example, performing the calculations as described above for *m* *= 2**16*, the attacker's probability of success reaches the 50% mark with as few as (*q + r*) ~= 425 packets. **References:**[GUMMADI] Krishna P.

### Impact

| An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to remotely spoof DNS responses, which may lead to DNS cache poisoning. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Apply a patch from your vendor. |
| --- |

| Disable recursion on any nameserver responding to DNS requests made by untrusted systems. As mentioned in ["Securing an Internet Name Server"](http://www.cert.org/archive/pdf/dns.pdf): Disabling recursion puts your name servers into a passive mode, telling them never to send queries on behalf of other name servers or resolvers. A totally non-recursive name server is protected from cache poisoning, since it will only answer queries directed to it. It doesn't send queries, and hence doesn't cache any data. Disabling recursion can also prevent attackers from bouncing denial of services attacks off your name server by querying for external zones. Non-recursive nameservers should be much more resistant to exploitation of the server vulnerabilities listed above. |

### [Microsoft Corporation](#IAFY-5FDPYP) Affected

Notified:  October 29, 2002  Updated: November 19, 2002

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

The Microsoft DNS Server implementation closely follows the DNS standard. DNS is an insecure protocol and until such time as the protocol describes a method for securing queries, a determined attacker could poison the cache of a DNS Server. A number of precautions in the Microsoft DNS server make this style of attack more difficult, but not impossible. Microsoft is considering additional improvements to its DNS implementation in future versions of the Microsoft DNS sever to reduce the effectiveness of attacks like this.

### [Openwall GNU/\*/Linux](#IAFY-5FDPDU) Affected

Notified:  October 29, 2002  Updated: December 04, 2002

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

One of the features added with BIND 4.9.x-OW patches has always been the addition of unpredictable query IDs, thus making BIND 4 with these patches applied more resistant against the described attacks. The randomization of source port numbers is, however, currently left up to the operating system kernel (and thus doesn't occur on most systems). Future versions of the patches might add this functionality.

Similarly, the glibc resolver code on Openwall GNU/\*/Linux (Owl) has been modified to use unpredictable query IDs (including in the very first version of Owl available to the public), but doesn't explicitly randomize source port numbers.

### [adns](#IAFY-5FFP2W) Not Affected

Notified:  October 29, 2002  Updated: November 15, 2002

### Status

Not Affected

### Vendor Statement

adns is not vulnerable. It is a stub resolver library, not a full-service resolver, and does not forward queries.

If the communication between adns and nameserver can be faked up by the attacker, there can be situations where a similar attack might be made to work. These kind of problems are why the adns documentation tells you that you need to make sure that only packets really from your nameserver can arrive at adns with the nameserver's source address and port.

## Various DNS service implementations generate multiple simultaneous queries for the same resource record

#### Vulnerability Note VU#457875

Original Release Date: 2002-11-19 | Last Revised: 2004-10-18

---

### Overview

Various implementations of DNS services may allow multiple simultaneous queries for the same resource record, allowing an attacker to apply probabilistic techniques to improve their odds of successful DNS spoofing.

### Description

| Some implementations of DNS services contain a vulnerability whereby multiple requests for the same resource record (RR) will generate multiple outstanding queries for that RR. As a result, it is possible for an attacker to apply a '[birthday attack](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/BirthdayAttack.html)' technique to dramatically improve the probability of a successful DNS spoofing attack. When performed against a caching nameserver, this can result in cache poisoning; however, similar techniques could be applied to some stub resolvers as well.  The only distinction between this attack and the traditional brute-force approach (1 query with multiple spoofed replies) is the generation of multiple simultaneous queries. The attacker need not sniff any packets between the victim resolver and the legitimate nameservers for the RR being spoofed. An attacker's success against any particular resolver instance will be probabilistic in nature, with a persistent attacker always being able to achieve a reasonable probability of success given enough attempts. By rapidly generating multiple queries for an RR to a vulnerable resolver, the attacker can induce a condition whereby the vulnerable resolver has multiple open queries for that RR. The attacker then sends a number of spoofed responses to the vulnerable resolver. Given the right combination of open queries and spoofed responses, the attacker can achieve a high probability of success with far fewer packets (by several orders of magnitude) than the traditional brute-force approach would require.This attack is quite effective against caching nameservers that provide recursive services. Recent research by Gummadi, Saroiu, and Gribble [GUMMADI] indicates that a large proportion of nameservers are configured to provide recursive services to the Internet at large, thereby laying them open to this kind of attack.The specific number of packets required to exploit any particular DNS resolver vary by implementation, but the following table lists a few of the more common scenarios found in a number of implementations   | **If the attacker has to guess...** | **...and is limited to the following number of open requests...** | **...it will take the following number of packets to achieve a 50% success rate**(includes both requests and responses) | | --- | --- | --- | | TID only (16bits) | 1 | 32.7 k (215) | | TID only (16bits) | 4 | 10.4 k | | TID only (16bits) | 200 | 427 | | TID only (16bits) | unlimited | 426 | | TID and port (32 bits) | 1 | 2.1 billion (231) | | TID and port (32 bits) | 4 | 683 million | | TID and port (32 bits) | 200 | 15 million | | TID and port (32 bits) | unlimited | 109 k | *Table 1: Number of packets required to reach 50% success probability for various numbers of open queries*  As expected, the traditional brute-force case where the attacker tries to guess the transaction ID or TID/port pair based on a single open request requires the attacker to search half the search space (15 or 31 bits, respectively) to achieve a 50% probability of success. However, when the attacker is able to induce the resolver into generating multiple simultaneous requests, the total number of packets required falls off rapidly.There are, of course, more effective methods to achieve DNS spoofing in certain cases, including sniffing query packets directly or the predictable transaction ID issues discussed in [CA-1997-22](http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-1997-22.html) "BIND - the Berkeley Internet Name Daemon". Additionally, Michal Zalewski's paper "Strange Attractors and TCP/IP Sequence Number Analysis" [ZALEWSKI] describes a method for analyzing the predictability of transaction IDs which we believe could be extended to analyze Transaction ID / UDP port pairs as well. Zalewski's paper was also discussed in [CA-2001-09](http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2001-09.html) "Statistical Weaknesses in TCP/IP Initial Sequence Numbers".The 'birthday attack' method described here appears to be reasonably well known in the DNS developer community, but we have been unable to find significant public discussion of it and are thus documenting it here.**Further discussion of the probability calculations**Assume that the transaction IDs generated by the vulnerable resolver are unpredictable by the attacker (if they're not, then the attack is far simpler than what we describe here; see [CA-1997-22](http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-1997-22.html) for more). The attacker does not know what the transaction IDs are, but can control how many transaction IDs the vulnerable resolver has open for a particular query at a given time by generating a series of otherwise legitimate queries. (The total number of transaction IDs open on the vulnerable resolver does not factor into this -- only the transaction IDs resulting from the attacker's queries count.)Let *m* = the number of possible transaction ID / UDP port combinations *q* = the number of open queries initiated by the attacker*r* = the number of bogus replies generated by the attacker Note that if the UDP ports are predictable, *m* *= 2**16*. If they are not predictable, *m* *= 2**32*. Of course, if both the transaction IDs and UDP ports are predictable, *m* approaches *1*.The goal for the attacker, therefore, is to find the smallest possible sum of (*q + r*) with a maximum probability of success.The first bogus reply sent by the attacker will have a probability of success given by *P**1* *= q / m*The attacker does not need to care whether any particular reply was successful or not. The only thing the attacker has to keep track of is what IDs have been sent in the bogus replies so there will not be any duplicates. Thus, since the attacker knows what the ID was in the first reply and doesn't want to repeat IDs, he only has a pool of (*m - 1*) IDs to pick from on the second reply. Therefore, the second reply has a probability of success of*P**2* *= q / (m - 1)*Likewise, for each successive iteration, the number of possible IDs the attacker will pick from shrinks by 1. In the generic case,*P**n* *= q / (m - (n - 1))* Each *P**n* represents the probability of success in the *n*th iteration, independently of all previous iterations. We can therefore represent the probability of a miss in the *n*th iteration as Qn where*Q**n* *= 1 - P**n* *= 1 - (q / (m - (n - 1)))* The cumulative probability of having missed in all iterations up to and including the *n*th iteration is*CumulativeMiss**n* *= Q**1**\*Q**2**\*...\*Q**n* and therefore the cumulative probability of at least one success with *r* bogus replies is*CumulativeHit**r* *= 1 - CumulativeMiss**r* Thus we can calculate the probability of compromise given *q* queries and *r* replies. We do this by iteratively fixing *q* and incrementing *r* until we reach the desired *P**r*. To find the optimal combination of *q* and *r*, we repeat the process for a number of values of *q*. "Optimal" is defined as the minimum sum of (*q + r*).When one considers cases where *q > 1*, it quickly becomes evident that the attacker's advantage grows significantly with relatively small numbers of queries (*q << m*). For example, performing the calculations as described above for *m* *= 2**16*, the attacker's probability of success reaches the 50% mark with as few as (*q + r*) ~= 425 packets. **References:**[GUMMADI] Krishna P.

### Impact

| An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to remotely spoof DNS responses, which may lead to DNS cache poisoning. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Apply a patch from your vendor. |
| --- |

| Disable recursion on any nameserver responding to DNS requests made by untrusted systems. As mentioned in ["Securing an Internet Name Server"](http://www.cert.org/archive/pdf/dns.pdf): Disabling recursion puts your name servers into a passive mode, telling them never to send queries on behalf of other name servers or resolvers. A totally non-recursive name server is protected from cache poisoning, since it will only answer queries directed to it. It doesn't send queries, and hence doesn't cache any data. Disabling recursion can also prevent attackers from bouncing denial of services attacks off your name server by querying for external zones. Non-recursive nameservers should be much more resistant to exploitation of the server vulnerabilities listed above. |

### [Microsoft Corporation](#IAFY-5FDPYP) Affected

Notified:  October 29, 2002  Updated: November 19, 2002

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

The Microsoft DNS Server implementation closely follows the DNS standard. DNS is an insecure protocol and until such time as the protocol describes a method for securing queries, a determined attacker could poison the cache of a DNS Server. A number of precautions in the Microsoft DNS server make this style of attack more difficult, but not impossible. Microsoft is considering additional improvements to its DNS implementation in future versions of the Microsoft DNS sever to reduce the effectiveness of attacks like this.

### [Openwall GNU/\*/Linux](#IAFY-5FDPDU) Affected

Notified:  October 29, 2002  Updated: December 04, 2002

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

One of the features added with BIND 4.9.x-OW patches has always been the addition of unpredictable query IDs, thus making BIND 4 with these patches applied more resistant against the described attacks. The randomization of source port numbers is, however, currently left up to the operating system kernel (and thus doesn't occur on most systems). Future versions of the patches might add this functionality.

Similarly, the glibc resolver code on Openwall GNU/\*/Linux (Owl) has been modified to use unpredictable query IDs (including in the very first version of Owl available to the public), but doesn't explicitly randomize source port numbers.

### [adns](#IAFY-5FFP2W) Not Affected

Notified:  October 29, 2002  Updated: November 15, 2002

### Status

Not Affected

### Vendor Statement

adns is not vulnerable. It is a stub resolver library, not a full-service resolver, and does not forward queries.

If the communication between adns and nameserver can be faked up by the attacker, there can be situations where a similar attack might be made to work. These kind of problems are why the adns documentation tells you that you need to make sure that only packets really from your nameserver can arrive at adns with the nameserver's source address and port.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Various DNS service implementations generate multiple simultaneous queries for the same resource record

#### Vulnerability Note VU#457875

Original Release Date: 2002-11-19 | Last Revised: 2004-10-18

---

### Overview

Various implementations of DNS services may allow multiple simultaneous queries for the same resource record, allowing an attacker to apply probabilistic techniques to improve their odds of successful DNS spoofing.

### Description

| Some implementations of DNS services contain a vulnerability whereby multiple requests for the same resource record (RR) will generate multiple outstanding queries for that RR. As a result, it is possible for an attacker to apply a '[birthday attack](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/BirthdayAttack.html)' technique to dramatically improve the probability of a successful DNS spoofing attack. When performed against a caching nameserver, this can result in cache poisoning; however, similar techniques could be applied to some stub resolvers as well.  The only distinction between this attack and the traditional brute-force approach (1 query with multiple spoofed replies) is the generation of multiple simultaneous queries. The attacker need not sniff any packets between the victim resolver and the legitimate nameservers for the RR being spoofed. An attacker's success against any particular resolver instance will be probabilistic in nature, with a persistent attacker always being able to achieve a reasonable probability of success given enough attempts. By rapidly generating multiple queries for an RR to a vulnerable resolver, the attacker can induce a condition whereby the vulnerable resolver has multiple open queries for that RR. The attacker then sends a number of spoofed responses to the vulnerable resolver. Given the right combination of open queries and spoofed responses, the attacker can achieve a high probability of success with far fewer packets (by several orders of magnitude) than the traditional brute-force approach would require.This attack is quite effective against caching nameservers that provide recursive services. Recent research by Gummadi, Saroiu, and Gribble [GUMMADI] indicates that a large proportion of nameservers are configured to provide recursive services to the Internet at large, thereby laying them open to this kind of attack.The specific number of packets required to exploit any particular DNS resolver vary by implementation, but the following table lists a few of the more common scenarios found in a number of implementations   | **If the attacker has to guess...** | **...and is limited to the following number of open requests...** | **...it will take the following number of packets to achieve a 50% success rate**(includes both requests and responses) | | --- | --- | --- | | TID only (16bits) | 1 | 32.7 k (215) | | TID only (16bits) | 4 | 10.4 k | | TID only (16bits) | 200 | 427 | | TID only (16bits) | unlimited | 426 | | TID and port (32 bits) | 1 | 2.1 billion (231) | | TID and port (32 bits) | 4 | 683 million | | TID and port (32 bits) | 200 | 15 million | | TID and port (32 bits) | unlimited | 109 k | *Table 1: Number of packets required to reach 50% success probability for various numbers of open queries*  As expected, the traditional brute-force case where the attacker tries to guess the transaction ID or TID/port pair based on a single open request requires the attacker to search half the search space (15 or 31 bits, respectively) to achieve a 50% probability of success. However, when the attacker is able to induce the resolver into generating multiple simultaneous requests, the total number of packets required falls off rapidly.There are, of course, more effective methods to achieve DNS spoofing in certain cases, including sniffing query packets directly or the predictable transaction ID issues discussed in [CA-1997-22](http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-1997-22.html) "BIND - the Berkeley Internet Name Daemon". Additionally, Michal Zalewski's paper "Strange Attractors and TCP/IP Sequence Number Analysis" [ZALEWSKI] describes a method for analyzing the predictability of transaction IDs which we believe could be extended to analyze Transaction ID / UDP port pairs as well. Zalewski's paper was also discussed in [CA-2001-09](http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2001-09.html) "Statistical Weaknesses in TCP/IP Initial Sequence Numbers".The 'birthday attack' method described here appears to be reasonably well known in the DNS developer community, but we have been unable to find significant public discussion of it and are thus documenting it here.**Further discussion of the probability calculations**Assume that the transaction IDs generated by the vulnerable resolver are unpredictable by the attacker (if they're not, then the attack is far simpler than what we describe here; see [CA-1997-22](http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-1997-22.html) for more). The attacker does not know what the transaction IDs are, but can control how many transaction IDs the vulnerable resolver has open for a particular query at a given time by generating a series of otherwise legitimate queries. (The total number of transaction IDs open on the vulnerable resolver does not factor into this -- only the transaction IDs resulting from the attacker's queries count.)Let *m* = the number of possible transaction ID / UDP port combinations *q* = the number of open queries initiated by the attacker*r* = the number of bogus replies generated by the attacker Note that if the UDP ports are predictable, *m* *= 2**16*. If they are not predictable, *m* *= 2**32*. Of course, if both the transaction IDs and UDP ports are predictable, *m* approaches *1*.The goal for the attacker, therefore, is to find the smallest possible sum of (*q + r*) with a maximum probability of success.The first bogus reply sent by the attacker will have a probability of success given by *P**1* *= q / m*The attacker does not need to care whether any particular reply was successful or not. The only thing the attacker has to keep track of is what IDs have been sent in the bogus replies so there will not be any duplicates. Thus, since the attacker knows what the ID was in the first reply and doesn't want to repeat IDs, he only has a pool of (*m - 1*) IDs to pick from on the second reply. Therefore, the second reply has a probability of success of*P**2* *= q / (m - 1)*Likewise, for each successive iteration, the number of possible IDs the attacker will pick from shrinks by 1. In the generic case,*P**n* *= q / (m - (n - 1))* Each *P**n* represents the probability of success in the *n*th iteration, independently of all previous iterations. We can therefore represent the probability of a miss in the *n*th iteration as Qn where*Q**n* *= 1 - P**n* *= 1 - (q / (m - (n - 1)))* The cumulative probability of having missed in all iterations up to and including the *n*th iteration is*CumulativeMiss**n* *= Q**1**\*Q**2**\*...\*Q**n* and therefore the cumulative probability of at least one success with *r* bogus replies is*CumulativeHit**r* *= 1 - CumulativeMiss**r* Thus we can calculate the probability of compromise given *q* queries and *r* replies. We do this by iteratively fixing *q* and incrementing *r* until we reach the desired *P**r*. To find the optimal combination of *q* and *r*, we repeat the process for a number of values of *q*. "Optimal" is defined as the minimum sum of (*q + r*).When one considers cases where *q > 1*, it quickly becomes evident that the attacker's advantage grows significantly with relatively small numbers of queries (*q << m*). For example, performing the calculations as described above for *m* *= 2**16*, the attacker's probability of success reaches the 50% mark with as few as (*q + r*) ~= 425 packets. **References:**[GUMMADI] Krishna P.

### Impact

| An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to remotely spoof DNS responses, which may lead to DNS cache poisoning. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Apply a patch from your vendor. |
| --- |

| Disable recursion on any nameserver responding to DNS requests made by untrusted systems. As mentioned in ["Securing an Internet Name Server"](http://www.cert.org/archive/pdf/dns.pdf): Disabling recursion puts your name servers into a passive mode, telling them never to send queries on behalf of other name servers or resolvers. A totally non-recursive name server is protected from cache poisoning, since it will only answer queries directed to it. It doesn't send queries, and hence doesn't cache any data. Disabling recursion can also prevent attackers from bouncing denial of services attacks off your name server by querying for external zones. Non-recursive nameservers should be much more resistant to exploitation of the server vulnerabilities listed above. |

### [Microsoft Corporation](#IAFY-5FDPYP) Affected

Notified:  October 29, 2002  Updated: November 19, 2002

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

The Microsoft DNS Server implementation closely follows the DNS standard. DNS is an insecure protocol and until such time as the protocol describes a method for securing queries, a determined attacker could poison the cache of a DNS Server. A number of precautions in the Microsoft DNS server make this style of attack more difficult, but not impossible. Microsoft is considering additional improvements to its DNS implementation in future versions of the Microsoft DNS sever to reduce the effectiveness of attacks like this.

### [Openwall GNU/\*/Linux](#IAFY-5FDPDU) Affected

Notified:  October 29, 2002  Updated: December 04, 2002

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

One of the features added with BIND 4.9.x-OW patches has always been the addition of unpredictable query IDs, thus making BIND 4 with these patches applied more resistant against the described attacks. The randomization of source port numbers is, however, currently left up to the operating system kernel (and thus doesn't occur on most systems). Future versions of the patches might add this functionality.

Similarly, the glibc resolver code on Openwall GNU/\*/Linux (Owl) has been modified to use unpredictable query IDs (including in the very first version of Owl available to the public), but doesn't explicitly randomize source port numbers.

### [adns](#IAFY-5FFP2W) Not Affected

Notified:  October 29, 2002  Updated: November 15, 2002

### Status

Not Affected

### Vendor Statement

adns is not vulnerable. It is a stub resolver library, not a full-service resolver, and does not forward queries.

If the communication between adns and nameserver can be faked up by the attacker, there can be situations where a similar attack might be made to work. These kind of problems are why the adns documentation tells you that you need to make sure that only packets really from your nameserver can arrive at adns with the nameserver's source address and port.

## Various DNS service implementations generate multiple simultaneous queries for the same resource record

#### Vulnerability Note VU#457875

Original Release Date: 2002-11-19 | Last Revised: 2004-10-18

---

### Overview

Various implementations of DNS services may allow multiple simultaneous queries for the same resource record, allowing an attacker to apply probabilistic techniques to improve their odds of successful DNS spoofing.

### Description

| Some implementations of DNS services contain a vulnerability whereby multiple requests for the same resource record (RR) will generate multiple outstanding queries for that RR. As a result, it is possible for an attacker to apply a '[birthday attack](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/BirthdayAttack.html)' technique to dramatically improve the probability of a successful DNS spoofing attack. When performed against a caching nameserver, this can result in cache poisoning; however, similar techniques could be applied to some stub resolvers as well.  The only distinction between this attack and the traditional brute-force approach (1 query with multiple spoofed replies) is the generation of multiple simultaneous queries. The attacker need not sniff any packets between the victim resolver and the legitimate nameservers for the RR being spoofed. An attacker's success against any particular resolver instance will be probabilistic in nature, with a persistent attacker always being able to achieve a reasonable probability of success given enough attempts. By rapidly generating multiple queries for an RR to a vulnerable resolver, the attacker can induce a condition whereby the vulnerable resolver has multiple open queries for that RR. The attacker then sends a number of spoofed responses to the vulnerable resolver. Given the right combination of open queries and spoofed responses, the attacker can achieve a high probability of success with far fewer packets (by several orders of magnitude) than the traditional brute-force approach would require.This attack is quite effective against caching nameservers that provide recursive services. Recent research by Gummadi, Saroiu, and Gribble [GUMMADI] indicates that a large proportion of nameservers are configured to provide recursive services to the Internet at large, thereby laying them open to this kind of attack.The specific number of packets required to exploit any particular DNS resolver vary by implementation, but the following table lists a few of the more common scenarios found in a number of implementations   | **If the attacker has to guess...** | **...and is limited to the following number of open requests...** | **...it will take the following number of packets to achieve a 50% success rate**(includes both requests and responses) | | --- | --- | --- | | TID only (16bits) | 1 | 32.7 k (215) | | TID only (16bits) | 4 | 10.4 k | | TID only (16bits) | 200 | 427 | | TID only (16bits) | unlimited | 426 | | TID and port (32 bits) | 1 | 2.1 billion (231) | | TID and port (32 bits) | 4 | 683 million | | TID and port (32 bits) | 200 | 15 million | | TID and port (32 bits) | unlimited | 109 k | *Table 1: Number of packets required to reach 50% success probability for various numbers of open queries*  As expected, the traditional brute-force case where the attacker tries to guess the transaction ID or TID/port pair based on a single open request requires the attacker to search half the search space (15 or 31 bits, respectively) to achieve a 50% probability of success. However, when the attacker is able to induce the resolver into generating multiple simultaneous requests, the total number of packets required falls off rapidly.There are, of course, more effective methods to achieve DNS spoofing in certain cases, including sniffing query packets directly or the predictable transaction ID issues discussed in [CA-1997-22](http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-1997-22.html) "BIND - the Berkeley Internet Name Daemon". Additionally, Michal Zalewski's paper "Strange Attractors and TCP/IP Sequence Number Analysis" [ZALEWSKI] describes a method for analyzing the predictability of transaction IDs which we believe could be extended to analyze Transaction ID / UDP port pairs as well. Zalewski's paper was also discussed in [CA-2001-09](http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2001-09.html) "Statistical Weaknesses in TCP/IP Initial Sequence Numbers".The 'birthday attack' method described here appears to be reasonably well known in the DNS developer community, but we have been unable to find significant public discussion of it and are thus documenting it here.**Further discussion of the probability calculations**Assume that the transaction IDs generated by the vulnerable resolver are unpredictable by the attacker (if they're not, then the attack is far simpler than what we describe here; see [CA-1997-22](http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-1997-22.html) for more). The attacker does not know what the transaction IDs are, but can control how many transaction IDs the vulnerable resolver has open for a particular query at a given time by generating a series of otherwise legitimate queries. (The total number of transaction IDs open on the vulnerable resolver does not factor into this -- only the transaction IDs resulting from the attacker's queries count.)Let *m* = the number of possible transaction ID / UDP port combinations *q* = the number of open queries initiated by the attacker*r* = the number of bogus replies generated by the attacker Note that if the UDP ports are predictable, *m* *= 2**16*. If they are not predictable, *m* *= 2**32*. Of course, if both the transaction IDs and UDP ports are predictable, *m* approaches *1*.The goal for the attacker, therefore, is to find the smallest possible sum of (*q + r*) with a maximum probability of success.The first bogus reply sent by the attacker will have a probability of success given by *P**1* *= q / m*The attacker does not need to care whether any particular reply was successful or not. The only thing the attacker has to keep track of is what IDs have been sent in the bogus replies so there will not be any duplicates. Thus, since the attacker knows what the ID was in the first reply and doesn't want to repeat IDs, he only has a pool of (*m - 1*) IDs to pick from on the second reply. Therefore, the second reply has a probability of success of*P**2* *= q / (m - 1)*Likewise, for each successive iteration, the number of possible IDs the attacker will pick from shrinks by 1. In the generic case,*P**n* *= q / (m - (n - 1))* Each *P**n* represents the probability of success in the *n*th iteration, independently of all previous iterations. We can therefore represent the probability of a miss in the *n*th iteration as Qn where*Q**n* *= 1 - P**n* *= 1 - (q / (m - (n - 1)))* The cumulative probability of having missed in all iterations up to and including the *n*th iteration is*CumulativeMiss**n* *= Q**1**\*Q**2**\*...\*Q**n* and therefore the cumulative probability of at least one success with *r* bogus replies is*CumulativeHit**r* *= 1 - CumulativeMiss**r* Thus we can calculate the probability of compromise given *q* queries and *r* replies. We do this by iteratively fixing *q* and incrementing *r* until we reach the desired *P**r*. To find the optimal combination of *q* and *r*, we repeat the process for a number of values of *q*. "Optimal" is defined as the minimum sum of (*q + r*).When one considers cases where *q > 1*, it quickly becomes evident that the attacker's advantage grows significantly with relatively small numbers of queries (*q << m*). For example, performing the calculations as described above for *m* *= 2**16*, the attacker's probability of success reaches the 50% mark with as few as (*q + r*) ~= 425 packets. **References:**[GUMMADI] Krishna P.

### Impact

| An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to remotely spoof DNS responses, which may lead to DNS cache poisoning. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Apply a patch from your vendor. |
| --- |

| Disable recursion on any nameserver responding to DNS requests made by untrusted systems. As mentioned in ["Securing an Internet Name Server"](http://www.cert.org/archive/pdf/dns.pdf): Disabling recursion puts your name servers into a passive mode, telling them never to send queries on behalf of other name servers or resolvers. A totally non-recursive name server is protected from cache poisoning, since it will only answer queries directed to it. It doesn't send queries, and hence doesn't cache any data. Disabling recursion can also prevent attackers from bouncing denial of services attacks off your name server by querying for external zones. Non-recursive nameservers should be much more resistant to exploitation of the server vulnerabilities listed above. |

### [Microsoft Corporation](#IAFY-5FDPYP) Affected

Notified:  October 29, 2002  Updated: November 19, 2002

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

The Microsoft DNS Server implementation closely follows the DNS standard. DNS is an insecure protocol and until such time as the protocol describes a method for securing queries, a determined attacker could poison the cache of a DNS Server. A number of precautions in the Microsoft DNS server make this style of attack more difficult, but not impossible. Microsoft is considering additional improvements to its DNS implementation in future versions of the Microsoft DNS sever to reduce the effectiveness of attacks like this.

### [Openwall GNU/\*/Linux](#IAFY-5FDPDU) Affected

Notified:  October 29, 2002  Updated: December 04, 2002

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

One of the features added with BIND 4.9.x-OW patches has always been the addition of unpredictable query IDs, thus making BIND 4 with these patches applied more resistant against the described attacks. The randomization of source port numbers is, however, currently left up to the operating system kernel (and thus doesn't occur on most systems). Future versions of the patches might add this functionality.

Similarly, the glibc resolver code on Openwall GNU/\*/Linux (Owl) has been modified to use unpredictable query IDs (including in the very first version of Owl available to the public), but doesn't explicitly randomize source port numbers.

The vendor has not provided us with any further information regarding this vulnerability.

### [adns](#IAFY-5FFP2W) Not Affected

Notified:  October 29, 2002  Updated: November 15, 2002

### Status

Not Affected

### Vendor Statement

adns is not vulnerable. It is a stub resolver library, not a full-service resolver, and does not forward queries.

If the communication between adns and nameserver can be faked up by the attacker, there can be situations where a similar attack might be made to work. These kind of problems are why the adns documentation tells you that you need to make sure that only packets really from your nameserver can arrive at adns with the nameserver's source address and port.
