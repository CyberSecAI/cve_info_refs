| | [Bug](bug.php?id=15595) #15595 | imap routines hang when "To" header is too large | | | | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | Submitted: | 2002-02-18 04:23 UTC | Modified: | 2002-06-27 18:19 UTC |  | | From: | charlesb at ekit-inc dot com | Assigned: |  | | Status: | Closed | Package: | [IMAP related](search.php?cmd=display&package_name[]=IMAP+related) | | PHP Version: | 4.1.1 | OS: | Solaris-i86 | | Private report: | No | CVE-ID: | *None* |   View [Developer](bug.php?id=15595&edit=1) [Edit](bug.php?id=15595&edit=2)   **[2002-02-18 04:23 UTC] charlesb at ekit-inc dot com** ``` The starting point for this was that our webmail (customised IMP)would crash if the "To" header was too large.  Probably the header violates rfc822, but php should be able to cope, or at least fail gracefully and not hang.  We are running php built with the imap4.5 uwash c-client, with ldap, with mysql.  Apache is built with mods rewrite, mime_magic, the lastest fastcgi, the latest modssl.  The fastcgi connection is used for most pages rendered from our site.  Playing around with truss led us to suspect mime_header_decode was at fault, ie:  php_if_imap_mime_header_decode+0x6d3:           movl   (%ebx),%edx  Now, in getting a gdb backtrace, things got very wierd.  Below is the output - but it occurs not only when we try to read the email with the oversized to header, but when I try to do something mundane like parse the whole mailbox.  So maybe there are two problems, needless to say - I hope the truss line is useful, because I wouldn't rely on the gdb backtrace.  Thanks.  Program received signal SIGPIPE, Broken pipe. 0xdfee1f3b in _writev () (gdb) bt #0  0xdfee1f3b in _writev () #1  0x80b2254 in ssl_io_unregister () #2  0x81ba5f4 in ap_hook_call () #3  0x81b9d41 in ap_hook_call () #4  0x8196641 in ap_bfilbuf () #5  0x8196a6c in ap_bfilbuf ()    #6  0x8196b38 in ap_bwrite ()  #7  0x816537e in php_mergesort ()  #8  0x8166ec5 in php_mergesort ()  #9  0x816749d in php_mergesort ()  #10 0x8197ddb in ap_invoke_handler ()  #11 0x81ac451 in ap_some_auth_required () #12 0x81ac4b0 in ap_process_request () #13 0x81a3ad1 in ap_child_terminate () #14 0x81a3c80 in ap_child_terminate () #15 0x81a3ddb in ap_child_terminate () #16 0x81a43d8 in ap_child_terminate () #17 0x81a4b9b in main () #18 0x809b947 in _start ()   ``` PatchesPull RequestsHistoryAllCommentsChangesGit/SVN commitsRelated reports  **[2002-02-18 08:29 UTC] [sander@php.net](//people.php.net/sander)** ``` Can you provide a simple sample script?  ``` **[2002-02-18 18:09 UTC] charlesb at ekit-inc dot com** ``` An exact script is difficult. (I've spent a day or two trying to pin it down to a simple routine, not with any great success).  However, it looks like  $h = @imap_header($imp->stream, imap_msgno($imp->stream, $msgnum));  is hanging with a message that has to header of about 4K (again, this probably violates rfc822, but it shouldn't hang like it does).  $imp->stream is constructed like this (as you'd expect):  $connstr = '{' . $this->server . ':' . $this->port . '}' . $this->mailbox; $this->stream = @imap_open($connstr, $this->user, $this->pass);   Thanks.  ``` **[2002-03-11 04:47 UTC] charlesb at ekit-inc dot com** ``` Is there anything I can do to help this along?  We've been bitten twice by this in the last few days.  ``` **[2002-03-11 09:37 UTC] [sniper@php.net](//people.php.net/sniper)** ``` First of all you should try with the latest c-client.  --Jani   ``` **[2002-03-11 20:52 UTC] charlesb at ekit-inc dot com** ``` We upgraded last week to 4.1.2, the problem still occurs.  ``` **[2002-03-11 21:30 UTC] [sniper@php.net](//people.php.net/sniper)** ``` Try the latest _c-client_ library, not PHP.  As this is most likely not bug in PHP but in the  c-client library itself.  --Jani   ``` **[2002-03-12 23:36 UTC] charlesb at ekit-inc dot com** ``` I built php again with imap-2001a's c-client, and the problem still occurred.  Other suggestions for things I could try?  Thanks, Charles  ``` **[2002-04-04 07:31 UTC] [sniper@php.net](//people.php.net/sniper)** ``` This is most likely a c-client bug. Try opening the same failing mail with Pine.  --Jani   ``` **[2002-05-07 00:00 UTC] php-bugs at lists dot php dot net** ``` No feedback was provided for this bug for over a month, so it is being suspended automatically. If you are able to provide the information that was originally requested, please do so and change the status of the bug back to "Open".  ``` **[2002-05-07 22:09 UTC] charlesb at ekit-inc dot com** ``` Were you able to open the sample mail I sent?  If so, can you tell me what system/c-client you guys were using?  (to my knowledge we were using the latest possible)  ``` **[2002-06-24 00:47 UTC] charlesb at ekit-inc dot com** ``` You may be interested to know that we tried the up-and-coming version of zope-webmail and pointed it to the imap server/user that contained this message with massive To headers (that crashed apache/php) and the message was loaded and displayed without any problems at all.  ``` **[2002-06-26 23:57 UTC] [sniper@php.net](//people.php.net/sniper)** ``` I never got that test email..can you send it again?   ``` **[2002-06-27 02:12 UTC] charlesb at ekit-inc dot com** ``` Sent file as attachment to sniper@php.net  Thanks.  ``` **[2002-06-27 18:19 UTC] [sniper@php.net](//people.php.net/sniper)** ``` This bug has been fixed in CVS. You can grab a snapshot of the CVS version at <http://snaps.php.net/>. In case this was a documentation  problem, the fix will show up soon at <http://www.php.net/manual/>. In case this was a PHP.net website problem, the change will show up on the PHP.net site and on the mirror sites. Thank you for the report, and for helping us make PHP better.    ``` |

This is one of several vulnerabilities where code in php_imap.c calls rfc822_write_address() to write an e-mail address to a buffer of fixed size without first checking that the e-mail address fits into the buffer.  <http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=15595> <http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=19280> <http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=22048> <http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=24150>  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):   How reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Copy <http://cc.ysu.edu/~jpdalbec/adam2.txt> to an IMAP mailbox. 2. Access the mailbox using IMP 3. 3.     Actual Results:  Web server segfaulted  Expected Results:  Mailbox should open and display overview.

[[details]](attachment.cgi?id=121874&action=edit "Combined patch for listed PHP bugs.") Combined patch for listed PHP bugs.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=175040#c3)  David Eisenstein    2006-01-17 23:07:48 UTC  ``` New Security bug:  CVE-2006-0208:    "Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in PHP 5.1.1 allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via unknown attack vectors in 'certain error conditions.'"  As a result, PHP has released PHP 5.1.2  <<http://www.php.net/release_5_1_2.php>>.  Red Hat has opened a bug for RHEL4, [Bug #178028](show_bug.cgi?id=178028 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2006-0208 PHP Cross Site Scripting (XSS) flaw").  Josh Bressers has determined that his affects PHP 5.1 and PHP 4.3 releases.  Josh also states that RHEL 3 and RHEL 2.1 are affected.  Josh says in [Bug #178028](show_bug.cgi?id=178028 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2006-0208 PHP Cross Site Scripting (XSS) flaw"), "The problem exists in the way PHP displays error messages.  This issue is only exploitable when 'display_errors' and 'html_errors' are both set to 'On' in the PHP configuration file.  When a HTML error message was being generated, the output was not properly sanitized, which could allow an attacker to insert arbitrary HTML, thus allowing a XSS attack.  "This issue is only exploitable if 'html_errors' is on, which the configuration file cleary states should not be used on production machines.  "I have verified this flaw exists in the PHP 4.3 and 5.1 branches."  RHEL 2.1 uses PHP 4.1.2.         RHL 7.3 uses PHP 4.1.2.                                  RHL 9   uses PHP 4.2.2. RHEL 3   uses PHP 4.3.2. RHEL 4   uses PHP 4.3.9.                                  FC1     uses PHP 4.3.11.                                  FC2     uses PHP 4.3.11.                                  FC3     uses PHP 4.3.11.  This issue therefore should affect RHL 7.3, RHL9, FC1, FC2, FC3.     ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=175040#c4)  Marc Deslauriers    2006-04-27 00:10:11 UTC  ``` The phpinfo() PHP function did not properly sanitize long strings. An attacker could use this to perform cross-site scripting attacks against sites that have publicly-available PHP scripts that call phpinfo(). ([CVE-2006-0996](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-0996))  The html_entity_decode() PHP function was found to not be binary safe. An attacker could use this flaw to disclose a certain part of the memory. In order for this issue to be exploitable the target site would need to have a PHP script which called the "html_entity_decode()" function with untrusted input from the user and displayed the result. ([CVE-2006-1490](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-1490))  The error handling output was found to not properly escape HTML output in certain cases. An attacker could use this flaw to perform cross-site scripting attacks against sites where both display_errors and html_errors are enabled. ([CVE-2006-0208](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-0208))  An input validation error was found in the "mb_send_mail()" function. An attacker could use this flaw to inject arbitrary headers in a mail sent via a script calling the "mb_send_mail()" function where the "To" parameter can be controlled by the attacker. ([CVE-2005-3883](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2005-3883))  A buffer overflow flaw was discovered in uw-imap, the University of Washington's IMAP Server. php-imap is compiled against the static c-client libraries from imap and therefore needed to be recompiled against the fixed version. This issue only affected Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3.

Not sure whether it affects other versions.  2) php-4.1.2-php_imap.c.patch seems to be a bit different than php-4.1.2-bug24150.patch and php-4.3.2-bug24150.patch that RHEL shipped.   Are these fixing the same bug?  This might be applicable to RHL9 as well.  It might be best to use RHEL patches if feasible.  3) the patches for 2006-0996 seem OK compared to RHEL, there are a couple of minor diffs wrt TSRMLS_CC etc. those are probably OK.  4) the approach for 2006-0208 was different, and RHEL21 seemed a bit simpler (at least to verify :-).  If the RPMs would need to be redone, I'd recommend that approach.   Name 	[CVE-2006-1990](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-1990) (under review) Status 	Candidate Description 	Integer overflow in the wordwrap function in string.c in PHP 4.4.2 and 5.1.2 might allow context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via certain long arguments that cause a small buffer to be allocated, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow in a memcpy function call, a different vulnerability than [CVE-2002-1396](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2002-1396).

The Bugs that John specifically pointed out have the effect of causing imap_fetch_overview() to segfault when a mailbox contains a From: or To: header with an overlong email address.  (See [Comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=175040#c0)).  John has just indicated that the patch, php-4.1.2-bug24150.patch, included in one of the RHEL updates, fixed only 3 out of 4 of the bugs he noticed (See [comment #12](show_bug.cgi?id=175040#c12)).  I haven't myself had a chance to dig into the code, but I thought you might wish to know this.  Do you think there indeed is an (additional) code-execution vulnerability here?  Also, did the patched php packages released with RHSA-2006-0501 fix all of the vulnerabilities that need fixing in php?  Does a new CVE number need to be allocated or anything?  Thanks.   -David   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=175040#c14)  Josh Bressers    2006-06-01 02:15:04 UTC  ``` Hi David,  Thanks for the heads up on this.  These issues never seem to have gotten CVE ids.  We'll have to sort all this out (which versions fixed which bugs, which bugs are really dupes, etc.)  It does seem that upstream [bug 15595](show_bug.cgi?id=15595 "CLOSED NOTABUG - RH 7.0 beta 5 and Zip drives") isn't fixed in RHEL2.1.  I'm going to have a better look tomorrow when I'm more attentive.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=175040#c15)  Josh Bressers    2006-06-14 12:36:54 UTC  ``` This comment is from my mail archive.  Due to the bugzilla crash some data was lost:  ------- Additional Comments From deisenst  2006-06-10 17:12 EST ------- Josh,  Anything new on the RHEL 2.1 front?  Folks,  Looks like we need to issue new packages here, perhaps based on the RHEL packages with the patch <http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=15595> added in.  Do you want me to do it, Marc?  Jeff?  Are there any other outstanding issues? -Dave    ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=175040#c16)  Josh Bressers    2006-06-14 12:40:14 UTC  ``` ------- Additional Comments From jorton  2006-06-12 09:51 EST ------- Sorry for the slow response David.  Yes, I can reproduce a segfault with the test case for the upstream PR 15595 issue on the RHEL2.1 php.  Thanks for bringing this to our attention.   This will need a CVE name (the issue is from 2002!).    ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=175040#c17)  Josh Bressers    2006-06-14 12:41:05 UTC  ``` ------- Additional Comments From jorton  2006-06-12 10:33 EST -------   This patch is incremental to php-4.1.2-bug24150.patch and should fix the 15595 issue (tested to do so, and testing in no other way).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
