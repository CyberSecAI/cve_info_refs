The provided content describes a vulnerability related to DNS spoofing, which is different from the typical description of CVE-2002-2212. The content does not include the CVE ID. Therefore, it is:

UNRELATED

However, for informational purposes, here's the extracted information from the provided content:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Some DNS service implementations generate multiple simultaneous queries for the same resource record (RR) when receiving multiple requests for that RR.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Multiple outstanding queries for the same RR by a vulnerable DNS resolver.
- Susceptibility to 'birthday attack' techniques to improve the probability of successful DNS spoofing.
- The use of predictable transaction IDs and/or UDP source ports in DNS queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote spoofing of DNS responses.
- DNS cache poisoning on caching nameservers.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending multiple requests for the same RR to a vulnerable DNS resolver.
- Sending spoofed DNS responses to the vulnerable resolver.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send DNS queries and spoofed responses to a vulnerable resolver.
- The attacker does not need to sniff traffic between the victim resolver and the legitimate nameservers.
- The attacker needs to be able to induce the resolver into generating multiple simultaneous requests.
