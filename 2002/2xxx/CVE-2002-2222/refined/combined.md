## Multiple vendors' Internet Key Exchange (IKE) implementations do not properly handle IKE response packets

#### Vulnerability Note VU#287771

Original Release Date: 2002-08-12 | Last Revised: 2004-02-09

---

### Overview

Internet Key Exchange (IKE) implementations from several vendors contain buffer overflows and denial-of-service conditions. The buffer overflow vulnerabilities could permit an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| The CERT/CC has received a report describing several vulnerabilities in different vendors' IKE implementations. The IKE protocol ([RFC 2409](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2409.txt)) operates within the framework of the Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP, [RFC 2408](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2408.txt)) and provides a way for nodes to authenticate each other and exchange keying material that is used to establish secure network services. IKE is commonly used by IPSec-based VPNs.  During an IKE exchange, some IKE implementations do not properly handle exceptional response packets. The report enumerates several cases:     + IKE represents the ISAKMP security association (SA) in the Security Paramater Index (SPI) field of a response packet. An overly large SPI payload value could trigger a buffer overflow. + An IKE response packet with a large number of payloads or an overly large payload could trigger buffer overflows. + An IKE response packet with a payload length of zero could cause vulnerable IKE implementations to consume CPU resources, causing a denial-of-service condition.  These problems have been shown to exist in IPSec-based VPN client software operating in Aggressive Mode during a phase 1 IKE exchange. Other software and other types of exchanges may also be affected. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker who is able to send solicited IKE responses could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the IKE service or cause a denial of service. The attacker must act as an IKE responder, so therefore must have control over the responder, the ability to spoof IKE response packets, or the ability to redirect the IKE initiator to a responder controlled by the attacker. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade or Patch**Upgrade or apply a patch to vulnerable IKE software as specified by your vendor. |
| --- |

| **Block or Restrict Access**Using a firewall or other packet filtering technology, block or restrict access to the IKE service, 500/udp. Note that blocking access will effectively disable an IPSec-based VPN that relies on IKE for key exchange. |

                                                          The FreeBSD Project

Topic:          security issues in ports
Announced:      2002-08-28

I.   Introduction

Several ports in the FreeBSD Ports Collection are affected by security
issues.  These are listed below with references and affected versions.
All versions given refer to the FreeBSD port/package version numbers.
The listed vulnerabilities are not specific to FreeBSD unless
otherwise noted.

These ports are not installed by default, nor are they ``part of
FreeBSD'' as such.  The FreeBSD Ports Collection contains thousands of
third-party applications in a ready-to-install format.  FreeBSD makes
no claim about the security of these third-party applications.  See
<URL:<http://www.freebsd.org/ports/>> for more information about the
FreeBSD Ports Collection.

II.  Ports

                Not fixed (others)
Malicious Web pages or files can cause loss of X session.
When the X server receives a request to display an enormously large
scalable font, the server exits abruptly, killing all its clients.
This has been confirmed only with XFree86 4.2.0, but there is
evidence that XFree86 3.3.6, the X font server, and Xvnc behave the
same way.  Unpatched Netscape (major version 6 or 7) and Mozilla
browsers do not limit the size of fonts which Web pages or files
can specify, thus triggering the bug.
Scalable fonts may be disabled as a workaround.

III. Upgrading Ports/Packages

To upgrade a fixed port/package, perform one of the following:

1) Upgrade your Ports Collection and rebuild and reinstall the port.
Several tools are available in the Ports Collection to make this
easier.  See:
  /usr/ports/devel/portcheckout
  /usr/ports/misc/porteasy
  /usr/ports/sysutils/portupgrade

2) Deinstall the old package and install a new package obtained from

[i386]
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-4-stable/All/

Packages are not automatically generated for other architectures at
this time.

+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
FreeBSD Security Notices are communications from the Security Officer
intended to inform the user community about potential security issues,
such as bugs in the third-party applications found in the Ports
Collection, which will not be addressed in a FreeBSD Security
Advisory.

* **001: SECURITY FIX: April 22, 2002**
    *All architectures*

  A local user can gain super-user privileges due to a buffer overflow
  in [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.1/sshd.8)
  if AFS has been configured on the system or if
  KerberosTgtPassing or AFSTokenPassing has been enabled
  in the sshd\_config file. Ticket and token passing is not enabled
  by default.

  [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.1/common/001_sshafs.patch)

  * **002: SECURITY FIX: April 25, 2002**
      *All architectures*

    A bug in [sudo(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.1/sudo.8) may allow an attacker to corrupt the heap by specifying a custom prompt.

    [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.1/common/002_sudo.patch)

    * **003: SECURITY FIX: May 8, 2002**
        *All architectures*

      A race condition exists where an attacker could fill the file descriptor
      table and defeat the kernel's protection of fd slots 0, 1, and 2 for a
      setuid or setgid process.

      [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.1/common/003_fdalloc2.patch)

      * **004: SECURITY FIX: May 22, 2002**
          *All architectures*

        Under certain conditions, on systems using YP with netgroups in the
        password database, it is possible that
        [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.1/sshd.8)
        does ACL checks for the requested user name but uses the password
        database entry of a different user for authentication. This means
        that denied users might authenticate successfully while permitted
        users could be locked out.

        [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.1/common/004_sshbsdauth.patch)

        * **005: SECURITY FIX: June 19, 2002**
            *All architectures*

          A buffer overflow can occur during the interpretation of chunked
          encoding in the http daemon, leading to possible remote crash or exploit.

          [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.1/common/005_httpd.patch)

          * **006: SECURITY FIX: June 24, 2002**
              *All architectures*

            All versions of OpenSSH's sshd between 2.3.1 and 3.3 contain an input validation
            error that can result in an integer overflow and privilege escalation.
            This problem is fixed in [OpenSSH
            3.4](https://www.openssh.com/openbsd.html), and a patch for the vulnerable releases is available as part of the
            [security advisory](https://www.openssh.com/txt/preauth.adv).

            * **007: SECURITY FIX: June 25, 2002**
                *All architectures*

              A potential buffer overflow in the DNS resolver has been found.

                * **009: SECURITY FIX: June 27, 2002**
                    *All architectures*

                  The kernel would let any user [ktrace(2)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.1/ktrace.2) set[ug]id processes.

                  [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.1/common/009_ktrace.patch)

                  * **010: RELIABILITY FIX: July 5, 2002**
                      *All architectures*

                    Receiving IKE payloads out of sequence can cause
                    [isakmpd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.1/isakmpd.8) to crash.

                    [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.1/common/010_isakmpd.patch)

                          [crypto(3)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.1/crypto.3)
                          library, all of them being potentially remotely exploitable.

                          [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.1/common/013_ssl.patch)
