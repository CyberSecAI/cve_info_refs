How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# CITRIX Owning the Legitimate Backdoor

Thu, 04 Oct 2007 16:26:51 GMTby
[pdp](/members/pdp.html)
> The Internet is full of wide open CITRIX gateways. This is madness!

The other day I was performing some CITRIX poking, so I had a lot of fun with breaking GUIs, which, as most of you probably know, are trivial to break into. I did play around with .ICA files as well, just to make sure that the client is not affected by some obvious client-side vulnerabilities. This exercise led me to reevaluate many things about ICA (Independent Computing Architecture). For [example](https://chatbotkit.com/examples), when querying Google and Yahoo for public .ICA files, I was presented with tones of wide open services, some of which were located on **.gov** and **.mil** domains.

> This is madness! No, this is the Web. Through, I wasn't expecting what I have found. Hacking like in the movies? You bet!

```
Google: [ext:ica](http://www.google.com/search?q=ext:ica), Yahoo: [originurlextension:ica](http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=originurlextension:ica)

I did not poke any of the services I found, although it is obvious what is insecure and what is not when it comes to citrix. It is enough to look into the ICA file. I am not planning to go into details here but let's say for now that ICA gives you hints about the server, the underlaying transport mechanism and of course the remote application that will be opened.

With a few lines in bash combined with my Google python script, I was able to dump all the ICA files that Google knows about and do some interesting grepping on them. What I discovered was unbelievable. Shall we start with the Global Logistics systems or the US Government Federal Funding Citrix portals - all of them wide open and susceptible to attacks. Again, no poking on my side, just simple observation exercises on the information provided by Google.

### Breaking into Citrix

When performing a Citrix tests, my goal is very simple: "try to open a command shell". Sometimes, `cmd.exe` and `command.com` are blocked, but I can still execute commands by saving them in `.bat` or `.cmd` files. If you care to read the command output, just pause the window with `pause`. It is simple. Let's not forget about Windows Scripting Host (WSH) which is usually not blocked at all.

But to get to the command line, you have to escape the GUI first and when it comes to Windows GUIs, escaping them is like a walk in the park. As soon as you open explorer with File Open/Save/Save as/Print or Help features, you can execute commands. Just for demonstration purposes, I composed a [video](/files/2007/10/hc01.wmv) that shows how it is done:

<iframe class="video" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/1-cXrZIVlTU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Here is more. The following example shows an ICA file which just opens `cmd.exe` right in front of your eyes:

[WFClient]
Version=2
TcpBrowserAddress=_some address_

[ApplicationServers]
_PlanVue 03 Tri-City_=

[_PlanVue 03 Tri-City_]
Address=_some address_
InitialProgram=**cmd.exe**

Compress=On
TWIMode=On

TransportDriver=TCP/IP
WinStationDriver=ICA 3.0

[EncRC5-128]

DriverNameWin16=PDC128W.DLL

[Compress]
DriverName=PDCOMP.DLL
DriverNameWin16=PDCOMPW.DLL
DriverNameWin32=PDCOMPN.DLL

It is unbelievable but it works.

Among the ICAs I found, there were a few which do require authentication. For dedicated attackers, this is definitely not the end of the world. Now you probably think that it is time to take out all the bruteforcers and dictionary files and start some heavy drilling. "Hold on! Let's try the backdoors first."

After you connect to Citrix you will land most likely on the Desktop which is protected by the Windows/Netware logon. However, keep in mind that there might be some applications underneath that does not require authentication, just like those we discussed earlier. So how do we find them? Ian Viteks [coded](/files/2007/10/enum.pl) a perl script to do exactly that:

[/files/2007/10/enum.pl](/files/2007/10/enum.pl)

I was intrigued by Ian's script, so I decided to write my own. However, I wasn't very keen on re-reversing citrix so I through I would go the easy way - reusable components. A few minutes on the Citrix' website were enough to get me started. I ended up with the following [script](/files/2007/10/enum.js). Keep in mind that you need to have a copy of the Citrix client in order to get it going:

[/files/2007/10/enum.js](/files/2007/10/enum.js)
```

I don't know which script is better. Ian's implementation seams to be cross-platformed and quite transparent for the user but it works only for UDP, while my approach works only on Windows and it requires a bit of understanding the architecture but it supports all possible ways Citrix can establish connections, and it can enumerate the Citrix servers and farms as well. Here is a demonstration of how you can use it:

### Conclusion

Ok, it is lame but with pretty much the same success, attackers can hack into quite sensitive services. It is unbelievable to me to find out that pretty much anyone can tap into huge organization with a few dirty Citrix tricks. And here are some stats:

Just by looking into Google, I was able to find \*\*114\*\* wide open CITRIX instances: \*\*10\*\* .gov, \*\*4\*\* .mil, \*\*20\*\* .edu, \*\*27\*\* .com, etc... The research was conducted offline, therefore there might be some false positives. Among the services discovered, there were several critical applications which looked so interesting that I didn't even dare look at them. With a similar success, attackers can perform just simple port scans for service port 1494. The steps described above apply.

It simple. It is malicious. It is highly effective. And the problem is that CITRIX is pretty useful. Here is a dilemma for you:
Let's say that you have a pretty stable desktop app which you would like to be available on the Web. What are you going to do? Port it to XHTML, JavaScript and CSS? No way! You are most likely going to put it on CITRIX and forget about it.![hackathology](//gravatar.com/avatar/271ecedbd232e23677ddc1d3956147eb?s=256&d=retro)hackathologyAwesome pdp, you are hacking citrix server and i am constantly being challenge by guys to hack them![vindic](//gravatar.com/avatar/2fbd3fcfa626bd4301c18cdbd207a7bb?s=256&d=retro)vindicheh, it's amazing man, really :)![wirepair](//gravatar.com/avatar/015dba318ece79e80b157518e8729f9a?s=256&d=retro)wirepairHey pdp, that's cool and all but that paper (hackingcitrix.txt) is actually mine, not Ian Vitek's.

then you'll get your windows explorer prompt. fun for checking out those shares on the internal LAN :-)
you can also navigate to `WINDOWS\System32\cmd.exe` and double click to get your cmd prompt.

A simple lockout mechanism (which people should have already implemented) for failed attempts would pretty much rule out this type of attack.![pdp](//gravatar.com/avatar/c4db4e65c9f09f2a373fcaefa5e2bfb4?s=256&d=retro)pdpGeorge, you are misunderstanding the whole purpose of the post. All I am showing here is that there are CITIRX instances on very critical domains which are wide open to attacks. No authentication is required - just simple enumeration tactics. The second post I wrote discusses how simple it is to write a CITRIX burteforcer with common windows utilities. Both posts are completely different by nature.![Donnerjack](//gravatar.com/avatar/6b5917e5763985c0fb3ceb3f7d70a01b?s=256&d=retro)DonnerjackI've confirmed this same sort of attack repeatedly It will not work over a properly configured firewall and Citrix Web Interface setup. Even following the most basic recommended setups by the firewall vendor and Citrix would stop this style of attack from working. If you would have pointed out that these attacks would only work in poorly configured and mismanaged environments, I would have applauded your efforts. As it is, you're deliberatly misleading the public.![Kevin](//gravatar.com/avatar/5d3ad0f7abda0f8fbeb2fe91090a2f45?s=256&d=retro)Kevinhey PDP, thanks for the article, pretty timely since I'm assessing a clients citrix install right now. I wasnt able to get any results from your enum.js script however, using the syntax "enum.js apps TCPBrowserAddress=x.x.x.x" and "enum.js apps HTTPBrowserAddress=x.x.x." it seems like its not even trying to connect to the server (sniffing the connection yields 0 packets between my machine and the citrix gateway) do you have any insight on this? Also can you link the SDK pages you used? I can just write my own but its a bit difficult finding the docs on their site...![pdp](//gravatar.com/avatar/c4db4e65c9f09f2a373fcaefa5e2bfb4?s=256&d=retro)pdphi Kevin, you have to be quite familiar with CITRIX in order to make the JS script work. Playing with different options is the key. For example you may need to try to force the client to go over UDP, etc. I would recommend to use the perl script first, cuz it seams to work without too much of configuration. In case your CITRIX is communicating over IPX, NetBios or whatever you have there, use the JavaScript version and play around with the options.
Instructions on how to program the client can be found from CITRIX's website. I don't remember the link.![Kevin](//gravatar.com/avatar/5d3ad0f7abda0f8fbeb2fe91090a2f45?s=256&d=retro)KevinOk thanks for the prompt reply. I think I've found the PDF that I need, I've tried the perl script, but that too seems to be having problems.

Exposing ICA to the internet (rather than using a reverse proxy like the secure or access gateway) should be a dismissible offence! You wouldn't expose your SMB shares to the internet. Good write up but it shows there are a lot of clueless people out there calling themselves IT professionals.![pdp](//gravatar.com/avatar/c4db4e65c9f09f2a373fcaefa5e2bfb4?s=256&d=retro)pdpCUG, absolutely...![curious1](//gravatar.com/avatar/c3c7f8243fb013a2ac9f2e96c50fe700?s=256&d=retro)curious1PDP...You're correct with the weaknesses that you found on the internet, however, the ICA 3.0 protocol hasn't been used by Citrix in more than 5 years and if you're dumb enough to put you ICA presentation server on the web...you get what you deserve. What about a setup using CAGs and RSA through a reverse proxy...do all your same assertions apply? Let me know. Either way, you have a valid point with what you found on google. You should, however, clarify your applicable scenarios.

The first line of your article 'The Internet is full of wide open CITRIX gateways' probably put the Sh$ts up many a CITRIX administrator because they implement true CITRIX gateways (that only open for the correct people). I hope people reading this article realise that this is not the way to implement CITRIX for remote access.
I can't believe the amount of people who don't follow simple IT Security recommended practices. This is probably why your article should be entitled 'Beware There are Numb-Nut Administrators everywhere!!' ;-)
