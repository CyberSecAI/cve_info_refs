{
  "CVE-2002-2437": {
    "Description": "The provided content describes a privacy issue related to the CSS :visited selector, which allows websites to detect a user's browsing history. Browsers have implemented mitigations to limit information leakage.",
    "Root cause": "The CSS :visited selector, when combined with JavaScript and other techniques, allows websites to determine which links a user has visited, revealing browsing history. This is due to the ability of CSS to alter the appearance of visited links and the ability of JavaScript to read CSS styles.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Use of the :visited CSS selector.",
      "JavaScript access to CSS style information via getComputedStyle().",
      "CSS-based timing attacks.",
        "CSS based resource loading (e.g. background-image)",
        "Use of CSS to alter the rendering of content (layout changes)"
    ],
    "Impact": "Websites can determine a user's browsing history, which can lead to privacy violations, targeted phishing attacks, dynamic pricing, and user fingerprinting.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Directly reading style attributes via getComputedStyle or document.getElementById().style.",
      "Using sibling selectors to alter the layout or visibility of other elements based on visited link status.",
      "Timing attacks that measure the speed of rendering based on visited/unvisited link styles.",
        "Triggering resource loads based on visited links, and using the network requests as signals",
        "Using CSS to cause layout shifts that can be detected by Javascript"
     ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to inject CSS or Javascript into a webpage. They do not require any particular position or capabilities on the victim's system."
