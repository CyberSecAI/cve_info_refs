Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities in the Webster HTTP Server:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The Webster HTTP Server has multiple vulnerabilities stemming from improper handling of HTTP requests:
    1. **Buffer Overflow:** Occurs due to insufficient bounds checking when processing the URI in a request. Specifically, a URI of 275 characters or more overwrites the saved return address on the stack.
    2. **Directory Traversal:** Occurs because the server does not properly validate path names, allowing the use of '/../' sequences to access files outside the web root directory.
    3.  **Cross-site Scripting:** Occurs because the server returns path names containing HTML markup without sanitizing them, resulting in the execution of the injected HTML/JavaScript code in the user's browser

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** Lack of proper bounds checking allows writing beyond the allocated memory for a URI.
*   **Directory Traversal:** Insufficient path validation permits access to restricted file system areas.
*   **Cross-site Scripting (XSS):** Failure to sanitize user-supplied data in the URI allows the injection of malicious code into the response.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** Allows arbitrary code execution, potentially leading to complete compromise of the server, enabling an attacker to take full control of the machine.
*   **Directory Traversal:**  Enables access to sensitive files, like the Windows NT SAM file, which could lead to further system compromise or information disclosure.
*  **Cross-site Scripting (XSS):** Allows an attacker to execute malicious scripts in the context of a user's browser session, potentially leading to session hijacking or other client-side attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** Sending a crafted HTTP request with a URI longer than 274 characters.
*   **Directory Traversal:** Sending an HTTP request with a URI that contains '/../' sequences to navigate out of the document root.
*   **Cross-site Scripting:** Sending an HTTP request with a URI containing embedded HTML/JavaScript code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Webster HTTP Server. No other special privileges or network position are required.
