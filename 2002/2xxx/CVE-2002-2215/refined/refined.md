{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `rfc822_write_address()` function in `php_imap.c` writes email addresses to a fixed-size buffer without prior length checks, leading to a buffer overflow.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow",
      "Insufficient Length Check"
    ],
    "impact": "A large number of 'To:' addresses in an email message can cause `imap_fetch_overview()` to segfault due to buffer overflow in the `rfc822_write_address` function, potentially leading to code execution.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafted email message with an excessive number of 'To:' addresses, sent to a vulnerable IMAP server",
      "The vulnerable function is called when the server processes the crafted mail message."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send a crafted email to a system running a vulnerable PHP version using an IMAP client or server that uses the vulnerable code."
