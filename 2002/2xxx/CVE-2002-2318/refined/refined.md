- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Lack of input sanitization in the error message output of the Falcon Web Server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the handling of 301 and 404 error messages.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the victim's browser when they access the vulnerable web server. This could allow for session hijacking, cookie stealing, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - For 301 errors: The server adds a slash to the requested URI and sends back a 301 redirect with the user-supplied URI in the response. If the URI contains malicious script tags, they will be executed in the user's browser.
    - For 404 errors:  If a file/folder is not found, and the necessary slash has been added to the URI, the server returns a 404 error page. The user-supplied URI is included within the error message. If the URI contains malicious script tags, they will be executed in the user's browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and inject malicious JavaScript code into the requested URI.
