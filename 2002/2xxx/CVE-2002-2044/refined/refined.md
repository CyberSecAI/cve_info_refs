The provided content describes vulnerabilities in two products: x_stat v2.3 and lower, and x_news v1.1.

**x_stat vulnerabilities:**

*   **Root cause:** The exact root cause isn't given, but the report indicates the use of phpinfo() which is a vulnerability in itself if exposed.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   Exposure of sensitive system information through `phpinfo()`.
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
    *   Path disclosure.
*  **Impact:**
    *   An attacker can gain sensitive system information via `phpinfo()`.
    *   Cross-site scripting can allow attackers to inject malicious scripts into the web application, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
    *   Path disclosure can provide attackers with information that can be used to further exploit the system or application.
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   Direct requests to the vulnerable pages exposing `phpinfo()`.
    *   Injecting malicious code through XSS vulnerabilities via user input.
    *   Direct requests to resources revealing path information.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the server running x_stat, usually a web server.

**x_news vulnerabilities:**

*   **Root cause:** Not specified
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   Unauthorised access to the admin menu.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Attackers could potentially compromise the entire application by gaining administrative access.
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   Exploitation of a vulnerability allowing access to the admin menu
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the server running x_news, usually a web server.
