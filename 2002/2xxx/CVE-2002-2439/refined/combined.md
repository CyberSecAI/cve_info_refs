| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=853906#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-09-03 09:54:49 UTC  ``` It was reported that C++ new[] operator was previously missing integer overflow / wrap around checks for its arguments. If an application compiled with gcc accepted untrusted input for memory allocation and was missing application-level checks for integer overflows of arguments, provided to the new[] operator, an attacker could use this flaw to cause the memory region, allocated in the end for the new[] operator statement, it to be smaller than truly required, possibly leading to heap-based buffer overflows.

Hi,
An integer overflow issue was discovered for gcc-4.7:
<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2002-2439>

This is already fixed in gcc-4.8.

These seem to be the two relevant patches that fix the problem:
<http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2012-08/msg01416.html>
<http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2012-06/msg01689.html>

If you fix the vulnerability please also make sure to include the
CVE (Common Vulnerabilities & Exposures) id in your changelog entry.

For further information see:

this is #402694. It is disappointing that the security did become a management
only team.  Note that this is an issue, where even a member of the security team
is involved upstream, doesn't comment, doesn't backport the patch upstream,
doesn't do that much with this issue.  No, it can't be severity serious with
this kind of attitude.

So please backport this one first upstream, test it, then come back, then I'll
pull it from the 4.7 branch.

Thanks, Matthias

What purpose does this kind of insult serve?  Especially over
something as inconsequential as bug severity.

Best wishes,

sorry if you feel insulted. I didn't mean to do so.  I don't care about the bug
severity as long as it is ignored for the release.  What I do care about is that
I do not have the resources to work on an (from my point of view) unimportant
issue, which apparently was already worked on by somebody else.

| [Description](#c0)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2012-09-05 05:17:56 UTC  ``` From red hat bugzilla at $URL:  It was reported that C++ new[] operator was previously missing integer overflow / wrap around checks for its arguments. If an application compiled with gcc accepted untrusted input for memory allocation and was missing application-level checks for integer overflows of arguments, provided to the new[] operator, an attacker could use this flaw to cause the memory region, allocated in the end for the new[] operator statement, it to be smaller than truly required, possibly leading to heap-based buffer overflows.  Upstream bug report: [1] <http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=19351>  Upstream patch: [2] <http://gcc.gnu.org/viewcvs?view=revision&revision=190546>  Proposed upstream patch for the __cxa_vec_new yet (pending upstream review): [3] <http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2012-08/msg01416.html>  References: [4] <http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=35790> [5] <http://cert.uni-stuttgart.de/ticker/advisories/calloc.html> [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=433992#c1) ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Ryan Hill (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2012-09-09 19:19:58 UTC  ``` If anything that's a security enhancement for badly written programs, not a vulnerability itself. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  SpanKY   gentoo-dev  2012-09-10 05:29:26 UTC  ``` it's not entirely clear whether the patch changes the ABI (they mention using a new symbol).  if it does, then we won't be doing a backport of it. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2012-11-05 19:54:39 UTC  ``` <http://gcc.gnu.org/viewcvs?view=revision&revision=193174> ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Chris Reffett (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev Security  2013-07-08 23:07:09 UTC  ``` Seems to be fixed in 4.8.0. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Aaron Bauman (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2016-02-21 06:43:42 UTC  ``` Bug fixed in 4.8.0 as previous comment notes.  Below is a link to redhat's bugzilla stating the impact of backporting a patch.    @base-system and @toolchain, please advise on backport. Doubtful a cleanup is possible here for compatibility reasons.  <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2002-2439> ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  SpanKY   gentoo-dev  2016-02-21 08:05:19 UTC  ``` no plans to backport or clean up.  gcc-4.9 is stable across the board at this point. ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Yury German   Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev  2017-04-17 00:45:23 UTC  ``` GLSA Vote No  Thank you all for your work Closing no GLSA ``` |  |

## Notes

```
[squeeze] - gcc-4.1 <no-dsa> (Potentially affected apps need to be recompiled, if such issues are spotted in apps, these cases can be fixed on a case-by-case basis)
[squeeze] - gcc-4.3 <no-dsa> (Potentially affected apps need to be recompiled, if such issues are spotted in apps, these cases can be fixed on a case-by-case basis)
[squeeze] - gcc-4.4 <no-dsa> (Potentially affected apps need to be recompiled, if such issues are spotted in apps, these cases can be fixed on a case-by-case basis)
[wheezy] - gcc-4.4 <no-dsa> (Potentially affected apps need to be recompiled, if such issues are spotted in apps, these cases can be fixed on a case-by-case basis)
[wheezy] - gcc-4.6 <no-dsa> (Potentially affected apps need to be recompiled, if such issues are spotted in apps, these cases can be fixed on a case-by-case basis)
[wheezy] - gcc-4.7 <no-dsa> (Potentially affected apps need to be recompiled, if such issues are spotted in apps, these cases can be fixed on a case-by-case basis)
Are there apps known to be exploitable through this?
Any application using unguarded memory allocation would be susceptible to DoS anyway?
This should be addressed in jessie by getting this fixed in gcc 4.7, so that the archive is
properly rebuild with a fixed version from the start

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=19351#c0)  Florian Weimer    2005-01-09 22:18:16 UTC  ``` operator new[] sometimes returns pointers to heap blocks which are too small.  When a new array is allocated, the C++ run-time has to calculate its size.  The product may exceed the maximum value which can be stored in a machine register.  This error is ignored, and the truncated value is used for the heap allocation.  This may lead to heap overflows and therefore security bugs.  (See <http://cert.uni-stuttgart.de/advisories/calloc.php> for further references.)  The test case below uses a user-defined operator new[] to test for the presence of this problem.  However, the problem itself occurs also with the default operator new[], but it is probably harder to write a portable test case.  #include <testsuite_hooks.h>  struct foo {   char data[16];   void* operator new[] (size_t size)   {     VERIFY(size != sizeof(foo));     VERIFY (false);     return malloc(size);   } };  int main() {   size_t size = size_t (-1) / sizeof(foo) + 2;   try     {       foo* f = new foo[size];       VERIFY (f == 0);       VERIFY (false);     }   catch(std::bad_alloc&)     {       return 0;     } } ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=19351#c1)  Andrew Pinski    2005-01-09 22:25:00 UTC  ``` This is undefined behavor.   Really there is nothing we can do, just think about this again, the programmer should catch this when  they read in the length. ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=19351#c2)  Florian Weimer    2005-01-09 22:35:01 UTC  ``` Why is this undefined behavior?  Would you quote chapter and verse, please?  GCC's behavior violates 5.3.4(10):  "A new-expression passes the amount of space requested to the allocation function as the first argument of type std::size_t.  That argument shall be no less than the size of the object being created; [...]"  In this case, the passed value is 16, which is much smaller than the size of the array. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=19351#c3)  Andrew Pinski    2005-01-09 22:45:37 UTC  ``` But the C++ standard does not say anything about this case. ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=19351#c4)  Andrew Pinski    2005-01-09 22:47:56 UTC  ``` I would get a clearification from the standards comittee if I were you.  multiplying a large unsigned  number by 16 and getting an overflow is werid case but again, the developer should be checking the  size for reality, if they don't it can cause other problems like a seg fault as malloc on linux does not  return null when running out of memory. ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=19351#c5)  Wolfgang Bangerth    2005-01-09 22:48:34 UTC  ``` I also wonder what the semantics are that you are expecting? I mean,   you try to allocate an array that is so large that you can't address   the individual bytes using a size_t, in other words one that is larger    than the address space the OS provides to your program. That clearly   doesn't make any sense.      That being said, I understand that the behavior of this is security   relevant and that any attempt to allocate more memory than is available   will necessarily have to fail. Thus, our present implementation isn't   standards conforming, since it returns a reasonable pointer even in   the case that the allocation should have failed. I would therefore agree   that this is a problem, and given that memory allocation is an expensive   operation, one overflow check isn't really time critical.      Unfortunately, the situation is not restricted to libstdc++'s implementation   of operator new[], since that operator only gets the total size of   the memory to be allocation, not the size per element and the number of   elements. Therefore, by the time we get into the implementation of this   operator, it is already too late. In other words, the overflow check has   to happen in compiler-generated code, not in the libstdc++ implementation.      I would support the introduction of such code, if necessary guarded by   some flag, or unconditionally, as a matter of quality of implemetation.      W.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=19351#c6)  Florian Weimer    2005-01-09 23:07:11 UTC  ``` There's no multiplication in the source code.  The multiplication is an implementation detail.  You can hardly use it to justify the semantics of the operation.  I would expect that std::bad_alloc is thrown.  But I agree that the C++ standard isn't very clear in this area.  The implementation must ensure that the postcondition in 5.3.4(10) holds, but the standard doesn't provide a means to signal failure.  I'm going to post a note to comp.std.c++ on this matter, but hopefully this will be fixed in GCC as a quality of implementation issue.  The necessary overflow check is should be very cheap because the multiplication is always by a constant. ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=19351#c7)  Andrew Pinski    2005-01-09 23:11:57 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=19351#c6)) > There's no multiplication in the source code.  The multiplication is an > implementation detail.  You can hardly use it to justify the semantics of the > operation.  Actually the multiplication is not an implementation detail. The standard says what opator new[] should be passed, just the multiplication is included. sizeof(int[i]) (well if it was valid C++, it is valid C99) is defined as a multiplication so it is not an  implemenation detail. ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=19351#c8)  Geoff Keating    2006-09-27 23:51:32 UTC  ``` Isn't this handled by -ftrapv? ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=19351#c9)  Andrew Pinski    2006-09-27 23:56:32 UTC  ``` Subject: Re:  operator new[] can return heap blocks which are too small  >  >  >  > ------- [Comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=19351#c8) from geoffk at gcc dot gnu dot org  2006-09-27 23:51 ------- > Isn't this handled by -ftrapv?  No because sizeof is unsigned and -ftrapv only deals with signed types.  -- Pinski  ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=19351#c10)  Mark Mitchell    2007-03-23 15:00:00 UTC  ``` What does the C standard say about calloc?  That's a similar case; the multiplication is in calloc.  Does it have to report an error? ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=19351#c11)  Andreas Schwab    2007-03-23 15:09:45 UTC  ``` "The calloc function allocates space for an array of nmemb objects, each of whose size is size." There is no mentioning of overflow, but the allocated space must surely be big enough to hold the array, and calloc shall fail if it cannot fulfill the request. ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=19351#c12)  Florian Weimer    2007-03-23 15:23:27 UTC  ``` Subject: Re:  operator new[] can return heap blocks which are too small  * mmitchel at gcc dot gnu dot org:  > What does the C standard say about calloc?

So as far as I can tell, C++ defines this as being returning too small of a size. ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=19351#c15)  felix-gcc    2008-04-01 21:24:27 UTC  ``` I think we can all agree it does not matter what we call this problem. Real world programs have security problems because of this. -fstack-protector carries a much larger run-time cost and gcc still offers it, and there is even less grounds to argue by any C or C++ standard that it's not the programmer's fault.  gcc still offers it.  As mentioned in the other bug, Microsoft Visual C++ already does this check.  They do it like this.  After the multiplication they check of the overflow flag is set, which on x86 indicates the result does not fit in the lower 32 bits.  If so, instead of the truncated value it passes (size_t)-1 the operator new, which causes that operator new to fail (in the default case at least, a user may define its own operator new and that one might still return something).  My favorite solution would be for the code to fail immediately.  Throw an exception or return NULL, depending on which operator new the program called.  ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=19351#c16)  Richard Biener    2008-04-01 21:51:25 UTC  ``` I agree.

# Security Information

* [Keeping your Debian System secure](#keeping-secure)
* [Recent Advisories](#DSAS)
* [Sources of Security Information](#infos)

 Debian takes security very seriously. We handle all security problems brought to our attention and ensure that they are corrected within a reasonable timeframe.

Experience has shown that security through obscurity never works. Therefore, public disclosure allows for quicker and better solutions of security problems. In that respect, this page addresses Debian's status regarding various known security holes, which could potentially affect the Debian operating system.

The Debian project coordinates many security advisories with other free software vendors, and as a result, these advisories are published the same day a vulnerability is made public.
In order to receive the latest Debian security advisories, please subscribe to the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list.

Debian also participates in security standardization efforts:

* The [Debian Security Advisories](#DSAS) are [CVE-Compatible](cve-compatibility)
* Debian [publishes](oval/) its security information using the [Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL)](https://github.com/CISecurity/OVALRepo)

## Keeping your Debian System secure

The packages [unattended-upgrades](https://packages.debian.org/stable/admin/unattended-upgrades) can be installed
to keep the computer current with the latest security (and other) updates automatically.
The [wiki entry](https://wiki.debian.org/UnattendedUpgrades) has
more detailed information how to manually set up unattended-upgrades.

For more information about security issues in Debian, please refer to our FAQ and our documentation:

 [Security FAQ](faq)  [Securing Debian](../doc/user-manuals#securing)

## Recent Advisories [RSS](dsa)

These are the recent Debian Security Advisories (DSA) posted to the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) list.

operator new[] sometimes returns pointers to heap blocks which
are too small. When a new array is allocated, the C++ run-time
has to calculate its size. The product may exceed the maximum
value which can be stored in a machine register. This error is
ignored, and the truncated value is used for the heap allocation.
This may lead to heap overflows and therefore security bugs.
(See http://cert.uni-stuttgart.de/advisories/calloc.php for further
references.)

## Notes

---

### [sbeattie](https://launchpad.net/~sbeattie)

fixed upstream in gcc 4.8.0
backporting fixes may be problematic for ABI issues
gcc-i686-linux-android/xenial is 4.7.4 based

---

### [mdeslaur](https://launchpad.net/~mdeslaur)

gcc-4.7 is not the default xenial compiler and is only used to
build a few packages. Fixing this would be intrusive, would
require rebuilding those packages, and there is no clear
attack vector on them. We will not be fixing gcc-4.7 in xenial.
Marking as ignored.

### Patch details

For informational purposes only. We recommend not to cherry-pick updates. [How can I get the fixes?](/security/cves/about#security)
