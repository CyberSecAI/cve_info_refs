{
  "CVE-2002-2439": {
    "description": "Integer overflow in the new[] operator in gcc before 4.8.0 allows attackers to have unspecified impacts.",
    "vulnerability_details": [
      {
        "root_cause": "Integer overflow during calculation of memory size for `new[]` operator.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "The C++ `new[]` operator in affected versions of gcc does not properly check for integer overflows when calculating the size of memory to allocate.",
          "Lack of input validation which can lead to heap overflow."
        ],
        "impact": "A smaller than required heap region will be allocated when the size computation overflows, leading to potential heap-based buffer overflows if the program writes past the allocated region.",
        "attack_vectors": [
          "An attacker can provide crafted input for memory allocation, specifically when the application accepts untrusted input for the size of the allocation.",
            "By providing large input to the `new[]` operator, an attacker could cause an integer overflow leading to the allocation of a smaller-than-expected memory chunk. "
        ],
        "required_capabilities": [
          "Ability to provide input to a C++ application which uses the vulnerable `new[]` operator.",
            "The attacker must be able to influence the size argument passed to the `new[]` operator through untrusted input"
        ],
          "additional_notes": "This is not a vulnerability in the program itself but in the compiler. It impacts programs compiled with vulnerable versions of GCC where they accept untrusted input for memory allocation and lack proper application-level overflow checks for arguments provided to `new[]`."
