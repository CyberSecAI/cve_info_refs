- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Surecom Broadband Router EP-4501 enables the SNMP server by default with default community names "public" for read access and "secret" for read/write access.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Use of default SNMP community strings.
    - SNMP server enabled by default from both LAN and WAN interfaces.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - **Read access (using "public"):** Allows enumeration and gathering of sensitive network information.
    - **Read/write access (using "secret"):** Allows attackers to restart the router and change its network settings.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Attackers on the LAN.
    - Attackers on the Internet (WAN).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Network access to the router (either LAN or WAN).
    - Knowledge of the default community names ("public" and "secret").
