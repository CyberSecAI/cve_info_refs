  "CVE-2023-52424": {
    "description": "The vulnerability, dubbed \"SSID Confusion\", stems from a design flaw in the IEEE 802.11 standard where the network name (SSID) is not always authenticated. This allows attackers to trick WiFi clients into connecting to a different network than intended by spoofing the SSID.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "A design flaw in the IEEE 802.11 standard that does not always require authentication of the network name (SSID).",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Lack of SSID authentication during the initial network discovery and connection process.",
         "Vulnerable authentication protocols such as WEP, WPA3 SAE-loop, 802.1X/EAP, and AMPE, where the SSID is not used to derive the PMK.",
         "Client devices not verifying the SSID in subsequent beacons after the initial connection.",
          "VPNs that auto-disable when connected to a 'trusted' network based on SSID."
      ],
        "impact": "An attacker can trick a victim into connecting to a malicious network with a spoofed SSID, leading to traffic interception, data manipulation, malware installation, or exposure of sensitive information.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack where the attacker spoofs the SSID of a trusted network.",
        "Rogue access point setup that broadcasts a spoofed SSID.",
         "Exploiting auto-disconnect features of VPN clients by using a spoofed SSID."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be within range to perform a MitM attack. They don't need to know the victim's credentials but need to know that the same credentials are used across multiple networks. The attacker needs to have a rogue access point that can spoof SSIDs and intercept/modify network packets.",
     "affected_platforms": [
        "All Wi-Fi clients",
        "All operating systems"
      ]
    },
        "additional_information": {
        "mitigations": [
           "Update the 802.11 WiFi standard to mandate authentication of the SSID.",
            "Always include the SSID in key derivation during the 4-way handshake.",
            "Include the SSID as additional authenticated data in the 4-way handshake.",
          "Implement improved beacon protection to verify the SSID during the handshake.",
           "Store reference beacon containing the SSID for verification.",
           "Avoid credential reuse across different SSIDs.",
           "Use a VPN configured to remain active at all times."
        ],
        "attack_details": "The attack involves a multi-channel man-in-the-middle (MC MitM) position between the victim and the intended network. The attacker modifies beacon frames and other packets to spoof the SSID. The attack has three stages:\n\n1.  **Network Discovery**: The attacker modifies frames to switch the SSIDs of trusted and untrusted networks.\n2.  **Authentication Hijacking**: The attacker rewrites the SSID in the authentication frames before forwarding them to the real AP.\n3.  **Ongoing MitM**: The attacker intercepts all traffic, rewriting frames to change the SSID, and maintains the connection as if it is the trusted network."
