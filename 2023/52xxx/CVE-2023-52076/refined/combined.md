# Remote Code Execution Vulnerability in Atril's EPUB ebook parsing

## Package

## Affected versions

<= latest

## Patched versions

None

## Description

## Description:

A Critical Path traversal and Arbitrary file write vulnerability has been discovered in the default document viewer software of MATE DE affecting popular operating systems such as Kali Linux, Parrot Security OS, Ubuntu-Mate, Xubuntu and all the other Operating Systems that use MATE or Atril as default doc viewer.

### Summary:

The vulnerability exists in Atril Document Viewer which is the default document viewer of the MATE environment. Atril is the default document reader for Kali Linux, Ubuntu-Mate, Parrot Security OS, and Xubuntu

This vulnerability is capable of writing arbitrary files anywhere on the filesystem to which the user opening a crafted document has access, the only limitation is that this vulnerability cannot be exploited to overwrite existing files but that doesn't stop an attacker from achieving Remote Command Execution on the target system.

I named this vulnerability "Slippy-Book"

Severity: CRITICAL

Impact: Remote Command Execution, System compromise

This can be used particularly against security researchers that mostly use Kali and Parrot OS.

Remote Command Execution can be achieved in many ways:

1. The most efficient way to achieve RCE is by placing a malicious .desktop entry under $HOME/.config/autostart/ directory, and the .desktop will execute when the user logs out and logs back in, the autostart/ directory acts as the startup folder in Windows, and it will execute all the .desktop entries that are present inside at startup. We can place an infinite number of .desktop files with random names under autostart/ directory to achieve RCE, no need to overwrite any file.
2. By writing the authorized\_keys file under the .ssh/ directory inside the user's home, in this way, an attacker can immediately achieve Command Execution via SSH if the target system has SSH enabled.
3. RCE can be achieved in another way just by writing files like .bash\_profile, .bash\_login, .zshrc, .cshrc, .vimrc, .xsession under the user's home directory. Many of these files might be missing in operating systems, it depends on the OS. In Ubuntu-mate and similar Desktop OS, .bash\_profile, and .bash\_login files won't be present by default, and placing those files with malicious commands written inside under the user's home directory will result in RCE if the user logs in to the system without GUI mode, like SSH login.
4. Another way to achieve control over the target system is by writing files in places like ~/.local/bin, ~/.local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/, ~/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/, ~/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/, ~/.local/share/applications/, /var/www/html/, /var/www/ and so on.

## [+] Achieving Remote Command Execution:

This vulnerability can't be exploited to overwrite existing files, it can only create new files under any specified locations, but that doesn't stop us from achieving RCE. I tried out using the vulnerability to write a .desktop entry under $HOME/.config/autostart and then I logged out and logged back in, the malicious .desktop entry got triggered and I got Remote Command Execution. I also tried out placing an authorized\_keys file under .ssh/ directory and achieved RCE via SSH.

Note: If a directory is not present it will create the directory automatically.

Who knows about the Ebook format? Hasn't everyone switched to PDF?

The answer is no, EPUB is still a popular and powerful document format, but still many people prefer PDF. Most of them are familiar with PDFs. So, I was trying to maximize this vulnerabilities impact.

Another Interesting thing I noticed was, when renaming the .epub document to something.pdf, the vulnerable Document Viewer (Atril) tries to open the something.pdf file and reads it as an EPUB document because it is responsible for reading both EPUB and PDF, it also supports many other document formats as well. In other words, we can rename our crafted something.epub to something.pdf and then send it to the target to achieve RCE on the target.

So everything is good, we could create an exploit that'll craft an epub/pdf pair to write malicious .desktop entries under /home//.config/autostart/ directory. But there's a small problem, the target user's username is required for successful exploitation of this bug. What if we don't know the username? No Easy RCE? Needs to guess Username? Needs to try random common usernames? Let's see what I got..

Upon further analysis, I found out that we can use the /proc/self/cwd to access the user's home directory if he downloads the crafted document and opens it somewhere inside his home directory such as the ~/Downloads/, ~/Documents/ directory. So we can exploit the path traversal bug to achieve RCE just by using the gadget ../../../../../proc/self/cwd/../.config/autostart/exploit.desktop.

I have created a fully working exploit for this vulnerability (exploit\_rce.sh) and also a script to write and include your own custom files for path traversal (exploit\_file\_write.sh).

---

## [+] Proof Of Concept:

As a Proof Of Concept, create an EPUB/PDF pair that writes a text file "pwnd.txt" on the User's desktop.

1. Take a sample EPUB file, rename it as POC.epub for the demo
2. Craft the POC.epub document (In the Attacker machine)

```
$ echo Desktop > XXYXXYXXYXXYprocYselfYcwdYDesktopYpwnd.txt

$ echo Desktop > XXYXXYXXYXXYprocYselfYcwdYXXYDesktopYpwnd.txt

$ zip -u POC.epub XXYXXYXXYXXYprocYselfYcwdYDesktopYpwnd.txt XXYXXYXXYXXYprocYselfYcwdYXXYDesktopYpwnd.txt

$ sed -i s/"XXYXXYXXYXXYprocYselfYcwdYDesktopYpwnd.txt"/"..\/..\/..\/..\/proc\/self\/cwd\/Desktop\/pwnd.txt"/g POC.epub

$ sed -i s/"XXYXXYXXYXXYprocYselfYcwdYXXYDesktopYpwnd.txt"/"..\/..\/..\/..\/proc\/self\/cwd\/..\/Desktop\/pwnd.txt"/g POC.epub

$ cp POC.epub POC.pdf

$ rm XXYXXYXXYXXY*.txt

```

(The POC.epub/POC.pdf are present under the POC/ directory)

Or you can use the exploit\_file\_write.sh script to craft a document that places a POC.txt under /tmp when the target user opens the document.

(An EPUB/PDF pair for the above example is present under POC/ directory)

[\*] NOTE: IF YOU ARE TRYING ANY OF MY POC EPUB/PDF Documents, PLEASE EMULATE A NORMAL USER BEHAVIOR AND IDEAL SETUP BY PLACING THOSE DOCS UNDER $HOME/, $HOME/Documents, $HOME/Downloads, or $HOME/Desktop

If we know the User's Username, we can craft a new custom malicious EPUB/PDF pair using exploit\_file\_write.sh script, it will be more efficient. Knowing the Username in a real attack scenario is no big deal, for example, if the attacker and the victim work in the same organization then the attacker can easily exploit this bug by crafting an EPUB/PDF pair with the exact path of the target's Home.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

A vulnerability was discovered in Atril, a simple document viewer designed for
the MATE desktop environment.

CVE-2023-52076

  A missing input sanitising could result in writing arbitrary files if a
  malformed epub document is opened, that could result in arbitrary code
  execution.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
1.20.3-1+deb10u2. This update also disables support for comic book archives,
mitigating CVE-2023-51698.

We recommend that you upgrade your atril packages.
