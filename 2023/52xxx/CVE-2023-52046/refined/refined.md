Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The root cause is a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Webmin application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stored XSS:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the "Execute cron job as" field. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are then stored and executed when other users view the page.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization or encoding when processing the "Execute cron job as" field, allowing the injection of XSS payloads.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Malicious Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to:
    - **Session Hijacking:** Stealing user session cookies and gaining unauthorized access to the web application.
    - **Data Theft:** Accessing and exfiltrating sensitive information from the application or the user's browser.
    - **Defacement:** Modifying the application's appearance and displaying malicious content.
    - **Phishing:** Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - **Other malicious activities:** Performing arbitrary actions on behalf of the victim.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exploitable via the Webmin web interface.
- **Specific Input Field:** The vulnerable input field is the "Execute cron job as" field when creating or editing scheduled cron jobs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to have authenticated access to the Webmin web interface to access the cron job scheduling functionality.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Input Field:** The attacker needs to know where the vulnerable field exists and understand how to inject a malicious payload.
- **Payload crafting:** The attacker needs to craft a suitable XSS payload. In this case the example given was a simple ">" character, but likely more sophisticated payloads would be used in reality.

**Additional Notes:**
- The content confirms the vulnerability affects Webmin version 2.105 and below.
- The provided step-by-step instructions detail the process of exploiting the vulnerability.
- The example payload provided is very simplistic (">"), but any Javascript payload can be used.
