# Vulnerability Notice Topaz Antifraud

[*See all Vulnerability notices*](https://northwave-cybersecurity.com/vulnerability-notice?hsLang=en)

## CVE NUMBER

CVE-2023-52271

## CVSS SCORE

6.8 - CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N

## SUMMARY

During recent kernel driver research, we identified a vulnerability in [Topaz Antifraud](https://www.topazevolution.com/en/antifraud/), a software solution used by Brazilian and Spanish banks, to combat bank fraud. The vulnerability can be utilised to make a new implementation of [Blackout](https://github.com/ZeroMemoryEx/Blackout); a tool to kill anti-malware protected processes.

## Impacted Versions

At least the following version is affected (and likely also lower versions).

* Topaz Antifraud wsftprm.sys 2.0.0.0

## DETAILS

The vulnerable driver creates a driver device which can be accessed by any user on the system. The driver device supports an IOCTL handler that allows any user to make abitrary calls to kernel functions that aid in killing any process on the target system. More details will be published in a blog post once the vulnerability has been patched by the vendor.

Northwave’s reverse engineering team was able to build a fully functional exploit that allows any user on the system to kill Protected Process Light (PPL) processes, such as Microsoft Defender.

Microsoft Defender running before execution of exploit:

Microsoft Defender stopped working after execution of exploit:
