- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper validation of user-supplied strings within the `column_value` element when constructing SQL queries in the `ConfigurationServlet`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection vulnerability due to lack of sanitization of user-provided input before using it in SQL queries.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote attackers can disclose sensitive information, specifically stored credentials, potentially leading to further compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** The `ConfigurationServlet`, which listens on TCP port 8080 by default, is vulnerable. The attack is carried out remotely by sending crafted requests to the servlet with malicious input for the `column_value` element.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker can be unauthenticated and can be remote.
