- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Private Google Calendars WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin does not properly sanitize user input, allowing malicious scripts to be injected into the website.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful XSS attack can allow a malicious actor to inject malicious scripts, such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads, which will be executed when guests visit the site.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious actor could inject malicious scripts via a user input that is not properly sanitized by the plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to provide input to the plugin's vulnerable entry points, such as a Contributor user role.
