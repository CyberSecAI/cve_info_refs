- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WooCommerce plugin for WordPress versions 8.2.2 and earlier is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin does not properly validate requests, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker could craft a malicious link or embed a request on a website that a user may visit while logged into the vulnerable WordPress site.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to lure a logged-in user to interact with malicious content. The attacker does not need to be authenticated on the target website.
