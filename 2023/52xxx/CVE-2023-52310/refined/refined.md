- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Command injection in the `get_online_pass_interval` function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The `get_online_pass_interval` function in `paddle.incubate.distributed.fleet.fleet_util.FleetUtil` does not properly sanitize user-provided inputs for `days` and `hours` parameters, allowing for command injection. Specifically, the provided `hours` parameter is used in a way that permits the execution of arbitrary commands.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system running the vulnerable code.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by calling the `get_online_pass_interval` function with malicious inputs, such as the provided PoC demonstrates.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to call the `get_online_pass_interval` function with control over the `days` and `hours` parameters.
