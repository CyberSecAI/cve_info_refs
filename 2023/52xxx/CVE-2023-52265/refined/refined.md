The provided content details a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application does not sanitize user-supplied input when updating email templates. Specifically, the `emailBody` field allows for the inclusion of arbitrary HTML and Javascript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored XSS: Malicious Javascript code can be stored in the email template.
- Lack of input sanitization: The application does not properly sanitize or encode user inputs, allowing for the injection of malicious code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The attacker can execute arbitrary Javascript code in the context of the victim's browser when they view an email template.
- This could lead to session hijacking, stealing sensitive information, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can modify an email template by sending a crafted PATCH request to the `/api/email/update/{id}` endpoint, inserting malicious Javascript code within the `emailBody` field.
- The malicious payload is then stored in the database.
- When a user accesses the email template through the `/email/read/{id}` endpoint, the stored Javascript is executed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have an authenticated session to access the email template modification functionality.
- The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify requests to the application, for example through a proxy like Burp Suite.
