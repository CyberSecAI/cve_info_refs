# Late-Unicode normalization vulnerability in ewen-lbh/ffcss

Low

[ewen-lbh](/ewen-lbh)
published
GHSA-wpmx-564x-h2mh
Dec 28, 2023

## Package

gomod

ffcss
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

Before v0.2.0

## Patched versions

None

## Description

### Summary

The function `lookupPreprocess()` is meant to apply some transformations to a string by disabling characters in the regex `[-_ .]`. However, due to the use of late Unicode normalization of type NFKD, it is possible to bypass that validation and re-introduce all the characters in the regex `[-_ .]`.

```
// lookupPreprocess applies transformations to s so that it can be compared
// to search for something.
// For example, it is used by (ThemeStore).Lookup
func lookupPreprocess(s string) string {
	return strings.ToLower(norm.NFKD.String(regexp.MustCompile(`[-_ .]`).ReplaceAllString(s, "")))
}
```

Take the following equivalent Unicode character U+2024 (․). Initially, the `lookupPreprocess()` function would compile the regex and replace the regular dot (.). However, the U+2024 (․) would bypass the `ReplaceAllString()`. When the normalization operation is applied to U+2024 (․), the resulting character will be U+002E (.). Thus, the dot was reintroduced back.

### Impact

The `lookupPreprocess()` can be easily bypassed with equivalent Unicode characters like U+FE4D (﹍), which would result in the omitted U+005F (\_), for instance. It should be noted here that the variable `s` is user-controlled data coming from [/cmd/ffcss/commands.go#L22-L28](https://github.com/ewen-lbh/ffcss/blob/master/cmd/ffcss/commands.go#L22-L28) the command args. The `lookupPreprocess()` function is only ever used to search for themes loosely (case insensitively, while ignoring dashes, underscores and dots), so the actual security impact is classified as low.

### Remediation

A simple fix would be to initially perform the Unicode normalization and then the rest of validations.
