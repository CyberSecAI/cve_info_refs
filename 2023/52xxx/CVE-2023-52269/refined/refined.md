Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is insufficient input sanitization in the "Message content filtering" feature of MDaemon Security Gateway. Specifically, the application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when creating a new rule, allowing the injection of malicious JavaScript code within the filtering rules.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. The injected JavaScript payload can be executed in the context of the user's browser when the filter rule is processed or displayed.
*  **SQL injection:** The title of the finding suggests that XSS is chained with SQL injection but it is not explicitly mentioned in the content

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser. This can have several consequences:
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Stealing user session cookies, granting the attacker access to the user's account.
    *   **Data Theft:** Accessing sensitive data within the application's interface.
    *   **Malware Delivery:** Redirecting the user to malicious websites or injecting further malicious content.
    *   **Defacement:** Modifying the appearance of the application interface.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Message Content Filtering Rule:** The attack vector is through the "Message content filtering" feature. An attacker with the ability to add/edit rules can insert the malicious JavaScript payload into a rule.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to MDaemon Security Gateway:** The attacker must have legitimate access to the MDaemon Security Gateway administrative interface, specifically the ability to create or edit filter rules. This could be an internal user, or an attacker who has compromised an account with such privileges.
*   **Ability to Create/Modify Filter Rules:** The attacker must have the necessary permissions within the application to create or modify filtering rules.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects Security Gateway versions 9.0.3 and below.
*   The provided exploit includes a complex payload designed to bypass various input filters or sanitization measures.
*   The exploit consists of a mix of JavaScript events and tags including `javascript:alert(1)`, `onerror`, `<FRAME SRC="javascript:alert(1);">`, `<script>alert(1)</script>`, etc.
*   The vulnerability is triggered when the crafted filter rule, containing the malicious payload, is processed by the application.

**Summary:**

This content describes an XSS vulnerability in the "Message content filtering" feature of MDaemon Security Gateway. An attacker with sufficient access can inject a malicious JavaScript payload via a filter rule. When the rule is processed, the attacker's JavaScript code is executed in the browser, which can lead to serious compromise.
