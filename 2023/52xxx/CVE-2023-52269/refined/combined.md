# **Easy** Administration and**Flexible** Management

Every business has different needs and environments. Security Gateway for email enables administrators to adjust settings at many levels allowing for a flexible configuration instead of being restricted to a one-size-fits-all solution.

    [![Security Gateway for Email Easiest Administration by Users](https://i.shgcdn.com/10f2ed89-4a3f-4434-a628-12c9f9f10f26/-/format/auto/-/preview/3000x3000/-/quality/lighter/)](https://www.g2.com/products/security-gateway/reviews)

# **Simple, Powerful, Accurate** Security Features

* Easily monitor and manage email traffic
* Flexible control for global and domain administrators
* Intuitive user quarantine email management
* Integrated email continuity and email archiving
* Effective standard or customizable data leak prevention rules
* Compromised password alerts

# **Satisfied Customers** Share Why They've Switched Platforms

"We implemented our own Exchange server, and we had the need to have an antispam that would help us to be free to monitor it and that the same user with a single click could release his email, and this software was what we needed"

**Cesar H., IT Admin.***Switched from Barracuda Gateway*

"We moved from Exchange Online Protection after trialing several alternatives (both on-prem and cloud based). Security Gateway was the perfect sweet spot. Spam capabilities are far superior to EOP. For the price you get all the expected features and a lot of extra goodies too."

**Bill R. , Director of IT***Switched from Exchange Online Protection*

"With Security Gateway in place I get a little better sleep at night knowing my Exchange Server and entire network is better protected from the nasty stuff out there. Out of the box, it's probably one of the easiest pieces of software to implement."

**John G., VP***Switched from GFI*
