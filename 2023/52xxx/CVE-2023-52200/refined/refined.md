- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The ARMember plugin for WordPress versions <= 4.0.22 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Lack of CSRF protection in the plugin allows attackers to perform actions on behalf of authenticated users without their knowledge or consent.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to perform unwanted actions under their current authentication. Specific impacts may vary, but could include changes to user accounts, access controls, and other sensitive settings.
- **Attack vectors:** A CSRF attack typically involves tricking a user (through malicious links, images or script on a malicious site) to submit a request to the vulnerable application, leveraging the user's existing authentication/session with the target web application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to convince an authenticated user of the WordPress site to click a malicious link or access a malicious site that can then submit the unwanted requests on their behalf. This does not require any prior access to the target system itself and can be done via social engineering or other means of tricking the victim to perform the unwanted action.
