- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress ARI Stream Quiz plugin, in versions 1.3.0 and earlier, is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary vulnerability is PHP Object Injection. The description also mentions that this vulnerability type could lead to code injection, SQL injection, path traversal, and denial of service. This suggests that the specific implementation lacks proper sanitization of user-supplied data which, when unserialized by PHP, may allow the attacker to instantiate arbitrary PHP objects and control their properties.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow a malicious actor to execute code injection, SQL injection, path traversal, denial of service, or potentially other malicious actions if a suitable POP (Property-Oriented Programming) chain is available. The impact is rated as high, with a CVSS score of 9.9.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the plugin on a WordPress site. It is a remote attack that requires a 'Contributor' privilege, which indicates that this vulnerability might be exploitable by users with lower privileges than administrators, depending on the specifics of the plugin's functionality and implementation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires contributor-level privileges to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker must be able to provide data that, when unserialized, leads to the object injection.
