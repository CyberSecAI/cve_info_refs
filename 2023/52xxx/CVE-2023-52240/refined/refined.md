Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-52240

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from faulty sanitization of URL parameters within the SAML POST binding login servlet of Kantega SSO Enterprise. This allows for the injection of arbitrary web scripts or HTML.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is an XSS issue due to the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied data in URL parameters.
- **HTML Injection:** Malicious HTML code can be injected through URL parameters which will be rendered in the SAML login page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript or other scripts, potentially leading to:
  - Session hijacking.
  - User impersonation.
  - Stealing sensitive information (e.g., cookies).
  - Defacement of the login page.
  - Redirection of users to malicious websites.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **URL Manipulation:** Attackers can exploit this by crafting malicious URLs containing the injected HTML or script, and then tricking users into clicking those links. This can be done via phishing emails or by hosting the malicious URL on a compromised site.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Attacker:** The attacker does not need direct access to the server but can launch an attack remotely via crafted URLs.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick a user into clicking a malicious link.

- FeCru server versions 4.4.2 - 4.14.8

**Vulnerable Component:**
