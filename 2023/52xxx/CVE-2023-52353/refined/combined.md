| Summary programs/ssl/ssl\_server2 refuses following tls1.3 connections from a peer if that peer used to establish tls1.2 connections with the server previously. System information Mbed TLS version (number or commit id): 3.4.0 [f1c032a](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/commit/f1c032adba124fecbb43ff52d3e08f7157ae69e1) Operating system and version: Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS Configuration (if not default, please attach `mbedtls_config.h`): #define MBEDTLS\_SSL\_PROTO\_TLS1\_3 Compiler and options (if you used a pre-built binary, please indicate how you obtained it): default Additional environment information: no Expected behavior programs/ssl/ssl\_server2 allows following tls1.3 connections from a peer if that peer used to establish tls1.2 connections with the server previously. Actual behavior programs/ssl/ssl\_server2 refuses following tls1.3 connections from a peer if that peer used to establish tls1.2 connections with the server previously. Steps to reproduce server: `./programs/ssl/ssl_server2` client: `./programs/ssl/ssl_client2 force_version=tls12` server shows `Successful connection`  Then, `ctrl+c` to close client, keep server running, restart client with `./programs/ssl/ssl_client2 force_version=tls13` server shows `Last error was: -0x7780 - SSL - A fatal alert message was received from our peer` Additional information Did not see this behavior in other tls implementations. |

| Form `include/mbedtls/mbedtls_config.h`:  ``` * \def MBEDTLS_SSL_PROTO_TLS1_3 * * Enable support for TLS 1.3. * * \note The support for TLS 1.3 is not comprehensive yet, in particular *       pre-shared keys are not supported. *       See docs/architecture/tls13-support.md for a description of the TLS *       1.3 support that this option enables.  ```  From `docs/architecture/tls13-support.md`:  * Supported versions:   - TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 with version negotiation on the client side, not server   side.  In summary, the server side doesn't have version negotiation yet. This is a documented limitation of TLS 1.3 in the library, which is a feature still in development. |

| Thanks for the report. I have checked and this is still relevant in 3.5 where we support version negotiation on server side. When a connection is closed, ssl\_server2 uses `mbedtls_ssl_session_reset()` to reset the SSL context to prepare for the following connection. In `mbedtls_ssl_session_reset()` the TLS maximum negotiable version is not reset properly: if the last connection negotiated TLS 1.2 that's the new maximum. |
