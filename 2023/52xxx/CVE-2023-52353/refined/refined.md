Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability lies in the `mbedtls_ssl_session_reset()` function within the Mbed TLS library. This function is responsible for resetting the SSL context after a connection is closed, preparing it for a new connection. However, it fails to properly reset the TLS maximum negotiable version. This means that if a previous connection negotiated TLS 1.2, the maximum version for subsequent connections will be incorrectly limited to TLS 1.2, even if the client attempts to use TLS 1.3.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Session Reset:** The core issue is the flawed logic in `mbedtls_ssl_session_reset()`, which does not fully reset the SSL context to its initial state, specifically regarding the maximum TLS version.
*   **Limited TLS Version Negotiation:** The server incorrectly remembers the maximum TLS version negotiated in a previous connection, preventing subsequent connections from using higher TLS versions (e.g., TLS 1.3 after a TLS 1.2 connection).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS) (limited):** Although not a full DoS, the server effectively refuses TLS 1.3 connections if there was a prior TLS 1.2 connection, disrupting service availability for clients requiring TLS 1.3.
*   **Loss of Expected Functionality:** Clients might be forced to downgrade to TLS 1.2 if the server is not correctly handling the connection reset and version negotiation.
*   **Interoperability Issues:** The server behaves differently from other TLS implementations and does not allow for version negotiation on the server side.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Repeated Connection Attempts:** An attacker, or even normal client usage, establishing an initial TLS 1.2 connection, followed by a TLS 1.3 connection attempt, can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker can be any client trying to establish a TLS connection with the server.
*   The attacker needs to establish one connection using TLS 1.2, then attempt a subsequent connection using TLS 1.3.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was present in Mbed TLS versions prior to 3.6.
*   It was fixed in Mbed TLS v3.6 with commit `ad736991bb59211118a29fe115367c24495300c2`.
*   The issue is specific to the `ssl_server2` example program.
