# Double Free or Corruption Error on Valid WebAssembly Module LoadÂ #2586

## Description

![@khagankhan](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/127453117?v=4&size=48)[khagankhan](https://github.com/khagankhan)opened [on Sep 22, 2023](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-micro-runtime/issues/2586#issue-1909611567)
## Describe the Bug

When executing a valid WebAssembly module using the `iwasm`, the program terminates with a "double free or corruption" error, probably originating from the `wasm_loader_ctx_destroy` function in `wasm_loader.c`.

`iwasm --version`: iwasm 1.2.3

`uname -a`: Linux node0.wamr.randtest-pg0.utah.cloudlab.us 5.15.0-56-generic [#62](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-micro-runtime/issues/62)-Ubuntu SMP Tue Nov 22 19:54:14 UTC 2022 x86\_64 x86\_64 x86\_64 GNU/Linux

## Steps to reproduce:

1. Save the `crash.wat` (Remove .txt extension)
2. Install and build WABT toolkit (`wat2wasm` from WABT can be used to convert `crash.wat` into `crash.wasm` using: `wat2wasm crash.wat -o crash.wasm`. I have also added `crash.wasm` that obviates the need to use `wat2wasm`)
3. Run `iwasm crash.wasm`
4. Observe the `abort`.

## Files that cause the `abort`:

[crash.wat.txt](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-micro-runtime/files/12705032/crash.wat.txt) (Remove .txt extension when to save)

[crash.wasm.txt](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-micro-runtime/files/12705033/crash.wasm.txt) (Remove .txt extension when to save)

## Observed Behavior:

```
iwasm crash.wasm

double free or corruption (out)
Aborted

```
## Expected behavior:

`iwasm` is supposed to run the module successfully. `wasmer` and `wasmtime` run the module successfully.

## GDB Backtrace

```
Program received signal SIGABRT, Aborted.

### Reduced code that caused the abort (`cat crash.wat`):

```

  (type (;0;) (func (param i64 f32 f32) (result i32)))
  (type (;1;) (func (param i64) (result i32)))
  (func (;0;) (type 0) (param i64 f32 f32) (result i32)
    (local i32 i64 f32 f64)
    global.get 0
    i32.const 0
    if (result i32) ;; label = @1
      i32.const 1
    else
      i32.const 0
      br 0 (;@1;)
      global.get 0
      i32.add
    end
    br_if 0 (;@0;)
    drop
    local.get 4
    i32.const 0
    call_indirect (type 1)
  )
  (table (;0;) 2 funcref)
  (global (;0;) (mut i32) i32.const 0)

```
## Additional information

A combination of AFL++ and Wasmlike, an Xsmith-based random program generator produced the snippet of code that found the issue. [Xsmith Project](https://www.flux.utah.edu/project/xsmith)

### @wenyongh **[wenyongh](/wenyongh)** commented [Sep 25, 2023](#issue-1910768669)

`wasm_loader_push_pop_frame_offset` may pop n operands by using

`loader_ctx->stack_cell_num` to check whether the operand can be

popped or not. While `loader_ctx->stack_cell_num` is updated in the

later `wasm_loader_push_pop_frame_ref`, the check may fail if the stack

is in polymorphic state and lead to `ctx->frame_offset` underflow.

Fix issue [#2577](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-micro-runtime/issues/2577) and [#2586](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-micro-runtime/issues/2586).

Sorry, something went wrong.
