# FreeScout End-User Portal Authentication Bypass Exploit (CVE-2023-52268)

## Overview

This exploit targets a vulnerability in the **FreeScout End-User Portal Module** (versions below 1.0.65) that allows an attacker to bypass authentication through improper session token management. By generating and testing session tokens, the attacker can gain unauthorized access to the ticketing system, impersonating users and accessing their support tickets. Crucially, the generated session tokens are mapped to other users than the one requesting the magic link authentication, allowing attackers to impersonate arbitrary users. If an administrative account session is compromised, the attacker gains full access to all support tickets on the platform.

### Why tho

The exploit takes advantage of weak session token management in the FreeScout End-User Portal's magic link authentication mechanism. Session tokens are **incorrectly mapped to other users** than the one initiating the request, meaning an attacker can generate session tokens that belong to different users on the platform. This flaw allows attackers to impersonate users and access their support tickets without needing to know their credentials.

### Impact

Support tickets often contain **sensitive information**, such as:

* User credentials for corporate systems / SaaS solutions
* Personal identifiable information (PII)
* Internal communications between users and support staff

### Responsible Disclosure

Vendor Notified: Yes

Fix Available: Update FreeScount End-User Portal to latest version.

# End-User Portal Module

## Let your customers submit tickets from the End-User Portal or contact form widget.

![](https://freescout.net/wp-content/uploads/edd/2020/11/freescout-end-user-portal-module-1000x750.png)
## [End-User Portal Module](https://freescout.net/module/end-user-portal/)

This module provides a fully equipped End-User Portal which allows customers to submit tickets, log in by email, view their tickets and reply to tickets. You can also add Contact Form Widget to your website.

#### **Submitting Tickets**

“Submit a Ticket” form form creates a ticket directly in the database. It does not create an email on your mail server and it does not send an email to the customer. Support agents receive email notification if they have “There is a new conversation” checkbox enabled in their “Notifications” settings.

[![](https://freescout.net/wp-content/uploads/edd/2020/11/helpdesk-end-user-portal.png)](https://freescout.net/wp-content/uploads/edd/2020/11/helpdesk-end-user-portal.png)

#### **Customer Authentication**

Customers can log in using their email addresses. If a customer with the specified email address does not exist in the system, new customer is created.

[![](https://freescout.net/wp-content/uploads/edd/2021/01/helpdesk-end-user-portal-log-in.png)](https://freescout.net/wp-content/uploads/edd/2021/01/helpdesk-end-user-portal-log-in.png)

Customer receives an email with the authentication link which allows to log in to the support portal. The link is valid for 1 hour.

[![](https://freescout.net/wp-content/uploads/edd/2021/01/helpdesk-authentication.png)](https://freescout.net/wp-content/uploads/edd/2021/01/helpdesk-authentication.png)

If you want to add a captcha to the Login form and Contact Form – see [Extra Security Module](https://freescout.net/module/extra-security/).

#### **Viewing Tickets**

After logging in customers can view their tickets.

[![](https://freescout.net/wp-content/uploads/edd/2021/01/help-desk-customer-tickets.png)](https://freescout.net/wp-content/uploads/edd/2021/01/help-desk-customer-tickets.png)

Customer can open each ticket and reply. If ticket’s status is “Closed”, customer’s reply automatically makes it “Open”.

[![](https://freescout.net/wp-content/uploads/edd/2021/01/help-desk-view-ticket.png)](https://freescout.net/wp-content/uploads/edd/2021/01/help-desk-view-ticket.png)

When a support agent replies to the ticket the customer receives the reply by email and also can view it in the End-User Portal.

#### **Portal Settings**

Each mailbox has it’s unique End-User Portal link which can be found in mailbox’s settings under “End-User Portal”.Â Customers can access only those End-User Portals to which you give them the link.

[![](https://freescout.net/wp-content/uploads/edd/2020/11/help-desk-end-user-portal-link.png)](https://freescout.net/wp-content/uploads/edd/2020/11/help-desk-end-user-portal-link.png)

The name of the mailbox is used as a title of theÂ End-User Portal.

#### **Contact Form Widget**

You can also embed contact from widget on your website. Live demo:Â <https://freescout.net/contact-form-widget-demo/>

[![](https://freescout.net/wp-content/uploads/edd/2020/12/help-desk-contact-form-widget.png)](https://freescout.net/wp-content/uploads/edd/2020/12/help-desk-contact-form-widget.png)

The code can be generated in the “Contact Form Widget” section of theÂ “End-User Portal” settings for a mailbox. Every time you change parameters of the widget, you need to update the code on your website.

[![](https://freescout.net/wp-content/uploads/edd/2020/12/freescout-helpdesk-contact-form-code.png)](https://freescout.net/wp-content/uploads/edd/2020/12/freescout-helpdesk-contact-form-code.png)

Contact form can be also embedded on the website via iframe – embedding URL can be obtained via “Open in New Window” link.

If you want to add an extra protection to the Contact Us form using reCAPTCH, use [Extra Security Module](https://freescout.net/module/extra-security/).

#### **Custom Fields**

If you have [Custom Fields Module](https://freescout.net/module/custom-fields/) installed, you can add custom fields to the Contact Form. Custom Fields will be visible in the widget and on the Submit form in the End-User Portal. Required custom fields will be marked as “required\*” in the form. Order of custom fields in the form corresponds to the order of custom fields in the mailbox settings.

*If you are adding Multiselect custom field to the Contact Form this field won’t autosuggest values like it happens when you are entering values in conversations in FreeScout. It’s done not to expose to customers all the existing values you have in this field in your system.*

#### **Prefilling “Submit a Ticket” Form Fields**

End-User Portal “Submit a Ticket” form fields can be prefilled via the URL:

*https://your-domain.com/help/4132458525?**f[email]=john@example.org&f[name]=John&f[message]=Text&f[cf\_37]=Test***

[Custom fields](https://freescout.net/module/custom-fields/) also can be prefilled via URL by specifying custom field ID like this: **f[cf\_37]** (where 37 is the custom field ID).

#### **Prefilling Contact Form Widget Fields**

In order to prefill Contact Form Widget fields add the following parameters to the script on your page:

<script>var FreeScoutW={**f:{“email”:”john@example.org”,”name”:”John”,”message”:”Text”,”cf\_37″:”Test”**},s:{“color”:”#8f9599″}};…</script>

#### **White-labeling**

“Powered by FreeScout” notice can be removed using [Widgets White-Labeling](https://freescout.net/module/white-label/) Module.

#### **Customization**

End-User Portal style and colors can be adjusted via [Customization Module](https://freescout.net/module/customization/) using custom CSS styles.

You can adjust widget position or z-index on your website using CSS. Widget button element isÂ **#fsw-btn** and widget window element isÂ **#fsw-iframe**.

#### **Language**

If you are logged in as a FreeScout user End-User Portal uses user’s language. Otherwise it uses language from Manage > Settings.

In order to set Contact Form language use Contact Form Widget’s “Language” parameter.

#### **Troubleshooting**

If you are using Reports module, make sure to update it to the latest version.

If you are receiving “…sameorigin…” error in your browser when embedding a Contact Form Widget, [check your server configuration](https://github.com/freescout-helpdesk/freescout/issues/1596)Â and check [these instructions](https://github.com/freescout-help-desk/freescout/issues/3996#issuecomment-2311022463).

There is a known [issue](https://github.com/freescout-helpdesk/freescout/issues/2201) – which allows end-user to select the first element of the dropdown custom field.

If you are embedding Contact Us form using iframe and receiving “Blocked autofocusing on a form control in a cross-origin subframe” warning in the browser console, try [this solution](https://github.com/freescout-helpdesk/freescout/issues/3794#issuecomment-1951332975).

## FAQ

### [#](#what-payment-methods-are-supported-for-official-modules) What payment methods are supported?

Bank Cards, Robokassa.

### [#](#license-period) Do I need to pay for official modules only once or every month?

All payments are one-time only.

### [#](#do-you-offer-bulk-discounts-do-you-offer-discount-for-nonprofits) Do you offer bulk discounts? Do you offer discounts for nonprofits?

No, as modules are already super cheap.

### [#](%22#trial-license)Â Do you offer trial licenses to try out modules before purchase?

Unfortunately not. We were doing this before, but people were cheating and never buying the full license after downloading modules.

### [#](#do-modules-work-if-freescout-is-installed-on-a-subdomain-or-subdirectory) Do modules work if FreeScout is installed on a subdomain or subdirectory?

Yes.

### [#](#invoice) Can you send me a tax invoice?

We don’t send invoices by request. You receive an invoice to the email address you provide during the payment. Also you can get the invoice from the Receipt page (the link to the Receipt is sent you by email during the payment).

### [#](#payment-is-not-working) Payment is not working, what to do?

If FastSpring rejects your bank card, try using PayPal instead (usually FastSpring can not do anything when the bank card is being rejected).

Sometimes FastSpring also experiences technical issues. In such cases just try to make the purchase again after some time.

If your payment still does not go through try to email FastSpring atÂ support@fastspring.com

### [#](#paid-but-no-license-keys) I paid but did not receive license keys

Sometimes payment gateways experiences technical issues and it may take several hours to finish processing the payment and send you license keys. Also you may receive license keys for one payment and not receive for another. In such cases just wait… After few hours keys will be sent to you.

### [#](#are-the-pricing-inclusive-of-tax) Are the pricing inclusive of tax?

You can read about taxesÂ [here](https://fastspring.com/docs/about-vat-and-sales-tax/).

### [#](#refund) Can I get a refund?

No. We don’t provide refunds. See Refund Policy [here](https://freescout.net/modules/).

### [#](#where-can-i-find-license-codes-after-purchasing) Where can I find license keys after purchasing?

Find an email with “*[FreeScout] Purchase Receipt*” subject in your mailbox (make sure to check a spam folder) or request your license keys usingÂ [this form](https://freescout.net/remind-license-keys/)Â (do not translate the received email using automatic translation tool as it may distort your license keys).

### [#](#how-will-i-get-the-code-of-the-module-how-can-i-download-the-files-locally-as-a-backup) How will I get the code of the module? How can I download the files locally?

Module source code will be downloaded into /Modules/ folder in your FreeScout. If you don’t see modules in “ManageÂ Â» Modules” it means your server is not configured properly and FreeScout can’t access https://freescout.net. Check logs inÂ “ManageÂ Â» Logs Â» App Logs” and try to fix the issue or [find someone](https://github.com/freescout-help-desk/freescout/wiki/Hire-Developer) who can help you to properly set up the FreeScout.

### [#](#download-in-local-network) My FreeScout is located in a local network and does not have access to the Internet. How can I download modules?

The only way to download modules in this case is to set a up an extra FreeScout instance, download modules there and copy them from /Modules folder to your FreeScout instance in the local network.

In order to activate modules you can temporary set up a proxy allowing Internet access, setÂ APP\_PROXY=https://your-proxy.example.org parameter in .env file and clear cache.

### [#](#will-it-be-possible-to-use-one-license-on-different-subdomains) Will it be possible to use one license on different subdomains?

Although modules are open source and can be used and modified in any way, we are humbly asking to use each license key on one FreeScout instance as appreciation of our hard work. So clickÂ `Deactivate License`Â button on Modules page in your FreeScout to transfer a module between FreeScout instances.

### [#](#dev-and-prod-license)Â Can I use the same license on my development and production FreeScout instance?

Unfortunately there is no workaround for this.

### [#](#where-can-i-find-license-codes-after-purchasing) Can I resell FreeScout modules?

Unfortunately we don’t allow reselling FreeScout modules.

### [#](#will-all-the-modules-be-backward-compatible-with-new-freescout-releases) Will all the modules be backward compatible with new FreeScout releases.

Yes.

### [#](#deactivate-license) Is it possible to transfer/disable the module licenses from the old domain and reactivate them on the new domain?

Yes. The license can be deactivated on **ANY FREESCOUT INSTANCE** – old or new or even on <https://demo.freescout.net> (just register there). First install theÂ **LATEST VERSION**Â of the FreeScout (otherwise this method may not work). UseÂ `Deactivate License`Â button. You don’t need to know your previous domain, only license key.

### [#](#modifying-modules) Can I change module’s code according to my needs?

You can change official modules code according to your needs. If you add some awesome features to modules or fix some bugs feel free to send us updated module at support@freescout.net. We will revise your additions and maybe update the module in the Modules Directory.

### [#](#if-a-module-does-not-work-on-my-freescout-installation-will-you-help-me) If a module does not work on my FreeScout installation will you help me?

No. Modules pages have detailed “Troubleshooting” section – make sure to check them. FreeScout Team only fixes confirmed bugs in modules, but does not provide a personal assistance. You may need to find a developer who can take a look into your issue.

### [#](#will-i-receive-a-support-after-purchasing-a-module) Will I receive a support after purchasing a module?

Technical support is limited to fixing bugs.

### [#](#will-i-receive-a-support-after-purchasing-a-module) FreeScout is not working after installing a module

See [this](https://github.com/freescout-help-desk/freescout/wiki/FreeScout-Modules#-freescout-or-module-is-not-working-after-installing-a-module).

### [#](#translate-modules) How can I translate modules?

Before translating make sure that you have the latest version of the FreeScout installed.

1. Log in as admin and update application to the latest version in “Manage Â» System”.
2. Go to “Manage Â» Modules” and update all modules to the latest versions.
3. Go toÂ “Manage Â» Translate”.
4. ClickÂ `Import translations`.
5. Choose a group in the dropdown to display translations.
6. Translate texts.
7. ClickÂ `Publish translations`Â to apply translations in your app.
8. ClickÂ `Send Translations`Â to send translations to FreeScout team. If sending does not work, download translations usingÂ `Download as ZIP`Â button and send toÂ support@freescout.net

### [#](#license) How do official paid modules comply with AGPL-license?

Modules are open source and licensed under AGPL-3.0 license. “Open source” does not mean it has to be free. We are calling our approach to distributing modules a “trust-based business model”. It complies with all AGPL requirements. Official modules are acquired by purchasing a license key. License key allows to download full source code of a module and use it, [modify](https://freescout.net/modules-faq/#modifying-modules) or share any way you want. As we put our hearts and souls into the development of modules over years, on each module’s page we have a humble request to use each license key on one FreeScout instance only. You may show appreciation of our work and respect this request or disregard it. You are free to modify the code and use modules on more than one FreeScout instance if you want to. We never disable from our side purchased license keys, even if someone decides to use some module on more than one FreeScout instance.
