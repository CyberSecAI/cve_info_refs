- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WP Job Portal plugin lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact varies on a case-by-case basis.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious actor crafts a request that is then unknowingly executed by an authenticated user, leading to unintended actions within the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to trick an authenticated user into executing a crafted request. This typically involves social engineering tactics like sending malicious links or embedding them into other websites. No specific privileges are needed by the attacker to trigger the vulnerability, other than being able to cause a victim to unknowingly make the malicious request.
