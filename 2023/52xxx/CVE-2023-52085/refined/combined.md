# Local File Inclusion through Server Side Template Injection via LESS compilation of values provided to the Backend ColorPicker FormWidget

Low

[LukeTowers](/LukeTowers)
published
GHSA-2x7r-93ww-cxrq
Dec 28, 2023

## Package

composer

winter/wn-backend-module
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

< 1.2.4

## Patched versions

1.2.4

## Description

### Impact

Users with access to backend forms that include a [ColorPicker FormWidget](https://wintercms.com/docs/v1.2/docs/backend/forms#color-picker) can provide a value that would then be included without further processing in the compilation of custom stylesheets via LESS. This had the potential to lead to a Local File Inclusion vulnerability.

By default, only the Brand Settings (backend.manage\_branding) and Mail Brand Settings (system.manage\_mail\_templates) forms both include the colorpicker formwidget and pass the provided value to be compiled in LESS, however it is also common for themes to include it on their Theme Customization (cms.manage\_theme\_options) form and it is technically possible for the values on that form to also be used in LESS compilation: <https://wintercms.com/docs/v1.2/docs/themes/development#asset-compiler-variables>.

### Patches

This issue has been patched in v1.2.4.

### Workarounds

Apply [5bc9257](https://github.com/wintercms/winter/commit/5bc9257fe2bc47d8b786a1b1bf96bafad23d8ddd) manually if unable to upgrade to v1.2.4.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
