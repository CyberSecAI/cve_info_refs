| The default approach we use causes invalid timestamp values: [steve-community/steve#1292](https://github.com/steve-community/steve/issues/1292)  We need a mechanism that closely follows XSD:dateTime and ISO 8601, but also respects some of the flexibilities: optional fractions, optional offset/timezone. |

| Checklist  * I checked other issues already, but found no answer/solution * I checked the documentation and wiki, but found no answer/solution * I am running the latest version and the issue still occurs * I am sure that this issue is about SteVe (and not about the charging station software or something unrelated to SteVe)  Specifications ``` SteVe Version     : 3.6.0 Operating system  : Ubuntu 22.04.1 JDK               : openjdk version "11.0.20.1" Database          : version 1.0.3  ``` Description When sending a StartTransaction OCPP message with the `timestamp` parameter set to `1000000`, the server incorrectly stores the `start_timestamp` in the database as `0000-00-00 00:00:00.000000`. This leads to an SQL exception when the system tries to retrieve the transaction data. Steps to Reproduce  1. Send a StartTransaction OCPP message with `timestamp` set to `1000000`. 2. Observe the `start_timestamp` in the database; note that it is stored as `0000-00-00 00:00:00.000000`. 3. Navigate to the web interface to view the transaction data. 4. Encounter the SQL exception error as shown in the attached screenshot.  Expected Behavior The server should handle the `timestamp` value properly by storing a valid timestamp or rejecting the message if the timestamp is invalid. Actual Behavior The server is storing an invalid timestamp which causes an SQL exception when attempting to read the transaction data, as seen in the error message: `Error while reading field: 'stevedb'.'transaction'.'start_timestamp'`.
