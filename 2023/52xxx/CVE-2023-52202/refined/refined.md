- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress plugin "HTML5 MP3 Player with Folder Feedburner" is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: PHP Object Injection vulnerability. This allows an attacker to execute code injection, SQL injection, path traversal, denial of service, and more if a proper POP chain is present.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to code injection, SQL injection, path traversal, denial of service, and potentially full system compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered via PHP object injection, likely through a vulnerable input. The specific input is not detailed in the provided text.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to supply malicious input that the application processes in a way that triggers the unserialization of PHP objects. The specific privileges required are not detailed, but the text mentions "Author" privilege.
