Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-52083:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that files uploaded to the Winter CMS Media Manager were only sanitized upon upload, but not when they were renamed. This oversight allowed a malicious user with the appropriate permissions to upload a file, and then rename it to an SVG file, bypassing the sanitization process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary weakness is the potential for a stored XSS attack. By renaming an uploaded file to an SVG, the attacker could embed malicious JavaScript within the SVG file which could then be executed in a victim's browser.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application failed to re-sanitize file content when the file is renamed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **XSS Execution:** If a victim visits the direct URL of the maliciously crafted SVG file, the embedded JavaScript code would be executed in their browser.
- **Limited Scope:** Although an XSS vulnerability exists, the impact is mitigated by the fact that the attacker requires the `media.manage_media` permission and the application needs to use local storage for media files. The XSS would only be triggered if a victim directly visits the URL of the maliciously uploaded SVG.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability over the network
- **File Upload:** The attacker needs to upload a file to the Media Manager and then rename it.
- **URL Trigger:** The victim needs to be tricked into visiting the URL of the renamed malicious SVG.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **High Privileges:** The attacker needs to have the `media.manage_media` permission in the Winter CMS backend to upload and rename files in the Media Manager.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to convince the victim to directly visit the URL of the maliciously uploaded SVG.
- **Specific application configuration:** The application would have to be using local storage where uploaded files are served under the same domain as the application itself instead of a CDN.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is considered to have a low severity because of the need for high privileges and user interaction.
- The vulnerability has been patched in version 1.2.4 of Winter CMS.
