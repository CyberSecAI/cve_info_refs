```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Unified Remote Desktop application's 'Remote' upload endpoint uses `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`, allowing any website to make requests to the localhost endpoint, uploading a malicious remote zip file.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "CORS Misconfiguration: The use of `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` on the upload endpoint allows cross-origin requests.",
    "Remote Code Execution: Arbitrary code execution via the `remote.lua` file within the uploaded zip archive."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote code execution on the victim's machine with the privileges of the user running the Unified Remote application.",
  "Attack vectors": "A malicious webpage can be crafted to send a POST request to the vulnerable endpoint on the user's localhost, triggering the upload and execution of malicious Lua code.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to host a malicious webpage accessible to the victim. The victim must have the Unified Remote application running and must be tricked into visiting the malicious webpage."
