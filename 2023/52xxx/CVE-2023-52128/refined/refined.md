- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress White Label Plugin <= 2.9.0 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to forge requests.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful CSRF attack could force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors**:  The attacker would need to trick a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website that crafts a forged request to the vulnerable plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs no authentication but relies on a logged-in user being tricked into making the request.
