- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress Floating Button plugin versions 6.0 and below are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful CSRF attack could force higher-privileged users to perform unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact would vary based on the actions the plugin allows, potentially leading to data modification, deletion, or privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker would need to craft a malicious request that targets the vulnerable plugin's functionality. The user must be authenticated on the targeted website. This request is then sent to the victim and triggered when the victim is logged in.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need to be authenticated. The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request and trick a logged-in user to trigger it.
