# TIFFRasterScanlineSize64 produce too-big size and could cause OOM

# Summary

`TIFFRasterScanlineSize64` could produce a very huge size with a crafted tiff input.
Perform allocation on the size returned by `TIFFRasterScanlineSize64` could cause OOM.

Remote attackers could utilize this bug cause deny-of-services.

# Details about the bug

As referred from the document of the API [TIFFRasterScanlineSize](http://www.simplesystems.org/libtiff/functions/TIFFsize.html?highlight=tiffrasterscanlinesize#c.TIFFRasterScanlineSize):

> TIFFRasterScanlineSize() returns the size in bytes of a complete decoded and packed raster scanline.

The API `TIFFRasterScanlineSize` returns a size of bytes.

However, the size returned by `TIFFRasterScanlineSize` can be controlled by user input and the size is not checked.

`TIFFRasterScanlineSize` calls `TIFFRasterScanlineSize64()` and `TIFFRasterScanlineSize64` calculate the size by the user controllable fields:  `td->td_bitspersample` and `td->td_imagewidth`.

In the [triger\_input\_41](https://github.com/PromptFuzz/crash_inputs/raw/main/libtiff/oom1/triger_input_41), their offsets are 0xC2-0xC3 and 0xAA-0xAb respectively.

```
uint64_t TIFFRasterScanlineSize64(TIFF *tif)
{
    static const char module[] = "TIFFRasterScanlineSize64";
    TIFFDirectory *td = &tif->tif_dir;
    uint64_t scanline;

    scanline =
        _TIFFMultiply64(tif, td->td_bitspersample, td->td_imagewidth, module);
    if (td->td_planarconfig == PLANARCONFIG_CONTIG)
    {
        scanline =
            _TIFFMultiply64(tif, scanline, td->td_samplesperpixel, module);
        return (TIFFhowmany8_64(scanline));
    }
    else
        return (_TIFFMultiply64(tif, TIFFhowmany8_64(scanline),

```

If the user controls it returns a huge size, the successive allocations on this size could cause OOMs.

> libtiff/tools/tiffcp.c also contains such a usage. This usage is not a rare scenario.

# Steps to reproduce

1. Download the poc input: [triger\_input\_41](https://github.com/PromptFuzz/crash_inputs/raw/main/libtiff/oom1/triger_input_41)
   (How one can reproduce the issue - this is very important)
2. Built libtiff with ASAN
3. Compile the Poc program:

```
clang++ -fsanitize=fuzzer,address -g -O0 -I/libtiff/include poc.cc -o poc.out libtiff.a -lz -ljpeg -llzma -ljbig
```

4. Trigger the bug:

```
./poc.out triger_input_41
```
