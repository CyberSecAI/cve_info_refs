### **[karlseguin](/karlseguin)** commented [Dec 24, 2023](#issuecomment-1868436618)

| Thanks. I now check the path for non-printable bytes. I realize that the spec requires more than this (i.e. some printable characters must be escaped, in some cases depending on where they are). But hopefully this check addresses the security issue.  I also added checks for the header key and values (I believe these checks are compliant). |
