The content is related to CVE-2023-52308.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A floating-point exception (FPE) occurs in the `paddle.amin` function when the input tensor `x` has invalid dimensions. Specifically, it crashes when the input tensor has dimensions of `[0, 0, 6, 3]`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is due to improper handling of invalid dimensions in the `paddle.amin` function, leading to a floating-point exception.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exploitation of this vulnerability causes a crash due to the FPE.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by providing an input tensor with specific invalid dimensions (e.g., `[0, 0, 6, 3]`) to the `paddle.amin` function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to pass a tensor with the specific invalid dimensions to the vulnerable function. No special privileges or access is needed.
