Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities:

**Vulnerability 1: Out-of-bounds read in `simple_log.cpp`**

*   **Root Cause:** The `_log` function in `simple_log.cpp` uses `vprintf` to print log messages. When a large or malformed HTTP request (e.g., very long URL, method, or header values) is processed, the log message generated can exceed the stack buffer allocated for the `printf` format string causing an out-of-bounds read.
*   **Weakness:**  Improper bounds checking on the size of the format string passed to `vprintf`.
*  **Impact:**  A dynamic-stack-buffer-overflow leading to a crash.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a malformed HTTP request with a large method, URL or header value.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker needs to send crafted HTTP requests to the server.

**Vulnerability 2: Use-after-free in `epoll_socket.cpp`**

*   **Root Cause:** In the `read_func` function within `epoll_socket.cpp`, a `TaskData` object is deleted after `handle_readable_event` is called, and a pointer to an `EpollContext` stored within the `TaskData` is used to set `_ctx_status` to `CONTEXT_READ_OVER` after the object is deleted. Additionally, the `close_and_release` function, which is called on a different thread, frees the `EpollContext` object. This leads to use-after-free when the first thread tries to access that freed memory.
*   **Weakness:** The `EpollContext` is used by multiple threads, and the logic that releases the `EpollContext` is not synchronized with the function that accesses the `EpollContext`.
*   **Impact:** Heap use-after-free, leading to a crash.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending multiple consecutive HTTP requests to the server.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker needs to establish multiple connections to the server.

The provided commit `17405b975948abc216f6a085d2d027ec1cfd5766` addresses these issues by:
*   Fixing the log overflow by limiting the size of the logged string in `sim_parser.cpp`.
*   Fixing the use-after-free in `epoll_socket.cpp` by setting `epoll_context->_ctx_status = CONTEXT_READ_OVER;` within `handle_readable_event` itself (before the epoll context could be deallocated by another thread) and removing the same logic from the thread pool's read_func handler.
