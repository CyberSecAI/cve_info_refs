Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) in FlyCms v1.0.
*   The vulnerability is located in the `/system/site/config_footer_updagte` component.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CSRF:** The application does not properly validate the origin of requests, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can modify the footer configuration of the website by tricking a logged-in administrator into submitting a crafted request.
*   In this specific PoC, the attacker is injecting arbitrary HTML code (`<footer id="footer"> <div class="container"> cs123 </div> </footer>`) into the footer, which would allow for defacement or malicious code injection.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through a malicious HTML page that contains a form targeting the vulnerable endpoint (`/system/site/config_footer_updagte`).
*   The attacker would need to trick a logged-in administrator into visiting the malicious page or otherwise triggering the crafted form submission.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious HTML page or find a way to inject malicious HTML into a context that a logged-in administrator may visit.
*   The attacker does not need to know the victim's authentication credentials, but the victim must have an active authenticated session with the FlyCms application.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided PoC uses a simple HTML form with a hidden input for the footer code.
*   The PoC demonstrates successful modification of the website's footer.
*   The provided screenshots show the injected payload successfully displayed on the target website, validating the CSRF vulnerability.
