# SQL Injection in explain DB queries.

High

[ildyria](/ildyria)
published
GHSA-rjwv-5j3m-p5x4
Dec 28, 2023

## Package

composer

lychee-org/lychee
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

>= 4.9.3

## Patched versions

5.0.2

## Description

### Impact

SQL injection on any binding for any Lychee installation with 4.9.3 <= and <= 5.0.1 using mysql/mariadb.

This injection is only active for users with the following `.env` settings:

```
DB_LOG_SQL=true
DB_LOG_SQL_EXPLAIN=true

```

**Note: The defaults settings of Lychee are safe (both are set to `false`).**

### Patches

Patch is provided on version 5.0.2.

### Workarounds

Disable SQL EXPLAIN logging:

Set `DB_LOG_SQL_EXPLAIN` to false.

### Severity

High

8.8

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
