## Important Security Updates

We are pleased to introduce you to version 7.5.1 of Allegra, which includes very important security improvements and enhancements for better usability. This update is part of our commitment to continuously offer you a secure and efficient product.

To address the security vulnerabilities listed below, it is strongly recommended to update to the latest Allegra version 7.5.1. Upon installation, a fix will be applied for each ZDI CAN listed in the table below, except for ZDI-CAN-22360. Cloud customers do not need to take any action, as we have updated their instances immediately following the disclosure.

Additional note on ZDI-CAN-22360 for On-Premise customers: Please check whether you have changed the Allegra database default password after installation.
