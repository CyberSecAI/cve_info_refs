Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-52328:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, specifically the `PageSize` parameter in the `operation.php` component. This missing validation allows for the injection of arbitrary script.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A remote attacker can execute arbitrary script within the context of the current user. This could potentially lead to remote code execution on the affected server.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack. An attacker sends a crafted request containing malicious script in the `PageSize` parameter to the vulnerable component.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated but must trick a user into visiting a malicious page or opening a malicious file.
- The attacker needs to be able to make network requests to the vulnerable application.
