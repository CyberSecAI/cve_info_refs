The provided content relates to CVE-2023-52074.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) in FlyCms v1.0.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The application lacks proper CSRF protection mechanisms, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to modify site settings by submitting a crafted form request without the user's knowledge or consent, potentially leading to defacement or other unauthorized changes.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack is performed by embedding a crafted HTML form on a malicious website. When a logged-in user visits the malicious website, the embedded form is automatically submitted, sending a request to the vulnerable `webconfig_updagte` endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious website that the victim (a logged-in FlyCms user) can access. The attacker does not need direct access to the FlyCms instance. The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint and parameters.
