Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-52090:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability resides within the Trend Micro Apex One Virus Scan Engine. It is caused by improper link following when handling mount points.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Link Following Vulnerability:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to manipulate the file system using mount points to delete files via the VSApiNt driver. This is due to a flaw in how the Virus Scan Engine follows links/mount points.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Local Privilege Escalation:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to escalate their privileges to SYSTEM level.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By escalating privileges, the attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the SYSTEM user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access Required:** The attacker needs to have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system. This can be achieved through various means like malware execution, exploiting other vulnerabilities, or social engineering.
- **Mount Point Creation:** The attacker creates a mount point, which is then abused by the vulnerable driver.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low-Privilege Code Execution:** The attacker must have the ability to execute code with low privileges on the target machine.
- **Local System Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable by a local attacker, meaning they need to have some form of access to the target system.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in the Virus Scan Engine of Trend Micro Apex One.
- The vulnerability was reported to Trend Micro on 2023-08-03.
- Trend Micro has released patches to address the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is identified by ZDI-CAN-21425.
