# Spring Boot 2.5.15 and 2.6.15 available now, fixing CVE-2023-20883

[Releases](/blog/category/releases) | [Phil Webb](/team/philwebb) |  May 18, 2023 | [...](/blog/2023/05/18/spring-boot-2-5-15-and-2-6-15-available-now#disqus_thread)

I happy to announce that Spring Boot `2.5.15` and `2.6.15` have been released and are now available from Maven Central.

This release follows a request from a customer with commercial support that was looking to have the ability to upgrade to later versions of SnakeYAML.

This release also includes fixes for [CVE-2023-20883: Spring Boot Welcome Page DoS Vulnerability](https://spring.io/security/cve-2023-20883) as well as [CVE-2023-20873: Security Bypass With Wildcard Pattern Matching on Cloud Foundry](https://spring.io/security/cve-2023-20873).

If you're interested in purchasing commercial support for Spring, please see <https://spring.io/support>.

# CVE-2023-20873: Security Bypass With Wildcard Pattern Matching on Cloud Foundry

HIGH | APRIL 20, 2023 | CVE-2023-20873
# Description

In Spring Boot versions 3.0.0 - 3.0.5, 2.7.0 - 2.7.10, 2.6.0 - 2.6.14, 2.5.0 - 2.5.14 and older unsupported versions, an application that is deployed to Cloud Foundry could be susceptible to a security bypass.

Specifically, an application is vulnerable when all of the following are true:

* You have code that can handle requests that match `/cloudfoundryapplication/**`. Typically, this will be if there is a catch-all request mapping which matches `/**`.
* The application is deployed to Cloud Foundry.

NOTE: Applications using Spring Cloud Config Server can handle requests to `/cloudfoundryapplication/**` by default and can be vulnerable if deployed to Cloud Foundry.

An application is not vulnerable if any of the following is true:

* The application is not deployed to Cloud Foundry
* You have disabled Cloud Foundry actuator endpoints with `management.cloudfoundry.enabled` set to `false`.
* Your application does not have handler mappings that can handle requests to `/cloudfoundryapplication/**`.

# Affected Spring Products and Versions

Spring Boot

* 3.0.0 to 3.0.5
* 2.7.0 to 2.7.10
* 2.6.0 to 2.6.14
* 2.5.0 to 2.5.14
* Older, unsupported versions are also affected

# Mitigation

Users of affected versions should apply the following mitigation: 3.0.x users should upgrade to 3.0.6+. 2.7.x users should upgrade to 2.7.11+. 2.6.x users should upgrade to 2.6.15+. 2.5.x users should upgrade to 2.5.15+. Users of older, unsupported versions should upgrade to 3.0.6+ or 2.7.11+.

Workarounds: Disable Cloud Foundry actuator endpoints by setting `management.cloudfoundry.enabled` to `false`.

# CVE-2023-20883: Spring Boot Welcome Page DoS Vulnerability

HIGH | MAY 19, 2023 | CVE-2023-20883
# Description

In Spring Boot versions 3.0.0 - 3.0.6, 2.7.0 - 2.7.11, 2.6.0 - 2.6.14, 2.5.0 - 2.5.14 and older unsupported versions, there is potential for a denial-of-service (DoS) attack if Spring MVC is used together with a reverse proxy cache.

Specifically, an application is vulnerable if all of the conditions are true:

* The application has Spring MVC auto-configuration enabled. This is the case by default if Spring MVC is on the classpath.
* The application makes use of Spring Boot's welcome page support, either static or templated.
* Your application is deployed behind a proxy which caches 404 responses.

Your application is NOT vulnerable if any of the following are true:

* Spring MVC auto-configuration is disabled. This is true if `WebMvcAutoConfiguration` is explicitly excluded, if Spring MVC is not on the classpath, or if `spring.main.web-application-type` is set to a value other than `SERVLET`.
* The application does not use Spring Boot's welcome page support.
* You do not have a proxy which caches 404 responses.

# Affected Spring Products and Versions

Spring Boot

3.0.0 to 3.0.6
2.7.0 to 2.7.11
2.6.0 to 2.6.14
2.5.0 to 2.5.14

Older, unsupported versions are also affected

# Mitigation

Users of affected versions should apply the following mitigations:

* 3.0.x users should upgrade to 3.0.7+
* 2.7.x users should upgrade to 2.7.12+
* 2.6.x users should upgrade to 2.6.15+
* 2.5.x users should upgrade to 2.5.15+

Users of older, unsupported versions should upgrade to 3.0.7+ or 2.7.12+.

Workarounds: configure the reverse proxy not to cache 404 responses and/or not to cache responses to requests to the root (`/`) of the application.
