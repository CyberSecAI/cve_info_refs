- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a missing bounds check in the `keyinstall` component, which could lead to an out-of-bounds write.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper Input Validation (CWE-20) leading to an out-of-bounds write.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Local escalation of privilege, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution with System execution privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: Local exploitation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have System execution privileges on the device. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.
