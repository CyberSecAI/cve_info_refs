Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2023-20775:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A buffer copy operation lacks proper size checks on the input data before writing to the destination buffer. This leads to a classic buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **CWE-120:** Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow'). The vulnerability stems from the absence of input validation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** Successful exploitation can lead to local privilege escalation. An attacker could potentially gain higher privileges on the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local attack: The vulnerability requires local system execution privileges for exploitation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have System execution privileges. This means they would need some level of access or compromise on the system before they could leverage this vulnerability.
