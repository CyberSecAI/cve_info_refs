Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2023-20862:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in how Spring Security handles the security context during logout when using serialized sessions. Specifically, it fails to properly clear the security context under certain conditions, and does not allow to explicitly save an empty security context to the `HttpSessionSecurityContextRepository`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Security Context Clearing on Logout:** When using serialized sessions (e.g., Spring Session) with `invalidateHttpSession(false)` and either `SecurityContextHolderFilter` or `requireExplicitSave(true)`, the logout process does not properly clear the security context.
*   **Inability to Explicitly Save Empty Context:** It is not possible to explicitly save an empty `SecurityContext` to the `HttpSessionSecurityContextRepository`.
*   **Custom Security Context Repository Issue:** Applications using custom `SecurityContextRepository` implementations that do not rely on the `HttpSession` are also vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Session Fixation:** Users may remain authenticated even after performing a logout action, potentially leading to unauthorized access to resources.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive information related to the user's session might be exposed due to the incomplete logout process.
*   **Data Modification/DoS:** While not explicitly stated in the spring advisory, the NetApp advisory indicates the possibility of data modification and denial of service. This is likely a consequence of the session fixation impact.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability by targeting applications that use Spring Security's logout support with serialized sessions and `invalidateHttpSession(false)`, along with `SecurityContextHolderFilter` or `requireExplicitSave(true)`.
*   Applications manually logging users out by saving an empty `SecurityContext` are vulnerable.
*   Custom `SecurityContextRepository` implementations not using `HttpSession` are vulnerable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker would need to interact with the vulnerable application, specifically the logout functionality.
*   No specific network position or privileges are required (as indicated by the CVSS vector `AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U`).

**Affected NetApp Products:**

*   Active IQ Unified Manager for Linux
*   Active IQ Unified Manager for Microsoft Windows
*   Active IQ Unified Manager for VMware vSphere

**Unaffected NetApp Products**
The advisory lists many unaffected products, demonstrating the widespread nature of the NetApp product line and the specific impact of this vulnerability.

**Mitigation:**
The primary mitigation is to upgrade to the fixed versions of spring security, which are
* 5.7.8
* 5.8.3
* 6.0.3
NetApp also released patched versions for the affected products.
* Active IQ Unified Manager for Microsoft Windows: 9.13P1
* Active IQ Unified Manager for VMware vSphere: 9.13P1
* Active IQ Unified Manager for Linux: 9.13P1

**Additional Notes:**

*   The NetApp advisory acknowledges public discussion of this vulnerability, aligning with the Spring Security advisory.
*   The CVSS score of 9.8 indicates a critical severity due to the potential impact of exploitation.
*   The vulnerability is present only if serialized sessions are used in combination with  `invalidateHttpSession(false)` and `SecurityContextHolderFilter` or `requireExplicitSave(true)`,  as well as custom `SecurityContextRepository` implementations that do not rely on `HttpSession`.
