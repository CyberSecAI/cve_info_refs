Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2023-20665:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a missing bounds check in the `ril` (Radio Interface Layer). This lack of validation allows for out-of-bounds access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-20 Improper Input Validation**: The core issue is the failure to properly validate input data, leading to out-of-bounds memory access.
- **Out-of-bounds read:** A read operation is performed outside the allocated memory region due to the missing bounds check.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure (ID):** Successful exploitation could lead to local information disclosure, where an attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive data from the affected device memory.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local: The attacker needs to have local access to the device to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have system execution privileges on the target device.
- No user interaction is required.
