      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to incorrect error checking when parsing ingress LLDP packets.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Incorrect error checking in LLDP packet parsing"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a steady stream of crafted LLDP packets to an affected device, causing a memory leak, which could result in a denial of service (DoS) condition when the device unexpectedly reloads.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Sending a steady stream of crafted LLDP packets to an affected device."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An unauthenticated, adjacent attacker with the ability to send crafted LLDP packets in the same broadcast domain (Layer 2 adjacent) as the affected device.",
      "additional_details": "The vulnerability cannot be exploited by transit traffic; the crafted LLDP packet must be targeted to a directly connected interface. The attack surface can be reduced by disabling LLDP on interfaces where it is not required. An exploit of this vulnerability can result in a memory leak in the LLDP process which could cause a crash of the device once there is insufficient system memory available. To monitor memory usage of the LLDP process, use the ps aux --sort -rss CLI command or the ps aux --sort -rss | grep lldp CLI command. In the output, the VSZ column indicates the total amount of memory in use by the LLDP process. If this number slowly increases over time and never decreases, this could be an indication that this vulnerability is being exploited. A device reboot is required to reclaim the memory."
