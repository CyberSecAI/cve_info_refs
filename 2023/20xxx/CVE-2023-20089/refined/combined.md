## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |
| **Hours** | 24 hours a day, 7 days a week |

## Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco

There are several ways to stay connected and receive the latest security vulnerability information from Cisco. Customers should review the following table, and subsequent summaries, to determine the appropriate option for them:

| **Cisco.com** | <https://www.cisco.com/security/> |

| **My Notifications** | <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html> |

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

### **RSS Feeds**

Cisco security vulnerability information is also available via RSS feeds from Cisco.com. These feeds are free and do not require an active Cisco.com registration. For information on how to subscribe to the RSS feeds, visit the [Cisco Security RSS Feeds page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44).

### **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API**

The Cisco PSIRT openVuln application programming interface (API) is a RESTful API that conforms to the [representational state transfer](https://restfulapi.net/) (REST) software architectural style and allows customers to obtain Cisco security vulnerability information in different machine-consumable formats. To learn about accessing and using the API, visit the [PSIRT page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) on the Cisco DevNet website.

### **My Notifications**

The [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) allows registered Cisco.com users to subscribe to and receive important Cisco product and technology information, including Cisco Security Advisories. This service provides an improved unified subscription experience, allowing users to choose the timing of notifications as well as the notification delivery method (email or RSS feed).

| **Additional Public Relations** | media\_pr@cisco.com |

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |
| **Hours** | 24 hours a day, 7 days a week |

## Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco

There are several ways to stay connected and receive the latest security vulnerability information from Cisco. Customers should review the following table, and subsequent summaries, to determine the appropriate option for them:

| **Cisco.com** | <https://www.cisco.com/security/> |

| **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API** | [https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT/](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) |
| **My Notifications** | <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html> |

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

### **RSS Feeds**

Cisco security vulnerability information is also available via RSS feeds from Cisco.com. These feeds are free and do not require an active Cisco.com registration. For information on how to subscribe to the RSS feeds, visit the [Cisco Security RSS Feeds page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44).

### **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API**

The Cisco PSIRT openVuln application programming interface (API) is a RESTful API that conforms to the [representational state transfer](https://restfulapi.net/) (REST) software architectural style and allows customers to obtain Cisco security vulnerability information in different machine-consumable formats. To learn about accessing and using the API, visit the [PSIRT page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) on the Cisco DevNet website.

### **My Notifications**

The [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) allows registered Cisco.com users to subscribe to and receive important Cisco product and technology information, including Cisco Security Advisories. This service provides an improved unified subscription experience, allowing users to choose the timing of notifications as well as the notification delivery method (email or RSS feed). The level of access will be determined by the subscriber's relationship with Cisco.

### Creating a Notification

To create a notification, use the following steps:

1. Log in to the [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) on Cisco.com using a registered Cisco.com account name and password.

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

This vulnerability is due to incorrect error checking when parsing ingress LLDP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a steady stream of crafted LLDP packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a memory leak, which could result in a denial of service (DoS) condition when the device unexpectedly reloads.  **Note:** This vulnerability cannot be exploited by transit traffic through the device. The crafted LLDP packet must be targeted to a directly connected interface, and the attacker must be in the same broadcast domain as the affected device (Layer 2 adjacent). In addition, the attack surface for this vulnerability can be reduced by disabling LLDP on interfaces where it is not required.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-aci-lldp-dos-ySCNZOpX>  This advisory is part of the February 2023 Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see [Cisco Event Response: February 2023 Semiannual Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-75057).  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches in ACI Mode if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco NX-OS Software and have the LLDP feature enabled.  For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. Determine Whether LLDP is Enabled To determine the LLDP status of a Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switch in ACI Mode, use the **show lldp interface ethernet *port/interface*** command. If the transmit (**tx**) and receive (**rx**) statuses are **Y**, LLDP is enabled on the interface, as in the following example:  ```   #show lldp interface ethernet port/interfaceInterface Information:Enable (tx/rx/dcbx): Y/Y/N    Port Mac address: 00:fe:c8:09:e2:92   ```    Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:    + Firepower 1000 Series   + Firepower 2100 Series   + Firepower 4100 Series   + Firepower 9300 Security Appliances   + MDS 9000 Series Multilayer Switches   + Nexus 1000 Virtual Edge for VMware vSphere   + Nexus 1000V Switch for Microsoft Hyper-V   + Nexus 1000V Switch for VMware vSphere   + Nexus 3000 Series Switches   + Nexus 5500 Platform Switches   + Nexus 5600 Platform Switches   + Nexus 6000 Series Switches   + Nexus 7000 Series Switches   + Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode   + Secure Firewall 3100 Series   + UCS 6200 Series Fabric Interconnects   + UCS 6300 Series Fabric Interconnects   + UCS 6400 Series Fabric Interconnects   + UCS 6500 Series Fabric Interconnects  Indicators of Compromise  * An exploit of this vulnerability can result in a memory leak in the LLDP process, which could cause a crash of the device once there is insufficient system memory available.  To monitor memory usage of the LLDP process, use the **ps aux --sort -rss** CLI command or the **ps aux --sort -rss | grep lldp** CLI command. In the output, the **VSZ** column indicates the total amount of memory in use by the LLDP process. If this number slowly increases over time and never decreases, this could be an indication that this vulnerability is being exploited. A device reboot is required to reclaim the memory.  ```   leaf# ps aux --sort -rssUSER       PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMANDroot     24764  2.1  3.3 2454992 544656 ?

However, if LLDP is not enabled on an interface, this vulnerability cannot be exploited on that interface. As a mitigation, disable LLDP on all interfaces where it is not required. Use the CLI commands **no lldp transmit** and **no lldp receive**. For additional information, see [Cisco APIC Layer 2 Networking Configuration Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/aci/apic/sw/2-x/L2_config/b_Cisco_APIC_Layer_2_Configuration_Guide/b_Cisco_APIC_Layer_2_Configuration_Guide_chapter_0100.html). While this mitigation has been deployed and was proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released [free software updates](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#ssu) that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.  Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:<https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  The [Cisco Support and Downloads page](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html) on Cisco.com provides information about licensing and downloads.

| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: Low C: High C: None  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: Low A: High A: None  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 7.4 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Unproven   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Not Defined  RC: Confirmed   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 7.4 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High  CR: Not Defined   Select Confidentiality Requirement Parameters  Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Select Integrity Requirement Parameters  Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High  AR: Not Defined   Select Availability Requirement Parameters  Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Vector Parameters  Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Complexity Parameters  Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Select Modified Privileges Required Parameters  Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Select Modified User Interaction Parameters  Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Select Modified Scope Parameters  Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Select Modified Confidentiality Parameters  Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Select Modified Integrity Parameters  Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined   Select Modified Availability Parameters    Environmental Score: 7.4 |

"title": "Summary",
"text": "A vulnerability in the Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) feature for Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches in Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) Mode could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a memory leak, which could result in an unexpected reload of the device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to incorrect error checking when parsing ingress LLDP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a steady stream of crafted LLDP packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a memory leak, which could result in a denial of service (DoS) condition when the device unexpectedly reloads.\r\n\r\nNote: This vulnerability cannot be exploited by transit traffic through the device. The crafted LLDP packet must be targeted to a directly connected interface, and the attacker must be in the same broadcast domain as the affected device (Layer 2 adjacent). In addition, the attack surface for this vulnerability can be reduced by disabling LLDP on interfaces where it is not required.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis advisory is part of the February 2023 Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see Cisco Event Response: February 2023 Semiannual Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-75057\"]."

If the transmit (tx) and receive (rx) statuses are Y, LLDP is enabled on the interface, as in the following example:\r\n\r\n\r\n#show lldp interface ethernet port/interface\r\nInterface Information:Enable (tx/rx/dcbx): Y/Y/N Port Mac address: 00:fe:c8:09:e2:92"

"text": "There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nHowever, if LLDP is not enabled on an interface, this vulnerability cannot be exploited on that interface. As a mitigation, disable LLDP on all interfaces where it is not required. Use the CLI commands no lldp transmit and no lldp receive. For additional information, see Cisco APIC Layer 2 Networking Configuration Guide [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/aci/apic/sw/2-x/L2\_config/b\_Cisco\_APIC\_Layer\_2\_Configuration\_Guide/b\_Cisco\_APIC\_Layer\_2\_Configuration\_Guide\_chapter\_0100.html\"].\r\n While this mitigation has been deployed and was proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment."

"text": "Cisco has released free software updates [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security\_vulnerability\_policy.html#ssu\"] that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.\r\n\r\nCustomers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nThe Cisco Support and Downloads page [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html\"] on Cisco.com provides information about licensing and downloads. This page can also display customer device support coverage for customers who use the My Devices tool.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security\_vulnerability\_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n Cisco NX-OS Software\r\nTo help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco NX-OS Software, Cisco provides the Cisco Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"]. This tool identifies any Cisco security advisories that impact a specific software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities that are described in each advisory (���First Fixed���). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities described in all the advisories that the Software Checker identifies (���Combined First Fixed���).\r\n\r\nTo use the tool, go to the Cisco Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"] page and follow the instructions.

## Minimum Recommended Cisco NX-OS Releases for Cisco Nexus 5600 Series Switches ---

 **Date: February 13, 2023**

This document lists the minimum recommended Cisco NX-OS software release for use with Cisco Nexus 5600 Series switches for both new deployments and existing deployments. Since these are minimum release recommendations, more recent software releases can be used to take advantage of newer hardware and software capabilities. These recommendations are general and should not replace environment specific design review efforts.

 **General Recommendation for New Deployments**

Cisco recommends that customers with new Cisco Nexus 5600 Series deployments choose from the following minimum recommended releases:

Table 1 Cisco Nexus 5600 Recommended Releases

we recommend that you upgrade to these releases at a minimum, if permitted by your current deployment and SAN design. These
recommendations are general and should not replace environment-specific design review efforts. Customers can alternatively
deploy more recent software releases to take advantage of newer hardware and software capabilities.

### Recommendation for SAN Analytics

We recommend to use the current release of Cisco MDS NX-OS. If you are using SAN Analytics and SAN Telemetry Streaming, we
recommend that you upgrade the NX-OS version of the switch to Cisco MDS NX-OS Release 8.4(1a) or later releases. See the Cisco
MDS NX-OS Release 8.4(1a) or later release notes for nondisruptive upgrade procedure.

Before upgrading from Cisco MDS NX-OS Release 8.2(x) or 8.3(x) to 8.4(1a) or later releases, ensure that you disable the SAN
Analytics feature using the feature analytics  command before upgrading and this is a one time requirement.

# Access Interfaces

Physical Ports

## Configuring Leaf Switch Physical Ports Using Policy Association

The procedure below
uses a Quick Start wizard.

| **Note** | ---  This procedure provides the steps for attaching a server to an ACI leaf switch interface. The steps would be the same for attaching other kinds of devices to an ACI leaf switch interface.  Figure 1. Switch Interface Configuration for Bare Metal Server      --- |
| --- | --- |

### Before you begin

* The ACI fabric
  is installed,
  APIC
  controllers are online, and the
  APIC
  cluster is formed and healthy.
* An
  APIC
  fabric administrator account is available that will enable creating the
  necessary fabric infrastructure configurations.
* The target leaf
  switches are registered in the ACI fabric and available.

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | On the APIC menu bar, navigate to Fabric > External Access Policies > Quick Start, and click Configure an interface, PC, and VPC. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | In the Select Switches To Configure Interfaces work area, click the large + to select switches to configure. In the Switches section, click the + to add switch ID(s) from the drop-down list of available switch IDs and click Update. |
| **Step 3** | Click the large + to configure switch interfaces.  The interface policy group is a named policy that specifies the group of interface policies you will apply to the selected interfaces of the switch. Examples of interface policies include Link Level Policy (for example, 1gbit port speed), Storm Control Interface Policy, and so forth.   | **Note** | The Attached Device Type domain is required for enabling an EPG to use the interfaces specified in the switch profile. | | --- | --- |  1. Specify    individual    as the interface type to use. 2. Specify    the interface ID to use. 3. Specify    the interface policies to use. 4. Specify    the attached device type to use. Choose    `Bare Metal` for connecting bare metal servers. Bare    metal uses the    `phys` domain type. 5. Click    Save to update the policy details, then click    Submit to submit the switch profile to the    APIC. The    APIC    creates the switch profile, along with the interface, selector, and attached    device type policies.   **Verification**: Use the CLI show int  command on the switch where the server is attached to verify that the switch interface is configured accordingly. |

---

### What to do next

This completes the
basic leaf interface configuration steps.

| **Note** | ---   While this configuration enables hardware connectivity, no data traffic can flow without a valid application profile, EPG, and contract that is associated with this hardware configuration.   --- |
| --- | --- |

## Configuring Leaf Switch Physical Ports Using Port Association

This procedure provides the steps for attaching a server to an ACI leaf switch interface. The steps would be the same for
attaching other kinds of devices to an ACI leaf switch interface.

### Before you begin

* The ACI fabric is installed, APIC controllers are online, and the APIC cluster is formed and healthy.
* An APIC fabric administrator account is available that will enable creating the necessary fabric infrastructure configurations.
* The target leaf switches are registered in the ACI fabric and available.

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | On the APIC menu bar, navigate to Fabric > Inventory > Inventory, choose a pod and navigate to the Configure tab .  A graphical representation of the switch appears. Choose the port to configure. Once selected, port configure type will appear at the top in the form of a highlighted port configuration type. Choose configuraton type and those configuration parameters will appear. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Once you have assigned the appropriate fields to the configuration, click Submit.  In this configuration, all changes to the leaf switch are done by selecting the port and applying the policy to it. All leaf switch configuration is done right here on this page.   You have selected the port *then* applied a policy to it. |

### What to do next

This completes the basic leaf interface configuration steps.

## Configuring Physical Ports in Leaf Nodes and FEX Devices Using the NX-OS CLI

The commands in the following examples create many managed objects in the Cisco Application Centric
Infrastructure (ACI) policy model that are fully compatible with the REST API/SDK and GUI. However, the CLI user can focus on the intended network
configuration instead of Cisco ACI model internals.

[Example of leaf node ports and FEX ports in Cisco ACI](#task_5AADEE0EAFC54FABBDE56D3180FEAF57__fig_h1g_4sx_rvb) shows examples of Ethernet ports directly on leaf nodes or FEX modules attached to leaf nodes and how each is represented
in the CLI. For FEX ports, the fex-id  is included in the naming of the port itself as in ethernet 101/1/1 . While describing an interface range, the ethernet  keyword need not be repeated as in NX-OS. Example: interface ethernet 101/1/1-2, 102/1/1-2 .

Figure 2. Example of leaf node ports and FEX ports in Cisco ACI

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/500001-600000/500001-510000/500001-501000/500022.jpg)

* Leaf node ID numbers are global.
* The fex-id  numbers are local to each leaf node.
* Note the space after the keyword ethernet .

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | configure  Enters global configuration mode.  Example: ``` apic1# configure ``` |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | leaf node-id  Specifies the leaf nodes to be configured. The node-id  can be a single node ID or a range of IDs, in the form node-id1`-` node-id2 , to which the configuration will be applied.  Example: ``` apic1(config)# leaf 102 ``` |
| **Step 3** | interface type  Specifies the interface that you are configuring. You can specify the interface type and identity. For an Ethernet port, use “ethernet slot / port.”  Example: ``` apic1(config-leaf)# interface ethernet 1/2 ``` |
| **Step 4** | (Optional) fex associate node-id  If the interface or interfaces to be configured are FEX interfaces, you must use this command to attach the FEX module to a leaf node before configuration.   | **Note** | This step is required before creating a port channel using FEX ports. | | --- | --- |   Example: ``` apic1(config-leaf-if)# fex associate 101 ``` |
| **Step 5** | speed speed  The speed setting is shown as an example. At this point you can configure any of the interface settings shown in the table below.  Example: ``` apic1(config-leaf-if)# speed 10G ``` |

---

The following table shows the interface settings that can be configured at this point:

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [no] shut | Shut down physical interface |
| [no] speed *speedValue* | Set the speed for physical interface |
| [no] link debounce time *time* | Set link debounce |
| [no] negotiate auto | Configure negotiate |
| [no] cdp enable | Disable/enable Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) |
| [no] mcp enable | Disable/enable Mis-cabling Protocol (MCP) |
| [no] lldp transmit | Set the transmit for physical interface |
| [no] lldp receive | Set the LLDP receive for physical interface |
| spanning-tree {bpduguard | bpdufilter} {enable | disable} | Configure spanning tree BPDU |
| [no] storm-control level *percentage* [ burst-rate *percentage* ] | Storm-control configuration (percentage) |
| [no] storm-control pps *packets-per-second* burst-rate *packets-per-second* | Storm-control configuration (packets-per-second) |

### Examples

Configure one port in a leaf node. The following example shows how to configure the interface eth1/2 in leaf 101 for the following
properties: speed, cdp, and admin state.

```
apic1# configure
apic1(config)# leaf 101
apic1(config-leaf)# interface ethernet 1/2
apic1(config-leaf-if)# speed 10G
apic1(config-leaf-if)# cdp enable
apic1(config-leaf-if)# no shut
```

Configure multiple ports in multiple leaf nodes. The following example shows the configuration of speed for interfaces eth1/1-10
for each of the leaf nodes 101-103.

```
apic1(config)# leaf 101-103
apic1(config-leaf)# interface eth 1/1-10
apic1(config-leaf-if)# speed 10G
```

Attach a FEX to a leaf node. The following example shows how to attach a FEX module to a leaf node. Unlike in NX-OS, the leaf
node port Eth1/5 is implicitly configured as fabric port and a FEX fabric port channel is created internally with the FEX
uplink port(s). In Cisco ACI, the FEX fabric port channels use default configuration and no user configuration is allowed.

| **Note** | ---   This step is required before creating a port channel using FEX ports, as described in the next example.   --- |
| --- | --- |

```
apic1(config)# leaf 102
apic1(config-leaf)# interface eth 1/5
apic1(config-leaf-if)# fex associate 101
```

Configure FEX ports attached to leaf nodes. This example shows configuration of speed for interfaces eth1/1-10 in FEX module
101 attached to each of the leaf nodes 102-103. The FEX ID 101 is included in the port identifier. FEX IDs start with 101
and are local to a leaf node.

```
apic1(config)# leaf 102-103
apic1(config-leaf)# interface eth 101/1/1-10
apic1(config-leaf-if)# speed 1G
```

Port Cloning

## Cloning Port Configurations

In the Cisco APIC Release 3.2 and later, the Port Cloning feature is supported. After you configure a leaf switch port, you
can copy the configuration and apply it to other ports. This is only supported in the APIC GUI (not in the NX-OS style CLI).

Port cloning is used for small numbers of leaf switch ports (interfaces) that are individually configured, not for interfaces
configured using Fabric Access Policies, that you deploy on multiple nodes in the fabric.

Port cloning is only supported for Layer 2 configurations.

The following policies are not supported on a cloned port:

* Attachable Access Entity
* Storm Control
* DWDM
* MACsec

## Cloning a Configured Leaf Switch Port Using the APIC GUI

This task describes how to clone a leaf switch port that you previously configured. For more information about configuring
ports, see Cisco APIC Layer 2 Networking Configuration Guide.

### Before you begin

Configure a leaf switch port (with supported Layer 2 policies) in the GUI under Fabric > Inventory, and one of the following:

* Topology > Interface > Configuration Mode
* Pod > Interface > Configuration Mode
* Pod> Leaf > Interface > Configuration Mode

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | On the Menu bar, choose Fabric > Inventory. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Navigate to the location where you configured the first port. |
| **Step 3** | For example, expand Pod and choose Leaf. |
| **Step 4** | Click Interface and choose Configuration from the drop-down list under Mode. |
| **Step 5** | Click the + icon on the interface menu bar to choose the leaf switch where the port to clone is located. |
| **Step 6** | Right-click the port you previously configured and choose Copy. |
| **Step 7** | Right-click the port on which you want to copy the configuration and choose Paste. |

Port Channels

## PC Host Load Balancing Algorithms

The following table provides the configurable port channel hash algorithms used in PC host load balancing across Cisco Application Centric
Infrastructure (ACI) leaf node downlinks. This feature was introduced in Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure
Controller (APIC), release 2.3(1e).

Table 1. PC Host Load Balancing Algorithms

| Traffic Type | Hashing Data Points |
| --- | --- |
| End Host PC traffic (configurable) | **For layer 2 frames**: Source MAC address and Destination MAC address  **For IP Traffic**:   * Source IP address * Destination IP address * Layer 4 Source Port * Layer 4 Destination Port |

When there is more than one port channel on a leaf switch, such as Po1 and Po2, then the following scenario is supported:

* Po1: Enable symmetric hash with SIP only.
* Po2: Do not enable symmetric hash. Use default hashing.

However, the following scenario is not supported because the second port channel Po2 has a different hash parameter:

* Po1: Enable symmetric hash with SIP only.
* Po2: Enable symmetric hash with DIP only.

That is, on a single leaf switch, all port channels that require symmetric hashing should use the same hash policy/parameter
or use the default hashing.

| **Note** | ---   Port channel hash algorithms are applied at each individual leaf node independently. The algorithms do not have influence on load balancing within the fabric, such as load balancing to leaf nodes in a vPC pair. Thus, symmetrical hashing is not supported on a vPC.   --- |
| --- | --- |

## ACI Leaf Switch Port Channel Configuration Using the GUI

The procedure
below uses a Quick Start wizard.

| **Note** | ---  This procedure provides the steps for attaching a server to an ACI leaf switch interface. The steps would be the same for attaching other kinds of devices to an ACI leaf switch interface.  Figure 3. Switch Port Channel Configuration      --- |
| --- | --- |

### Before you begin

* The ACI
  fabric is installed,
  APIC
  controllers are online, and the
  APIC
  cluster is formed and healthy.
* An
  APIC
  fabric administrator account is available that will enable creating the
  necessary fabric infrastructure configurations.
* The target
  leaf switches are registered in the ACI fabric and available.

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | On the APIC menu bar, navigate to Fabric > External Access Policies > Quick Start, and click Configure an interface, PC, and vPC. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | In the Select Switches To Configure Interfaces work area, click the large + to select switches to configure. In the Switches section, click the + to add switch ID(s) from the drop-down list of available switch IDs and click Update. |
| **Step 3** | Click the large + to configure switch interfaces.  The interface policy group is a named policy that specifies the group of interface policies you will apply to the selected interfaces of the switch. Examples of interface policies include Link Level Policy (for example, 1gbit port speed), Storm Control Interface Policy, and so forth.   | **Note** | The Attached Device Type is required for enabling an EPG to use the interfaces specified in the switch profile. | | --- | --- |  1. Specify    pc    as the interface type to use. 2. Specify    the interface IDs to use. 3. Specify the interface policies to use. For example, click the Port Channel Policy drop-down arrow to choose an existing port channel policy or to create a new port channel policy.         | **Note** | * Choosing to create a port channel policy displays the Create Port Channel Policy dialog box where you can specify the policy details and enable features such as symmetric hashing. Also note that choosing   the Symmetric hashing option displays the Load Balance Hashing  field, which enables you to configure hash tuple. However, only one customized hashing option can be applied on the same   leaf switch. * Symmetric hashing is not supported on the following switches:    + Cisco Nexus 93128TX   + Cisco Nexus 9372PX   + Cisco Nexus 9372PX-E   + Cisco Nexus 9372TX   + Cisco Nexus 9372TX-E   + Cisco Nexus 9396PX   + Cisco Nexus 9396TX |    | --- | --- | 4. Specify    the attached device type to use. Choose    `Bare Metal` for connecting bare metal servers. Bare    metal uses the    `phys` domain type. 5. Click    Save to update the policy details, then click    Submit to submit the switch profile to the    APIC. The    APIC    creates the switch profile, along with the interface, selector, and attached    device type policies.   **Verification**: Use the CLI show int  command on the switch where the server is attached to verify that the switch interface is configured accordingly. |

### What to do next

This completes the port channel configuration steps.

| **Note** | ---   While this configuration enables hardware connectivity, no data traffic can flow without a valid application profile, EPG, and contract that is associated with this hardware configuration.   --- |

## Configuring Port Channels in Leaf Nodes and FEX Devices Using the NX-OS CLI

Port-channels are logical interfaces in NX-OS used to aggregate bandwidth for multiple physical ports and also for providing
redundancy in case of link failures. In NX-OS, port-channel interfaces are identified by user-specified numbers in the range
1 to 4096 unique within a node. Port-channel interfaces are either configured explicitly (using the interface port-channel command) or created implicitly (using the channel-group command). The configuration of the port-channel interface is applied to all the member ports of the port-channel. There are
certain compatibility parameters (speed, for example) that cannot be configured on the member ports.

In the ACI model, port-channels are configured as logical entities identified by a name to represent a collection of policies
that can be assigned to set of ports in one or more leaf nodes. Such assignment creates one port-channel interface in each
of the leaf nodes identified by an auto-generated number in the range 1 to 4096 within the leaf node, which may be same or
different among the nodes for the same port-channel name. The membership of these port-channels may be same or different as
well. When a port-channel is created on the FEX ports, the same port-channel name can be used to create one port-channel interface
in each of the FEX devices attached to the leaf node. Thus, it is possible to create up to N+1 unique port-channel interfaces
(identified by the auto-generated port-channel numbers) for each leaf node attached to N FEX modules. This is illustrated
with the examples below. Port-channels on the FEX ports are identified by specifying the
fex-id
 along with the port-channel name (
interface port-channel foo fex 101
, for example).

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/500001-600000/500001-510000/500001-501000/500023.jpg)

* N+1 instances per leaf of port-channel foo are possible when each leaf is connected to N FEX nodes.
* Leaf ports and FEX ports cannot be part of the same port-channel instance.
* Each FEX node can have only one instance of port-channel foo.

### Procedure

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | configure  Example: ``` apic1# configure  ``` | Enters global configuration mode. |
| **Step 2** | template port-channel channel-name  Example: ``` apic1(config)# template port-channel foo  ``` | Creates a new port-channel or configures an existing port-channel (global configuration). |
| **Step 3** | [no] switchport access vlan vlan-id tenant tenant-name application application-name epg epg-name  Example: ```  apic1(config-po-ch-if)# switchport access vlan 4 tenant ExampleCorp application Web epg webEpg  ``` | Deploys the EPG with the VLAN on all ports with which the port-channel is associated. |
| **Step 4** | channel-mode active  Example: ``` apic1(config-po-ch-if)# channel-mode active  ```  | **Note** | To enable symmetric hashing, enter the  lacp symmetric-hash   command: ``` apic1(config-po-ch-if)# lacp symmetric-hash  ``` | | --- | --- | | | **Note** | The channel-mode  command is equivalent to the mode option in the channel-group command in NX-OS. In ACI, however, this is supported for the port-channel (not on a member port). | | --- | --- |    Symmetric hashing is not supported on the following switches:   * Cisco Nexus 93128TX * Cisco Nexus 9372PX * Cisco Nexus 9372PX-E * Cisco Nexus 9372TX * Cisco Nexus 9372TX-E * Cisco Nexus 9396PX * Cisco Nexus 9396TX |
| **Step 5** | exit  Example: ``` apic1(config-po-ch-if)# exit  ``` | Returns to configure mode. |
| **Step 6** | leaf node-id  Example: ``` apic1(config)# leaf 101  ``` | Specifies the leaf switches to be configured. The  node-id  can be a single node ID or a range of IDs, in the form  node-id1 `-`  node-id2 , to which the configuration will be applied. |
| **Step 7** | interface type  Example: ``` apic1(config-leaf)# interface ethernet 1/1-2  ``` | Specifies the interface or range of interfaces that you are configuring to the port-channel. |
| **Step 8** | [no] channel-group channel-name  Example: ``` apic1(config-leaf-if)# channel-group foo  ``` | Assigns the interface or range of interfaces to the port-channel. Use the keyword no  to remove the interface from the port-channel. To change the port-channel assignment on an interface, you can enter the channel-group  command without first removing the interface from the previous port-channel. |
| **Step 9** | (Optional) lacp port-priority priority  Example: ```  apic1(config-leaf-if)# lacp port-priority 1000 apic1(config-leaf-if)# lacp rate fast   ``` | (Optional)  This setting and other per-port LACP properties can be applied to member ports of a port-channel at this point.   | **Note** | In the ACI model, these commands are allowed only after the ports are member of a port channel. If a port is removed from a port channel, configuration of these per-port properties are removed as well. | | --- | --- | |

The following
table shows various commands for global configurations of port channel
properties in the ACI model. These commands can also be used for configuring
overrides for port channels in a specific leaf in the (config-leaf-if) CLI
mode. The configuration made on the port-channel is applied to all member
ports.

| CLI Syntax | Feature |
| --- | --- |
| [no] speed <speedValue> | Set the speed for port-channel |
| [no] link debounce time <time> | Set Link Debounce for port-channel |
| [no] negotiate auto | Configure Negotiate for port-channel |
| [no] cdp enable | Disable/Enable CDP for port-channel |
| [no] mcp enable | Disable/Enable MCP for port-channel |
| [no] lldp transmit | Set the transmit for port-channel |
| [no] lldp receive | Set the lldp receive for port-channel |
| spanning-tree <bpduguard | bpdufilter> <enable | disable> | Configure spanning tree BPDU |
| [no] storm-control level <percentage> [ burst-rate <percentage> ] | Storm-control configuration (percentage) |
| [no] storm-control pps <packet-per-second> burst-rate <packets-per-second> | Storm-control configuration (packets-per-second) |
| [no] channel-mode { active | passive | on| mac-pinning } | LACP mode for the link in port-channel l |
| [no] lacp min-links <value> | Set minimum number of links |
| [no] lacp max-links <value> | Set maximum number of links |
| [no] lacp fast-select-hot-standby | LACP fast select for hot standby ports |
| [no] lacp graceful-convergence | LACP graceful convergence |
| [no] lacp load-defer | LACP load defer member ports |
| [no] lacp suspend-individual | LACP individual Port suspension |
| [no] lacp port-priority | LACP port priority |
| [no] lacp rate | LACP rate |

### Examples

Configure a port
channel (global configuration). A logical entity foo is created that represents
a collection of policies with two configurations: speed and channel mode. More
properties can be configured as required.

| **Note** | ---   The channel mode command is equivalent to the mode option in the channel group command in NX-OS. In ACI, however, this supported for the port-channel (not on member port).   --- |
| --- | --- |

```
apic1(config)# template port-channel foo
apic1(config-po-ch-if)# switchport access vlan 4 tenant ExampleCorp application Web epg webEpg
apic1(config-po-ch-if)# speed 10G
apic1(config-po-ch-if)# channel-mode active

```

Configure ports to
a port-channel in a FEX. In this example, port channel foo is assigned to ports
Ethernet 1/1-2 in FEX 101 attached to leaf node 102 to create an instance of
port channel foo. The leaf node will auto-generate a number, say 1002 to
identify the port channel in the switch. This port channel number would be
unique to the leaf node 102 regardless of how many instance of port channel foo
are created.

| **Note** | ---   The configuration to attach the FEX module to the leaf node must be done before creating port channels using FEX ports.   --- |
| --- | --- |

```
apic1(config)# leaf 102
apic1(config-leaf)# interface ethernet 101/1/1-2
apic1(config-leaf-if)# channel-group foo

```

In Leaf 102, this
port channel interface can be referred to as interface port-channel foo FEX
101.

```
apic1(config)# leaf 102
apic1(config-leaf)# interface port-channel foo fex 101
apic1(config-leaf)# shut

```

Configure ports
to a port channel in multiple leaf nodes. In this example, port channel foo is
assigned to ports Ethernet 1/1-2 in each of the leaf nodes 101-103. The leaf
nodes will auto generate a number unique in each node (which may be same or
different among nodes) to represent the port-channel interfaces.

```
apic1(config)# leaf 101-103
apic1(config-leaf)# interface ethernet 1/1-2
apic1(config-leaf-if)# channel-group foo

```

Add members to
port channels. This example would add two members eth1/3-4 to the port-channel
in each leaf node, so that port-channel foo in each node would have members eth
1/1-4.

```
apic1(config)# leaf 101-103
apic1(config-leaf)# interface ethernet 1/3-4
apic1(config-leaf-if)# channel-group foo

```

Remove members
from port channels. This example would remove two members eth1/2, eth1/4 from
the port channel foo in each leaf node, so that port channel foo in each node
would have members eth 1/1, eth1/3.

```
 apic1(config)# leaf 101-103
apic1(config-leaf)# interface eth 1/2,1/4
apic1(config-leaf-if)# no channel-group foo

```

Configure
port-channel with different members in multiple leaf nodes. This example shows
how to use the same port-channel foo policies to create a port-channel
interface in multiple leaf nodes with different member ports in each leaf. The
port-channel numbers in the leaf nodes may be same or different for the same
port-channel foo. In the CLI, however, the configuration will be referred as
interface port-channel foo. If the port-channel is configured for the FEX
ports, it would be referred to as interface port-channel foo fex
<fex-id>.

```
apic1(config)# leaf 101
apic1(config-leaf)# interface ethernet 1/1-2
apic1(config-leaf-if)# channel-group foo
apic1(config-leaf-if)# exit
apic1(config-leaf)# exit
apic1(config)# leaf 102
apic1(config-leaf)# interface ethernet 1/3-4
apic1(config-leaf-if)# channel-group foo
apic1(config-leaf-if)# exit
apic1(config-leaf)# exit
apic1(config)# leaf 103
apic1(config-leaf)# interface ethernet 1/5-8
apic1(config-leaf-if)# channel-group foo
apic1(config-leaf-if)# exit
apic1(config-leaf)# interface ethernet 101/1/1-2
apic1(config-leaf-if)# channel-group foo

```

Configure per
port properties for LACP. This example shows how to configure member ports of a
port-channel for per-port properties for LACP.

| **Note** | ---   In ACI model, these commands are allowed only after the ports are member of a port channel. If a port is removed from a port channel, configuration of these per-port properties would be removed as well.   --- |
| --- | --- |

```
apic1(config)# leaf 101
apic1(config-leaf)# interface ethernet 1/1-2
apic1(config-leaf-if)# channel-group foo
apic1(config-leaf-if)# lacp port-priority 1000
apic1(config-leaf-if)# lacp rate fast

```

Configure admin
state for port channels. In this example, a port-channel foo is configured in
each of the leaf nodes 101-103 using the channel-group command. The admin state
of port-channel(s) can be configured in each leaf using the port-channel
interface. In ACI model, the admin state of the port-channel cannot be
configured in the global scope.

```
// create port-channel foo in each leaf
apic1(config)# leaf 101-103
apic1(config-leaf)# interface ethernet 1/3-4
apic1(config-leaf-if)# channel-group foo

// configure admin state in specific leaf
apic1(config)# leaf 101
apic1(config-leaf)# interface port-channel foo
apic1(config-leaf-if)# shut

```

Override config is
very helpful to assign specific vlan-domain, for example, to the port-channel
interfaces in each leaf while sharing other properties.

```
// configure a port channel global config
apic1(config)# interface port-channel foo
apic1(config-if)# speed 1G
apic1(config-if)# channel-mode active

// create port-channel foo in each leaf
apic1(config)# leaf 101-103
apic1(config-leaf)# interface ethernet 1/1-2
apic1(config-leaf-if)# channel-group foo

// override port-channel foo in leaf 102
apic1(config)# leaf 102
apic1(config-leaf)# interface port-channel foo
apic1(config-leaf-if)#  speed 10G
apic1(config-leaf-if)#  channel-mode on
apic1(config-leaf-if)#  vlan-domain dom-foo

```

This example shows
how to change port channel assignment for ports using the channel-group
command. There is no need to remove port channel membership before assigning to
other port channel.

```
apic1(config)# leaf 101-103
apic1(config-leaf)# interface ethernet 1/3-4
apic1(config-leaf-if)# channel-group foo
apic1(config-leaf-if)# channel-group bar

```

## Configuring Two Port Channels Applied to Multiple Switches Using the REST API

This example creates two port channels (PCs) on leaf switch 17, another port channel on leaf switch 18, and a third one on
leaf switch 20. On each leaf switch, the same interfaces will be part of the PC (interface 1/10 to 1/15 for port channel 1
and 1/20 to 1/25 for port channel 2). The policy uses two switch blocks because each a switch block can contain only one group
of consecutive switch IDs. All these PCs will have the same configuration.

| **Note** | ---  Even though the PC configurations are the same, this example uses two different interface policy groups. Each Interface Policy Group represents a PC on a switch. All interfaces associated with a given interface policy group are part of the same PCs.  --- |
| --- | --- |

### Before you begin

* The ACI fabric is installed, APIC controllers are online, and the APIC cluster is formed and healthy.
* An APIC fabric administrator account is available that will enable creating the necessary fabric infrastructure configurations.
* The target leaf switch and protocol(s) are configured and available.

### Procedure

---

| To create the two PCs, send a post with XML such as the following:  Example: ``` <infraInfra dn="uni/infra">         <infraNodeP name=”test">              <infraLeafS name="leafs" type="range">                   <infraNodeBlk name="nblk”                         from_=”17" to_=”18”/>                   <infraNodeBlk name="nblk”                         from_=”20" to_=”20”/>             </infraLeafS>             <infraRsAccPortP tDn="uni/infra/accportprof-test1"/>	             <infraRsAccPortP tDn="uni/infra/accportprof-test2"/>	        </infraNodeP>         <infraAccPortP name="test1">             <infraHPortS name="pselc" type="range">                   <infraPortBlk name="blk1”                         fromCard="1" toCard="1"                         fromPort="10" toPort=”15”/>             <infraRsAccBaseGrp                         tDn="uni/infra/funcprof/accbundle-bndlgrp1"/>              </infraHPortS>        </infraAccPortP>         <infraAccPortP name="test2">              <infraHPortS name="pselc" type="range">                   <infraPortBlk name="blk1”                         fromCard="1" toCard="1"                         fromPort=“20" toPort=”25”/>                   <infraRsAccBaseGrp                         tDn="uni/infra/funcprof/accbundle-bndlgrp2" />              </infraHPortS>        </infraAccPortP>         <infraFuncP>              <infraAccBndlGrp name="bndlgrp1" lagT="link">                   	<infraRsHIfPol  tnFabricHIfPolName=“default"/>                    <infraRsCdpIfPol tnCdpIfPolName=”default”/> 	                  <infraRsLacpPol tnLacpLagPolName=”default"/>              </infraAccBndlGrp>               <infraAccBndlGrp name="bndlgrp2" lagT="link">                    <infraRsHIfPol  tnFabricHIfPolName=“default"/>                    <infraRsCdpIfPol tnCdpIfPolName=”default”/>                    <infraRsLacpPol tnLacpLagPolName=”default"/>              </infraAccBndlGrp>        </infraFuncP>  </infraInfra>  ``` |

Virtual Port Channels

## About Virtual Port Channels in Cisco ACI

A virtual port channel (vPC) allows links that are physically connected to two different Cisco Application Centric
Infrastructure (ACI) leaf nodes to appear as a single port channel (PC) to a third device, such as a network switch, server, any other networking
device that supports link aggregation technology. vPCs consist of two Cisco ACI leaf switches designated as vPC peer switches. Of the vPC peers, one is primary and one is secondary. The system formed by
the switches is referred to as a vPC domain.

Figure 4. vPC Domain

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/500001-600000/500001-510000/504001-505000/504295.jpg)

The following behavior is specific to the Cisco ACI vPC implementation:

* No dedicated peer-link between the vPC peers. Instead, the fabric itself serves as the Multi-Chassis Trunking (MCT).
* Peer reachability protocol: Cisco ACI uses the Zero Message Queue (ZMQ) instead of Cisco Fabric Services (CFS).

  + ZMQ is an open-source, high-performance messaging library that uses TCP as the transport.
  + This library is packaged as libzmq on the switch and linked into each application that needs to communicate with a vPC peer.
* Peer reachability is not handled using a physical peer link. Instead, routing triggers are used to detect peer reachability.

  + The vPC manager registers with Unicast Routing Information Base (URIB) for peer route notifications.
  + When IS-IS discovers a route to the peer, URIB notifies the vPC manager, which in turn attempts to open a ZMQ socket with
    the peer.
  + When the peer route is withdrawn by IS-IS, the vPC manager is again notified by URIB, and the vPC manager brings down the
    MCT link.

## ACI Virtual Port Channel Workflow

This workflow provides an overview of the steps required to configure a virtual port channel (vPC).

port channel configuration

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/500001-600000/500001-510000/500001-501000/500009.jpg)

### 1. Prerequisites

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/500001-600000/500001-510000/500001-501000/500570.jpg)

* Ensure that you have read/write access privileges to the infra security domain.
* Ensure that the target leaf switches with the necessary interfaces are available.

| **Note** | ---   When creating a vPC domain between two Leaf nodes, please considering the hardware model limitations:   * Generation 1 switches are compatible only with other Generation 1 Switches. These switch models can be identified by the lack   of “EX”, or “FX” at the end of the switch name. For example N9K-9312TX.  Generation 2 and later switches can be mixed together in a vPC domain. These switch models can be identified with “EX”, “FX”   or “FX2” at the end of the switch name. For example N9K-93108TC-EX, or N9K-9348GC-FXP.   Example:  Compatible vPC Switch Pairs:   * N9K-9312TX & N9K-9312TX * N9K-93108TC-EX & N9K-9348GC-FXP * Nexus 93180TC-FX & Nexus 93180YC-FX * Nexus 93180YC-FX & Nexus 93180YC-FX   Incompatible vPC Switch Pairs:   * N9K-9312TX & N9K-93108TC-EX * N9K-9312TX & Nexus 93180YC-FX  --- |
| --- | --- |

### 2. Configure the Virtual Port Channel

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/500001-600000/500001-510000/500001-501000/500570.jpg)

1. On the APIC menu bar, navigate to Fabric > External Access Policies  > Quick Start, and click Configure an interface, PC, and vPC to open the quick start wizard.
2. Provide the specifications for the policy name, switch IDs and the interfaces the virtual port channel will use. Add the Interface
   Policy parameters, such as group port speed, storm control, CDP, LLDP. Add the Attached Device Type as an External Bridged Device and specify the VLAN and domain that will be used.
3. Use the CLI show int command on the ACI leaf switches where the external switch is attached to verify that the switches and virtual port channel
   are configured accordingly.

| **Note** | ---   While this configuration enables hardware connectivity, no data traffic can flow without a valid application profile, EPG, and contract that is associated with this hardware configuration.   --- |
| --- | --- |

### Configure the Application Profile

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/500001-600000/500001-510000/500001-501000/500570.jpg)

1. On the APIC menu bar, navigate to Tenant >
   tenant-name
    > Quick Start, and click Create an application profile under the tenant quick start wizard.
2. Configure the endpoint groups (EPGs), contracts, bridge domain, subnet, and context.
3. Associate the application profile EPGs with the virtual port channel switch profile created above.

Virtual Port Channel Use Cases

## vPC With the Same Leaf Switch Interfaces Across Two Leaf Switches With Combined Profiles

For the example of this use case, you define the following things:

* A combined switch profile called `Leaf201_202_SwProf` (node 201 and node 202).
* A combined interface profile called `Leaf201_202_IntProf` (node 201 and node 202).
* An access port selector called `Eth1_1` (under the `Leaf201_202` interface profile) is pointing toward a vPC interface policy group.
* The vPC interface policy group is pointing toward an AAEP called `Customer_AEP`.
* The AEP (`Customer_AEP`) has an association with the `Customer_PhysDom`.
* The `Customer_PhysDom` has an association with a VLAN pool called `Customer_Static_VLPool`.

Figure 6. vPC With the Same Leaf Switch Interfaces Across Two Leaf Switches With Combined Profiles

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/500001-600000/500001-510000/504001-505000/504296.jpg)

### What This Configuration Does

On switches `Leaf201` and `Leaf202`, configure port Eth1/1 to be part of a vPC. This vPC interface will have access to VLANs 1201 through 1299. Depending on
the interface policy group, you can enable LACP Active and other interface specific policy configurations.

### When to Use This Configuration

If you have dedicated pairs of compute leaf switches with nothing but vPC-connected servers, for example, this would be a
solid use case for using combined-switch/interface profiles under your fabric access policies for those switches. You could
preconfigure your switch, interface, access port selector, and vPC interface policy groups in such a way that allowed you
to plug in 48 chassis-type servers with minimal effort.

## vPC With the Same Leaf Switch Interfaces Across Two Leaf Switches with Individual Profiles

For the example of this use case, you define the following things:

* Individual switch profiles called `Leaf201_SwProf` and `Leaf202_SwProf` (node 201 and node 202).
* Individual interface profiles called `Leaf201_IntProf` and `Leaf202_IntProf` (node 201 and node 202)
* Access port selectors called `Eth1_1` (under the `Leaf201` and `Leaf202` interface profiles) is pointing toward the same vPC interface policy group.
* The vPC interface policy group is pointing toward an AAEP called `Customer_AEP`.
* The AEP (`Customer_AEP`) has an association with the `Customer_PhysDom`.
* The `Customer_PhysDom` has an association with a VLAN pool called `Customer_Static_VLPool`.

Figure 7. vPC With the Same Leaf Switch Interfaces Across Two Leaf Switches with Individual Profiles

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/500001-600000/500001-510000/504001-505000/504297.jpg)

### What This Configuration Does

On switches `Leaf201` and `Leaf202`, configure port Eth1/1 to be a part of a vPC. This vPC interface will have access to VLANs 1201 through 1299. Depending on
the interface policy group, you can enable LACP active and other interface specific policy configurations.

### When to Use This Configuration

Use this configuration when you have leaf switches that support mixed workloads, such as compute, services, or Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure
Controllers (APICs). In this case, having individual interface profiles allows for the most amount of flexibility, while allowing you to keep
your Fabric > Access Policies configuration as clean and manageable as possible.

## vPC With Different Leaf Switch Interfaces Across Two Leaf Switches With Individual Profiles

For the example of this use case, you define the following things:

* Individual switch profiles called `Leaf201_SwProf` and `Leaf202_SwProf` (node 201 and node 202).
* Individual interface profiles called `Leaf201_IntProf` and `Leaf202_IntProf` (node 201 and node 202)
* An access port selector called `Eth1_1` (under the `Leaf201` interface profile) is pointing toward the same vPC interface policy group.
* An access port selector called `Eth1_2` (under the `Leaf202` interface profile) is pointing toward the same vPC interface policy group.
* The vPC interface policy group is pointing toward an AAEP called `Customer_AEP`.
* The AEP (`Customer_AEP`) has an association with the `Customer_PhysDom`.
* The `Customer_PhysDom` has an association with a VLAN pool called `Customer_Static_VLPool`.

Figure 8. vPC With Different Leaf Switch Interfaces Across Two Leaf Switchs With Individual Profiles

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/500001-600000/500001-510000/504001-505000/504298.jpg)

### What This Configuration Does

On ports Eth1/1 on Leaf201 and Eth 1/2 on Leaf202, configure those ports to be a part of a vPC. This vPC interface will have
access to VLANs 1201 through 1299. Depending on the interface policy group, you can enable LACP active and other interface
specific policy configurations.

### When to Use This Configuration

Use this configuration in a lab environment where you cannot use interfaces that match up. However, you must constantly refer
to the GUI to determine where you plugged in your server. As a result, this configuration is cumbersome and is not ideal.

| **Note** | ---   Do not use this configuration in production.   --- |
| --- | --- |

## Defining vPC Switch Pairs Using the GUI

This procedure defines vPC switch pairs using the GUI. We recommend that you keep the leaf switch peer group names simple
as shown in the following example:

* Leaf201\_202
* Leaf203\_204
* Leaf205\_206

For naming and numbering best practices, see the Cisco ACI Object Naming and Numbering: Best Practices document:

<https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/aci/apic/sw/kb/b-Cisco-ACI-Naming-and-Numbering.html>

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | On the menu bar, choose Fabric > Access Policies. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | In the Navigation pane, choose Policies > Switch > Virtual Port Channel default. |
| **Step 3** | In the Explicit vPC Protection Groups table, click + and fill out the fields as follows:   1. In the Name field, enter the vPC pair name.  Example name: `Leaf201_202`. A name similar to the example easily identifies which two fabric nodes are vPC peers. 2. In the ID field, enter the vPC pair ID (logical peer ID).  Example ID: `201`. The example uses the first node ID number of the pair to make it easier to correlate the ID with the vPC pair. 3. In the Switch 1 and Switch 2 fields, choose the leaf switches for the vPC switch pair. 4. Click Submit. |

---

The vPC pair gets added to the Explicit vPC Protection Groups table. The Virtual IP value is an auto-generated IP address from the system tunnel endpoint (TEP) pool, and represents the virtual shared (Anycast)
TEP of the vPC switch pair. That is, packets destined to vPC-connected endpoints of the vPC pair will use this Anycast VTEP
to send the packets.

## ACI Leaf Switch Virtual Port Channel Configuration Using the GUI

The procedure
below uses a Quick Start wizard.

| **Note** | ---   This procedure provides the steps for attaching a trunked switch to a ACI leaf switch virtual port channel. The steps would be the same for attaching other kinds of devices to an ACI leaf switch interface.   --- |
| --- | --- |

Figure 9. Switch Virtual Port Channel Configuration

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/500001-600000/500001-510000/500001-501000/500009.jpg)

| **Note** | ---   LACP sets a port to the suspended state if it does not receive an LACP PDU from the peer. This can cause some servers to fail to boot up as they require LACP to logically bring-up the port. You can tune behavior to individual use by disabling LACP suspend individual. To do so, create a port channel policy in your vPC policy group, and after setting the mode to LACP active, remove Suspend Individual Port. Now the ports in the vPC will stay active and continue to send LACP packets.   --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---   Adaptive Load Balancing (ALB) (based on ARP Negotiation) across virtual port channels is not supported in the ACI.   --- |
| --- | --- |

### Before you begin

* The ACI fabric is installed, APIC controllers are online, and the APIC cluster is formed and healthy.
* An APIC fabric administrator account is available that will enable creating the necessary fabric infrastructure configurations.
* The target
  leaf switches are registered in the ACI fabric and available.

| **Note** | ---   When creating a vPC domain between two leaf switches, both switches must be in the same switch generation, one of the following:   * Generation 1 - Cisco Nexus N9K switches without “EX” on the end of the switch name; for example, N9K-9312TX * Generation 2 – Cisco Nexus N9K switches with “EX” on the end of the switch model name; for example, N9K-93108TC-EX   Switches such as these two are not compatible vPC peers. Instead, use switches of the same generation.   --- |
| --- | --- |

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | On the APIC menu bar, navigate to Fabric > Access Policies > Quick Start, and click Configure an interface, PC, and vPC. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | In the Configure an interface, PC, and vPC work area, click the large green + to select switches. The Select Switches To Configure Interfaces work area opens with the Quick option selected by default. |
| **Step 3** | Select switch IDs from the Switches drop-down list, name the profile, then click Save. The saved policy displays in the Configured Switch Interfaces list. |
| **Step 4** | Configure the Interface Policy Group and Attached Device Type that the virtual port channel will use for the selected switches.  The interface policy group is a named policy that specifies the group of interface policies you will apply to the selected interfaces of the switch. Examples of interface policies include Link Level Policy (for example, 1gbit port speed), Storm Control Interface Policy, and so forth.   | **Note** | The Attached Device Type domain is required for enabling an EPG to use the interfaces specified in the switch profile. | | --- | --- |  1. Specify vpc the interface type (individual, PC, or vPC) to use. 2. Specify    the interface IDs to use. 3. Specify    the interface policies to use. 4. Specify    the attached device type to use. Choose    `External Bridged Devices` for connecting a switch. 5. Specify    the    Domain, and    VLAN    Range. 6. Click Save to update the policy details, then click Submit to submit the switch profile to the APIC. The APIC creates the switch profile, along with the interface, selector, and attached device type policies.   **Verification**: Use the CLI show int  command on the leaf switches where the external switch is attached to verify that the vPC is configured accordingly. |

---

### What to do next

This completes the switch virtual port channel configuration steps.

| **Note** | ---   While this configuration enables hardware connectivity, no data traffic can flow without a valid application profile, EPG, and contract that is associated with this hardware configuration.   --- |
| --- | --- |

## Configuring Virtual Port Channels in Leaf Nodes and FEX Devices Using the NX-OS CLI

A virtual port channel (vPC) is an enhancement to port-channels that allows connection of a host or switch to two upstream
leaf nodes to improve bandwidth utilization and availability. In NX-OS, vPC configuration is done in each of the two upstream
switches and configuration is synchronized using peer link between the switches.

| **Note** | ---   When creating a vPC domain between two leaf switches, both switches must be in the same switch generation, one of the following:   * Generation 1 - Cisco Nexus N9K switches without “EX” on the end of the switch name; for example, N9K-9312TX * Generation 2 – Cisco Nexus N9K switches with “EX” on the end of the switch model name; for example, N9K-93108TC-EX   Switches such as these two are not compatible vPC peers. Instead, use switches of the same generation.   --- |
| --- | --- |

The Cisco Application Centric
Infrastructure (ACI) model does not require a peer link and vPC configuration can be done globally for both the upstream leaf nodes. A global
configuration mode called **vpc context** is introduced in Cisco ACI and vPC interfaces are represented using a type **interface vpc** that allows global configuration applicable to both leaf nodes.

Two different topologies are supported for vPC in the Cisco ACI model: vPC using leaf ports and vPC over FEX ports. It is possible to create many vPC interfaces between a pair of leaf nodes
and similarly, many vPC interfaces can be created between a pair of FEX modules attached to the leaf node pairs in a straight-through
topology.

vPC considerations include:

* The vPC name used is unique between leaf node pairs. For example, only one vPC 'corp' can be created per leaf pair (with or
  without FEX).
* Leaf ports and FEX ports cannot be part of the same vPC.
* Each FEX module can be part of only one instance of vPC corp.
* vPC context allows configuration
* The vPC context mode allows configuration of all vPCs for a given leaf pair. For vPC over FEX, the fex-id  pairs must be specified either for the vPC context or along with the vPC interface, as shown in the following two alternative
  examples.

  ```
  (config)# vpc context leaf 101 102
  (config-vpc)# interface vpc Reg fex 101 101
  ```

  or

  ```
  (config)# vpc context leaf 101 102 fex 101 101
  (config-vpc)# interface vpc Reg
  ```

In the Cisco ACI model, vPC configuration is done in the following steps (as shown in the examples below).

| **Note** | ---   A VLAN domain is required with a VLAN range. It must be associated with the port-channel template.   --- |
| --- | --- |

1. VLAN domain configuration (global config) with VLAN range
2. vPC domain configuration (global config)
3. Port-channel template configuration (global config)
4. Associate the port channel template with the VLAN domain
5. Port-channel configuration for vPC (global config)
6. Configure ports to vPC in leaf nodes
7. Configure Layer 2, Layer 3 for vPC in the vPC context

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | configure  Enters global configuration mode.  Example: ``` apic1# configure ``` |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | vlan-domainname[dynamic] [type domain-type]  Configures a VLAN domain for the virtual port-channel (here with a port-channel template).  Example: ``` apic1(config)# vlan-domain dom1 dynamic ``` |
| **Step 3** | vlanrange  Configures a VLAN range for the VLAN domain and exits the configuration mode. The range can be a single VLAN or a range of VLANs.  Example: ``` apic1(config-vlan)# vlan 1000-1999 apic1(config-vlan)# exit ``` |
| **Step 4** | vpc domain explicit domain-id leaf node-id1 node-id2  Configures a vPC domain between a pair of leaf nodes. You can specify the vPC domain ID in the explicit mode along with the leaf node pairs.  Alternative commands to configure a vPC domain are as follows:   * vpc   domain [consecutive | reciprocal]  The consecutive and reciprocal options allow auto configuration of a vPC domain across all leaf nodes in the Cisco ACI fabric. * vpc   domain   consecutive   domain-start   leaf   start-node   end-node  This command configures a vPC domain consecutively for a selected set of leaf node pairs.  Example: ``` apic1(config)# vpc domain explicit 1 leaf 101 102 ``` |
| **Step 5** | peer-dead-interval interval  Configures the time delay the Leaf switch waits to restore the vPC before receiving a response from the peer. If it does not receive a response from the peer within this time, the Leaf switch considers the peer dead and brings up the vPC with the role as a master. If it does receive a response from the peer it restores the vPC at that point. The range is from 5 seconds to 600 seconds. The default is 200 seconds.  Example: ``` apic1(config-vpc)# peer-dead-interval 10 ``` |
| **Step 6** | exit  Returns to global configuration mode.  Example: ``` apic1(config-vpc)# exit ``` |
| **Step 7** | template port-channel channel-name  Creates a new port-channel or configures an existing port-channel (global configuration).  All vPCs are configured as port-channels in each leaf pair. The same port-channel name must be used in a leaf pair for the same vPC. This port-channel can be used to create a vPC among one or more pairs of leaf nodes. Each leaf node will have only one instance of this vPC.  Example: ``` apic1(config)# template port-channel corp ``` |
| **Step 8** | vlan-domain membervlan-domain-name  Associates the port channel template with the previously configured VLAN domain.  Example: ``` vlan-domain member dom1 ``` |
| **Step 9** | switchport access vlan vlan-id tenant tenant-name application application-name epg epg-name  Deploys the EPG with the VLAN on all ports with which the port-channel is associated.  Example: ``` apic1(config-po-ch-if)# switchport access vlan 4 tenant ExampleCorp application Web epg webEpg ``` |
| **Step 10** | channel-mode active   | **Note** | A port-channel must be in active channel-mode for a vPC. | | --- | --- |   Example: ``` apic1(config-po-ch-if)# channel-mode active ``` |
| **Step 11** | exit  Returns to configure mode.  Example: ``` apic1(config-po-ch-if)# exit ``` |
| **Step 12** | leaf node-id1 node-id2  Specifies the pair of leaf switches to be configured.  Example: ``` apic1(config)# leaf 101-102 ``` |
| **Step 13** | interface typeleaf/interface-range  Specifies the interface or range of interfaces that you are configuring to the port-channel.  Example: ``` apic1(config-leaf)# interface ethernet 1/3-4 ``` |
| **Step 14** | [no] channel-group channel-name vpc  Assigns the interface or range of interfaces to the port-channel. Use the keyword no  to remove the interface from the port-channel. To change the port-channel assignment on an interface, you can enter the channel-group  command without first removing the interface from the previous port-channel.   | **Note** | The vpc  keyword in this command makes the port-channel a vPC. If the vPC does not already exist, a vPC ID is automatically generated and is applied to all member leaf nodes. | | --- | --- |   Example: ``` apic1(config-leaf-if)# channel-group corp vpc ``` |
| **Step 15** | exit  Example: ``` apic1(config-leaf-if)# exit ``` |
| **Step 16** | exit  Example: ``` apic1(config-leaf)# exit ``` |
| **Step 17** | vpc  context leaf node-id1 node-id2  The vPC context mode allows configuration of vPC to be applied to both leaf node pairs.  Example: ``` apic1(config)# vpc context leaf 101 102 ``` |
| **Step 18** | interface vpc channel-name  Example: ``` apic1(config-vpc)# interface vpc blue fex 102 102 ``` |
| **Step 19** | (Optional)  [no] shutdown  Administrative state configuration in the vPC context allows changing the admin state of a vPC with one command for both leaf nodes.  Example: ``` apic1(config-vpc-if)# no shut ``` |

---

### Example

This example shows how to configure a basic vPC.

```
apic1# configure
apic1(config)# vlan-domain dom1 dynamic
apic1(config-vlan)# vlan 1000-1999
apic1(config-vlan)# exit
apic1(config)# vpc domain explicit 1 leaf 101 102
apic1(config-vpc)# peer-dead-interval 10
apic1(config-vpc)# exit
apic1(config)# template port-channel corp
apic1(config-po-ch-if)# vlan-domain member dom1
apic1(config-po-ch-if)# channel-mode active
apic1(config-po-ch-if)# exit
apic1(config)# leaf 101-102
apic1(config-leaf)# interface ethernet 1/3-4
apic1(config-leaf-if)# channel-group corp vpc
apic1(config-leaf-if)# exit
apic1(config)# vpc context leaf 101 102
```

This example shows how to configure vPCs with FEX ports.

```
apic1(config-leaf)# interface ethernet 101/1/1-2
apic1(config-leaf-if)# channel-group Reg vpc
apic1(config)# vpc context leaf 101 102
apic1(config-vpc)# interface vpc corp
apic1(config-vpc-if)# exit
apic1(config-vpc)# interface vpc red fex 101 101
apic1(config-vpc-if)# switchport
apic1(config-vpc-if)# exit
apic1(config-vpc)# interface vpc blue fex 102 102
apic1(config-vpc-if)# shut
```

## Configuring a Single Virtual Port Channel Across Two Switches Using the REST API

The two steps for creating a virtual port channel across two switches are as follows:

* Create a `fabricExplicitGEp`: this policy specifies the leaf switch that pairs to form the virtual port channel.
* Use the infra selector to specify the interface configuration.

The APIC performs several validations of the `fabricExplicitGEp` and faults are raised when any of these validations fail. A leaf can be paired with only one other leaf. The APIC rejects any configuration that breaks this rule. When creating a `fabricExplicitGEp`, an administrator must provide the IDs of both of the leaf switches to be paired. The APIC rejects any configuration which breaks this rule. Both switches must be up when `fabricExplicitGEp` is created. If one switch is not up, the APIC accepts the configuration but raises a fault. Both switches must be leaf switches. If one or both switch IDs corresponds
to a spine, the APIC accepts the configuration but raises a fault.

### Before you begin

* The ACI fabric is installed, APIC controllers are online, and the APIC cluster is formed and healthy.
* An APIC fabric administrator account is available that will enable creating the necessary fabric infrastructure configurations.
* The target leaf switch and protocol(s) are configured and available.

### Procedure

---

| To create the `fabricExplicitGEp` policy and use the intra selector to specify the interface, send a post with XML such as the following example:  Example: ``` <fabricProtPol pairT="explicit"> <fabricExplicitGEp name="tG" id="2"> 	<fabricNodePEp id=”18”/> 	<fabricNodePEp id=”25"/>         </fabricExplicitGEp>    </fabricProtPol>  ``` |
| --- |

## Configuring a Virtual Port Channel on Selected Port Blocks of Two Switches Using the REST API

This policy creates a single virtual port channel (vPC) on leaf switches 18 and 25, using interfaces 1/10 to 1/15 on leaf
18, and interfaces 1/20 to 1/25 on leaf 25.

### Before you begin

* The ACI fabric is installed, APIC controllers are online, and the APIC cluster is formed and healthy.
* An APIC fabric administrator account is available that will enable creating the necessary fabric infrastructure configurations.
* The target leaf switch and protocol(s) are configured and available.

| **Note** | ---   When creating a vPC domain between two leaf switches, both switches must be in the same switch generation, one of the following:   * Generation 1 - Cisco Nexus N9K switches without “EX” on the end of the switch name; for example, N9K-9312TX * Generation 2 – Cisco Nexus N9K switches with “EX” on the end of the switch model name; for example, N9K-93108TC-EX   Switches such as these two are not compatible vPC peers. Instead, use switches of the same generation.   --- |
| --- | --- |

### Procedure

---

| To create the vPC send a post with XML such as the following example:  Example: ``` <infraInfra dn="uni/infra">         <infraNodeP name=”test1">            <infraLeafS name="leafs" type="range">                 <infraNodeBlk name="nblk”                       from_=”18" to_=”18”/>            </infraLeafS>            <infraRsAccPortP tDn="uni/infra/accportprof-test1"/>	        </infraNodeP>         <infraNodeP name=”test2">            <infraLeafS name="leafs" type="range">                 <infraNodeBlk name="nblk”                       from_=”25" to_=”25”/>            </infraLeafS>            <infraRsAccPortP tDn="uni/infra/accportprof-test2"/>	        </infraNodeP>         <infraAccPortP name="test1">            <infraHPortS name="pselc" type="range">                 <infraPortBlk name="blk1”                       fromCard="1" toCard="1"                       fromPort="10" toPort=”15”/>                 <infraRsAccBaseGrp                       tDn="uni/infra/funcprof/accbundle-bndlgrp" />             </infraHPortS>        </infraAccPortP>         <infraAccPortP name="test2">             <infraHPortS name="pselc" type="range">                  <infraPortBlk name="blk1”                        fromCard="1" toCard="1"                        fromPort=“20" toPort=”25”/>             <infraRsAccBaseGrp                   tDn="uni/infra/funcprof/accbundle-bndlgrp" />             </infraHPortS>         </infraAccPortP>          <infraFuncP>               <infraAccBndlGrp name="bndlgrp" lagT=”node">                    <infraRsHIfPol  tnFabricHIfPolName=“default"/>                    <infraRsCdpIfPol tnCdpIfPolName=”default”/>                    <infraRsLacpPol tnLacpLagPolName=”default"/>               </infraAccBndlGrp>         </infraFuncP>  </infraInfra>  ``` |

Reflective Relay

## Reflective Relay (802.1Qbg)

Reflective relay is a switching option beginning with Cisco APIC Release 2.3(1). Reflective relay—the tagless approach of
IEEE standard 802.1Qbg—forwards all traffic to an external switch, which then applies policy and sends the traffic back to
the destination or target VM on the server as needed. There is no local switching. For broadcast or multicast traffic, reflective
relay provides packet replication to each VM locally on the server.

One benefit of reflective relay is that it leverages the external switch for switching features and management capabilities,
freeing server resources to support the VMs. Reflective relay also allows policies that you configure on the Cisco APIC to
apply to traffic between the VMs on the same server.

In the Cisco ACI, you can enable reflective relay, which allows traffic to turn back out of the same port it came in on. You
can enable reflective relay on individual ports, port channels, or virtual port channels as a Layer 2 interface policy using
the APIC GUI, NX-OS CLI, or REST API. It is disabled by default.

The term Virtual Ethernet Port Aggregator (VEPA) is also used to describe 802.1Qbg functionality.

### Reflective Relay Support

Reflective relay supports the following:

* IEEE standard 802.1Qbg tagless approach, known as reflective relay.

  Cisco APIC Release 2.3(1) release does not support the IEE standard 802.1Qbg S-tagged approach with multichannel technology.
* Physical domains.

  Virtual domains are not supported.
* Physical ports, port channels (PCs), and virtual port channels (vPCs).

  Cisco Fabric Extender (FEX) and blade servers are not supported. If reflective relay is enabled on an unsupported interface,
  a fault is raised, and the last valid configuration is retained. Disabling reflective relay on the port clears the fault.
* Cisco Nexus 9000 series switches with EX or FX at the end of their model name.

## Enabling Reflective Relay Using the GUI

Reflective relay is disabled by default; however, you can enable it on a port, port channel, or virtual port channel as a
Layer 2 interface policy on the switch. You first configure a policy and then associate the policy with a policy group.

### Before you begin

This procedure assumes that you have set up the Cisco Application Centric
Infrastructure (ACI) fabric and installed the physical switches.

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Choose Fabric > External Access Policies >  > Interface Policies and then open the Policies folder. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Right-click the L2 Interface folder and choose Create L2 Interface Policy. |
| **Step 3** | In the Create L2 Interface Policy dialog box, enter a name in the Name field. |
| **Step 4** | In the Reflective Relay (802.1Qbg) area, click enabled. |
| **Step 5** | Choose other options in the dialog box as needed. |
| **Step 6** | Click SUBMIT. |
| **Step 7** | In the Policies navigation pane, open the Policy Groups folder and click the Leaf Policy Groups folder. |
| **Step 8** | In the Leaf Policy Groups central pane, expand the ACTIONS drop-down list, and choose Create Leaf Access Port Policy Group, Create PC Interface Policy Group, Create vPC Interface Policy Group, or Create PC/vPC Override Policy Group. |
| **Step 9** | In the policy group dialog box, enter a name in the Name field. |
| **Step 10** | From the L2 Interface Policy drop-down list, choose the policy that you just created to enable Reflective Relay. |
| **Step 11** | Click Submit. |

## Enabling Reflective Relay Using the NX-OS CLI

Reflective relay is disabled by default; however, you can enable it on a port, port channel, or virtual port channel as a
Layer 2 interface policy on the switch. In the NX-OS CLI, you can use a template to enable reflective relay on multiple ports
or you can enable it on individual ports.

### Before you begin

This procedure assumes that you have set up the Cisco Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) fabric and installed the physical
switches.

### Procedure

---

| Enable reflective relay on one or multiple ports:  Example:This example enables reflective relay on a single port: ``` apic1(config)# leaf 101 apic1(config-leaf)# interface ethernet 1/2 apic1(config-leaf-if)# switchport vepa enabled apic1(config-leaf-if)# exit apic1(config-leaf)# exit  ```  Example:This example enables reflective relay on multiple ports using a template: ``` apic1(config)# template policy-group grp1 apic1(config-pol-grp-if)# switchport vepa enabled apic1(config-pol-grp-if)# exit apic1(config)# leaf 101 apic1(config-leaf)# interface ethernet 1/2-4 apic1(config-leaf-if)# policy-group grp1  ```  Example:This example enables reflective relay on a port channel: ``` apic1(config)# leaf 101 apic1(config-leaf)# interface port-channel po2                  apic1(config-leaf-if)# switchport vepa enabled apic1(config-leaf-if)# exit apic1(config-leaf)# exit apic1(config)#   ```  Example:This example enables reflective relay on multiple port channels: ``` apic1(config)# template port-channel po1 apic1(config-if)# switchport vepa enabled apic1(config-if)# exit apic1(config)# leaf 101 apic1(config-leaf)# interface ethernet 1/3-4 apic1(config-leaf-if)# channel-group po1  apic1(config-leaf-if)# exit apic1(config-leaf)# exit  ```  Example:This example enables reflective relay on a virtual port channel: ``` apic1(config)# vpc domain explicit 1 leaf 101 102 apic1(config-vpc)# exit apic1(config)# template port-channel po4 apic1(config-if)# exit apic1(config)# leaf 101-102 apic1(config-leaf)# interface eth 1/11-12 apic1(config-leaf-if)# channel-group po4 vpc apic1(config-leaf-if)# exit apic1(config-leaf)# exit apic1(config)# vpc context leaf 101 102 apic1(config-vpc)# interface vpc po4 apic1(config-vpc-if)# switchport vepa enabled  ``` |
| --- |

## Enabling Reflective Relay Using the REST API

Reflective relay is disabled by default; however, you can enable it on a port, port channel, or virtual port channel as a
Layer 2 interface policy on the switch.

### Before you begin

This procedure assumes that you have set up the Cisco Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) fabric and installed the physical
switches.

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Configure a Layer 2 Interface policy with reflective relay enabled.  Example: ``` <l2IfPol name=“VepaL2IfPol” vepa=“enabled"  />  ``` |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Apply the Layer 2 interface policy to a leaf access port policy group.  Example: ``` <infraAccPortGrp name=“VepaPortG">     <infraRsL2IfPol tnL2IfPolName=“VepaL2IfPol”/> </infraAccPortGrp>  ``` |
| **Step 3** | Configure an interface profile with an interface selector.  Example: ``` <infraAccPortP name=“vepa">         <infraHPortS name="pselc" type="range">              <infraPortBlk name="blk"                  fromCard="1" toCard="1" fromPort="20" toPort="22">              </infraPortBlk>              <infraRsAccBaseGrp tDn="uni/infra/funcprof/accportgrp-VepaPortG" />          </infraHPortS>  </infraAccPortP>  ``` |
| **Step 4** | Configure a node profile with node selector.  Example: ``` <infraNodeP name=“VepaNodeProfile">         <infraLeafS name=“VepaLeafSelector" type="range">                  <infraNodeBlk name=“VepaNodeBlk" from_="101" to_="102"/>         </infraLeafS>                <infraRsAccPortP tDn="uni/infra/accportprof-vepa"/>     </infraNodeP>  ``` |

FEX Interfaces

## Configuring Port, PC, and vPC Connections to FEX Devices

FEX connections and the profiles used to configure them can be created using the GUI, NX-OS Style CLI, or the REST API.

Interface profiles for configuring FEX connections are supported since Cisco APIC, Release 3.0(1k).

For information on how to configure them using the NX-OS style CLI, see the topics about configuring ports, PCs and vPCs using
the NX-OS style CLI.

* [ACI FEX Guidelines](#id_23576)

### ACI FEX Guidelines

Observe the following guidelines when deploying a FEX:

* Assuming that no leaf switch front panel ports are configured to deploy and EPG and VLANs, a maximum of 10,000 port EPGs are
  supported for being deployed using a FEX.
* For each FEX port or vPC that includes FEX ports as members, a maximum of 20 EPGs per VLAN are supported.
* A vPC with FEX interfaces ignores the minimum and maximum number of links configured in its port-channel policy. The vPC remains
  up even if the number of links is less than the minimum or greater than the maximum.

## FEX Virtual Port Channels

The ACI fabric supports Cisco Fabric Extender (FEX) server-side virtual port channels (vPC), also known as an FEX straight-through
vPC.

| **Note** | ---   When creating a vPC domain between two leaf switches, both switches must be in the same switch generation, one of the following:   * Generation 1 - Cisco Nexus N9K switches without “EX” or "FX" on the end of the switch name; for example, N9K-9312TX * Generation 2 – Cisco Nexus N9K switches with “EX” or "FX" on the end of the switch model name; for example, N9K-93108TC-EX   Switches such as these two are not compatible vPC peers. Instead, use switches of the same generation.   --- |
| --- | --- |

Figure 10. Supported FEX vPC Topologies

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/300001-400000/340001-350000/349001-350000/349526.jpg)

Supported FEX vPC port channel topologies include the following:

* Both VTEP and
  non-VTEP hypervisors behind a FEX.
* Virtual switches (such as AVS or VDS) connected to two FEXs that are connected to the ACI fabric (vPCs directly connected
  on physical FEX ports is not supported - a vPC is supported only on port channels).

| **Note** | ---   When using GARP as the protocol to n.jpgy of IP to MAC binding changes to different interfaces on the same FEX you must set the bridge domain mode to ARP Flooding and enable EP Move Detection Mode: GARP-based Detection, on the L3 Configuration  page of the bridge domain wizard. This workaround is only required with Generation 1 switches. With Generation 2 switches or later, this is not an issue.   --- |
| --- | --- |

## Configuring a Basic FEX Connection Using the GUI

The procedure below uses a Quick Start wizard that automatically creates some necessary policies for FEX deployment. The main
steps are as follows:

1. Configure a switch profile that includes an auto-generated FEX profile.
2. Customize the auto-generated FEX Profile to enable attaching a server to a single FEX port.

   Figure 11. Basic FEX Configuration

   ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/300001-400000/340001-350000/349001-350000/349992.jpg)

| **Note** | ---   This procedure provides the steps for attaching a server to the FEX. The steps would be the same for attaching any device to an ACI attached FEX.   --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---   Configuring FEX connections with FEX IDs `165` to `199` is not supported in the APIC GUI. To use one of these FEX IDs, configure the profile using the NX-OS style CLI. For more information, see Configuring FEX Connections Using Interface Profiles with the NX-OS Style CLI.   --- |
| --- | --- |

### Before you begin

* The ACI fabric
  is installed,
  APIC
  controllers are online, and the
  APIC
  cluster is formed and healthy.
* An
  APIC
  fabric administrator account is available that will enable creating the
  necessary fabric infrastructure configurations.
* The target leaf switches, interfaces, and protocol(s) are configured and available.
* The FEX is
  powered on and connected to the target leaf interfaces

| **Note** | ---   A maximum of eight members is supported in fabric port-channels connected to FEXs.   --- |
| --- | --- |

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | On the APIC, create a switch profile using the Fabric > Access Policies > Quick Start Configure Interface, PC, And vPC wizard.   1. On the APIC menu bar, navigate to Fabric > Access Policies > Quick Start. 2. In the Quick Start page, click the Configure an interface, PC, and vPC option to open the Configure Interface, PC And vPC wizard. 3. In the Configure an interface, PC, and vPC work area, click the + to add a new switch profile. 4. In the Select Switches To Configure Interfaces work area, click the Advanced radio button. 5. Select the switch from the drop-down list of available switch IDs.     Troubleshooting Tips: In this procedure, one switch is included in the profile. Selecting multiple switches allows the same profile to be used on    multiple switches. 6. Provide a name in the Switch Profile Name field. 7. Click the + above the Fexes list to add a FEX ID and the switch ports to which it will connect to the switch profile.  You must configure FEX IDs 165 - 199, using the NX-OS style CLI. See Configuring FEX Connections Using Interface Profiles with the NX-OS Style CLI. 8. Click Save  to save the changes. Click Submit to submit the switch profile to the APIC. The APIC auto-generates the necessary FEX profile (<switch policy name>\_FexP<FEX ID>) and selector (<switch policy name>\_ifselctor).   **Verification**: Use the CLI show fex command on the switch where the FEX is attached to verify that the FEX is online. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Customize the auto-generated FEX Profile to enable attaching a server to a single FEX port.   1. In the Navigation pane, locate the switch policy you just created in the policies list. You will also find the auto-generated FEX the <switch policy name>\_FexP<FEX ID> profile. 2. In the    work pane of the    <switch policy name>\_FexP<FEX ID> profile,    click the    + to add a new entry to the    Interface Selectors For FEX     list. The    Create Access Port Selector dialog opens. 3. Provide a    name for the selector. 4. Specify    the FEX interface IDs to use. 5. Select an    existing    Interface Policy Group from the list or    Create Access Port Policy Group.  The access    port policy group is a named policy that specifies the group of interface    policies you will apply to the selected interfaces of the FEX. Examples of    interface policies include Link Level Policy (for example, 1gbit port speed),    Attach Entity Profile, Storm Control Interface Policy, and so forth.         | **Note** | Within the interface policy group, the Attached Entity Profile is required for enabling an EPG to use the interfaces specified in the FEX port selector. |    | --- | --- | 6. Click Submit to submit the FEX profile to the APIC. The APIC updates the FEX profile.   **Verification**: Use the CLI show int command on the switch where the FEX is attached to verify that the FEX interface is configured accordingly.   This completes the basic FEX configuration steps. |

---

### What to do next

| **Note** | ---   While this configuration enables hardware connectivity, no data traffic can flow without a valid application profile, EPG, and contract that is associated with this hardware configuration.   --- |
| --- | --- |

## Configuring FEX Port Channel Connections Using the GUI

The main steps are as follows:

1. Configure an FEX profile to use FEX ports to form a port channel.
2. Configure the port channel to enable attaching a server.

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | On the APIC, add a port channel to a FEX profile.   1. On the APIC menu bar, navigate to Fabric > Access Policies > Interfaces > Leaf Interfaces >  Profiles. 2. In the    Navigation Pane, select the FEX profile.  APIC    auto-generated FEX profile names are formed as follows:    <switch policy name>\_FexP<FEX ID>. 3. In the    FEX Profile work area, click the    +to add a new entry to the    Interface Selectors For FEX     list. The    Create Access Port Selector dialog opens. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Customize the Create Access Port Selector to enable attaching a server to the FEX port channel.   1. Provide a    name for the selector. 2. Specify    the FEX interface IDs to use. 3. Select an    existing    Interface Policy Group from the list or    Create PC Interface Policy Group.  The port    channel interface policy group specifies the group of policies you will apply    to the selected interfaces of the FEX. Examples of interface policies include    Link Level Policy (for example, 1gbit port speed), Attach Entity Profile, Storm    Control Interface Policy, and so forth.         | **Note** | Within the interface policy group, the Attached Entity Profile is required for enabling an EPG to use the interfaces specified in the FEX port selector. |    | --- | --- | 4. In the    Port    Channel Policy option, select static or dynamic LACP according to the    requirements of your configuration. 5. Click    Submit to submit the updated FEX proflle to the    APIC. The    APIC    updates the FEX profile.   **Verification**: Use the CLI show port-channel summary  command on the switch where the FEX is attached to verify that the port channel is configured accordingly. |

---

### What to do next

This completes the FEX port channel configuration steps.

| **Note** | ---   While this configuration enables hardware connectivity, no data traffic can flow without a valid application profile, EPG, and contract that is associated with this hardware configuration.   --- |

  configured, powered on, and connected to the target leaf interfaces

| **Note** | ---   When creating a vPC domain between two leaf switches, both switches must be in the same switch generation, one of the following:   * Generation 1 - Cisco Nexus N9K switches without “EX” on the end of the switch name; for example, N9K-9312TX * Generation 2 – Cisco Nexus N9K switches with “EX” on the end of the switch model name; for example, N9K-93108TC-EX   Switches such as these two are not compatible vPC peers. Instead, use switches of the same generation.   --- |
| --- | --- |

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | On the APIC, add a virtual port channel to two FEX profiles.   1. On the APIC menu bar, navigate to Fabric > External Access Policies > Interfaces > Leaf Interfaces >  Profiles. 2. In the    Navigation Pane, select the first FEX profile.  APIC    auto-generated FEX profile names are formed as follows:    <switch policy name>\_FexP<FEX ID>. 3. In the    FEX    Profile work area, click the    +to add a new entry to the    Interface Selectors For FEX     list. The    Create Access Port Selector dialog opens. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Customize the Create Access Port Selector to enable attaching a server to the FEX virtual port channel.   1. Provide a    name for the selector. 2. Specify the    FEX interface ID to use.  Typically,    you will use the same interface ID on each FEX to form the virtual port    channel. 3. Select an    existing    Interface Policy Group from the list or    Create    VPC Interface Policy Group.  The virtual port channel interface policy group specifies the group of policies you will apply to the selected interfaces    of the FEX. Examples of interface policies include Link Level Policy (for example, 1gbit port speed), Attach Entity Profile,    Storm Control Interface Policy, and so forth.         | **Note** | Within the interface policy group, the Attached Entity Profile is required for enabling an EPG to use the interfaces specified in the FEX port selector. |    | --- | --- | 4. In the    Port    Channel Policy option, select static or dynamic LACP according to the    requirements of your configuration. 5. Click    Submit to submit the updated FEX proflle to the    APIC. The    APIC    updates the FEX profile.   **Verification**: Use the CLI show port-channel summary  command on the switch where the FEX is attached to verify that the port channel is configured accordingly. |
| **Step 3** | Configure the second FEX to use the same Interface Policy Group just specified for the first FEX.   1. In the    FEX Profile work area of the second FEX profile,    click the    +to add a new entry to the    Interface Selectors For FEX     list. The    Create Access Port Selector dialog opens. 2. Provide a    name for the selector. 3. Specify    the FEX interface ID to use.  Typically,    you will use the same interface ID on each FEX to form the virtual port    channel. 4. From the    drop-down list, select the same virtual port channel    Interface Policy Group just used in the first FEX    profile.  The    virtual port channel interface policy group specifies the group of policies you    will apply to the selected interfaces of the FEX. Examples of interface    policies include Link Level Policy (for example, 1gbit port speed), Attach    Entity Profile, Storm Control Interface Policy, and so forth.         | **Note** | Within the interface policy group, the Attached Entity Profile is required for enabling an EPG to use the interfaces specified in the FEX port selector. |    | --- | --- | 5. Click    Submit to submit the updated FEX proflle to the    APIC. The    APIC    updates the FEX profile.   **Verification**: Use the CLI show vpc extended  command on the switch where one of the FEXes is attached to verify that the virtual port channel is configured accordingly. |

---

### What to do next

This completes the FEX virtual port channel configuration steps.

| **Note** | ---   While this configuration enables hardware connectivity, no data traffic can flow without a valid application profile, EPG, and contract that is associated with this hardware configuration.   --- |

## Configuring an FEX VPC Policy Using the REST API

This task creates a FEX virtual port channel (VPC) policy.

### Before you begin

* The ACI fabric is installed, APIC controllers are online, and the APIC cluster is formed and healthy.
* An APIC fabric administrator account is available that will enable creating the necessary fabric infrastructure configurations.
* The target leaf switch, interfaces, and protocol(s) are configured and available.
* The FEXes are configured, powered on, and connected to the target leaf interfaces

| **Note** | ---   When creating a VPC domain between two leaf switches, both switches must be in the same switch generation, one of the following:   * Generation 1 - Cisco Nexus N9K switches without “EX” on the end of the switch name; for example, N9K-9312TX * Generation 2 – Cisco Nexus N9K switches with “EX” on the end of the switch model name; for example, N9K-93108TC-EX  Switches such as these two are not compatible VPC peers. Instead, use switches of the same generation.  --- |

## Configuring FEX Connectivity to an ACI leaf switch Using Profiles with the NX-OS-Style CLI

Use this procedure to configure FEX connections to leaf nodes using the NX-OS style CLI.

| **Note** | ---   Configuring FEX connections with FEX IDs `165` to `199` is not supported in the Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) GUI. To use one of these FEX IDs, configure the profile using the following commands.   --- |
| --- | --- |

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | configure  Enters global configuration mode.  Example: ``` apic1# configure ``` |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | leaf-interface-profile name  Specifies the leaf interface profile to be configured.  Example: ``` apic1(config)# leaf-interface-profile fexIntProf1 ``` |
| **Step 3** | leaf-interface-group name  Specifies the interface group to be configured.  Example: ``` apic1(config-leaf-if-profile)# leaf-interface-group leafIntGrp1 ``` |
| **Step 4** | fex associate fex-id [template template-typefex-template-name]  Attaches a FEX module to a leaf node. Use the optional template keyword to specify a template to be used. If it does not exist, the system creates a template with the name and type you specified.  Example: ``` apic1(config-leaf-if-group)# fex associate 101 ``` |

---

### Example

This merged example configures a leaf interface profile for FEX connections with ID 101.

```
apic1# configure
apic1(config)# leaf-interface-profile fexIntProf1
apic1(config-leaf-if-profile)# leaf-interface-group leafIntGrp1
apic1(config-leaf-if-group)# fex associate 101
```

Configuring Port Profiles to Change Ports from Uplink to Downlink or Downlink to Uplink

## Configuring Port Profiles

Prior to Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure
Controller (APIC) release 3.1(1), conversion from uplink port to downlink port or downlink port to uplink port (in a port profile) was not
supported on Cisco Application Centric
Infrastructure (ACI) leaf switches. Starting with Cisco APIC release 3.1(1), uplink and downlink conversion is supported on Cisco Nexus 9000 series switches with names that end in EX
or FX, and later (for example, N9K-C9348GC-FXP). A FEX connected to converted downlinks is also supported.

This functionality is supported on the following Cisco switches:

* N9K-C9348GC-FXP
* N9K-C93180LC-EX and N9K-C93180YC-FX
* N9K-C93108TC-EX and N9K-C93108TC-FX (only uplink to downlink conversion is supported)
* N9K-C9336C-FX2 (only downlink to uplink conversion is supported)

### Restrictions

* Fast Link Failover policies and port profiles are not supported on the same port. If port profile is enabled, Fast Link Failover
  cannot be enabled or vice versa.
* The last 2 uplink ports of supported TOR switches cannot be converted to downlink ports (they are reserved for uplink connections.)
* Up to Cisco APIC release 3.2, port profiles and breakout ports are not supported on the same ports.
* With Cisco APIC release 3.2 and later, dynamic breakouts (both 100Gb and 40Gb) are supported on profiled QSFP ports on the N9K-C93180YC-FX
  switch. Breakout and port profile are supported together for conversion of uplink to downlink on ports 49-52. Breakout (both
  10g-4x or 25g-4x options) is supported on downlink profiled ports.
* Reloading a switch after changing a switch's port profile configuration interrupts traffic through the data plane.

### Guidelines

In converting uplinks to downlinks and downlinks to uplinks, consider the following guidelines.

| Subject | Guideline |
| --- | --- |
| Decommissioning nodes with port profiles | If a decommissioned node has the Port Profile feature deployed on it, the port conversions are not removed even after decommissioning the node. It is necessary to manually delete the configurations after decommission, for the ports to return to the default state. To do this, log onto the switch, run the setup-clean-config.sh script, and wait for it to run. Then, enter the reload command. |
| FIPS | When you enable or disable Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) on a Cisco ACI fabric, you must reload each of the switches in the fabric for the change to take effect. The configured scale profile setting is lost when you issue the first reload after changing the FIPS configuration. The switch remains operational, but it uses the default scale profile. This issue does not happen on subsequent reloads if the FIPS configuration has not changed.  FIPS is supported on Cisco NX-OS release 13.1(1) or later.  If you must downgrade the firmware from a release that supports FIPS to a release that does not support FIPS, you must first disable FIPS on the Cisco ACI fabric and reload all the switches in the fabric for the FIPS configuration change. |
| Maximum uplink port limit | When the maximum uplink port limit is reached and ports 25 and 27 are converted from uplink to downlink and back to uplink on Cisco 93180LC-EX switches:  On Cisco 93180LC-EX Switches, ports 25 and 27 are the native uplink ports. Using the port profile, if you convert port 25 and 27 to downlink ports, ports 29, 30, 31, and 32 are still available as four native uplink ports. Because of the threshold on the number of ports (which is maximum of 12 ports) that can be converted, you can convert 8 more downlink ports to uplink ports. For example, ports 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 13, 15, 17 are converted to uplink ports and ports 29, 30, 31 and 32 are the 4 native uplink ports (the maximum uplink port limit on Cisco 93180LC-EX switches).  When the switch is in this state and if the port profile configuration is deleted on ports 25 and 27, ports 25 and 27 are converted back to uplink ports, but there are already 12 uplink ports on the switch (as mentioned earlier). To accommodate ports 25 and 27 as uplink ports, 2 random ports from the port range 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 13, 15, 17 are denied the uplink conversion and this situation cannot be controlled by the user.  Therefore, it is mandatory to clear all the faults before reloading the leaf node to avoid any unexpected behavior regarding the port type. It should be noted that if a node is reloaded without clearing the port profile faults, especially when there is a fault related to limit-exceed, the port might not be in an expected operational state. |

 **Breakout Limitations**

| Switch | Releases | Limitations |
| --- | --- | --- |
| N9K-C9332PQ | Cisco APIC 2.2 (1) and later | * 40Gb dynamic breakouts into 4X10Gb ports are supported. * Ports 13 and 14 do not support breakouts. * Port profiles and breakouts are not supported on the same port. |
| N9K-C93180LC-EX | Cisco APIC 3.1(1) and later | * 40Gb and 100Gb dynamic breakouts are supported on ports 1 through 24 on odd numbered ports. * When the top ports (odd ports) are broken out, then the bottom ports (even ports) are error disabled. * Port profiles and breakouts are not supported on the same port. |
| N9K-C9336C-FX2 | Cisco APIC 3.1(2) and later | * 40Gb and 100Gb dynamic breakouts are supported on ports 1 through 30. * Port profiles and breakouts are not supported on the same port. |
| N9K-C93180YC-FX | Cisco APIC 3.2(1) and later | * 40Gb and 100Gb dynamic breakouts are supported on ports 49 though 52, when they are on profiled QSFP ports. To use them for   dynamic breakout, perform the following steps:    + Convert ports 49-52 to front panel ports (downlinks).   + Perform a port-profile reload, using one of the following methods:      - In the Cisco APIC GUI, navigate to Fabric > Inventory >  Pod >  Leaf, right-click Chassis and choose Reload.     - In the iBash CLI, enter the reload command.   + Apply breakouts on the profiled ports 49-52. * Ports 53 and 54 do not support either port profiles or breakouts. |

## Port Profile Configuration Summary

The following table summarizes supported uplinks and downlinks for the switches that support port profile conversions from
Uplink to Downlink and Downlink to Uplink.

## Configuring a Port Profile Using the GUI

This procedure explains how to configure a port profile, which determines the port type: uplink or downlink.

### Before you begin

* The ACI fabric is installed, APIC controllers are online, and the APIC cluster is formed and healthy.
* An APIC fabric administrator account is available that will enable creating or modifying the necessary fabric infrastructure configurations.
* The target leaf switches are registered in the ACI fabric and available.

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | From the **Fabric** menu, select **Inventory**. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | In the left navigation pane of the **Inventory** screen, select **Topology**. |
| **Step 3** | Under **Topology** tab, select the **Interface** tab in the right navigation pane. |
| **Step 4** | Select the mode as **Configuration**. |
| **Step 5** | Add a leaf switch by clicking on the + icon (**Add Switches**) in the table menu. |
| **Step 6** | In the **Add Switches** table, select the **Switch ID** and click **Add Selected**.  When you select the port, the available option is highlighted. |
| **Step 7** | Select the ports and choose the new port type as **Uplink** or **Downlink**.  The last two ports are reserved for uplink. These cannot be converted to downlink ports. |
| **Step 8** | After clicking uplink or downlink, click **Submit** (reload the switch on your own later) or **Submit and Reload Switch**.   | **Note** | Reload the switch for the change in the uplink or downlink configuration to take effect. | | --- | --- | |

## Configuring a Port Profile Using the NX-OS Style CLI

To configure a port profile using the NX-OS style CLI, perform the following steps:

### Before you begin

* The ACI fabric is installed, APIC controllers are online, and the APIC cluster is formed and healthy.
* An APIC fabric administrator account is available that will enable creating or modifying the necessary fabric infrastructure configurations.
* The target leaf switches are registered in the ACI fabric and available.

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | configure  Enters global configuration mode.  Example: ``` apic1# configure ``` |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | leaf node-id  Specifies the leaf or leaf switches to be configured.  Example: ``` apic1(config)# leaf 102 ``` |
| **Step 3** | interface type  Specifies the interface that you are configuring. You can specify the interface type and identity. For an Ethernet port, use ethernet slot / port.  Example: ``` apic1(config-leaf)# interface ethernet 1/2 ``` |
| **Step 4** | port-direction {uplink | downlink}  Determines the port direction or changes it. This example configures the port to be a downlink.   | **Note** | On the N9K-C9336C-FX switch, changing a port from uplink to downlink is not supported. | | --- | --- |   Example: ``` apic1(config-leaf-if)# port-direction downlink ``` |
| **Step 5** | Log on to the leaf switch where the port is located and enter the reload command. |

### Before you begin

* The ACI fabric is installed, APIC controllers are online, and the APIC cluster is formed and healthy.
* An APIC fabric administrator account is available that will enable creating or modifying the necessary fabric infrastructure configurations.
* The target leaf switches are registered in the ACI fabric and available.

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | To create a port profile that converts a downlink to an uplink, send a post with XML such as the following:  ``` <!-- /api/node/mo/uni/infra/prtdirec.xml --> <infraRsPortDirection tDn="topology/pod-1/paths-106/pathep-[eth1/7]" direc=“UpLink” /> ``` |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | To create a port profile that converts an uplink to a downlink, send a post with XML such as the following:  Example: ``` <!-- /api/node/mo/uni/infra/prtdirec.xml --> <infraRsPortDirection tDn="topology/pod-1/paths-106/pathep-[eth1/52]" direc=“DownLink” /> ``` |

---

## Verifying Port Profile Configuration and Conversion Using the NX-OS Style CLI

You can verify the configuration and the conversion of the ports using the
show interface brief
 CLI command.

| **Note** | ---   Port profile can be deployed only on the top ports of a Cisco N9K-C93180LC-EX switch, for example, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, and 23. When the top port is converted using the port profile, the bottom ports are hardware disabled. For example, if Eth 1/1 is converted using the port profile, Eth 1/2 is hardware disabled.   --- |
| --- | --- |

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | This example displays the output for converting an uplink port to downlink port. Before converting an uplink port to downlink port, the output is displayed in the example. The keyword routed denotes the port as uplink port.  Example: ```   switch# show interface brief <snip> Eth1/49          --      eth  routed  down   sfp-missing              100G(D)   -- Eth1/50          --      eth  routed  down   sfp-missing              100G(D)   -- <snip>   ``` |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | After configuring the port profile and reloading the switch, the output is displayed in the example. The keyword trunk denotes the port as downlink port.  Example: ```  switch# show interface brief <snip> Eth1/49          0       eth  trunk   down   sfp-missing              100G(D)   -- Eth1/50          0       eth  trunk   down   sfp-missing              100G(D)   -- <snip>   ``` |

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |
| **Hours** | 24 hours a day, 7 days a week |

## Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco

There are several ways to stay connected and receive the latest security vulnerability information from Cisco. Customers should review the following table, and subsequent summaries, to determine the appropriate option for them:

| **Cisco.com** | <https://www.cisco.com/security/> |
| --- | --- |
| **Email** | cust-security-announce@cisco.com |
| **RSS** | <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44> |
| **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API** | [https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT/](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) |
| **My Notifications** | <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html> |

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |
| **Hours** | 24 hours a day, 7 days a week |

## Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco

There are several ways to stay connected and receive the latest security vulnerability information from Cisco. Customers should review the following table, and subsequent summaries, to determine the appropriate option for them:

| **Cisco.com** | <https://www.cisco.com/security/> |

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

### **RSS Feeds**

Cisco security vulnerability information is also available via RSS feeds from Cisco.com. These feeds are free and do not require an active Cisco.com registration. For information on how to subscribe to the RSS feeds, visit the [Cisco Security RSS Feeds page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44).

### **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API**

The Cisco PSIRT openVuln application programming interface (API) is a RESTful API that conforms to the [representational state transfer](https://restfulapi.net/) (REST) software architectural style and allows customers to obtain Cisco security vulnerability information in different machine-consumable formats. To learn about accessing and using the API, visit the [PSIRT page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) on the Cisco DevNet website.

### **My Notifications**

The [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) allows registered Cisco.com users to subscribe to and receive important Cisco product and technology information, including Cisco Security Advisories. This service provides an improved unified subscription experience, allowing users to choose the timing of notifications as well as the notification delivery method (email or RSS feed). The level of access will be determined by the subscriber's relationship with Cisco.

### Creating a Notification

To create a notification, use the following steps:

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.
