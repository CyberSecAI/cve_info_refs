- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation in the apu (Application Processor Unit).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing bounds check leading to an out-of-bounds write.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Local escalation of privilege, potentially allowing an attacker to gain system execution privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: Local exploitation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: System execution privileges are needed to trigger the vulnerability. No user interaction is required.
