- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a missing bounds check in the `pqframework` component when handling input data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is an improper input validation leading to a potential out-of-bounds read, identified as CWE-20.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation leads to local information disclosure. The attacker can potentially read sensitive information due to the out-of-bounds read.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker must have some form of access to the device. The vulnerability can be triggered without user interaction.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs System execution privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
