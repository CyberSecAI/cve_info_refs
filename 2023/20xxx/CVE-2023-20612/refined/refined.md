- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing bounds check in the Radio Interface Layer (ril)
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds write due to the missing bounds check.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Local escalation of privilege, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution with System execution privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** Local attack, no user interaction is required
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs System execution privileges to trigger the vulnerability.
