## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |
| **Hours** | 24 hours a day, 7 days a week |

## Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco

There are several ways to stay connected and receive the latest security vulnerability information from Cisco. Customers should review the following table, and subsequent summaries, to determine the appropriate option for them:

| **Cisco.com** | <https://www.cisco.com/security/> |

| **My Notifications** | <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html> |

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

### **RSS Feeds**

Cisco security vulnerability information is also available via RSS feeds from Cisco.com. These feeds are free and do not require an active Cisco.com registration. For information on how to subscribe to the RSS feeds, visit the [Cisco Security RSS Feeds page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44).

### **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API**

The Cisco PSIRT openVuln application programming interface (API) is a RESTful API that conforms to the [representational state transfer](https://restfulapi.net/) (REST) software architectural style and allows customers to obtain Cisco security vulnerability information in different machine-consumable formats. To learn about accessing and using the API, visit the [PSIRT page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) on the Cisco DevNet website.

### **My Notifications**

The [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) allows registered Cisco.com users to subscribe to and receive important Cisco product and technology information, including Cisco Security Advisories. This service provides an improved unified subscription experience, allowing users to choose the timing of notifications as well as the notification delivery method (email or RSS feed). The level of access will be determined by the subscriber's relationship with Cisco.

### Creating a Notification

To create a notification, use the following steps:

1. Log in to the [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) on Cisco.com using a registered Cisco.com account name and password.

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

This vulnerability is due to improper handling of certain packets when they are sent to the inspection engine. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of crafted packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to deplete all 9,472 byte blocks on the device, resulting in traffic loss across the device or an unexpected reload of the device. If the device does not reload on its own, a manual reload of the device would be required to recover from this state.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ftd-intrusion-dos-DfT7wyGC>  This advisory is part of the November 2023 release of the Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Security Advisory Bundled publication.

Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released [free software updates](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#ssu) that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.  Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:<https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  The [Cisco Support and Downloads page](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html) on Cisco.com provides information about licensing and downloads. This page can also display customer device support coverage for customers who use the My Devices tool.  When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade. Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software To help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software, Cisco provides the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x). This tool identifies any Cisco security advisories that impact a specific software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities that are described in each advisory (“First Fixed”). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities that are described in all the advisories that the Software Checker identifies (“Combined First Fixed”).  To use the tool, go to the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) page and follow the instructions. Alternatively, use the following form to search for vulnerabilities that affect a specific software release. To use the form, follow these steps:    1. Choose which advisories the tool will search-all advisories, only advisories with a Critical or High [Security Impact Rating (SIR)](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#asr), or only this advisory.   2. Choose the appropriate software.   3. Choose the appropriate platform.   4. Enter a release number-for example, **9.16.2.11** for Cisco ASA Software or **6.6.7** for Cisco FTD Software.   5.

## About Security Intelligence

As an early line of defense against malicious internet content, Security Intelligence uses reputation intelligence to quickly
block connections to or from IP addresses, URLs, and domain names. This is called *Security Intelligence block listing*.

Security Intelligence is an early phase of access control, before the system performs more resource-intensive evaluation.
Using a Block list improves performance by quickly excluding traffic that does not require inspection.

| **Note** | ---  You cannot use a Block list to block fastpathed traffic. Prefilter evaluation occurs before Security Intelligence filtering. Fastpathed traffic bypasses all further evaluation, including Security Intelligence.  --- |
| --- | --- |

Although you can configure custom Block lists, Cisco provides access to regularly updated intelligence feeds. Sites representing
security threats such as malware, spam, botnets, and phishing appear and disappear faster than you can update and deploy custom
configurations.

You can refine Security Intelligence Block listing with Do Not Block lists and monitor-only Block lists. These mechanisms
exempt traffic from being blocked by a Block list, but do **not** automatically trust or fastpath matching traffic. Traffic added to a Do Not Block list or monitored at the Security Intelligence
stage is intentionally subject to further analysis with the rest of access control.

[Security Intelligence](objects-object-mgmt.html#ID-2243-00000135)

## Best Practices for Security Intelligence

* Configure your access control policies to block threats detected by Cisco-provided Security Intelligence feeds. See [Configuration Example: Security Intelligence Blocking](#Cisco_Task_in_List_GUI.dita_b51a6b08-0e5b-402a-908f-90c33c87a27a).
* If you want to supplement the Cisco-provided Security Intelligence feeds with custom threat data, or manually block emerging
  threats:

  + For IP addresses, use custom Security Intelligence lists and feeds, or Network objects or groups. To create these, see [Security Intelligence](objects-object-mgmt.html#ID-2243-00000135) and [Network](objects-object-mgmt.html#ID-2243-000000f2), and their subtopics. To use them for Security Intelligence, see [Configure Security Intelligence](#ID-2192-00000098). Network objects used in Security Intelligence policy require an Threat license.
  + For URLs and domains, use custom Security Intelligence lists and feeds, *not* objects or groups. See details at [Manual URL Filtering Options](access-url-filtering.html#Cisco_Reference.dita_72248e9a-706c-4e53-9bf1-de72f87b1beb).
  + You can also add entries to a Block list from events. See [Global and Domain Security Intelligence Lists](objects-object-mgmt.html#ID-2243-000001eb).
* To test new feeds, or for passive deployments, set the action from block to monitor only. See [Security Intelligence Monitoring](#Cisco_Concept.dita_b35da9d3-9b28-4a77-8e67-62e7b03fd05c).
* If you need to exclude specific sites or addresses from Security Intelligence blocking, see [Override Security Intelligence Blocking](#Cisco_Task_in_List_GUI.dita_3880ef32-70aa-40df-a8cf-07c91dad0153).
* If your Firepower deployment is integrated with SecureX or the related tool SecureX threat response (formerly known as Cisco Threat Response or CTR), and you use custom Security Intelligence lists and feeds, be sure to update
  security services exchange with these lists and feeds. For details, see instructions for configuring auto-promotion of events
  in the security services exchange online help. For general information about this integration, see Integrate with Cisco SecureX in the [Cisco Secure Firewall Management
  Center Administration Guide](http://www.cisco.com/go/firepower-config).
* System-provided Security Intelligence categories may change over time and without notification; you should plan to check periodically
  for changes, and modify your policies accordingly.
* You should also configure URL filtering, a separate feature with separate licensing requirements, for further protection against
  malicious sites. See [URL Filtering](access-url-filtering.html#id_86522).

## Security Intelligence Sources

* System-provided feeds

  Cisco provides access to regularly updated intelligence feeds for domains, URLs and IP addresses. For more information, see
  [Security Intelligence](objects-object-mgmt.html#ID-2243-00000135).

  If you see a feed with "TID" in the name, this feed is *not* used by Security Intelligence. Instead, this feed is used by the feature described in [Secure Firewall Threat Intelligence Director](threat-intelligence-director.html#topic_bqr_hf5_5y).
* Third-party feeds

  Optionally, supplement Cisco-provided feeds with third-party reputation feeds, which are dynamic lists that the Secure Firewall Management
  Center downloads from the internet on a regular basis. See [Custom Security Intelligence Feeds](objects-object-mgmt.html#ID-2243-00000278).
* Custom Block lists or feeds (or objects or groups)

  Block specific IP addresses, URLs, or domain names using a manually-created list or feed (for IP addresses, you can also use
  network objects or groups.)

  For example, if you become aware of malicious sites or addresses that are not yet blocked by a feed, add these sites to a
  custom Security Intelligence list and add this custom list to the Block list in the Security Intelligence tab of your access
  control policy, as described in [Custom Security Intelligence Lists](objects-object-mgmt.html#ID-2243-000002e9) and [Configure Security Intelligence](#ID-2192-00000098).

  For IP addresses, you can optionally use network objects rather than lists or feeds for this purpose; for information, see
  [Network](objects-object-mgmt.html#ID-2243-000000f2). (For URLs, using lists and feeds is strongly recommended over other methods.)
* Custom Do Not Block lists or feeds

  Override Security Intelligence blocking for specific sites or addresses. See [Override Security Intelligence Blocking](#Cisco_Task_in_List_GUI.dita_3880ef32-70aa-40df-a8cf-07c91dad0153).
* Global Block lists (one each for Network, URL and DNS)

  While reviewing events, you can immediately add an event's IP address, URL, or domain to the applicable Global Block List
  so that Security Intelligence will handle future traffic from that source. See [Global and Domain Security Intelligence Lists](objects-object-mgmt.html#ID-2243-000001eb).
* Global Do Not Block lists (one each for Network, URL and DNS)

  While reviewing events, you can immediately add an event's IP address, URL, or domain to the applicable Global Do Not Block
  List if you do not want Security Intelligence to block future traffic from that source. See [Global and Domain Security Intelligence Lists](objects-object-mgmt.html#ID-2243-000001eb).

## Configure Security Intelligence

Each access control policy has Security Intelligence options. You can add network objects, URL objects and lists, and Security
Intelligence feeds and lists to a Block list or Do Not Block list, and constrain any of these by security zone. You can also
associate a DNS policy with your access control policy, and add domain names to a Block or Do Not Block list.

The number of objects in the Do Not Block lists plus the number in the Block lists cannot exceed 125 network objects, or 32767
URL objects and lists.

### Before you begin

* Tip: For guidance on minimum configuration recommendations, see also [Configuration Example: Security Intelligence Blocking](#Cisco_Task_in_List_GUI.dita_b51a6b08-0e5b-402a-908f-90c33c87a27a).
* To ensure that all options are available to select, add at least one managed device to your management center.
* In passive deployments, or if you want to set Security Intelligence
  filtering to monitor-only, enable logging;
  see Logging Connections with Security
  Intelligence in the [Cisco Secure Firewall Management
  Center Administration Guide](http://www.cisco.com/go/firepower-config)
  .
* Configure a DNS policy to take Security Intelligence action for domains. For more information, see [DNS Policies](access-dns.html#topic_597B040C87AF484AACFD620694DAD35C).

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | In the access control policy editor, click Security Intelligence.  If the controls are dimmed, settings are inherited from an ancestor policy, or you do not have permission to modify the configuration. If the configuration is unlocked, uncheck Inherit from base policy to enable editing. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | You have the following options:   * Click Networks to add network objects (IP addresses).      | **Note** | Network objects used in a Security Intelligence policy require a Threat license. |   | --- | --- | * Click URLs to add URL objects. |
| **Step 3** | Find the Available Objects you want to add to the Block or Do Not Block list. You have the following options:   * Search the available objects by typing in the Search by name or value field. Clear the search string by clicking Reload (reload icon) or Clear (clear icon). * If no existing list or feed meets your needs, click Add (add icon), select New Network List or New URL List, and proceed as described in [Creating Security Intelligence Feeds](objects-object-mgmt.html#ID-2243-00000291) or [Uploading New Security Intelligence Lists to the Secure Firewall Management Center](objects-object-mgmt.html#ID-2243-00000305). * If no existing object meets your needs, click Add (add icon), select New Network Object or New URL Object, and proceed as described in [Creating Network Objects](objects-object-mgmt.html#ID-2243-0000010b).   Security Intelligence ignores IP address blocks using a `/0` netmask. |
| **Step 4** | Choose one or more Available Objects to add. |
| **Step 5** | (Optional) Choose an Available Zone to constrain the selected objects by zone.  You cannot constrain system-provided Security Intelligence lists by zone.   | **Note** | The Any zone for an SI list applies only to interfaces that are part of a security zone. However, an exception is that if a device does not have any interfaces associated with a security zone, then the Any zone will match any interface.  For example, if you have five interfaces on a device and none of them are associated with a security zone, any SI list that is assigned to the Any zone will be inspected against traffic on ALL interfaces on the device. If you add one interface to a security zone on that device, it effectively would remove SI inspection on the other four interfaces, where the zone is set to Any for an SI list. If you add the other four interfaces to a security zone, they will be evaluated by the SI list attached to the Any zone. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 6** | Click Add to Do Not Block list or Add to Block list, or click and drag the selected objects to either list.  To remove an object from a Block or Do Not Block list, click Delete (delete icon) To remove multiple objects, choose the objects and right-click to Delete Selected. |
| **Step 7** | (Optional) Set objects on the Block list to monitor-only by right-clicking the object under Block List, then choosing Monitor-only (do not block).  You cannot set system-provided global Security Intelligence lists to monitor only. |
| **Step 8** | Choose a DNS policy from the DNS Policy drop-down list. |
| **Step 9** | Click Save. |

### Security Intelligence Options

Use the Security Intelligence tab in the access control policy editor to configure network (IP address) and URL Security Intelligence,
and to associate the access control policy with a DNS policy in which you have configured Security Intelligence for domains.

#### Available Objects

Available objects include:

* Security Intelligence categories populated by the system-provided feed.

  For details, see [Security Intelligence Categories](#Cisco_Reference.dita_c2799e42-d01e-439e-9aae-e3deb9a94a63).
* System-provided Global Block and Do Not Block lists.

  For descriptions, see [Security Intelligence Sources](#ID-2192-0000002b).
* Security Intelligence lists and feeds that you create under Object > Object Management > Security Intelligence.

  For descriptions, see [Security Intelligence Sources](#ID-2192-0000002b).
* Network and URL objects and groups that are configured on the respective pages under Object > Object Management. These are
  different from the Security Intelligence objects in the previous bullet.

  For details about network objects, see [Network](objects-object-mgmt.html#ID-2243-000000f2). (For URLs, use Security Intelligence lists or feeds rather than objects or groups.)

#### Available Zones

Except for the system-provided Global lists, you can constrain Security Intelligence filtering by zone.

For example: To improve performance, you may want to target enforcement. As a more specific example, you can block spam only
for a security zone that handles email traffic.

To enforce Security Intelligence filtering for an object on multiple zones, you must add the object to the Block or Do Not
Block list separately for each zone.

#### DNS Policy

In order to match DNS traffic using Security Intelligence, you must select a DNS policy for your Security Intelligence configuration.

Using Block or Do Not Block lists, or monitoring traffic based on a DNS list or feed, also requires that you:

* Configure DNS Security Intelligence lists and feeds. See [Security Intelligence](objects-object-mgmt.html#ID-2243-00000135).
* Create a DNS policy. See [Creating Basic DNS Policies](access-dns.html#task_A456C66B7ACF488FB8E74FC4A7F7A516) for more information.
* Configure DNS rules that reference your DNS lists or feeds. See [Creating and Editing DNS Rules](access-dns.html#task_A147A86396C348168474AEE4517AAB2B) for more information.
* Because you deploy the DNS policy as part of your access control policy, you must associate both policies. See [DNS Policy Deploy](access-dns.html#concept_850E5A96214E4EE487736533D634E8A2) for more information.

#### Do Not Block List

See [Override Security Intelligence Blocking](#Cisco_Task_in_List_GUI.dita_3880ef32-70aa-40df-a8cf-07c91dad0153).

To select all objects in the list, right-click an object.

#### Block List

See [Configuration Example: Security Intelligence Blocking](#Cisco_Task_in_List_GUI.dita_b51a6b08-0e5b-402a-908f-90c33c87a27a) and other topics in this chapter.

For explanations of the visual indicators in the Block list, see [Block List Icons](#Cisco_Reference.dita_ab471e93-ab48-4c74-9267-69c145c1c17a).

To select all objects in the list, right-click an object.

#### Logging

Security Intelligence logging, enabled by default, logs all blocked and monitored connections handled by an access control
policy’s target devices. However, the system does not log Do Not Block list matches; logging of connections on the Do Not
Block list depends on their eventual disposition. Logging must be enabled for connections on the Block list before you can
set objects on that list to monitor-only.

To enable, disable, or view logging settings, right-click an object in the Block list.

Security Intelligence categories are determined by the system-provided feeds described in [Security Intelligence](objects-object-mgmt.html#ID-2243-00000135).

These categories are used in the following locations:

* The Networks sub-tab on the Security Intelligence tab of an access control policy
* The URLs sub-tab beside the Networks tab on the Security Intelligence tab of an access control policy
* In a DNS policy on the DNS tab in the DNS rule configuration page
* In events generated when traffic matches Block or Monitor configurations in the above locations

| **Note** | ---   If your organization is using Secure Firewall threat intelligence director: When viewing events, you may see categories that indicate that the action was taken by TID, such as `TID URL Block`.   --- |
| --- | --- |

Categories are updated by Talos from the cloud, and this list may change independently of Firepower releases.

Table 1. Cisco Talos Intelligence Group
(Talos) Feed Categories

| Security Intelligence Category | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Attackers | Active scanners and hosts known for outbound malicious activity |
| Banking\_fraud | Sites that engage in fraudulent activities that relate to electronic banking |
| Bogon | Bogon networks and unallocated IP addresses |
| Bots | Sites that host binary malware droppers |
| CnC | Sites that host command-and-control servers for botnets |
| Cryptomining | Hosts providing remote access to pools and wallets for the purpose of mining cryptocurrency |
| Dga | Malware algorithms used to generate a large number of domain names acting as rendezvous points with their command-and-control servers |
| Exploitkit | Software kits designed to identify software vulnerabilities in clients |
| High\_risk | Domains and hostnames that match against the OpenDNS predictive security algorithms from security graph |
| Ioc | Hosts that have been observed to engage in Indicators of Compromise (IOC) |
| Link\_sharing | Websites that share copyrighted files without permission |
| Malicious | Sites exhibiting malicious behavior that do not necessarily fit into another, more granular, threat category |
| Malware | Sites that host malware binaries or exploit kits |
| Newly\_seen | Domains that have recently been registered, or not yet seen via telemetry.   | **Attention** | Currently, this category does not have any active feed and is reserved for future use. | | --- | --- | |
| Open\_proxy | Open proxies that allow anonymous web browsing |
| Open\_relay | Open mail relays that are known to be used for spam |
| Phishing | Sites that host phishing pages |
| Response | IP addresses and URLs that are actively participating in malicious or suspicious activity |
| Spam | Mail hosts that are known for sending spam |
| Spyware | Sites that are known to contain, serve, or support spyware and adware activities |
| Suspicious | Files that appear to be suspicious and have characteristics that resemble known malware |
| Tor\_exit\_node | Hosts known to offer exit node services for the Tor Anonymizer network |

### Block List Icons

The following visual indicators may appear in the Block list on the Security Intelligence tab in an access control policy:

| Icon or Visual Indicator | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Block (block icon) | The object is set to block. |
| Monitor (monitor icon) | The object is set to monitor-only.  See [Security Intelligence Monitoring](#Cisco_Concept.dita_b35da9d3-9b28-4a77-8e67-62e7b03fd05c) |
| An object is displayed in strikethrough text | The same object is also on the Do Not Block list, which overrides the block. |

### Configuration Example: Security Intelligence Blocking

Configure your access control policy to block all threats detectable by the system's regularly updated Security Intelligence
feeds.

The number of objects in the Block lists plus the number in the Do Not Block lists cannot exceed 125 network objects, or 32767
URL objects and lists.

#### Before you begin

* To ensure that all options are available to select, add at least one managed device to your management center.
* Configure a DNS policy to block all Security Intelligence threat categories for domains. For more information, see [DNS Policies](access-dns.html#topic_597B040C87AF484AACFD620694DAD35C).
* If you have, or will have, custom lists of entities to block, create a Security Intelligence object of each type (URLs, DNS,
  Networks.) See [Security Intelligence](objects-object-mgmt.html#ID-2243-00000135).

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Click Policies > Access Control. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Create a new access control policy or edit an existing policy. |
| **Step 3** | In the access control policy editor, click Security Intelligence.  If the controls are dimmed, settings are inherited from an ancestor policy, or you do not have permission to modify the configuration. If the configuration is unlocked, uncheck Inherit from base policy to enable editing. |
| **Step 4** | Click Networks to add blocking criteria for IP addresses.   1. Scroll down in the Networks list and select all of the threat categories listed below the Global lists. 2. If applicable, select the security zones for which you want to block these threats. 3. Click Add to Block List. 4. If you have created custom lists or feeds with addresses to block, add those to the Block List using the same steps as above. |
| **Step 5** | Click URLs to add blocking criteria for URLs, and repeat the steps you followed for Networks. |
| **Step 6** | Choose a DNS policy from the DNS Policy drop-down list; see [DNS Policy Overview](access-dns.html#concept_0348C9C9AE3E449CB544BBD4D52B8497). |
| **Step 7** | Click Save. |

---

#### What to do next

* Enable logging for these connections; see Logging Connections with Security Intelligence in
  the [Cisco Secure Firewall Management
  Center Administration Guide](http://www.cisco.com/go/firepower-config)
  .
* Deploy configuration changes; see [Deploy Configuration Changes](get-started-deployment.html#task_75E181687ECF4EFC8EB6AF4509C20C0B).
* For additional protection, configure URL filtering to block malicious URLs. See [URL Filtering](access-url-filtering.html#id_86522).

## Security Intelligence Monitoring

Monitoring logs connection events for traffic that would have been blocked by Security Intelligence, but does not block the
traffic. Monitoring is especially useful for:

* Testing feeds before you implement them.

  Consider a scenario where you want to test a third-party feed before you implement blocking using that feed. When you set
  the feed to monitor-only, the system allows connections that would have been blocked to be further analyzed by the system,
  but also logs a record of each of those connections for your evaluation.
* Passive deployments, to optimize performance.

  Managed devices that are deployed passively cannot affect traffic flow; there is no advantage to configuring the system to
  block traffic. Additionally, because blocked connections are not actually blocked in passive deployments, the system may report
  multiple beginning-of-connection events for each blocked connection.

| **Note** | ---   If configured, Secure Firewall threat intelligence director may impact the action taken (Monitor or Block.) For more information, see [Threat Intelligence Director-Management Center Action Prioritization](threat-intelligence-director.html#reference_sfb_wf5_5y).   --- |
| --- | --- |

### To Configure Security Intelligence Monitoring:

After you configure Security Intelligence blocking following the instructions in [Configuration Example: Security Intelligence Blocking](#Cisco_Task_in_List_GUI.dita_b51a6b08-0e5b-402a-908f-90c33c87a27a), right-click each applicable object in the Block list and choose Monitor-only. You cannot set system-provided Security Intelligence lists to monitor only.

## Override Security Intelligence Blocking

Optionally, you can use Do Not Block lists to exempt specific domains, URLs, or IP addresses from being blocked by Security
Intelligence lists or feeds.

For example, you can:

* Override the occasional false-positive block in a reputable Security Intelligence feed
* Inspect specific traffic in depth instead of blocking it early based on reputation
* Exempt otherwise-restricted transactions based on zone from Security Intelligence blocking

  For example, you can add an improperly classified URL to a Do Not Block list, but then restrict the Do Not Block list object
  using a security zone used by those in your organization who need to access those URLs. That way, only those with a business
  need can access the URLs on the Do Not Block list.

| **Note** | ---   Entries on a Do Not Block list are simply exemptions from the block list. Any connection that passes the Security Intelligence policy is subject to the access control rules. Thus, an entry in the Do Not Block list can subsequently be blocked by an access control rule or intrusion policy. Your Do Not Block entries should always be exemptions from your block lists.   --- |
| --- | --- |

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Option 1: Add an IP address, URL, or domain from an event to the Global Do Not Block List. See [Global and Domain Security Intelligence Lists](objects-object-mgmt.html#ID-2243-000001eb). |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Option 2: Use a custom Security Intelligence list or feed.   1. Create the custom Security Intelligence list or feed. See [Custom Security Intelligence Lists](objects-object-mgmt.html#ID-2243-000002e9) or [Creating Security Intelligence Feeds](objects-object-mgmt.html#ID-2243-00000291). 2. For IP addresses (Networks) and URLs: Edit your access control policy, click the Security Intelligence tab, then click the    custom list or feed in the Networks or URLs sub-tab, then click Add to Do Not Block List. 3. Save your changes. 4. For domains (DNS): See the "DNS Policy" section in the [Security Intelligence Options](#ID-2192-00000072) topic. 5. Deploy your changes. |

## Troubleshooting Security Intelligence

See the following topics for troubleshooting Security Intelligence.

* [Security Intelligence Categories Are Missing from the Available Options List](#id_114227)

### Security Intelligence Categories Are Missing from the Available Options List

**Symptoms:** On the Security Intelligence tab of the access control policy, Security Intelligence categories (such as CnC or Exploitkit)
are not displayed in the Networks tab under Available Options.

**Cause:**

* These categories do not appear until you have added at least one managed device to your management center. You must add a
  device in order to pull all TALOS feeds.
* The URL filtering feature uses a different set of categories than the Security Intelligence feature; the category that you
  expect to see may be a URL filtering category. To see URL filtering categories, look at the URLs tab in an access control rule.

## History for Security Intelligence Block Listing

| Feature | Minimum Management Center | Minimum Threat Defense | Details |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| New Security Intelligence categories | All | Any | Talos has added the following new Security Intelligence categories:   * banking\_fraud * ioc * high\_risk * link\_sharing * malicious * newly\_seen * spyware   You should update your access control and DNS policies to address the new categories, and check periodically for future changes.  New/modified pages: Security Intelligence tab, Networks and URLs sub-tabs; DNS rules in DNS policies  Supported platforms: management center |

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

### **RSS Feeds**

Cisco security vulnerability information is also available via RSS feeds from Cisco.com. These feeds are free and do not require an active Cisco.com registration. For information on how to subscribe to the RSS feeds, visit the [Cisco Security RSS Feeds page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44).

### **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API**

The Cisco PSIRT openVuln application programming interface (API) is a RESTful API that conforms to the [representational state transfer](https://restfulapi.net/) (REST) software architectural style and allows customers to obtain Cisco security vulnerability information in different machine-consumable formats. To learn about accessing and using the API, visit the [PSIRT page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) on the Cisco DevNet website.

### **My Notifications**

The [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) allows registered Cisco.com users to subscribe to and receive important Cisco product and technology information, including Cisco Security Advisories. This service provides an improved unified subscription experience, allowing users to choose the timing of notifications as well as the notification delivery method (email or RSS feed). The level of access will be determined by the subscriber's relationship with Cisco.

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

[How Policies Examine Traffic For Intrusions](intrusion-overview.html#ID-2247-0000004f)

## Intrusion Policy Basics

*Intrusion policies* are defined sets of intrusion detection
and prevention configurations that inspect traffic for security violations and,
in inline deployments, can block or alter malicious traffic. Intrusion policies
are invoked by your access control policy and are the system’s last line of
defense before traffic is allowed to its destination.

At the heart of each intrusion policy are the intrusion rules.
An enabled rule causes the system to generate intrusion events for (and
optionally block) traffic matching the rule. Disabling a rule stops processing
of the rule.

The system delivers several base intrusion policies, which
enable you to take advantage of the experience of the
Talos Intelligence Group.
For these policies,
Talos
sets intrusion and preprocessor rule states (enabled or disabled), as well as
provides the initial configurations for other advanced settings.

| **Tip** | ---   System-provided intrusion and network analysis policies are similarly named but contain different configurations. For example, the Balanced Security and Connectivity network analysis policy and the Balanced Security and Connectivity intrusion policy work together and can both be updated in intrusion rule updates. However, the network analysis policy governs mostly preprocessing options, whereas the intrusion policy governs mostly intrusion rules.   --- |
| --- | --- |

If you create a custom intrusion policy, you can:

* Tune detection by enabling and disabling rules, as well as by
  writing and adding your own rules.
* Use Cisco recommendations to
  associate the operating systems, servers, and client application protocols
  detected on your network with rules specifically written to protect those
  assets.
* Configure various advanced settings such as external alerting,
  sensitive data preprocessing, and global rule thresholding.
* Use layers as building blocks to efficiently manage multiple
  intrusion policies.

In an inline deployment, an intrusion policy can block and
modify traffic:

* *Drop rules* can drop matching packets and generate intrusion
  events. To configure an intrusion or preprocessor drop rule, set its state to
  Drop and Generate Events.
* Intrusion rules can use the
  `replace` keyword to replace malicious content.

For intrusion rules to affect traffic, you must correctly configure drop
rules and rules that replace content, as well as correctly deploy managed devices
inline, that is, with inline interface sets. Finally, you must enable the intrusion
policy’s *drop behavior*, or Drop when Inline setting.

When tailoring your intrusion policy, especially when enabling
and adding rules, keep in mind that some intrusion rules require that traffic
first be decoded or preprocessed in a certain way. Before an intrusion policy
examines a packet, the packet is preprocessed according to configurations in a
network analysis policy. If you disable a required preprocessor, the system
automatically uses it with its current settings, although the preprocessor
remains disabled in the network analysis policy web interface.

| **Caution** | ---   Because preprocessing and intrusion inspection are so closely related, the network analysis and intrusion policies examining a single packet **must** complement each other. Tailoring preprocessing, especially using multiple custom network analysis policies, is an **advanced** task.   --- |
| --- | --- |

After you configure a custom intrusion policy, you can use it as
part of your access control configuration by associating the intrusion policy
with one or more access control rules or an access control policy’s default
action. This forces the system to use the intrusion policy to examine certain
allowed traffic before the traffic passes to its final destination. A variable
set that you pair with the intrusion policy allows you to accurately reflect
your home and external networks and, as appropriate, the servers on your
network.

Note that by default, the system disables intrusion inspection
of encrypted payloads. This helps reduce false positives and improve
performance when an encrypted connection matches an access control rule that
has intrusion inspection configured.

* the time and date the policy was last modified (in local time) and the user who modified it
* whether the Drop when Inline setting is enabled, which allows you to drop and modify traffic in an inline deployment. An inline deployment could be configurations
  that are deployed to devices using routed, switched, or transparent interfaces, or inline interface pairs.
* which access control policies and devices are using the intrusion policy to inspect traffic
* whether a policy has unsaved changes, as well as information about who (if anyone) is currently editing the policy

## Custom Intrusion Policy Creation

When you create a new intrusion policy you must give it a unique
name, specify a base policy, and specify drop behavior.

The base policy defines the intrusion policy’s default settings.
Modifying a setting in the new policy overrides—but does not change—the
settings in the base policy. You can use either a system-provided or custom
policy as your base policy.

* [Creating a Custom Snort 2 Intrusion Policy](#ID-2231-0000009b)

### Creating a Custom Snort 2 Intrusion Policy

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Choose Policies > Access Control > Intrusion. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click Create Policy. If you have unsaved changes in another policy, click Cancel when prompted to return to the Intrusion Policy page.  Ensure the Intrusion Policies tab is selected. |
| **Step 3** | Enter a unique Name and, optionally, a Description. |
| **Step 4** | Choose the Inspection Mode.  The selected action determines whether intrusion rules block and alert (Prevention mode) or only alert (Detection mode). |
| **Step 5** | Choose the initial Base Policy.  You can use either a system-provided or another custom policy as your base policy. |
| **Step 6** | Click Save.  The new policy has the same settings as its base policy. |

[Configuring Intrusion Rules in Layers](intrusion-layers.html#ID-2233-00000236)

### Intrusion Policy Changes

When you create a new intrusion policy, it has the same
intrusion rule and advanced settings as its base policy.

The system caches one intrusion policy per user. While editing
an intrusion policy, if you choose any menu or other path to another page, your
changes stay in the system cache even if you leave the page.

## Access Control Rule Configuration to Perform Intrusion Prevention

An access control policy can have multiple access control rules
associated with intrusion policies. You can configure intrusion inspection for
any Allow or Interactive Block access control rule, which permits you to match
different intrusion inspection profiles against different types of traffic on
your network before it reaches its final destination.

Whenever the system uses an intrusion policy to evaluate
traffic, it uses an associated
*variable set*. Variables in a set represent values commonly
used in intrusion rules to identify source and destination IP addresses and
ports. You can also use variables in intrusion policies to represent IP
addresses in rule suppressions and dynamic rule states.

| **Tip** | ---   Even if you use system-provided intrusion policies, Cisco **strongly** recommends you configure the system’s intrusion variables to accurately reflect your network environment. At a minimum, modify default variables in the default set.   --- |
| --- | --- |

### Understanding System-Provided and Custom Intrusion Policies

Cisco delivers several intrusion policies with the system. By using system-provided intrusion policies, you can take advantage
of the experience of the Talos Intelligence Group. For these policies, Talos sets intrusion and preprocessor rule states, as well as provides the initial configurations for advanced settings. You can
use system-provided policies as-is, or you can use them as the base for custom policies. Building custom policies can improve
the performance of the system in your environment and provide a focused view of the malicious traffic and policy violations
occurring on your network.

### Connection and Intrusion Event Logging

When an intrusion policy invoked by an access control rule detects an intrusion and generates an intrusion event, it saves
that event to the Secure Firewall Management
Center. The system also automatically logs the end of the connection where the intrusion occurred to the Secure Firewall Management
Center database, regardless of the logging configuration of the access control rule.

* [Configuring an Access Control Rule to Perform Intrusion Prevention](#ID-2177-00000157)

**Related References**
[Predefined Default Variables](objects-object-mgmt.html#ID-2243-00000521)

### Access Control Rule Configuration and Intrusion Policies

The number of unique intrusion policies you can use in a single
access control policy depends on the model of the target devices; more powerful
devices can handle more. Every unique
**pair** of intrusion policy and variable set counts as one
policy. Although you can associate a different intrusion policy-variable set
pair with each Allow and Interactive Block rule (as well as with the default
action), you cannot deploy an access control policy if the target devices have
insufficient resources to perform inspection as configured.

### Configuring an Access Control Rule to Perform Intrusion Prevention

You must be an Admin, Access Admin, or Network Admin to perform this task.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | In the access control policy editor, create a new rule or edit an existing rule; see [Access Control Rule Components](access-rules.html#ID-2190-00000053). |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Ensure the rule action is set to Allow, Interactive Block, or Interactive Block with reset. |
| **Step 3** | Click Inspection. |
| **Step 4** | Choose a system-provided or custom Intrusion Policy, or choose None to disable intrusion inspection for traffic that matches the access control rule. |
| **Step 5** | If you want to change the variable set associated with the intrusion policy, choose a value from the Variable Set drop-down list. |
| **Step 6** | Click Save to save the rule. |
| **Step 7** | Click Save to save the policy. |

#### What to do next

* Deploy configuration changes; see [Deploy Configuration Changes](get-started-deployment.html#task_75E181687ECF4EFC8EB6AF4509C20C0B).

## Drop Behavior in an Inline Deployment

If you want to assess how your configuration would function in an inline deployment (that is, where relevant configurations
are deployed to devices using routed, switched, or transparent interfaces, or inline interface pairs) without actually affecting
traffic, you can disable drop behavior. In this case, the system generates intrusion events but does not drop packets that
trigger the drop rules. When you are satisfied with the results, you can enable drop behavior.

Note that in passive or inline deployments in tap mode, the system cannot affect traffic regardless of the drop behavior.
In a passive deployment, rules set to Drop and Generate Events behave identically to rules set to Generate Events. The system generates intrusion events but cannot drop packets.

| **Note** | ---   Suppose a file Block action causes a Block or Pending file policy verdict on a packet, and later, an IPS event is generated on the same packet. In that case, the IPS event is marked as Dropped instead of Would have dropped even if the IPS policy is in detection mode (IDS).   --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---   To block the transfer of malware over FTP, you must not only correctly configure malware defense, but also enable Drop when Inline in your access control policy’s default intrusion policy.   --- |
| --- | --- |

When you view intrusion events, workflows can include the
*inline result*, which indicates whether traffic was actually
dropped, or whether it only would have dropped.

* [Setting Drop Behavior in an Inline Deployment](#ID-2231-00000196)

### Setting Drop Behavior in an Inline Deployment

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Choose Policies > Access Control > Intrusion. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click Snort 2 Version next to the policy you want to edit.  If View (View button) appears instead, the configuration belongs to an ancestor domain, or you do not have permission to modify the configuration. |
| **Step 3** | Set the policy’s drop behavior:   * Check the   Drop when Inline   check box to allow intrusion rules to affect traffic and generate events. * Clear the   Drop when Inline   check box to prevent intrusion rules from affecting traffic while still   generating events. |
| **Step 4** | Click Commit Changes to save changes you made in this policy since the last policy commit.  If you leave the policy without committing changes, changes since the last commit are discarded if you edit a different policy. |

---

#### What to do next

* Deploy configuration changes; see [Deploy Configuration Changes](get-started-deployment.html#task_75E181687ECF4EFC8EB6AF4509C20C0B).

## Drop Behavior in a Dual System Deployment

When there are two systems connected back to back in a network, it is normal to see the first system drop events and still
record a drop or "would have dropped" event on the second system. The first system decides to drop the packets by the time
it scans the last packet of the file, while the second system also investigates and identifies the traffic as "to be dropped".

For example, a 5 packet HTTP GET request whose first packet triggers a rule is blocked by the first system and only the last
packet is dropped. The second system receives only 4 packets and the connection gets dropped, but when the second system finally
flushes the partial GET request while it is pruning the session, it triggers the same rule with "would have dropped" as the
inline result.

## Intrusion Policy Advanced Settings

An intrusion policy’s
*advanced settings* require specific expertise to configure.
The base policy for your intrusion policy determines which advanced settings
are enabled by default and the default configuration for each.

When you choose
Advanced Settings in the navigation panel of an
intrusion policy, the policy lists its advanced settings by type. On the
Advanced Settings page, you can enable or disable advanced settings in your
intrusion policy, as well as access advanced setting configuration pages. An
advanced setting must be enabled for you to configure it.

When you disable an advanced setting, the sublink and Edit link no longer appear, but your configurations are retained. Note that some intrusion policy configurations (sensitive data
rules, SNMP alerts for intrusion rules) require enabled and correctly configured advanced settings.

Modifying the configuration of an advanced setting requires an
understanding of the configuration you are modifying and its potential impact
on your network.

### Specific Threat Detection

The sensitive data preprocessor detects sensitive data such as
credit card numbers and Social Security numbers in ASCII text.

Note that other preprocessors that detect specific threats (back
orifice attacks, several portscan types, and rate-based attacks that attempt to
overwhelm your network with excessive traffic) are configured in network
analysis policies.

### Intrusion Rule Thresholds

Global rule thresholding can prevent your system from being
overwhelmed with a large number of events by allowing you to use thresholds to
limit the number of times the system logs and displays intrusion events.

### External Responses

In addition to the various views of intrusion events in the web
interface, you can enable logging to system log (syslog) facilities or send event
data to an SNMP trap server. Per policy, you can specify intrusion event
notification limits, set up intrusion event notification to external logging
facilities, and configure external responses to intrusion events.

Note that in addition to these per-policy alerting
configurations, you can globally enable or disable email alerting on intrusion
events for each rule or rule group. Your email alert settings are used
regardless of which intrusion policy processes a packet.

## Optimizing Performance for Intrusion Detection and Prevention

If you want the
system to perform intrusion detection and prevention but do not need
to take advantage of discovery data, you can optimize performance by disabling
new discovery as described below.

### Before you begin

To perform this task, you must have one of the following user roles:

* Admin, Access Admin, or Network Admin for access control.
* Admin or Discovery Admin for network discovery.

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Modify or delete rules associated with the access control policy deployed at the target device. None of the access control rules associated with that device can have user, application, or URL conditions; see [Create and Edit Access Control Rules](access-rules.html#ID-2190-00000090). |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Delete all rules from the network discovery policy for the target device; see [Configuring Network Discovery Rules](discovery-policies.html#ID-2223-0000010b). |
| **Step 3** | Deploy the changed configuration to the target device; see [Deploy Configuration Changes](get-started-deployment.html#task_75E181687ECF4EFC8EB6AF4509C20C0B). |

# Intrusion Policies

The following topics explain intrusion policies and the closely
associated network analysis policies (NAP). Intrusion policies include rules
that check traffic for threats and block traffic that appears to be an attack.
Network analysis policies control traffic preprocessing, which prepares traffic
to be further inspected by normalizing traffic and identifying protocol
anomalies.

Because preprocessing and intrusion inspection are so closely related,
the network analysis and intrusion policies examining a single packet must
complement each other.

## About Intrusion and Network Analysis Policies

Network analysis and intrusion policies work together to detect and
prevent intrusion threats.

* A network analysis policy (NAP) governs how traffic is decoded and
  preprocessed so that it can be further evaluated, especially for anomalous
  traffic that might signal an intrusion attempt.
* An intrusion policy uses intrusion and preprocessor rules, which are
  collectively known as intrusion rules, to examine the decoded packets for
  attacks based on patterns. The rules can either prevent (drop) the threatening
  traffic and generate an event, or simply detect (alert) it and generate an
  event only.

As the system analyzes traffic, the network analysis decoding and
preprocessing phase occurs before and separately from the intrusion prevention
phase. Together, network analysis and intrusion policies provide broad and deep
packet inspection. They can help you detect, alert on, and protect against
network traffic that could threaten the availability, integrity, and
confidentiality of hosts and their data.

### System-Defined Network Analysis and Intrusion Policies

The system includes several pairs of same-named network analysis and intrusion policies that complement and work with each
other. For example there are both NAP and intrusion policies named “Balanced Security and Connectivity,” which are meant to
be used together. The system-provided policies are configured by the Cisco Talos Intelligence Group
(Talos). For these policies, Talos sets the intrusion and preprocessor rule states and provides the initial configurations for preprocessors and other advanced
settings.

As new vulnerabilities become known, Talos releases intrusion rule updates. These rule updates can modify any system-provided network analysis or intrusion policy,
and can provide new and updated intrusion rules and preprocessor rules, modified states for existing rules, and modified default
policy settings. Rule updates might also delete rules from system-provided policies and provide new rule categories, as well
as modify the default variable set.

You can manually update the rules database, or configure a regular
update schedule. You must deploy an update for it to take effect. For more
information on updating system databases, see
[Updating System Databases](fptd-fdm-mgmt.html#id_11511).

The following are the system-provided policies:

Balanced Security and Connectivity network analysis and intrusion
policies

These policies are built for both speed and detection. Used
together, they serve as a good starting point for most networks and deployment
types. The system uses the Balanced Security and Connectivity network analysis
policy as the default.

Connectivity Over Security network analysis and intrusion policies

These policies are built for networks where connectivity, the
ability to get to all resources, takes precedence over network infrastructure
security. The intrusion policy enables far fewer rules than those enabled in
the Security over Connectivity policy. Only the most critical rules that block
traffic are enabled.

Security Over Connectivity network analysis and intrusion policies

These policies are built for networks where network infrastructure
security takes precedence over user convenience. The intrusion policy enables
numerous network anomaly intrusion rules that could alert on or drop legitimate
traffic.

Maximum Detection network analysis and intrusion policies

These policies are built for networks where network infrastructure
security is given even more emphasis than is given by the Security Over
Connectivity policies, with the potential for even greater operational impact.
For example, the intrusion policy enables rules in a large number of threat
categories including malware, exploit kit, old and common vulnerabilities, and
known in-the-wild exploits.

### Inspection Mode: Prevention vs. Detection

By default, all intrusion policies operate in Prevention mode to implement an Intrusion
Prevention System (IPS). In the Prevention inspection mode, if a connection matches an
intrusion rule whose action is to drop traffic, the connection is actively blocked.

If you instead want to test the effect of the intrusion policy on your network, you can
change the mode to Detection, which implements an Intrusion Detection System (IDS). In
this inspection mode, drop rules are treated like alert rules, where you are notified of
matching connections, but the action result becomes Would Have Blocked, and connections
are never in fact blocked.

You change the inspection mode per intrusion policy, so you can have a mix of prevention
and detection.

The Snort 3 network analysis policy (NAP) also has an
inspection mode. Unlike the intrusion policy, the NAP policy is global, so you must run
all NAP processing in either Prevention or Detection mode. You should use the same mode
you use for your intrusion policies. If you have a mix of Prevention and Detection
policies, select Prevention to match your most restrictive intrusion policies.

### Intrusion and Preprocessor Rules

An intrusion rule is a specified set of keywords and arguments that the
system uses to detect attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in your network. As
the system analyzes network traffic, it compares packets against the conditions
specified in each rule, and triggers the rule if the data packet meets all the
conditions specified in the rule.

The system includes the following types of rules created by Cisco Talos Intelligence Group
(Talos):

* Intrusion rules, which are subdivided into shared object rules and
  standard text rules
* Preprocessor rules, which are rules associated with preprocessors
  and packet decoder detection options in the network analysis policy. Most
  preprocessor rules are disabled by default.

The following topics explain intrusion rules in more depth.

* [Intrusion Rule Attributes](#concept_C4C21B1BDF794F468738C9F836C6C87B)
* [Default Intrusion Variable Set](#concept_AF54E757E6694EE4B08030A4EA1D737C)
* [Generator Identifiers](#concept_821B9C87DA8744CB8E3C2375A1DB3C9B)

#### Intrusion Rule Attributes

When you view an intrusion policy, you see a list of all the intrusion rules available for
identifying threats.

The list of rules for each policy is the same. The difference is in the action configured for each rule. Because there are
over 30,000 rules, scrolling through the list will take time. Rules are revealed as you scroll through the list.

Following are the
attributes that define each rule:

> (Signature
Description)

Click the > button in the left column to open the signature description. The description is the actual code used by the Snort inspection
engine to match traffic against the rule. Explaining the code is out of scope for this document, but it is explained in detail
in Management Center Configuration Guide; select the book for your software version from <http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/security/defense-center/products-installation-and-configuration-guides-list.html>. Look for information on intrusion rule editing.

The signatures
contain variables for certain items. For more information, see
[Default Intrusion Variable Set](#concept_AF54E757E6694EE4B08030A4EA1D737C).

GID

Generator Identifier (ID). This number indicates which system component evaluates the rule
and generates events. A 1 indicates a standard text intrusion rule, a 3
indicates a shared object intrusion rule. (The difference in these rule
types is not meaningful for a device
manager user.) These are the main rules of interest when configuring an intrusion
policy. For information on the other GIDs, see [Generator Identifiers](#concept_821B9C87DA8744CB8E3C2375A1DB3C9B).

SID

Snort Identifier (ID), also called signature ID. Snort IDs lower than 1000000 were created by the Cisco Talos Intelligence Group
(Talos).

Action

The state of
this rule in the selected intrusion policy. For each rule, “(Default)” is added
to the action that is the default action for the rule within this policy. To
return a rule to its default setting, you select this action. Possible actions
are:

* Alert—Create an
  event when this rule matches traffic, but do not drop the connection.
* Drop—Create an
  event when this rule matches traffic, and also drop the connection.
* Disabled—Do not
  match traffic against this rule. No events are generated.

Status

For Snort 2 rules, Status is a separate column. If you change the default
action for a rule, this column shows “Overridden.” Otherwise, the column is
empty.

For Snort 3 rules, the “Overridden” status is shown at the bottom of the
Action attribute, if you changed it.

Message

This is the name
of the rule, which also appears in events triggered by the rule. The message
typically identifies the threat that the signature matches. You can search the
Internet for more information on each threat.

#### Default Intrusion Variable Set

The intrusion rule

#### Generator Identifiers

The generator identifier (GID) identifies the subsystem that
evaluates an intrusion rule and generates events. Standard text intrusion rules
have a generator ID of 1, and shared
object intrusion rules have a generator ID of 3. There are also several sets of
rules for various preprocessors. The following table explains the GIDs.

Table 1. Generator IDs

| ID | Component |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Standard Text Rule. |
| 2 | Tagged Packets.  (Rules for the Tag generator, which generates packets from a tagged session. ) |
| 3 | Shared Object Rule. |
| 102 | HTTP Decoder. |
| 105 | Back Orifice Detector. |
| 106 | RPC Decoder. |
| 116 | Packet Decoder. |
| 119, 120 | HTTP Inspect Preprocessor.  (GID 120 rules relate to server-specific HTTP traffic.) |
| 122 | Portscan Detector. |
| 123 | IP Defragmentor. |
| 124 | SMTP Decoder.  (Exploits against SMTP verbs.) |
| 125 | FTP Decoder. |
| 126 | Telnet Decoder. |
| 128 | SSH Preprocessor. |
| 129 | Stream Preprocessor. |
| 131 | DNS Preprocessor. |
| 133 | DCE/RPC Preprocessor. |
| 134 | Rule Latency, Packet Latency.  (Events for these rules are generated when rule latency suspends (SID 1) or re-enables (SID 2) a group of intrusion rules, or when the system stops inspecting a packet because the packet latency threshold is exceeded (SID 3).) |
| 135 | Rate-Based Attack Detector.  (Excessive connections to hosts on the network.) |
| 137 | SSL Preprocessor. |
| 138, 139 | Sensitive Data Preprocessor. |
| 140 | SIP Preprocessor. |
| 141 | IMAP Preprocessor. |
| 142 | POP Preprocessor. |
| 143 | GTP Preprocessor. |
| 144 | Modbus Preprocessor. |
| 145 | DNP3 Preprocessor. |

### Network Analysis Policies

Network analysis policies control traffic preprocessing. Preprocessors prepare traffic to be
further inspected by normalizing traffic and identifying protocol anomalies. Network
analysis-related preprocessing occurs after Security Intelligence drops and SSL
decryption, but before access control and intrusion or file inspection.

By default, the system uses the Balanced Security and Connectivity network analysis
policy to preprocess all traffic handled by the access control policy. However, if
you configure an intrusion policy on any access control rule, the system uses the
network analysis policy that matches the most aggressive intrusion policy applied.
For example, if you use both Security over Connectivity and Balanced policies in
your access control rules, the system uses the Security over Connectivity NAP for
all traffic. For Snort 3 custom intrusion
policies, this assignment is done according to the base template policy assigned
to the intrusion policy.

When using Snort 3, you can select a policy explicitly and optionally customize its
settings. We recommend that you select the policy whose name matches the intrusion
policy that you use for most traffic that goes through the device, whether you use
the intrusion policy directly, or you use it as the base policy in your custom
intrusion policies. You can then change the inspection mode, or adjust specific
inspector or binder settings to account for the traffic on your network.

In addition, consider whether you have enabled preprocessor rules in the intrusion
policy. If you enable rules that require a preprocessor, ensure that you also enable
the corresponding inspector in the NAP. For each inspector, you can also adjust the
attributes for the inspector, including the ports examined (the binders), to
customize inspector behavior for your network.

| **Note** | ---   If you are using Snort 2, the system uses the same-named NAP policy as the most restrictive intrusion policy you apply in any access control rule, and you cannot edit inspector or binder settings.   --- |
| --- | --- |

## License Requirements for Intrusion Policies

You must enable the **Threat** license to apply intrusion policies in access control rules. For information on configuring licenses, see [Enabling or Disabling Optional Licenses](fptd-fdm-license.html#id_12247).

No extra license is needed for network analysis policies.

## Applying Intrusion Policies in Access Control Rules

To apply intrusion
policies to network traffic, you select the policy within an access control
rule that allows traffic. You do not directly assign intrusion policies.

You can assign
different intrusion policies to provide variable intrusion protection based on
the relative risks of the networks you are protecting. For example, you might
use the more stringent Security over Connectivity policy for traffic between
your inside network and external networks. On the other hand, you might apply
the more lenient Connectivity over Security policy for traffic between inside
networks.

You can also
simplify your configuration by using the same policy for all networks. For
example, the Balanced Security and Connectivity policy is design to provide
good protection without excessively impacting connectivity.

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Select Policies > Access Control. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Either create a new rule, or edit an existing rule, that allows traffic.  If the default action is allow, you can also specify an intrusion policy in the default action.  You cannot apply intrusion policies to rules that trust or block traffic. |
| **Step 3** | Click the Intrusion Policy tab. |
| **Step 4** | Select Intrusion Policy > On and select the intrusion inspection policy to use on matching traffic. |

## Switching Between Snort 2 and Snort 3

Snort is the main inspection engine for the product. Although you can switch Snort
versions freely, some intrusion rules in Snort 2.0 might not exist in Snort 3.0, and
vice versa. If you changed the rule action for one of these rules, that change is
not preserved if you switch to Snort 3 and then back to Snort 2, or back again to
Snort 3. Your changes to rule actions for rules that exist in both versions are
preserved. Note that the mapping between rules in Snort 3 vs. Snort 2 can be
one-to-one or one-to-many, so preservation of changes is done on a best effort
basis.

If you change the Snort version, the system will perform an automatic deployment to implement the change. You can see the
progress in the Task list. The tasks are Snort Version Change and Automatic Deployment—Snort version toggle. Because of the
deployment and the fact that Snort must be stopped and restarted, all existing connections, including VPN, are dropped and
must be reestablished, which will cause a momentary traffic loss.

| **Note** | ---   If you try to switch Snort versions and the switch fails, you will have pending changes that you cannot discard, and a subsequent toggle attempt will not be allowed. If this happens, you must complete the switch using the ToggleInspectionEngine API, which you can use from the API Explorer. You must set the bypassPendingChangeValidation attribute to TRUE.   --- |
| --- | --- |

### Before you begin

To determine which Snort version is currently enabled, use this procedure, or choose Policies > Intrusion. Look for the Snort Version line above the
table. The current version is the first number in the complete version number. For
example, 2.9.17-95 is a Snort 2 version.

If the device is in an air-gapped network, consider manually uploading the latest
rules package for the new version before switching.

If you downgrade to 2.0, any custom intrusion policies that you created are converted
to the base policy used in the custom policy. As far as possible, rule action
overrides are retained. If more than one custom policy uses the same base policy,
the overrides of the custom policy that is used in the most access control policies
are retained, and the overrides for the other custom policies are lost. Access
control rules that used these "duplicate" policies will now use the base policy
created from your most-used custom policy. All custom policies are deleted. If you
want to preserve the custom policies so that you can import them later, after
switching back to Snort 3, use the threat
defense API to export the configuration.

In addition, a downgrade to 2.0 removes any NAP
customizations, and the system switches to use the most appropriate NAP based on the
intrusion policies used in access control rules.

Hostname redirect in active authentication also
requires Snort 3, and will be removed if you switch to Snort 2.

You must deploy any pending changes before you can switch Snort versions.

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Choose Device, then click View Configuration in the Updates summary.  Look at the Intrusion Rule group. The current Snort version is indicated. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | In the Intrusion Rule group, you can change the Snort version by clicking Upgrade to Snort 3.0 or Downgrade to Snort 2.0. |
| **Step 3** | When prompted to confirm your action, select the option to get the latest intrusion rules package, then click Yes.  We recommend that you get the latest rules package. The system downloads packages for the active Snort version only, so it is unlikely that you have the latest package installed for the Snort version you are switching to.  You must wait until the task to switch versions completes before you can edit intrusion policies. |

## Configuring Syslog for Intrusion Events

You can configure an external syslog server for intrusion policies to
send intrusion events to your syslog server. You must configure the syslog
server on the intrusion policy to get intrusion events sent to the server.
Configuring a syslog server on an access rule sends connection events only to
the syslog server, not intrusion events.

If you select multiple syslog servers, events are
sent to each of the servers.

Intrusion events have the message ID 430001.

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Select Policies > Intrusion. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click the Intrusion Policy Settings button (Gear/Settings button.) to configure syslog. |
| **Step 3** | Click the + button under Send Intrusion Events To and select the server objects that define the syslog servers. If the required objects do not already exist, click Create New Syslog Server and create them. |
| **Step 4** | Click OK. |

---

## Configuring the Network Analysis Policy (Snort 3)

The Network Analysis Policy (NAP) is applied to all allowed connections on the
device. The NAP determines which inspectors are enabled, and the values of the
attributes used by the inspectors. The binders determine the ports and protocols
that should be associated with the various inspectors.

Coordinate the NAP with the intrusion policies you apply in access control rules:

* If you use a single intrusion policy in your access control rules, select the
  same-named NAP. Then, make adjustments to inspectors and attributes based on
  the settings in your intrusion policy. For example, if you enable intrusion
  rules for a particular inspector, such as CIP, ensure that you enable that
  inspector in the NAP.
* If you use multiple intrusion policies, select the NAP that matches the most
  strict intrusion policy that you use.
* If you use custom intrusion policies, make your NAP selection based on the
  base intrusion policy for your custom intrusion policies.
* If you do not need to customize any inspectors or binders, consider
  configuring the system to automatically select the most appropriate NAP
  based on your intrusion policy usage. This is the default option.

### Before you begin

Unless you prevent it, the system regularly downloads LSP updates to the inspection
rules. These updates can add or remove inspectors and attributes, and change default
settings for attributes. If you have made overrides to removed inspectors, these
overrides are preserved and you will see warnings that the inspector is no longer
supported. In this case, delete the inspector and make any other flagged adjustments
to ensure your NAP is completely valid.

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Choose Policies > Intrusion.  Verify that the Snort version shown above the table is 3.x. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click the Intrusion Policy Settings button (Gear/Settings button.). |
| **Step 3** | In Default Network Analysis Policy, select one of the following:   * Auto—Automatically select the NAP that matches   the most-used intrusion policy (or base policy for custom rules)   applied in access control rules. If you do not apply any intrusion   policies, the Balanced Security and Connectivity NAP is used. The   NAP is run in Prevention mode, and you cannot customize intrusion or   binder settings. The remainder of this procedure does not apply when   running in automatic mode. * Custom—Explicitly select the NAP that should   be used. Click the Edit link next to the   policy name to select a different policy. You can then select the   inspection mode, and customize inspector and binder settings, as   described in the following steps. |
| **Step 4** | In the Edit Network Analysis Policy dialog box, select the policy and configure its settings.   1. In Network Analysis Policy, select the policy    that should apply globally to all allowed connections. 2. Select the Inspection Mode.  The inspection mode determines how non-compliant traffic is handled.    Use the same inspection mode as you use in your intrusion policies    for optimal results.     * Prevention—Block any decoder,      normalization, or protocol anomalies based on the settings      in the policy. You must use this option if you enable the      SSL Decryption policy, or if you enable the TLS      Server Identity Discovery option in the      access control policy settings.    * Detection—Simply issue alerts for      decoder, normalization, or protocol anomalies. Do not block      any traffic. 3. (Optional.) Configure and manage overrides to the inspectors and    binders:     * To edit overrides, see [Configuring Inspector and Binder Overrides](#Cisco_Task_in_List_GUI.dita_e6960060-5b51-419d-ac09-fb55545850b3).    * To download the schema or overrides, see [Downloading Overrides and the Schema](#Cisco_Task_in_List_GUI.dita_6d5ef939-3834-4b06-acdf-dff2d647758c).    * To upload overrides, see [Uploading Overrides](#Cisco_Task_in_List_GUI.dita_e447172f-a47e-4032-8776-549b10eb8c6a).    * To reset all the overrides, click the Reset      Inspector/Binder Overrides link above the      NAP file. You are asked to confirm the reset. The deletion      is limited to inspectors or binders, as indicated in the      command name. For example, deleting all binder overrides      leaves your inspector overrides unchanged.    * To reverse all changes to the selected inspector, click      Reset Inspector to      Defaults.    * To filter the view so you see only those inspectors that have      overrides, click Show Only Overrides.      Click Show All Inspectors to remove      the filter. 4. Click OK. |

### Configuring Inspector and Binder Overrides

When you select a base NAP, you are selecting inspector settings contained in that
baseline policy. In most cases, these are the appropriate settings.

However, you can override the settings in the selected NAP. For example, you can
enable or disable individual inspectors, or change the value for an attribute or a
binder.

The following procedure explains how to configure overrides directly. Alternatively,
you can download the schema, make changes offline, then upload your overrides. You
can also upload the overrides you downloaded from another device.

#### Before you begin

Explaining each inspector, binder, and attribute is beyond the scope of this
document. For detailed information, including examples, see Snort 3 Inspector
Reference at <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/secure-firewall/snort3-inspectors/snort-3-inspector-reference.html>.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Choose Policies > Intrusion, click the  Intrusion Policy Settings button (Gear/Settings button. ), select Custom for the NAP settings, then click the Edit link next to the policy name. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click the tab that contains the setting you want to change:   * Inspectors—The inspectors examine specific   types of traffic, such as FTP, for protocol anomalies. * Binders—The Binder inspector determines when a   service inspector needs to be used to inspect traffic. The   configurations in the binder inspector include the ports, hosts,   CIDRs, and services that define when another inspector in the   network analysis policy needs to inspect traffic. |
| **Step 3** | Edit the settings as needed.   * Use the following to control the view in the JSON editor:    + Use the Filter edit box to do a     full-text search of the JSON file.   + Click the Expand All Fields button     (Expand all fields) to open all of the folders in the JSON file.   + Click the Collapse All Fields (Collapse all fields) button to close all folders in the JSON file.   + Click the Undo Last Action (Undo last action) button to reverse your most recent change.   + Click the Redo (Redo) button to redo your last reversed change.   + Select Tree to see a formatted view of     the JSON file, which includes action menus, error flags, and     other features to guide your edits.   + Select Code to see the raw JSON file. * In Tree view, click the Menu (JSON menu) button to manipulate the contents of the file. You can:    + Insert attributes. Use Auto to have     the editor determine the appropriate data type. Otherwise,     add an Array, Object, or String. If you add an invalid     attribute, the system will mark the inspector or binder as     having a problem that you must resolve.   + Append attributes. This action does     the same as Insert, but puts the attribute at the end of the     section.   + Duplicate the selected attribute.   + Remove (delete) the selected     attribute. When editing an attribute, a popup message might     also provide a Delete command. * To enable an inspector that is currently disabled, or change the   setting of any Boolean attribute, click the checkbox in front of the   attribute value. For example, to enable an inspector, change the   enabled : false attribute to:    Enabled set to true. * To change the value of a string or numeric attribute, click in the   attribute and edit the value as needed. If your entry violates the   rules for the field, error messages explain the discrepancy. For   example, a numeric value indicates the valid range of values if you   enter a value outside the range. * To reset overrides:    + Click Reset Inspector/Binder Overrides     to remove all of your changes to all inspectors or binders     and return to default values. The deletion is limited to     inspectors or binders, as indicated in the command name. For     example, deleting all binder overrides leaves your inspector     overrides unchanged.   + Click Reset Inspector to     Defaults to reverse all changes to the     selected inspector only. * To filter the view so you see only those inspectors that have   overrides, click Show Only Overrides. Click   Show All Inspectors to remove the filter. * If an inspector is no longer supported, the inspector is flagged with   a message. Click the Delete Inspector link in   the message to remove the inspector. |
| **Step 4** | Click OK when finished. |

---

### Downloading Overrides and the Schema

You can download the NAP schema, or download the overrides you have configured for
the policy.

Downloading overrides is recommended whenever you change the base NAP, in case you
want to go back to your previous settings. In addition, you could use the JSON
editor on one device to implement the overrides you want to use on all devices,
download the overrides, then upload that override file to other devices.

Downloading the schema is useful if you want to edit the file offline, then upload
your overrides to this device or to multiple devices. You should copy/paste just the
sections you need to change, rather than upload the entire file, to ensure only
those changes you make are considered overrides.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Choose Policies > Intrusion, click the  Intrusion Policy Settings button (Gear/Settings button. ), select Custom for the NAP settings, then click the Edit link next to the policy name. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Do one of the following:   * To download the schema for the currently-select NAP, click the gear   icon (Gear/Settings button.) and select Download > Policy Schema. * To download the saved set of overrides, as they existed prior to the   current editing session, click the gear icon (Gear/Settings button.) and select Download > Last Saved Overrides. The file includes overridden attributes plus their   containing objects. * To download the overrides you have created in the current editing   session, click the gear icon (Gear/Settings button.) and select Download > Current Unsaved Overrides. The file includes overridden attributes plus their   containing objects. |

---

### Uploading Overrides

Rather than editing attributes using the embedded JSON editor, you can download the
NAP policy schema, edit the file offline, then upload the file. Any overrides
configured in the uploaded file are then applied to the selected NAP.

You can also upload a file you downloaded after configuring overrides on another
device.

By uploading your overrides, you can upload the same file to multiple devices and
easily apply the same overrides.

#### Before you begin

For overriding an inspector configuration in the network analysis policy, you should
upload only the changes that you require. You should not upload the entire
configuration because it makes the overrides sticky in nature and therefore, any
subsequent changes to the default values or configuration as part of the LSP updates
would not be applied. Ensure that your uploaded overrides are tightly focused on
just those attributes you want to change.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Choose Policies > Intrusion, click the  Intrusion Policy Settings button (Gear/Settings button. ), select Custom for the NAP settings, then click the Edit link next to the policy name. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click the gear icon (Gear/Settings button.) and select Upload > Overrides. |
| **Step 3** | (Optional.) Click one of the Download links to save a copy of your existing overrides.  You can either download the last saved overrides (those made before the current editing session) or the current unsaved overrides (those made during the current editing session). |
| **Step 4** | Click Yes on the Confirm Upload Overrides dialog box to confirm you want to continue. |
| **Step 5** | Click Browse, or drag and drop, to select the JSON file that contains your overrides, and click OK. |

## Managing Intrusion Policies (Snort 3)

When you use Snort 3 as the inspection engine, you can create your own intrusion
policies and customize them for your purposes. The system comes with pre-defined
policies that are based on the same-named Cisco Talos Intelligence Group
(Talos)-defined policies. Although you can edit these policies, a better practice is to
create your own policy based on the underlying Talos policy and change that if you need to adjust rule actions.

Each of these pre-defined policies includes the same list of intrusion rules (also
known as signatures), but they differ in the actions taken for each rule. For
example, a rule might be enabled in one policy, but disabled in another policy.

If you find that a particular rule is giving you too many false positives, where the
rule is blocking traffic that you do not want blocked, you can disable the rule
without needing to switch to a less-secure intrusion policy. You could alternatively
change it to alert on matches without dropping traffic.

Conversely, if you know you need to protect against a specific attack, but the
related rule is disabled in your chosen intrusion policy, you can enable the rule
without changing to a more secure policy.

Use the intrusion related dashboards, and the Event Viewer (both on the
Monitoring page), to evaluate how intrusion rules are
impacting traffic. Keep in mind that you will see intrusion events and intrusion
data only for traffic that matches intrusion rules set to alert or drop; disabled
rules are not evaluated.

| **Note** | ---   If you switch to Snort 2, you cannot create custom policies, and the use of intrusion policies differs slightly. Instead of this topic, see [Managing Intrusion Policies (Snort 2)](#concept_C0EB1AB846C945C38FE3940BBC8803F7).   --- |
| --- | --- |

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Choose Policies > Intrusion.  Verify that the Snort version shown above the table is 3.x. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Do any of the following:   * Use the Search/Filter box to find a policy.   You can search by name only. * Click the gear icon (Gear/Settings button.) to enable logging to a syslog server. See [Configuring Syslog for Intrusion Events](#task_3C0D47785EF24FCB88E6E671705E10E8). * Click the gear icon (Gear/Settings button.) to configure the network analysis policy (NAP). See [Configuring the Network Analysis Policy (Snort 3)](#Cisco_Task_in_List_GUI.dita_49189b70-682c-4336-9620-fe104df820f6). * Click + to create a new policy. See [Configuring a Custom Intrusion Policy (Snort 3)](#Cisco_Task_in_List_GUI.dita_577e0181-dbc9-492b-90b8-a4b59bd381f0). * Click the edit icon (edit icon) to see the properties and rules in the policy, and to edit them.   See [Viewing or Editing Intrusion Policy Properties (Snort 3)](#Cisco_Task_in_List_GUI.dita_6faed926-3676-491a-9639-25912f85d7b3). * Click the delete icon (delete icon) to delete a policy. |

### Configuring a Custom Intrusion Policy (Snort 3)

You can create new intrusion policies to customize rule behavior if the pre-defined
policies do not fit your needs. In general, it is good practice to create custom
policies based on the pre-defined policies rather than to alter those policies. This
ensures you can easily implement one of the Cisco Talos defined policies if you find
that your customizations do not deliver the results that you need.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Choose Policies > Intrusion. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Do one of the following:   * To create a new policy, click +. * To edit an existing policy, click the edit icon (edit icon) for the policy. When you are shown the policy details, click the   Edit link in the policy properties   section at the top of the page. |
| **Step 3** | Enter a Name, and optionally, a description for the policy. |
| **Step 4** | Configure the Inspection Mode for the policy.   * Prevention—Intrusion rule actions are always   applied. Connections that match a drop rule are blocked. * Detection—Intrusion rules generate alerts   only. A connection that matches a drop rule will generate alert   messages, but the connection will not be blocked. |
| **Step 5** | Select the Base Template for the policy.  The base templates are provided by Cisco Talos. Click the info icon for each to see more information about the policies. Note that policy names can change, and new policies appear, when a new rules package gets installed.   * Maximum Detection (Cisco Talos)—This policy   places all emphasis on security. Network connectivity and throughput   is not guaranteed and false positives are likely. This policy should   only be used for high security areas and security monitors must be   prepared to investigate alerts to determine their validity. * Security Over Connectivity (Cisco Talos)—This   policy places an emphasis on security, at the possible expense of   network connectivity and throughput. Traffic is inspected more   deeply, more rules are evaluated, and both false positives and   increased latency are expected but within reason. * Balanced Security and Connectivity (Cisco   Talos)—(Default.) This policy attempts to strike the   delicate balance between network connectivity and throughput and the   needs of security. While not as strict as Security Over   Connectivity, this policy attempts to keep users secure while being   less obtrusive about normal traffic. * Connectivity Over Security (Cisco Talos)—This   policy places an emphasis on network connectivity and throughput, at   the possible expense of security. Traffic is inspected less deeply,   and fewer rules are evaluated. * No Rules Active (Cisco Talos)—This policy is a   basic policy that configures typical preprocessor settings but does   not have any rules or built-in alerts enabled. Use this policy as a   base if you want to ensure that only those policies you want to   apply are enabled. |
| **Step 6** | Click OK.  You are returned to the intrusion policy list. You can now view the new policy and adjust rule actions as needed. |

### Viewing or Editing Intrusion Policy Properties (Snort 3)

The Intrusion Policy page shows a list of the policies, including both pre-defined
and user-defined policies, and their descriptions. To edit a policy, you must first
view the policy's properties.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Choose Policies > Intrusion. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click the edit icon (edit icon) for a policy.  The policy contains the following sections:   * Policy Name drop-down list.    + You can easily switch to a different policy by selecting it     from the drop-down list, or return to the list of policies     by clicking the back button (Go Back to Virtual Routers arrow.).   + You can delete this policy by clicking the delete icon next     to the policy name (delete icon). * General properties. This section shows the   intrusion mode, base policy, and description. Click   Edit to change these properties or the   policy name. * Rule Group table of contents. This list   displays all the rule groups that have active rules in the policy.   The groups have a hierarchy, with parent groups containing child   groups that organize subsets of rules within the larger parent   group. Each group is a logical collection of rules, and a given rule   can appear in more than one group.    + To add a group that currently has no active rules in the     policy, click + > Add Existing Rule Group and select the group. See [Adding or Removing Rule Groups in an Intrusion Policy (Snort 3)](#Cisco_Task_in_List_GUI.dita_2d4f4706-b442-4ed1-8d9f-73abb005f21a).   + To change the security level of a group, select the child     group in the list. The rule list changes to show the     security level at the top, with the rules in the group     listed below. Click the Edit link     next to the security level and select a new level. Click     View Description when editing to     get information about each security level. Note that     changing the level can change which rules are active, and     also the action for a given rule, with more secure levels     tending to have more active rules and more rules with the     Drop action. Click OK to confirm the     change. (Security Level     does not apply to custom rule groups.)      Changing the security level for an existing rule group.   + To remove all the rules in a group, select the child group in     the list. Then, click the Exclude     link to the far right of the group name and confirm that you     want to exclude the group. Excluding the group simply     disables all the rules in the group. It does not delete the     group.  However, if the group includes rules that are shared with     other groups that are enabled, the shared rules retain     whatever actions are applied by the still-active group. In     all cases, we retain your most aggressive setting for an     individual rule, regardless of group membership.   + To add a new custom rule group of custom rules, click + > Upload Custom Rules. For details, see [Uploading Custom Intrusion Rules](#Cisco_Task_in_List_GUI.dita_878807ca-3cd2-4efd-ab6e-50a8a2959864).   + To change the name or description of a custom rule group,     click Edit.   + To delete a custom rule group, click     Delete. For more information, see     [Managing Custom Intrusion Rules and Rule Groups](#Cisco_Task_in_List_GUI.dita_1704f9a7-4642-48db-a5db-1938d5494c4b).   + To add a new custom rule in a custom rule group, click     + above the rule table. See [Configuring Individual Custom Intrusion Rules](#Cisco_Task_in_List_GUI.dita_75af97a5-8671-4f83-9924-e48860433a3e).   + To edit, duplicate, delete, or manage group membership for a     custom rule, mouse over the right of the rule and click the     appropriate button or command. For more information, see     [Configuring Individual Custom Intrusion Rules](#Cisco_Task_in_List_GUI.dita_75af97a5-8671-4f83-9924-e48860433a3e). * List of rules. You can use the search field to   help you find rules using full-text search. You can also select   filtering items to search on any combination of GID or SID, show only user defined rules   (those you added),    show only those rules whose actions are overridden, or   simply show rules based on their actions (disabled, alert, drop).   The rules are lazy-loaded, so it will take quite a bit of time to   scroll through the entire unfiltered list. When filtering the list,   click the refresh button to reload the filtered view.    + To change the action for a rule, click the     Action cell for the rule and     select the new action, to Alert only,     to Block matching traffic, or to     Disable the rule. The default     action for each rule is indicated.   + To change the action for more than one rule at a time, click     the check box in the left column of the rules you want to     change, then select the new action from the     Action drop-down list above the     rules table. Click the check box in the GID:SID header to     select all the rules in the list. You can change up to 5000     rules at a time.   + To update the rules within a custom rule group, click     Upload Rule File. For more     information, see [Uploading Custom Intrusion Rules](#Cisco_Task_in_List_GUI.dita_878807ca-3cd2-4efd-ab6e-50a8a2959864).   + To get more information about a rule, click the link in the     GID:SID cell. The link takes you     to Snort.org.   + To change the rules listed, you can click a child group from     the rule group table of contents (not a parent group). You     can return to the all-rules list by clicking ALL     RULES at the top of the rule group list.   + To change the sorting order, click the table header for a     column. The default sorting for the rules is overridden     rules first, then drop rules, then alert rules.   + To see what changes where made in an intrusion rule (LSP)     update, select LSP Update in the     filter field, then select the updates whose changes you want     to see, and specify whether you want to see all changes, or     just additions or changes to the rules. |

### Adding or Removing Rule Groups in an Intrusion Policy (Snort 3)

Intrusion rules are organized in local groups. There is a hierarchy to the groups,
with parent groups containing related child groups. The rules themselves appear in
child groups only: parent groups are simply an organizational construct. A given
rule can appear in more than one group.

Any custom rule groups you create are in the User
Defined Groups folder. Custom rule groups do not have a hierarchy.

The easiest way to add or remove rules in an intrusion policy is to add or remove
groups. Because the rules in a group are logically related, it is highly likely that
you will want to use most if not all rules within a given group.

The following procedure explains how to add groups and change the group’s security
level.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Choose Policies > Intrusion. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click the edit icon (edit icon) for the policy you want to change. |
| **Step 3** | (Adding groups.) If the group is not shown in the list of rule groups, click + > Add Existing Rule Group and do the following:   1. Find the child group.     * A check mark next to a parent group name indicates that all      child groups in the parent group are already selected.    * A minus mark next to a parent group name indicates that one      or more child group has no enabled rules for this policy.      These are the groups you can add.    * A check mark next to a child group name indicates the group      is already selected. 2. Select the group you want to add (that is, check its check box). 3. (Optional, does not apply to custom    rule groups.) Each group has a default security level depending    on the base policy used for the custom policy. If you want to change it,    click the security level icon, select a new level, and click    OK.  Level 1 is the least secure posture, emphasizing connectivity over    security, whereas level 4 is the most aggressive, providing maximum    security. You can click View Description to    see an explanation of each level as you select it.     Changing security level while adding a rule group. 4. Continue selecting (or deselecting) groups until you have made all of    your changes. 5. Click OK. |
| **Step 4** | (Removing groups.) If you want to disable all the rules within a group, you can use any of the following methods:   * Select the group, then click the Exclude link   to the far right of the group name, above the list of rules. * Use the method for adding a group, but instead, deselect the unwanted   group (that is, uncheck its check box), and click   OK. * You can delete a custom rule group to remove it entirely from the   system and from all intrusion policies that use it. Select the   group, then click Delete. |

### Changing Intrusion Rule Actions (Snort 3)

Each intrusion policy has the same rules. The difference is the action taken for each
rule can be different from policy to policy.

By changing the rule action, you can disable rules that are giving you too many false
positives, or you can change whether the rule alerts on or drops matching traffic.
You can also enable disabled rules to alert or drop matching traffic.

The easiest method to change rule actions is to change the security level of a rule
group. When you change a group's security level, the action of the rules within the
group change. This can mean that some rules become enabled (or disabled), or the
action can change between alert and drop, based on the security posture you select.
However, you can change an individual rule action if that is what you need.

| **Note** | ---   The default action for a given rule is based on the overall selection of group and severity. Changing the severity of the group, or excluding the group, can change the default action for the rule.   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Before you begin

Custom rule groups do not have security levels. You cannot use the security level
technique to change rule actions for custom rules.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Choose Policies > Intrusion. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click the view icon (View configuration button.) for the policy whose rule actions you want to change. |
| **Step 3** | (Recommended method.) Change the security level for a rule group.   1. Click the child rule group in the rule group list. 2. Above the list of rules, click Edit next to the    security level for the group.     Changing the security level for an existing rule group.        | **Note** | If you want to disable all the rules in the group, do not click Edit. Instead, click Exclude and confirm that you want to exclude the group. The group is not deleted, its rules are simply disabled. Skip the remaining steps. |    | --- | --- | 3. Select the new level for the group. Click View    Description to see an explanation of each level as you    pick it.  Level 1 is the least secure posture, emphasizing connectivity over    security, whereas level 4 is the most aggressive, providing maximum    security. 4. Click OK. |
| **Step 4** | (Manual method.) Change the action for one or more rule.   1. Find the rule whose action you want to change.  Use the Search/Filter box to search on strings    within the rule information. You can also select filtering items to    search on any combination of GID or SID, or simply show rules based    on their actions (disabled, alert, drop). The rules are lazy-loaded,    so it will take quite a bit of time to scroll through the entire    unfiltered list. When filtering the list, click the refresh button    to reload the filtered view.  Ideally, you can get the Snort identifier (SID) and generator    identifier (GID) from an event or from Cisco Technical Support, if    you are working with them on an issue. You can then search precisely    for the rule. 2. To change the action, do one of the following:     * Change one rule at a time—Click the      Action column for the rule and      select the required action:       + Alert—Create an event when        this rule matches traffic, but do not drop the        connection.      + Drop—Create an event when this        rule matches traffic, and also drop the connection.      + Disabled—Do not match traffic        against this rule. No events are generated.    * Change multiple rules at one time—Click the check boxes for      the rules you want to change, then click the      Bulk drop-down above the table      and pick the desired action. Click the check box in the      GID:SID header to select all the rules in the list. You can      change up to 5000 rules at a time. |

### Managing Custom Intrusion Rules and Rule Groups

The system comes with thousands of intrusion rules defined by Cisco Talos Intelligence Group
(Talos). If you know of additional attacks, you can create and upload custom intrusion
rules to screen for those attacks, and either alert or drop them. You can also
create, edit, and delete rules one at a time.

For uploaded rules, you create the rules offline using a text editor. We recommend
that you include a group of custom rules in each text file you upload. You can then
easily upload changes to your rules, and either merge new rules into your custom
rule groups, or replace your rules with new, edited copies.

Explaining how to create these rules is outside the scope of this document. For
detailed information on how to write intrusion rules for Snort, including how to
convert Snort 2 rules to Snort 3 format, see the guides on <https://snort.org/documents>. For
example, Rules Authors Introduction to Writing Snort 3 Rules at <https://snort.org/documents/rules-writers-guide-to-snort-3-rules>.

#### Before you begin

You create custom rule groups during the process of uploading custom rules, as
described in [Uploading Custom Intrusion Rules](#Cisco_Task_in_List_GUI.dita_878807ca-3cd2-4efd-ab6e-50a8a2959864), or when creating individual rules or
managing rule membership. After you create the group, you can manage the group and
its contents.

Note that custom groups are available for all intrusion policies, not just the policy
you were editing when you created the group. Thus, changes you make to a group are
made for all policies. For example, if you delete a custom rule group, it is deleted
from all policies and is no longer available for any of them.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Choose Policies > Intrusion. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click the edit icon (edit icon) for a policy.  We recommend that you add custom rules to a custom intrusion policy rather than one of the built-in policies. |
| **Step 3** | Do any of the following:   * To create a group, click + > Upload Custom Rules. See [Uploading Custom Intrusion Rules](#Cisco_Task_in_List_GUI.dita_878807ca-3cd2-4efd-ab6e-50a8a2959864). * To edit a group’s name or description, select the group in the group   table of contents in the User Defined Groups folder. You can then   click Edit and make your changes. * To exclude the group and its rules from the policy, select the group   in the group table of contents in the User Defined Groups folder.   You can then click Exclude to remove the   group. * To delete the group from the system and all policies that use it,   select the group in the group table of contents in the User Defined   Groups folder. Then click Delete. Note that   if a rule exists only in the deleted group, it is also deleted from   the system. However, if a rule also exists in other custom rule   groups that you are not deleting, the rule will remain in those   groups. * To replace or update the rules in a group in bulk, select the group   in the group table of contents in the User Defined Groups folder.   Then, click Upload Rule File next to the   Action drop-down list above the group’s rule table. The process is   the same as that described in [Uploading Custom Intrusion Rules](#Cisco_Task_in_List_GUI.dita_878807ca-3cd2-4efd-ab6e-50a8a2959864). * To create and manage individual rules, and their assignment to rule   groups, see [Configuring Individual Custom Intrusion Rules](#Cisco_Task_in_List_GUI.dita_75af97a5-8671-4f83-9924-e48860433a3e). |

#### Uploading Custom Intrusion Rules

If you know of attacks that are not currently covered by other rules, you can create
and upload custom intrusion rules to screen for those attacks, and either alert or
drop them. The action of the imported rules must be either alert or drop, and the
default action for the rule is defined by the action in the imported file. Once
imported, you can change a rule action and disable a rule if necessary.

You must create these rules offline. In the device
manager, you are simply uploading a rules file, you are not configuring the rules directly. The rules file should be a text file.
You can use line returns to format the rules to be readable, or put a rule on a single line, and empty lines are allowed.
Rule format is explained at snort.org.

For example, an upload file of three rules could look like the following:

```

alert tcp $HOME_NET any -> $EXTERNAL_NET $HTTP_PORTS (
   msg: "My Custom Rule: EXPLOIT-KIT Styx exploit kit landing page request";
   flow:to_server,established;
   http_raw_uri;
   bufferlen:>100;
   http_uri;
   content:"/i.html?",depth 8; pcre:"/\/i\.html\?[a-z0-9]+\=[a-zA-Z0-9]{25}/";
   flowbits:set,styx_landing;
   metadata: copied from talos sid 29452;
   service:http;
   classtype:trojan-activity;
   gid:1;
   sid:1000000;
   rev:1;
)

alert tcp $HOME_NET 8811 -> $EXTERNAL_NET any (
   msg:"My Custom rule: MALWARE-BACKDOOR fear1.5/aciddrop1.0 runtime detection - initial connection";
   flow:to_client,established;
   flowbits:isset,Fear15_conn.2;
   content:"Drive",nocase;
   metadata:copied from talos sid 7710;
   classtype:trojan-activity;
   gid:1;
   sid:1000001;
   rev:1;
)

alert tcp $EXTERNAL_NET $FILE_DATA_PORTS -> $HOME_NET any (
   msg:"My Custom Rule: INDICATOR-COMPROMISE download of a Office document with embedded PowerShell";
   flow:to_client,established;
   flowbits:isset,file.doc;
   file_data;
   content:"powershell.exe",fast_pattern,nocase;
   metadata:copied from talos sid 37244;
   classtype:trojan-activity;
   gid:1;
   sid:1000002;
   rev:1;
)
```

##### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Choose Policies > Intrusion. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click the edit icon (edit icon) for a policy.  We recommend that you add custom rules to a custom intrusion policy rather than one of the built-in policies. |
| **Step 3** | Do one of the following:   * Above the list of groups, click + > Upload Custom Rules. * If you are uploading rules into a custom rule group that you already   created, you can select the custom rule group, then click   Upload Rule File next to the   Action drop-down list above the group’s   rule table. |
| **Step 4** | Click Browse and select your custom rule file, or drag and drop the file into the Upload File dialog box.  Wait for the upload to complete. |
| **Step 5** | Select how you want to handle conflicts:  A conflict occurs when a rule you are adding is the same as one already in the system. This should happen only if you are uploading the same rules or edited versions of rules that you previously uploaded.  Select one of these options:   | **Note** | Merge and Replace are basically the same thing. Uploaded rules must have higher revision numbers than the ones you already uploaded for any changes to be made to the existing rules. The only difference is that if the upload file is missing rules that are in the targeted custom rule group, the Replace option will delete those rules from the rule group. The Merge option will leave those "missing" rules in place. | | --- | --- |  * Merge—Any changed rules in the uploaded file   that also exist in the selected group will have those changes   merged, if the rule in the uploaded file has a higher revision   number. Any unchanged rules, or rules in the group that do not have   corresponding rules in the upload, will be left unchanged. Any new   rules in the upload will be added. This is the default option. * Replace—The rules in the uploaded file will   replace the rules in the selected group, if the revision number on   the uploaded rule is higher. Any existing rules not in the uploaded   file will be deleted from the group. Existing rules whose uploaded   version has a revision number that is the same or lower will be left   unchanged. Any new rules in the upload will be added. |
| **Step 6** | Click + and select the custom rule group for the uploaded rules.  If the custom rule group you want to use does not yet exist, click Create New Group and create it now. The new group needs a name and optionally, a description. Then, you can select the new group.  If you are replacing rules, you can select a single group only. If you are merging them, you can select multiple groups. |
| **Step 7** | Click OK.  The files are uploaded and placed in the new group. You should see a summary of how many rules were uploaded, and how many rules were updated, deleted, or ignored.  If there are errors in the file, the upload will fail. You can click the Download Error File link to get more information on the errors.  The group is automatically activated in this intrusion policy. The group and new rules are available to be added to other policies, but the group and rules are not automatically enabled in any other policy. For information on adding groups to other policies, see [Adding or Removing Rule Groups in an Intrusion Policy (Snort 3)](#Cisco_Task_in_List_GUI.dita_2d4f4706-b442-4ed1-8d9f-73abb005f21a). |

#### Configuring Individual Custom Intrusion Rules

You can configure custom intrusion rules one at a time rather than in bulk through
file uploads. This method works well when you need to make a quick adjustment to a
rule, or you need to create or modify just a few rules at a time.

When configuring intrusion rules, keep the following in mind:

* The GID for all custom rules should be 1.
* The SID for a rule must be unique across all rules in the system. It also
  must be one million (1000000) or higher.
* If you edit a rule, you must change the rule version. Normally, you increment
  the version number by 1.
* You can duplicate a Cisco Talos Intelligence Group
  (Talos) rule to create your own version of the rule, but you still must change
  the SID of the duplicate to make it unique.

The system will do some validity checking to ensure the rule is well formed, and you
will see error messages about any problems. However, the system cannot determine
whether the rule is sensible.

For detailed information on how to write intrusion rules for Snort, including how to
convert Snort 2 rules to Snort 3 format, see the guides on <https://snort.org/documents>. For
example, Rules Authors Introduction to Writing Snort 3 Rules at <https://snort.org/documents/rules-writers-guide-to-snort-3-rules>.

##### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Choose Policies > Intrusion. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click the edit icon (edit icon) for a policy.  We recommend that you add custom rules to a custom intrusion policy rather than one of the built-in policies. |
| **Step 3** | Do one of the following:   * To add an intrusion rule, click the Add New Intrusion   Rule button (+) above the   rule table. When adding a rule, you must select one or more custom   rule groups to contain the new rule. You can create new groups while   adding the rule if necessary. * To add a rule by duplicating and editing an existing rule, mouse over   the right end of the rule and click the Duplicate (Copy connection summary to clipboard button.) button. The button appears only on mouse-over. For custom rules,   the Duplicate command is under the more   options (...) button. * To edit a custom rule, find the rule in a custom rule group and click   the edit (edit icon) button for the rule. Your edits apply across all groups in which   the rule resides. Make sure you increment the rule version number by   at least 1 when making changes. * To delete a custom rule, click the delete (delete icon) button for the rule. The rule is deleted from all rule groups   that contain it. If you just want to remove a rule from a group, use   the Manage Group Assignments option instead   of deleting the rule. * To change which groups contain the rule, click the more options   (...) button and select Manage   Group Assignments. You can then add or remove   groups. Your changes simply affect group membership, it does not   change the rule or delete it. |
| **Step 4** | For new rules and groups, add the rule to the policy.  When you create a new group when creating a new rule, or editing an existing rule, that group is not added to your policy automatically, nor is the rule enabled automatically. You are prompted to add the group to the policy you are editing. If you do not add the group while adding or editing the rule, you can add the group later using the following process:   1. Click + > Add Existing Rule Group above the group table of contents. 2. Find the group under the User Defined Groups folder, select it, and    click OK. 3. Select the group in the table of contents and verify that the new rule    is in the group and has the desired action. |

---

## Managing Intrusion Policies (Snort 2)

You can apply any of the pre-defined intrusion policies. Each of these policies includes the same
list of intrusion rules (also known as signatures), but they differ in the actions taken
for each rule. For example, a rule might be active in one policy, but disabled in
another policy.

If you find that a
particular rule is giving you too many false positives, where the rule is
blocking traffic that you do not want blocked, you can disable the rule without
needing to switch to a less-secure intrusion policy. You could alternatively
change it to alert on matches without dropping traffic.

Conversely, if you know you need to protect against a specific attack, but the related rule is disabled in your chosen intrusion
policy, you can enable the rule without changing to a more secure policy.

Use the intrusion
related dashboards, and the Event Viewer (both on the
Monitoring page), to evaluate how intrusion rules
are impacting traffic. Keep in mind that you will see intrusion events and
intrusion data only for traffic that matches intrusion rules set to alert or
drop; disabled rules are not evaluated.

The following topics
explain intrusion policies and rule tuning in more detail.

* [Configure the Inspection Mode for an Intrusion Policy (Snort 2)](#id_121662)
* [Changing Intrusion Rule Actions (Snort 2)](#task_4D5DD40DDCE0426C8846E5684287E63B)

### Configure the Inspection Mode for an Intrusion Policy (Snort 2)

By default, all intrusion policies operate in Prevention mode to implement an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS). In the Prevention
inspection mode, if a connection matches an intrusion rule whose action is to drop traffic, the connection is actively blocked.

If you instead want to test the effect of the intrusion policy on your network, you can change the mode to Detection, which
implements an Intrusion Detection System (IDS). In this inspection mode, drop rules are treat like alert rules, where you
are notified of matching connections, but the action result becomes Would Have Blocked, and connections are never in fact
blocked.

You change the inspection mode per intrusion policy, so you can have a mix of prevention and detection.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Select Policies > Intrusion. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click the tab for the intrusion policy whose inspection mode you want to change.  The Inspection Mode is indicated above the rules table. |
| **Step 3** | Click the Edit link next to the inspection mode, change the mode for the policy, and click OK.  The options are:   * Prevention—Intrusion rule actions are always applied. Connections that match a drop rule are blocked. * Detection—Intrusion rules generate alerts only. A connection that matches a drop rule will generate alert messages, but the connection   will not be blocked. |

---

### Changing Intrusion Rule Actions (Snort 2)

Each pre-defined
intrusion policy has the same rules. The difference is the action taken for
each rule can be different from policy to policy.

By changing the rule action, you can disable rules that are giving you too many false positives, or you can change whether
the rule alerts on or drops matching traffic. You can also enable disabled rules to alert or drop matching traffic.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Select Policies > Intrusion. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click the tab for the intrusion policy whose rule actions you want to change.  The pre-defined policies are:   * Connectivity   over Security * Balanced   Security and Connectivity * Security   over Connectivity * Maximum   Detection |
| **Step 3** | Find the rule whose action you want to change.  The rules are sorted with the overridden ones listed first, and sorted by action within the group of overridden rules. Otherwise, the rules are sorted by GID, then SID.  Use the search box to locate the rule you want to change. Ideally, you can get the Snort identifier (SID) and generator identifier (GID) from an event or from Cisco Technical Support, if you are working with them on an issue.  For detailed information about the elements of each rule, see [Intrusion Rule Attributes](#concept_C4C21B1BDF794F468738C9F836C6C87B).  To search the list:   1. Click in the    Search box to open the search attributes dialog box. 2. Enter a    combination of Generator ID (GID), Snort ID (SID), or rule    Action, and click    Search.  For example,    you could select    Action = Drop to see all the rules in the policy    that will drop matching connections. The text beside the search box indicates    how many rules match your criteria, for example, “8937 of 9416 rules found.”  To clear a    search criteria, click the x for the criteria in the search box. |
| **Step 4** | Click the Action column for the rule and select the required action:   * Alert—Create an   event when this rule matches traffic, but do not drop the connection. * Drop—Create an   event when this rule matches traffic, and also drop the connection. * Disabled—Do not   match traffic against this rule. No events are generated.   The default action for the rule is indicated by “(Default)” added to the action. If you change the default, the status column indicates “Overridden” for that rule. |

## Monitoring Intrusion Policies

You can find intrusion
policy statistics on the
Attackers and
Targets dashboards on the
Monitoring page. You must apply an intrusion policy
to at least one access control rule to see any information on these dashboards.
See
[Monitoring Traffic and System Dashboards](fptd-fdm-monitor.html#id_10212).

To see intrusion
events, select
Monitoring > Events, then click the
Intrusion tab. You can hover over an event and
click the
View Details link to get more information. From
the details page, you can click the
View IPS Rule to go to the rule in the relevant
intrusion policy, where you can change the rule action. This can help you
reduce the impact of false positives, where a rule is blocking too many good
connections, by changing the action from drop to alert. Conversely, you can
change an alert rule into a drop rule if you are seeing a lot of attack traffic
for a rule.

If you configure a syslog server for the intrusion policy, intrusion events have the message ID 430001.

# Planning Your Upgrade

Before upgrading the Secure Firewall ASA, you should perform the following preparation:

* Check the upgrade path for the current version to the target version; ensure you plan for any intermediate versions required
  for each operating system.
* Check for guidelines and limitations that affect your intermediate and target versions, or that affect failover and clustering
  zero downtime upgrading.
* Download all software packages required from Cisco.com.
* Back up your configurations, especially if there is a configuration migration.

The following topics explain how to upgrade your ASA.

* [ASA Upgrade Checklist](#id_59005)
* [Compatibility](#id_59003)
* [Upgrade Path](#id_58680)
* [Download the Software from Cisco.com](#id_58682)
* [Back Up Your Configurations](#id_58690)

## Important Guidelines Before You Upgrade

Check for upgrade guidelines and limitations, and configuration migrations for each operating system.

* [ASA Upgrade Guidelines](#id_47465)
* [FXOS Upgrade Guidelines](#concept_svt_h1k_ddb)

### ASA Upgrade Guidelines

Before you upgrade, check for migrations and any other guidelines.

* [Version-Specific Guidelines and Migrations](#id_28407)
* [Clustering Guidelines](#id_47469)
* [Failover Guidelines](#id_47468)
* [Additional Guidelines](#id_30935)

#### Version-Specific Guidelines and Migrations

Depending on your current version, you might experience one or more configuration migrations, and have to consider configuration
guidelines for all versions between the starting version and the ending version when you upgrade.

* [8.3 Guidelines and Migration](#reference_xvt_541_cz)

##### 9.22 Guidelines

* **Smart licensing default transport changed in 9.22**—In 9.22, the smart licensing
  default transport changed from Smart Call Home to Smart Transport. You can
  configure the ASA to use Smart Call Home if necessary using the
  transport type callhome  command. When you
  upgrade to 9.22, the transport is automatically changed Smart Transport. If
  you downgrade, the transport is set back to Smart Call Home, and if you want
  to use Smart Transport, you need to specify transport type
  smart .

##### 9.20 Guidelines

* **OSPF redistribute commands that specify a route-map that matches a
  prefix-list will be removed in 9.20(2)**—When you upgrade to 9.20(2),
  OSPF **redistribute** commands where the specified **route-map** uses
  a **match ip address prefix-list** will be removed from the
  configuration. Although prefix lists have never been supported, the parser
  still accepted the command. Before upgrading, you should reconfigure OSPF to
  use route maps that specify an ACL in the **match ip address** command.

##### 9.19 Guidelines

* **ASDM 7.19(1) requires Oracle Java version 8u261 or later**—Before you
  upgrade to ASDM 7.19, be sure to update Oracle Java (if used) to version
  8u261 or later. This version supports TLSv1.3, which is required to upgrade
  the ASDM Launcher. OpenJRE is not affected.

##### 9.18 Guidelines

* **ASDM signed-image support in 9.18(2)/7.18(1.152) and later**—The ASA now validates
  whether the ASDM image is a Cisco digitally signed image. If you try to run
  an older ASDM image with an ASA version with this fix, ASDM will be blocked
  and the message “%ERROR: Signature not valid for file disk0:/<filename>”
  will be displayed at the ASA CLI. ASDM release 7.18(1.152) and later are
  backwards compatible with all ASA versions, even those without this fix.
  ([CSCwb05291](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwb05291), [CSCwb05264](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwb05264))
* **9.18(1) upgrade issue if you enabled HTTPS/ASDM (with HTTPS authentication) and SSL on
  the same interface with the same port**—If you enable both SSL
  (**webvpn** > **enable**
  *interface*) and HTTPS/ASDM (http ) access on
  the same interface, you can access AnyConnect from
  **https://***ip\_address* and ASDM from
  **https://***ip\_address***/admin**, both on port 443.
  However, if you also enable HTTPS authentication (**aaa authentication http
  console**), then you must specify a different port for ASDM access
  starting in 9.18(1). Make sure you change the port before you upgrade using
  the http  command. ([CSCvz92016](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvz92016))
* **ASDM Upgrade Wizard**—Due to ASD API migration, you must use ASDM 7.18 or later to
  upgrade to ASA 9.18 or later. Because ASDM is backwards compatible with
  earlier ASA versions, you can upgrade ASDM to 7.18 or later for any ASA
  version.

##### 9.17 Guidelines

* **ASDM signed-image support in 9.17(1.13)/7.18(1.152) and later**—The ASA
  now validates whether the ASDM image is a Cisco digitally signed image. If
  you try to run an older ASDM image with an ASA version with this fix, ASDM
  will be blocked and the message “%ERROR: Signature not valid for file
  disk0:/<filename>” will be displayed at the ASA CLI. ASDM release
  7.18(1.152) and later are backwards compatible with all ASA versions, even
  those without this fix. ([CSCwb05291](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwb05291), [CSCwb05264](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwb05264))
* **No support for Clientless SSL VPN in 9.17(1) and later**—Clientless SSL VPN is no
  longer supported.

  + **webvpn**—The following subcommands are removed:

    - **apcf**
    - **java-trustpoint**
    - **onscreen-keyboard**
    - **port-forward**
    - **portal-access-rule**
    - **rewrite**
    - **smart-tunnel**
  + **group-policy webvpn**—The following subcommands are removed:

    - **port-forward**
    - **smart-tunnel**
    - **ssl-clientless**
* **ASDM Upgrade Wizard**—Due to an internal change, starting in March 2022 the upgrade
  wizard will no longer work with pre-ASDM 7.17(1.152) versions. You must
  manually upgrade to 7.17(1.152) to use the wizard.

##### 9.16 Guidelines

* **ASDM signed-image support in 9.16(3.19)/7.18(1.152) and later**—The ASA
  now validates whether the ASDM image is a Cisco digitally signed image. If
  you try to run an older ASDM image with an ASA version with this fix, ASDM
  will be blocked and the message “%ERROR: Signature not valid for file
  disk0:/<filename>” will be displayed at the ASA CLI. ASDM release
  7.18(1.152) and later are backwards compatible with all ASA versions, even
  those without this fix. ([CSCwb05291](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwb05291), [CSCwb05264](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwb05264))
* **SNMPv3 users using MD5 hashing and DES encryption are no longer supported, and the users
  will be removed when you upgrade to 9.16(1)**—Be sure to change any
  user configuration to higher security algorithms using the
  snmp-server user  command before you
  upgrade.
* **SSH host key action required in 9.16(1)**—In addition to RSA, we added
  support for the EDDSA and ECDSA host keys for SSH. The ASA tries to use keys
  in the following order if they exist: EDDSA, ECDSA, and then RSA. When you
  upgrade to 9.16(1), the ASA will fall back to using the existing RSA key.
  However, we recommend that you generate higher-security keys as soon as
  possible using the crypto key generate {eddsa |
  ecdsa}  command. Moreover, if you explicitly
  configure the ASA to use the RSA key with the ssh key-exchange
  hostkey rsa  command, you must generate a key that is
  2048 bits or higher. For upgrade compatibility, the ASA will use smaller RSA
  host keys only when the default host key setting is used. RSA support will
  be removed in a later release.
* **In 9.16 and later, certificates with RSA keys are not compatible with
  ECDSA ciphers**—When you use the ECDHE\_ECDSA cipher group, configure
  the trustpoint with a certificate that contains an ECDSA-capable key.
* ssh version
  **command removed in 9.16(1)**—This command has been removed. Only SSH
  version 2 is supported.
* **When you upgrade to 9.16 or later, you might see a different certificate
  serial number**—In 9.16, the ASA started using OpenSSL, which causes
  negative values in certificates to be computed differently, so you may see a
  different serial number after upgrading. This change does not affect
  operation. (CSCvv30338)
* **SAMLv1 feature removed in 9.16(1)**—Support for SAMLv1 was removed.
* **No support for DH groups 2, 5, and 24 in 9.16(1)**—Support has been
  removed for the DH groups 2, 5, and 24 in SSL DH group configuration. The
  ssl dh-group command has been updated to remove
  the command options group2, group5, and
  group24.

##### 9.15 Guidelines

* **No support in ASA 9.15(1) and later for the ASA 5525-X, ASA 5545-X, and
  ASA 5555-X**—ASA 9.14(x) is the last supported version. For the ASA
  FirePOWER module, the last supported version is 6.6.
* **Cisco announces the feature deprecation for Clientless SSL VPN effective with ASA version
  9.17(1)**—Limited support will continue on releases prior to
  9.17(1).
* **For the Firepower 1010, invalid VLAN IDs can cause problems**—Before you
  upgrade to 9.15(1), make sure you are not using a VLAN for switch ports in
  the range 3968 to 4047. These IDs are for internal use only, and 9.15(1)
  includes a check to make sure you are not using these IDs. For example, if
  these IDs are in use after upgrading a failover pair, the failover pair will
  go into a suspended state. See [CSCvw33057](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvw33057) for more information.
* **SAMLv1 feature deprecation**—Support for SAMLv1 is deprecated.
* **Low-Security Cipher Removal in ASA 9.15(1)**—Support for the following
  less secure ciphers used by IKE and IPsec have been removed:

  + Diffie-Hellman groups: 2 and 24
  + Encryption algorithms: DES, 3DES, AES-GMAC, AES-GMAC-192,
    AES-GMAC-256, NULL, ESP-3DES, ESP-DES, ESP-MD5-HMAC
  + Hash algorithms: MD5

  | **Note** | ---   Low-security SSH and SSL ciphers have not yet been removed.   --- |
  | --- | --- |

  Before you upgrade from an earlier version of ASA to Version 9.15(1), you
  must update your VPN configuration to use the ciphers supported in 9.15(1),
  or else the old configuration will be rejected. When the configuration is
  rejected, one of the following actions will occur, depending on the
  command:

  + The command will use the default cipher.
  + The command will be removed.

  Fixing your configuration before upgrading is especially important for
  clustering or failover deployments. For example, if the secondary unit is
  upgraded to 9.15(1), and the removed ciphers are synced to this unit from
  the primary, then the secondary unit will reject the configuration. This
  rejection might cause unexpected behavior, like failure to join the
  cluster.

  **IKEv1**: The following subcommands are removed:

  + **crypto ikev1 policy**
    *priority*:

    - **hash md5**
    - **encryption 3des**
    - **encryption des**
    - **group 2**

  **IKEv2**: The following subcommands are removed:

  + **crypto ikev2 policy**
    *priority*:

    - **prf md5**
    - **integrity md5**
    - **group 2**
    - **group 24**
    - **encryption 3des**
    - **encryption des**
    - **encryption null**

  **IPsec**: The following subcommands are removed:

  + **crypto ipsec ikev1 transform-set *name* esp-3des esp-des
    esp-md5-hmac**
  + **crypto ipsec ikev2 ipsec-proposal *name***

    - **protocol esp integrity md5**
    - **protocol esp encryption 3des aes-gmac aes-gmac- 192
      aes-gmac -256 des**
  + **crypto ipsec profile *name***

    - **set pfs group2 group24**

  **Crypto Map**: The following subcommands are removed:

  + **crypto map *name sequence* set pfs group2**
  + **crypto map *name sequence* set pfs group24**
  + **crypto map *name sequence* set ikev1 phase1-mode aggressive
    group2**
* **Re-introduction of CRL Distribution Point configuration**—The static CDP
  URL configuration option, that was removed in 9.13(1), was re-introduced in
  the  match-certificate  command.
* **Restoration of bypass certificate validity checks option**—The option to
  bypass revocation checking due to connectivity problems with the CRL or OCSP
  server was restored.

  The following subcommands were restored:

  + **revocation-check crl none**
  + **revocation-check ocsp none**
  + **revocation-check crl ocsp none**
  + **revocation-check ocsp crl none**

##### 9.14 Guidelines

* **ASDM signed-image support in 9.14(4.14)/7.18(1.152) and later**—The ASA
  now validates whether the ASDM image is a Cisco digitally signed image. If
  you try to run an older ASDM image with an ASA version with this fix, ASDM
  will be blocked and the message “%ERROR: Signature not valid for file
  disk0:/<filename>” will be displayed at the ASA CLI. ASDM release
  7.18(1.152) and later are backwards compatible with all ASA versions, even
  those without this fix. ([CSCwb05291](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwb05291), [CSCwb05264](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwb05264))
* **ASDM Cisco.com Upgrade Wizard failure on Firepower 1000 and 2100 in
  Appliance mode**—The ASDM Cisco.com Upgrade Wizard does not work for
  upgrading to 9.14 (Tools > Check for ASA/ASDM
  Updates). The wizard can upgrade ASDM from 7.13 to 7.14, but the
  ASA image upgrade is grayed out. ([CSCvt72183](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvt72183)) As a workaround, use one of the following
  methods:

  + Use Tools > Upgrade Software from Local
    Computer for both ASA and ASDM. Note that the ASDM
    image (7.14(1)) in the 9.14(1) bundle also has the bug [CSCvt72183](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvt72183); you should download the newer 7.14(1.46)
    image to enable correct functioning of the wizard.
  + Use Tools > Check for ASA/ASDM Updates to
    upgrade to ASDM 7.14 (the version will be 7.14(1.46); then use the
    new ASDM to upgrade the ASA image. Note that you may see a
    Fatal Installation Error; in this case,
    click OK. You must then set the boot image
    manually on the Configuration > Device Management  > System Image/Configuration > Boot Image/Configuration screen. Save the configuration and reload the
    ASA.
* **For Failover pairs in 9.14(1)+, the ASA no longer shares SNMP client
  engine data with its peer.**
* **No support in ASA 9.14(1)+ for cnatAddrBindNumberOfEntries and
  cnatAddrBindSessionCount OIDs ([CSCvy22526](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvy22526))**.
* **Upgrade issue for 9.14(4)24 and RADIUS challenges for AnyConnect mobile
  users**—To restore RADIUS functionality, upgrade to 9.18(4)22 or
  later.
* **Upgrading the Firepower 2100 in Platform mode**—When you upgrade to 9.14
  or later, if your EtherChannel (port-channel) was disabled at the time of
  upgrade, then you will need to manually enable both the EtherChannel and its
  member interfaces after upgrade.
* **Downgrade issue for the Firepower 2100 in Platform mode from 9.13/9.14 to
  9.12 or earlier**—For a Firepower 2100 with a fresh installation of
  9.13 or 9.14 that you converted to Platform mode: If you downgrade to 9.12
  or earlier, you will not be able to configure new interfaces or edit
  existing interfaces in FXOS (note that 9.12 and earlier only supports
  Platform mode). You either need to restore your version to 9.13 or later, or
  you need to clear your configuration using the FXOS erase configuration
  command. This problem does not occur if you originally upgraded to 9.13 or
  9.14 from an earlier release; only fresh installations are affected, such as
  a new device or a re-imaged device. ([CSCvr19755](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvr19755))
* **The tls-proxy  keyword, and support for
  SCCP/Skinny encrypted inspection, was removed** from the
  inspect skinny  command.
* **ASDM Upgrade Wizard**—Due to an internal change, the wizard is only
  supported using ASDM 7.10(1) and later; also, due to an image naming change,
  you must use ASDM 7.12(1) or later to upgrade to ASA 9.10(1) and later.
  Because ASDM is backwards compatible with earlier ASA releases, you can
  upgrade ASDM no matter which ASA version you are running. Note that ASDM
  7.13 and 7.14 did not support the ASA 5512-X, 5515-X, 5585-X, or ASASM; you
  must upgrade to ASDM 7.13(1.101) or 7.14(1.48) to restore ASDM support.

##### 9.13 Guidelines

* **ASAv requires 2GB memory in 9.13(1) and later**—Beginning with 9.13(1),
  the minimum memory requirement for the ASAv is 2GB. If your current ASAv
  runs with less than 2GB of memory, you cannot upgrade to 9.13(1) from an
  earlier version. You must adjust the memory size before upgrading. See the
  [ASAv Getting Started Guide](https://www.cisco.com/go/asa-quick) for information about
  the resource allocations (vCPU and memory) supported in version 9.13(1).
* **Downgrade issue for the Firepower 2100 in Platform mode from 9.13 to 9.12
  or earlier**—For a Firepower 2100 with a fresh installation of 9.13
  that you converted to Platform mode: If you downgrade to 9.12 or earlier,
  you will not be able to configure new interfaces or edit existing interfaces
  in FXOS (note that 9.12 and earlier only supports Platform mode). You either
  need to restore your version to 9.13, or you need to clear your
  configuration using the FXOS erase configuration command. This problem does
  not occur if you originally upgraded to 9.13 from an earlier release; only
  fresh installations are affected, such as a new device or a re-imaged
  device. (CSCvr19755)
* **Cluster control link MTU change in 9.13(1)**—Starting in 9.13(1), many
  cluster control packets are larger than they were in previous releases. The
  recommended MTU for the cluster control link has always been 1600 or
  greater, and this value is appropriate. However, if you set the MTU to 1600
  but then failed to match the MTU on connecting switches (for example, you
  left the MTU as 1500 on the switch), then you will start seeing the effects
  of this mismatch with dropped cluster control packets. Be sure to set all
  devices on the cluster control link to the same MTU, specifically 1600 or
  higher.
* **Beginning with 9.13(1), the ASA establishes an LDAP/SSL connection only if
  one of the following certification criteria is satisfied**:

  + The LDAP server certificate is trusted (exists in a trustpoint or the
    ASA trustpool) and is valid.
  + A CA certificate from servers issuing chain is trusted (exists in a
    trustpoint or the ASA trustpool) and all subordinate CA certificates
    in the chain are complete and valid.
* **Local CA server is removed in 9.13(1)**—When the ASA is configured as
  local CA server, it can issue digital certificates, publish Certificate
  Revocation Lists (CRLs), and securely revoke issued certificates. This
  feature has become obsolete and hence the crypto ca
  server  command is removed.
* **Removal of CRL Distribution Point commands**—The static CDP URL
  configuration commands, namely crypto-ca-trustpoint
  crl  and crl url  were removed
  with other related logic. The CDP URL was moved to match certificate
  command.

  | **Note** | ---   The CDP URL configuration was enhanced to allow multiple instances of the CDP override for a single map (refer [CSCvu05216](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvu05216)).   --- |
  | --- | --- |
* **Removal of bypass certificate validity checks option**—The option to
  bypass revocation checking due to connectivity problems with the CRL or OCSP
  server was removed.

  The following subcommands are removed:

  + **revocation-check crl none**
  + **revocation-check ocsp none**
  + **revocation-check crl ocsp none**
  + **revocation-check ocsp crl none**

  Thus, after an upgrade, any revocation-check command that is no longer
  supported will transition to the new behavior by ignoring the trailing
  none.

  | **Note** | ---   These commands were restored later (refer [CSCtb41710](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtb41710)).   --- |
  | --- | --- |
* **Low-Security Cipher Deprecation**— Several encryption ciphers used by
  the ASA IKE, IPsec, and SSH modules are considered insecure and have been
  deprecated. They will be removed in a later release.

  IKEv1: The following subcommands are deprecated:

  + **crypto ikev1 policy**
    *priority*:

    - **hash md5**
    - **encryption 3des**
    - **encryption des**
    - **group 2**
    - **group 5**

  IKEv2: The following subcommands are deprecated:

  + **crypto ikev2 policy**
    *priority*

    - **integrity md5**
    - **prf md5**
    - **group 2**
    - **group 5**
    - **group 24**
    - **encryption 3des**
    - **encryption des** (this command is still available when
      you have the DES encryption license only)
    - **encryption null**

  IPsec: The following commands are deprecated:

  + **crypto ipsec ikev1 transform-set *name* esp-3des esp-des
    esp-md5-hmac**
  + **crypto ipsec ikev2 ipsec-proposal *name***

    - **protocol esp integrity md5**
    - **protocol esp encryption 3des aes-gmac aes-gmac- 192
      aes-gmac -256 des**
  + **crypto ipsec profile *name***

    - **set pfs group2 group5 group24**

  SSH: The following commands are deprecated:

  + **ssh cipher integrity custom hmac-sha1-96:hmac-md5:
    hmac-md5-96**
  + **ssh key-exchange group dh-group1-sha1**

  SSL: The following commands are deprecated:

  + **ssl dh-group group2**
  + **ssl dh-group group5**
  + **ssl dh-group group24**

  Crypto Map: The following commands are deprecated:

  + **crypto map *name sequence* set pfs group2**
  + **crypto map *name sequence* set pfs group5**
  + **crypto map *name sequence* set pfs group24**
  + **crypto map *name sequence* set ikev1 phase1-mode aggressive
    group2**
  + **crypto map *name sequence* set ikev1 phase1-mode aggressive
    group5**
* **In 9.13(1), Diffie-Hellman Group 14 is now the default** for the
  group  command under crypto
  ikev1 policy , ssl dh-group ,
  and crypto ikev2 policy for IPsec PFS using
  crypto map set pfs , crypto
  ipsec profile , crypto dynamic-map set
  pfs , and crypto map set ikev1
  phase1-mode . The former default Diffie-Hellman group
  was Group 2.

  When you upgrade from a pre-9.13(1) release, if you need to use the old
  default (Diffie-Hellman Group 2), then you must *manually* configure
  the DH group as **group 2** or else your tunnels will default to Group
  14. Because group 2 will be removed in a future release, you should move
  your tunnels to group 14 as soon as
  possible.

##### 9.12 Guidelines

* **ASDM signed-image support in 9.12(4.50)/7.18(1.152) and later**—The ASA
  now validates whether the ASDM image is a Cisco digitally signed image. If
  you try to run an older ASDM image with an ASA version with this fix, ASDM
  will be blocked and the message “%ERROR: Signature not valid for file
  disk0:/<filename>” will be displayed at the ASA CLI. ASDM release
  7.18(1.152) and later are backwards compatible with all ASA versions, even
  those without this fix. ([CSCwb05291](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwb05291), [CSCwb05264](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwb05264))
* ASDM Upgrade Wizard—Due to an internal change, the wizard is only supported using ASDM 7.10(1) and later; also, due to an
  image naming change, you must use ASDM 7.12(1) or later to upgrade to ASA 9.10(1) and later. Because ASDM is backwards compatible
  with earlier ASA releases, you can upgrade ASDM no matter which ASA version you are running.
* SSH security improvements and new defaults in 9.12(1)—See the following SSH security improvements:

  + SSH version 1 is no longer supported; only version 2 is supported. The ssh version 1  command will be migrated to ssh version 2 .
  + Diffie-Hellman Group 14 SHA256 key exchange support. This setting is now the default (ssh key-exchange group dh-group14-sha256 ). The former default was Group 1 SHA1. Make sure that your SSH client supports Diffie-Hellman Group 14 SHA256. If it does
    not, you may see an error such as "Couldn't agree on a key exchange algorithm." For example, OpenSSH supports Diffie-Hellman
    Group 14 SHA256.
  + HMAC-SHA256 integrity cipher support. The default is now the high security set of ciphers (hmac-sha1 and hmac-sha2-256 as
    defined by the ssh cipher integrity high  command). The former default was the medium set.
* The NULL-SHA TLSv1 cipher is deprecated and removed in 9.12(1)—Because NULL-SHA doesn't offer encryption and is no longer
  considered secure against modern threats, it will be removed when listing supported ciphers for TLSv1 in the output of tls-proxy  mode commands/options and show ssl ciphers all . The ssl cipher tlsv1 all  and ssl cipher tlsv1 custom NULL-SHA  commands will also be deprecated and removed.
* The default trustpool is removed in 9.12(1)—In order to comply with PSB requirement, SEC-AUT-DEFROOT, the "default" trusted
  CA bundle is removed from the ASA image. As a result, crypto ca trustpool import default  and crypto ca trustpool import clean default  commands are also removed along with other related logic. However, in existing deployments, certificates that were previously
  imported using these command will remain in place.
* The ssl encryption  command is removed in 9.12(1)—In 9.3(2) the deprecation was announced and replaced by ssl cipher . In 9.12(1), ssl encryption  is removed and no longer supported.

##### 9.10 Guidelines

* Due to an internal change, the ASDM Upgrade wizard is only supported using ASDM 7.10(1) and later; also, due to an image naming
  change, you must use ASDM 7.12(1) or later to upgrade to ASA 9.10(1) and later. Because ASDM is backwards compatible with
  earlier ASA releases, you can upgrade ASDM no matter which ASA version you are running.

##### 9.9 Guidelines

* ASA 5506-X memory issues with large configurations on 9.9(2) and later—If you upgrade to 9.9(2) or later, parts of a very
  large configuration might be rejected due to insufficient memory with the following message: "ERROR: Insufficient memory to
  install the rules". One option is to enter the **object-group-search access-control** command to improve memory usage for ACLs; your performance might be impacted, however. Alternatively, you can downgrade to
  9.9(1).

##### 9.8 Guidelines

* **ASDM signed-image support in 9.8(4.45)/7.18(1.152) and later**—The ASA
  now validates whether the ASDM image is a Cisco digitally signed image. If
  you try to run an older ASDM image with an ASA version with this fix, ASDM
  will be blocked and the message “%ERROR: Signature not valid for file
  disk0:/<filename>” will be displayed at the ASA CLI. ASDM release
  7.18(1.152) and later are backwards compatible with all ASA versions, even
  those without this fix. ([CSCwb05291](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwb05291), [CSCwb05264](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwb05264))
* Before upgrading to 9.8(2) or later, FIPS mode requires the failover key to
  be at least 14 characters—Before you upgrade to to 9.8(2) or later in FIPS
  mode, you must change the failover key  or
  failover ipsec pre-shared-key  to be at
  least 14 characters long. If your failover key is too short, when you
  upgrade the first unit, the failover key will be rejected, and both units
  will become active until you set the failover key to a valid value.
* Do not upgrade to 9.8(1) for ASAv on Amazon Web Services--Due to [CSCve56153](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCve56153), you should not upgrade to 9.8(1). After upgrading, the ASAv becomes unreachable. Upgrade to 9.8(1.5) or later instead.

##### 9.7 Guidelines

* Upgrade issue with 9.7(1) to 9.7(1.x) and later for VTI and VXLAN VNI—If you configure both Virtual Tunnel Interfaces (VTIs)
  and VXLAN Virtual Network Identifier (VNI) interfaces, then you cannot perform a zero downtime upgrade for failover; connections
  on these interface types will not replicate to the standby unit until both units are on the same version. (CSCvc83062)

##### 9.6 Guidelines

* (ASA 9.6(2) through 9.7(x)) Upgrade impact when using SSH public key authentication—Due to updates to SSH authentication,
  additional configuration is required to enable SSH public key authentication; as a result, existing SSH configurations using
  public key authentication no longer work after upgrading. Public key authentication is the default for the ASAv on Amazon
  Web Services (AWS), so AWS users will see this issue. To avoid loss of SSH connectivity, you can update your configuration
  *before* you upgrade. Or you can use ASDM after you upgrade (if you enabled ASDM access) to fix the configuration.

  | **Note** | ---   The original behavior was restored in 9.8(1).   --- |
  | --- | --- |

  Sample original
  configuration for a username "admin":

  ```

  username admin nopassword privilege 15
  username admin attributes
    ssh authentication publickey 55:06:47:eb:13:75:fc:5c:a8:c1:2c:bb:
    07:80:3a:fc:d9:08:a9:1f:34:76:31:ed:ab:bd:3a:9e:03:14:1e:1b hashed

  ```

  To use the
  ssh
  authentication  command, before you upgrade, enter the following
  commands:

  ```

  aaa authentication ssh console LOCAL
  username admin password <password> privilege 15

  ```

  We recommend
  setting a password for the username as opposed to keeping the
  nopassword
  keyword, if present. The
  nopassword
  keyword means that
  *any*
  password can be entered, not that
  *no*
  password can be entered. Prior to 9.6(2), the
  aaa  command was
  not required for SSH public key authentication, so the
  nopassword
  keyword was not triggered. Now that the
  aaa  command is
  required, it automatically also allows regular password authentication for a
  username  if the
  password  (or
  nopassword )
  keyword is present.

  After you
  upgrade, the
  username
  command no longer requires the
  password  or
  nopassword
  keyword; you can require that a user cannot enter a password. Therefore, to
  force public key authentication only, re-enter the
  username
  command:

  ```

  username admin privilege 15

  ```
* Upgrade impact when upgrading the ASA on the Firepower 9300— Due to license entitlement naming changes on the back-end, when
  you upgrade to ASA 9.6(1)/FXOS 1.1(4), the startup configuration may not parse correctly upon the initial reload; configuration
  that corresponds to add-on entitlements is rejected.

  For a standalone ASA, after the unit reloads with the new version,
  wait until all the entitlements are processed and are in an "Authorized" state
  (**show license all** or
  **Monitoring > Properties > Smart License**), and simply
  reload again (**reload** or
  **Tools > System Reload**)
  *without* saving the configuration. After the reload, the
  startup configuration will be parsed correctly.

  For a failover pair if you have any add-on entitlements, follow
  the upgrade procedure in the FXOS release notes, but reset failover after you
  reload each unit (failover reset  or
  **Monitoring > Properties > Failover > Status**,
  **Monitoring > Failover > System**, or
  **Monitoring > Failover > Failover Group**, and then
  click
  Reset Failover).

  For a cluster, follow the upgrade procedure in the FXOS release
  notes; no additional action is required.

##### 9.5 Guidelines and Migration

* 9.5(2) New Carrier License—The new Carrier license replaces the existing GTP/GPRS license, and also includes support for SCTP
  and Diameter inspection. For the Firepower 9300 ASA security module, the feature mobile-sp  command will automatically migrate to the feature carrier  command.
* 9.5(2) E-mail proxy commands deprecated—In ASA Version 9.5(2), the e-mail proxy commands (imap4s , pop3s , smtps ) and subcommands are no longer supported.
* 9.5(2) CSD commands deprecated or migrated—In ASA Version 9.5(2), the CSD commands (csd image , show webvpn csd image , show webvpn csd , show webvpn csd hostscan , show webvpn csd hostscan image ) are no longer supported.

  The following CSD commands will migrate: csd enable  migrates to hostscan enable ; csd hostscan image  migrates to hostscan image .
* 9.5(2) Select AAA commands deprecated—In ASA Version 9.5(2), these AAA commands and subcommands (override-account-disable , authentication crack ) are no longer supported.
* 9.5(1) We deprecated the following command: timeout gsn
* ASA 5508-X and 5516-X upgrade issue when upgrading to 9.5(x) or later—Before you upgrade to ASA Version 9.5(x) or later, if
  you never enabled jumbo frame reservation then you must check the maximum memory footprint. Due to a manufacturing defect,
  an incorrect software memory limit might have been applied. If you upgrade to 9.5(x) or later before performing the below
  fix, then your device will crash on bootup; in this case, you must downgrade to 9.4 using ROMMON ([Load an Image for the ASA 5500-X Series Using ROMMON](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/asa95/configuration/general/asa-95-general-config/admin-swconfig.html#ID-2152-000008e5)), perform the below procedure, and then upgrade again.

  1. Enter the following command to check for the failure condition:

     ```

     ciscoasa# show memory detail | include Max memory footprint
     Max memory footprint        =    456384512
     Max memory footprint        =            0
     Max memory footprint        =    456384512

     ```

     If a value less than **456,384,512** is returned for “Max memory footprint,” then the failure condition is present, and you must complete the remaining steps
     before you upgrade. If the memory shown is 456,384,512 or greater, then you can skip the rest of this procedure and upgrade
     as normal.
  2. Enter global configuration mode:

     ```

     ciscoasa# configure terminal
     ciscoasa(config)#

     ```
  3. Temporarily enable jumbo frame reservation:

     ```

     ciscoasa(config)# jumbo-frame reservation
     WARNING: This command will take effect after the running-config
     is saved and the system has been rebooted. Command accepted.
     INFO: Interface MTU should be increased to avoid fragmenting
     jumbo frames during transmit

     ```

     | **Note** | ---   Do not reload the ASA.   --- |
     | --- | --- |
  4. Save the configuration:

     ```

     ciscoasa(config)# write memory
     Building configuration...
     Cryptochecksum: b511ec95 6c90cadb aaf6b306 41579572
     14437 bytes copied in 1.320 secs (14437 bytes/sec)
     [OK]

     ```
  5. Disable jumbo frame reservation:

     ```

     ciscoasa(config)# no jumbo-frame reservation
     WARNING: This command will take effect after the running-config is saved and
     the system has been rebooted. Command accepted.
     ```

     | **Note** | ---   Do not reload the ASA.   --- |
     | --- | --- |
  6. Save the configuration again:

     ```

     ciscoasa(config)# write memory
     Building configuration...
     Cryptochecksum: b511ec95 6c90cadb aaf6b306 41579572
     14437 bytes copied in 1.320 secs (14437 bytes/sec)
     [OK]

     ```
  7. You can now upgrade to Version 9.5(x) or later.

##### 9.4 Guidelines and Migration

* 9.4(1) Unified
  Communications Phone Proxy and Intercompany Media Engine Proxy are
  deprecated—In ASA Version 9.4, the Phone Proxy and IME Proxy are no longer
  supported.

##### 9.3 Guidelines and Migration

* 9.3(2) Transport Layer Security (TLS) version 1.2 support—We now support TLS version 1.2 for secure message transmission for
  ASDM, Clientless SSVPN, and AnyConnect VPN. We introduced or modified the following commands: ssl client-version, ssl server-version,
  ssl cipher, ssl trust-point, ssl dh-group. We deprecated the following command: ssl encryption
* 9.3(1) Removal of AAA Windows NT domain authentication—We removed NTLM support for remote access VPN users. We deprecated
  the following command: aaa-server protocol nt

##### 9.2 Guidelines and Migration

###### Auto Update Server certificate verification

9.2(1) Auto Update Server certificate verification enabled by default. The Auto Update Server certificate verification is
now enabled by default; for new configurations, you must explicitly disable certificate verification. If you are upgrading
from an earlier release, and you did not enable certificate verification, then certificate verification is not enabled, and
you see the following warning:

`WARNING: The certificate provided by the auto-update servers will not be verified. In order to verify this certificate please
use the verify-certificate option.`

The configuration will be migrated to explicitly configure no verification:

auto-update server no-verification

###### Upgrade impact for ASDM login

Upgrade impact for ASDM login when upgrading from a pre-9.2(2.4) release to 9.2(2.4) or later. If you upgrade from a pre-9.2(2.4)
release to ASA Version 9.2(2.4) or later and you use command authorization and ASDM-defined user roles, users with Read Only
access will not be able to log in to ASDM. You must change the more  command either before or after you upgrade to be at privilege level 5; only Admin level users can make this change. Note
that ASDM version 7.3(2) and later includes the more  command at level 5 for defined user roles, but preexisting configurations need to be fixed manually.

**ASDM:**

1. Choose Configuration > Device Management > Users/AAA > AAA Access > Authorization, and click Configure Command Privileges.
2. Select more, and click Edit.

3. Change the Privilege Level to 5, and click OK.
4. Click OK, and then Apply.

**CLI:**

`ciscoasa(config)# privilege cmd level 5 mode exec command more`

##### 9.1 Guidelines and Migration

* Maximum MTU Is Now 9198 Bytes—If your MTU was set to a value higher than 9198, then the MTU is automatically lowered when
  you upgrade. In some cases, this MTU change can cause an MTU mismatch; be sure to set any connecting equipment to use the
  new MTU value. The maximum MTU that the ASA can use is 9198 bytes (check for your model’s exact limit at the CLI help). This
  value does not include the Layer 2 header. Formerly, the ASA let you specify the maximum MTU as 65535 bytes, which was inaccurate
  and could cause problems.

##### 9.0 Guidelines and Migration

* **IPv6 ACL Migration**—IPv6 ACLs (ipv6 access-list ) will be migrated to extended ACLs (access-list extended ); IPv6 ACLs are no longer supported.

  If IPv4 and IPv6 ACLs are applied on the same direction of an interface (access-group  command), then the ACLs are merged:

  + If both IPv4 and IPv6 ACLs are not used anywhere other than the access-group, then the name of the IPv4 ACL is used for the
    merged ACL; the IPv6 access-list is removed.
  + If at least one of the ACLs is used in another feature, then a new ACL is created with the name *IPv4-ACL-name\_IPv6-ACL-name*; the in-use ACL(s) continue to be used for other features. ACLs not in use are removed. If the IPv6 ACL is in use for another
    feature, it is migrated to an extended ACL of the same name.
* **ACL Any Keyword Migration**—Now that ACLs support both IPv4 and IPv6, the any  keyword now represents “all IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.” Any existing ACLs that use the any  keyword will be changed to use the any4  keyword, which denotes “all IPv4 traffic.”

  In addition, a separate keyword was introduced to designate “all IPv6 traffic”: any6 .

  The any4  and any6  keywords are not available for all commands that use the any  keyword. For example, the NAT feature uses only the any  keyword; any represents IPv4 traffic or IPv6 traffic depending on the context within the specific NAT command.
* **Static NAT-with-port-translation Requirement Before Upgrading**—In Version 9.0 and later, static NAT-with-port-translation rules limit access to the destination IP address for the specified
  port only. If you try to access the destination IP address on a different port not covered by a NAT rule, then the connection
  is blocked. This behavior is also true for Twice NAT. Moreover, traffic that does not match the source IP address of the Twice
  NAT rule will be dropped if it matches the destination IP address, regardless of the destination port. Therefore, before you
  upgrade, you must add additional rules for all other traffic allowed to the destination IP address.

  For example, you have the following Object NAT rule to translate HTTP traffic to the inside server between port 80 and port
  8080:

  ```

  object network my-http-server
    host 10.10.10.1
    nat (inside,outside) static 192.168.1.1 80 8080

  ```

  If you want any other services to reach the server, such as FTP, then you must explicitly allow them:

  ```

  object network my-ftp-server
    host 10.10.10.1
    nat (inside,outside) static 192.168.1.1 ftp ftp

  ```

  Or, to allow traffic to other ports of the server, you can add a general static NAT rule that will match all other ports:

  ```

  object network my-server-1
    host 10.10.10.1
    nat (inside,outside) static 192.168.1.1

  ```

  For Twice NAT, you have the following rule to allow HTTP traffic from 192.168.1.0/24 to the inside server and translate between
  port 80 and port 8080:

  ```

  object network my-real-server
    host 10.10.10.1
  object network my-mapped-server
    host 192.168.1.1
  object network outside-real-hosts
    subnet 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0
  object network outside-mapped-hosts
    subnet 10.10.11.0 255.255.255.0
  object service http-real
    service tcp destination eq 80
  object service http-mapped
    service tcp destination eq 8080
  object service ftp-real
    service tcp destination eq 21
  nat (outside,inside) source static outside-real-hosts outside-mapped-hosts destination static my-mapped-server my-real-server service http-mapped http-real

  ```

  If you want the outside hosts to reach another service on the inside server, add another NAT rule for the service, for example
  FTP:

  ```

  nat (outside,inside) source static outside-real-hosts outside-mapped-hosts destination static my-mapped-server my-real-server ftp-real ftp-real

  ```

  If you want other source addresses to reach the inside server on any other ports, you can add another NAT rule for that specific
  IP address or for any source IP address. Make sure the general rule is ordered after the specific rule.

  ```

  nat (outside,inside) source static any any destination static my-mapped-server my-real-server

  ```

##### 8.4 Guidelines and Migration

* Configuration Migration for Transparent Mode—In 8.4, all transparent mode interfaces now belong to a bridge group. When you
  upgrade to 8.4, the existing two interfaces are placed in bridge group 1, and the management IP address is assigned to the
  Bridge Group Virtual Interface (BVI). The functionality remains the same when using one bridge group. You can now take advantage
  of the bridge group feature to configure up to four interfaces per bridge group and to create up to eight bridge groups in
  single mode or per context.

  | **Note** | ---   Note In 8.3 and earlier, as an unsupported configuration, you could configure a management interface without an IP address, and you could access the interface using the device management address. In 8.4, the device management address is assigned to the BVI, and the management interface is no longer accessible using that IP address; the management interface requires its own IP address.   --- |
  | --- | --- |
* When upgrading to 8.4(2) from 8.3(1), 8.3(2), and 8.4(1), all identity NAT configurations will now include the no-proxy-arp  and route-lookup  keywords, to maintain existing functionality. The unidirectional  keyword is removed.

##### 8.3 Guidelines and Migration

See the following guide that describes the configuration migration process when you upgrade from a pre-8.3 version of the
Cisco ASA 5500 operating system (OS) to Version 8.3:

[Cisco ASA 5500 Migration to Version 8.3](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/asa83/upgrading/migrating.html)

#### Clustering Guidelines

There are no special requirements for Zero Downtime Upgrades for ASA clustering with the following exceptions.

| **Note** | ---   Zero Downtime *Downgrades* are not officially supported with clustering.   --- |
| --- | --- |

* Firepower 4100/9300 Failover and
  Clustering hitless upgrade requirements for flow offload—Due to bug fixes in the flow
  offload feature, some combinations of FXOS and ASA do not support flow offload (see the
  [compatibility
  table](#id_59069)). Flow offload is disabled by default for ASA. To
  perform a Failover or Clustering hitless upgrade when using flow offload, you need to
  follow the below upgrade paths to ensure that you are always running a compatible
  combination when upgrading to FXOS 2.3.1.130 or later:

  1. Upgrade ASA to 9.8(3) or later
  2. Upgrade FXOS to 2.3.1.130 or later
  3. Upgrade ASA to your final version

  For example, you are on FXOS 2.2.2.26/ASA 9.8(1), and you want to upgrade to FXOS 2.6.1/ASA 9.12(1), then you can:

  1. Upgrade ASA to 9.8(4)
  2. Upgrade FXOS to 2.6.1
  3. Upgrade ASA to 9.12(1)
* Firepower 4100/9300 Cluster Upgrade
  to FXOS 2.3/ASA 9.9(2)—Data units on ASA 9.8 and
  earlier cannot rejoin a cluster where the control
  unit is on FXOS 2.3/9.9(2) or later; they will
  join after you upgrade the ASA version to 9.9(2)+
  [[CSCvi54844](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvi54844)].
* Distributed Site-to-Site VPN—Distributed Site-to-Site VPN sessions on a failed unit require up to 30 minutes to stabilize
  on other units. During this time, additional unit failures might result in lost sessions. Therefore, during a cluster upgrade,
  to avoid traffic loss, follow these steps. Refer to the FXOS/ASA cluster upgrade procedure so you can integrate these steps
  into your upgrade task.

  | **Note** | ---   Zero Downtime Upgrade is not supported with Distributed Site-to-Site VPN when upgrading from 9.9(1) to 9.9(2) or later. In 9.9(2), due to Active Session Redistribution enhancements, you cannot run some units on 9.9(2) and other units on 9.9(1).   --- |
  | --- | --- |

  1. On the
     chassis *without* the control unit, disable
     clustering on one module using the ASA
     console.

     cluster group
     name

     no enable

     If you are upgrading FXOS on the chassis as well as ASA, save the configuration so clustering will be disabled after the chassis
     reboots:

     write memory
  2. Wait for the cluster to stabilize; verify all backup sessions have been created.

     show cluster vpn-sessiondb summary
  3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for each module on this chassis.
  4. Upgrade FXOS on the chassis using the FXOS CLI or Firepower Chassis Manager.
  5. After the chassis comes online, update the ASA image on each module using the FXOS CLI or Firepower Chassis Manager.
  6. After the modules come online, re-enable clustering on each module at the ASA console.

     cluster group
     name

     enable

     write memory
  7. Repeat steps
     1 through 6 on the second chassis, being sure to
     disable clustering on the data units first, and
     then finally the control unit.

     A new control
     unit will be chosen from the upgraded chassis.
  8. After the
     cluster has stabilized, redistribute active
     sessions among all modules in the cluster using
     the ASA console on the control unit.

     cluster redistribute vpn-sessiondb
* Upgrade issue for 9.9(1) and later with clustering—9.9(1) and later includes an improvement in the backup distribution. You
  should perform your upgrade to 9.9(1) or later as follows to take advantage of the new backup distribution method; otherwise
  upgraded units will continue to use the old method.

  1. Remove all secondary units from the cluster (so the cluster consists only of the primary unit).
  2. Upgrade 1 secondary unit, and rejoin the cluster.
  3. Disable clustering on the primary unit; upgrade it, and rejoin the cluster.
  4. Upgrade the remaining secondary units, and join them back to the cluster, one at a time.
* Firepower 4100/9300 Cluster Upgrade
  to ASA 9.8(1) and earlier—When you disable
  clustering on a data unit (no
  enable ), which is part of the
  upgrade process, traffic directed to that unit can
  drop for up to three seconds before traffic is
  redirected to a new owner [[CSCvc85008](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvc85008)].
* Zero Downtime Upgrade may not be supported when upgrading to the following releases with the fix for [CSCvb24585](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvb24585). This fix moved 3DES from the default (medium) SSL ciphers to the low cipher set. If you set a custom cipher that only includes
  3DES, then you may have a mismatch if the other side of the connection uses the default (medium) ciphers that no longer include
  3DES.

  + 9.1(7.12)
  + 9.2(4.18)
  + 9.4(3.12)
  + 9.4(4)
  + 9.5(3.2)
  + 9.6(2.4)
  + 9.6(3)
  + 9.7(1)
  + 9.8(1)
* Upgrade issues for fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) ACLs—Due to [CSCuv92371](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuv92371), ACLs containing FQDNs might result in incomplete ACL replication to secondary units in a cluster or failover pair. This
  bug is present in 9.1(7), 9.5(2), 9.6(1), and some interim releases. We suggest that you upgrade to a version that includes
  the fix for CSCuy34265: 9.1(7.6) or later, 9.5(3) or later, 9.6(2) or later. However, due to the nature of configuration replication,
  zero downtime upgrade is not available. See [CSCuy34265](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuy34265) for more information about different methods of upgrading.
* Firepower Threat Defense Version 6.1.0 clusters do not support inter-site clustering (you can configure inter-site features
  using FlexConfig starting in 6.2.0). If you deployed or re-deployed a 6.1.0 cluster in FXOS 2.1.1, and you entered a value
  for the (unsupported) site ID, then you must remove the site ID (set it to **0**) on each unit in FXOS before you upgrade to 6.2.3. Otherwise, the units will not be able to rejoin the cluster after the
  upgrade. If you already upgraded, change the site ID to **0** on each unit to resolve the issue. See the FXOS configuration guide to view or change the site ID
* Upgrade to 9.5(2) or later
  (CSCuv82933)—Before you upgrade the control unit,
  if you enter show cluster
  info , the upgraded data units show
  as “DEPUTY\_BULK\_SYNC”; other mismatched states are
  also shown. You can ignore this display; the
  status will show correctly when you upgrade all
  units.
* Upgrade from 9.0(1) or 9.1(1) (CSCue72961)—Zero Downtime Upgrade is not supported.

#### Failover Guidelines

There are no special requirements for Zero Downtime Upgrades for failover with the following exceptions:

* For the Firepower 1010, invalid VLAN IDs can cause problems—Before you upgrade to
  9.15(1), make sure you are not using a VLAN for switch ports in the range 3968 to 4047.
  These IDs are for internal use only, and 9.15(1) includes a check to make sure you are
  not using these IDs. For example, if these IDs are in use after upgrading a failover
  pair, the failover pair will go into a suspended state. See [CSCvw33057](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvw33057) for more information.
* Firepower 4100/9300 Failover and
  Clustering hitless upgrade requirements for flow offload—Due to bug fixes in the flow
  offload feature, some combinations of FXOS and ASA do not support flow offload (see the
  [compatibility
  table](#id_59069)). Flow offload is disabled by default for ASA. To
  perform a Failover or Clustering hitless upgrade when using flow offload, you need to
  follow the below upgrade paths to ensure that you are always running a compatible
  combination when upgrading to FXOS 2.3.1.130 or later:

  1. Upgrade ASA to 9.8(3) or later
  2. Upgrade FXOS to 2.3.1.130 or later
  3. Upgrade ASA to your final version

  For example, you are on FXOS 2.2.2.26/ASA 9.8(1), and you want to upgrade to FXOS 2.6.1/ASA 9.12(1), then you can:

  1. Upgrade ASA to 9.8(4)
  2. Upgrade FXOS to 2.6.1
  3. Upgrade ASA to 9.12(1)
* Upgrade issues with 8.4(6), 9.0(2) , and 9.1(2)—Due to CSCug88962, you cannot perform a Zero Downtime Upgrade to 8.4(6), 9.0(2),
  or 9.1(3). You should instead upgrade to 8.4(5) or 9.0(3). To upgrade 9.1(1), you cannot upgrade directly to the 9.1(3) release
  due to CSCuh25271, so there is no workaround for a Zero Downtime Upgrade; you must upgrade to 9.1(2) before you upgrade to
  9.1(3) or later.
* Upgrade issues for fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) ACLs—Due to [CSCuv92371](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuv92371), ACLs containing FQDNs might result in incomplete ACL replication to secondary units in a cluster or failover pair. This
  bug is present in 9.1(7), 9.5(2), 9.6(1), and some interim releases. We suggest that you upgrade to a version that includes
  the fix for CSCuy34265: 9.1(7.6) or later, 9.5(3) or later, 9.6(2) or later. However, due to the nature of configuration replication,
  zero downtime upgrade is not available. See [CSCuy34265](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuy34265) for more information about different methods of upgrading.
* Upgrade issue with 9.7(1) to 9.7(1.x) and later for VTI and VXLAN VNI—If you configure
  both Virtual Tunnel Interfaces (VTIs) and VXLAN Virtual Network Identifier (VNI)
  interfaces, then you cannot perform a zero downtime upgrade for failover; connections on
  these interface types will not replicate to the standby unit until both units are on the
  same version. (CSCvc83062)
* Before upgrading to 9.8(2) or later, FIPS mode
  requires the failover key to be at least 14
  characters—Before you upgrade to to 9.8(2) or
  later in FIPS mode, you must change the
  failover key  or
  failover ipsec
  pre-shared-key  to be at least 14
  characters long. If your failover key is too
  short, when you upgrade the first unit, the
  failover key will be rejected, and both units will
  become active until you set the failover key to a
  valid value.
* Upgrade issue with GTP inspection—There could be some downtime during the upgrade, because the GTP data structures are not
  replicated to the new node.

#### Additional Guidelines

* Cisco ASA Clientless SSL VPN Portal Customization Integrity
  Vulnerability—Multiple vulnerabilities have been fixed for clientless SSL VPN
  in ASA software, so you should upgrade your software to a fixed version. See
  <http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20141008-asa>
  for details about the vulnerability and a list of fixed ASA versions. Also, if
  you ever ran an earlier ASA version that had a vulnerable configuration, then
  regardless of the version you are currently running, you should verify that the
  portal customization was not compromised. If an attacker compromised a
  customization object in the past, then the compromised object stays persistent
  after you upgrade the ASA to a fixed version. Upgrading the ASA prevents this
  vulnerability from being exploited further, but it will not modify any
  customization objects that were already compromised and are still present on
  the system.

### FXOS Upgrade Guidelines

Before you upgrade, read the release notes for each FXOS version in your chosen upgrade path. Release notes contain important
information about each FXOS release, including new features and changed functionality.

Upgrading may require configuration changes that you must address. For example, new hardware supported in an FXOS release
might also require that you update the FXOS firmware.

FXOS release notes are available here: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/security/firepower-9000-series/products-release-notes-list.html>.

#### ASA 9.20 and 9.19

Releases in **bold** are the recommended versions.

| **Note** | ---  * ASA 9.20(x) was the final version for the Firepower 2100 series. * ASA 9.18(x) was the final version for the Firepower 4110, 4120, 4140, 4150, and   Security Modules SM-24, SM-36, and SM-44 for the Firepower 9300. * ASDM versions are backwards compatible with all previous ASA versions, unless   otherwise stated. For example, ASDM 7.19(1) can manage an ASA 5516-X on ASA   9.10(1). * New ASA versions require the coordinating ASDM version or a later version; you cannot   use an old version of ASDM with a new version of ASA. For example, you cannot use ASDM   7.18 with ASA 9.19. For ASA maintenance releases and interims, you can continue to use   the current ASDM version, unless otherwise stated. For example, you can use ASA   9.20(1.5) with ASDM 7.20(1). If an ASA maintenance release has significant new   features, then usually there will be a new ASDM version required.  --- |

#### ASA 9.18 to 9.17

Releases in **bold** are the recommended versions.

| **Note** | ---  * ASA 9.16(x) was the final version for the ASA 5506-X, 5506H-X, 5506W-X, 5508-X, and   5516-X. * ASDM versions are backwards compatible with all previous ASA versions, unless   otherwise stated. For example, ASDM 7.17(1) can manage an ASA 5516-X on ASA   9.10(1). * New ASA versions require the coordinating ASDM version or a later version; you cannot   use an old version of ASDM with a new version of ASA. For example, you cannot use ASDM   7.17 with ASA 9.18. For ASA maintenance releases and interims, you can continue to use   the current ASDM version, unless otherwise stated. For example, you can use ASA   9.17(1.2) with ASDM 7.17(1). If an ASA maintenance release has significant new   features, then usually there will be a new ASDM version required. * ASA 9.17(1.13) and 9.18(2) and later requires ASDM 7.18(1.152) or later. The ASA now   validates whether the ASDM image is a Cisco digitally signed image. If you try to run   an older ASDM image than 7.18(1.152) with an ASA version with this fix, ASDM will be   blocked and the message “%ERROR: Signature not valid for file disk0:/<filename>”   will be displayed at the ASA CLI.

#### ASA 9.16 to 9.15

Releases in **bold** are the recommended versions.

| **Note** | ---  * ASA 9.16(x) was the final version for the ASA 5506-X, 5506H-X, 5506W-X, 5508-X, and   5516-X. * ASA 9.14(x) was the final version for the ASA 5525-X, 5545-X, and 5555-X. * ASDM versions are backwards compatible with all previous ASA versions, unless   otherwise stated. For example, ASDM 7.15(1) can manage an ASA 5516-X on ASA   9.10(1). * New ASA versions require the coordinating ASDM version or a later version; you cannot   use an old version of ASDM with a new version of ASA. For example, you cannot use ASDM   7.15 with ASA 9.16. For ASA maintenance releases and interims, you can continue to use   the current ASDM version, unless otherwise stated. For example, you can use ASA   9.16(1.15) with ASDM 7.16(1). If an ASA maintenance release has significant new   features, then usually there will be a new ASDM version required. * ASA 9.16(3.19) and later requires ASDM 7.18(1.152) or later. The ASA now validates   whether the ASDM image is a Cisco digitally signed image. If you try to run an older   ASDM image than 7.18(1.152) with an ASA version with this fix, ASDM will be blocked   and the message “%ERROR: Signature not valid for file disk0:/<filename>” will be   displayed at the ASA CLI.

### Firepower 4100/9300 Compatibility with ASA and Threat Defense

The following table lists compatibility between the ASA and threat
defense applications with the Firepower 4100/9300.

The **bold** versions listed below are specially-qualified companion releases. You
should use these software combinations whenever possible because Cisco performs enhanced
testing for these combinations.

For upgrading, see the following guidelines:

* FXOS—For 2.2.2 and later, you can upgrade directly to a higher
  version. When upgrading from versions earlier than 2.2.2, you need to upgrade to each
  intermediate version. Note that you cannot upgrade FXOS to a version that does not
  support your current logical device version. You will need to upgrade in steps:
  upgrade FXOS to the highest version that supports your current logical device; then
  upgrade your logical device to the highest version supported with that FXOS version.
  For example, if you want to upgrade from FXOS 2.2/ASA 9.8 to FXOS 2.13/ASA 9.19, you
  would have to perform the following upgrades:

  1. FXOS 2.2→FXOS 2.11 (the highest version that supports 9.8)
  2. ASA 9.8→ASA 9.17 (the highest version supported by 2.11)
  3. FXOS 2.11→FXOS 2.13
  4. ASA 9.17→ASA 9.19
* ASA—ASA lets you upgrade directly from your current version to any higher version,
  noting the FXOS requirements above.

| **Note** | ---   This section applies only to the Firepower 4100/9300. Other models utilize FXOS only as an underlying operating system that is included in the ASA and threat defense unified image bundles. For the Secure Firewall 3100 in multi-instance mode, see the Threat Defense compatibility guide.   --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---   FXOS 2.8(1.125)+ and later versions do not support ASA 9.14(1) or 9.14(1.10) for ASA SNMP polls and traps; you must use 9.14(1.15)+. Other releases, such as 9.13 or 9.12, are not affected.   --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---   FXOS 2.12/ASA 9.18/Threat Defense 7.2 was the final version for the Firepower 4110, 4120, 4140, 4150, and Security Modules SM-24, SM-36, and SM-44 for the Firepower 9300.   --- |

### Upgrade Path: ASA Logical Devices for the Firepower 4100/9300

To view your current version and model, use one of the following methods:

* Firepower Chassis Manager: Choose Overview, and look
  at the Model and Version
  fields at the top.
* CLI: For the version, use the show version  command,
  and look at the Package-Vers: field. For the model, enter scope
  chassis 1 , and then show
  inventory .

For upgrading, see the following guidelines:

* FXOS—For 2.2.2 and later, you can upgrade directly to a higher
  version. When upgrading from versions earlier than 2.2.2, you need to upgrade to each
  intermediate version. Note that you cannot upgrade FXOS to a version that does not
  support your current logical device version. You will need to upgrade in steps:
  upgrade FXOS to the highest version that supports your current logical device; then
  upgrade your logical device to the highest version supported with that FXOS version.
  For example, if you want to upgrade from FXOS 2.2/ASA 9.8 to FXOS 2.13/ASA 9.19, you
  would have to perform the following upgrades:

  1. FXOS 2.2→FXOS 2.11 (the highest version that supports 9.8)
  2. ASA 9.8→ASA 9.17 (the highest version supported by 2.11)
  3. FXOS 2.11→FXOS 2.13
  4. ASA 9.17→ASA 9.19
* ASA—ASA lets you upgrade directly from your current version to any higher version,
  noting the FXOS requirements above.

#### Note on Downgrades

Downgrade of FXOS images is not
officially supported. The only Cisco-supported method of
downgrading an image version of FXOS is to perform a
complete re-image of the device.

## Download the Software from Cisco.com

Download all software packages from Cisco.com before you start your upgrade. Depending on the operating system and whether
you are using CLI or GUI, you should place the images on a server or on your management computer. See each installation procedure
for details on supported file locations.

| **Note** | ---   A Cisco.com login and Cisco service contract are required.   --- |
| --- | --- |

* [Download ASA Software](#ID-2152-0000008d)
* [Download FXOS for the Firepower 4100/9300](#ID-2152-0000008d)

### Download ASA Software

If you are using the ASDM Upgrade Wizard, you do not have to
pre-download the software. If you are manually upgrading, for example for a
failover upgrade, download the images to your local computer.

For a CLI upgrade, you can put the software on many server types, including TFTP, HTTP, and FTP. See the copy  command in the [ASA command reference](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/asa-command-reference/A-H/cmdref1/c4.html#pgfId-2171368).

ASA software can be downloaded from Cisco.com. These tables include naming conventions and
information about ASA packages.

Bias-Free Language

### Bias-Free Language

The documentation set for this product strives to use bias-free language. For the purposes of this documentation set, bias-free is defined as language that does not imply discrimination based on age, disability, gender, racial identity, ethnic identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and intersectionality. Exceptions may be present in the documentation due to language that is hardcoded in the user interfaces of the product software, language used based on RFP documentation, or language that is used by a referenced third-party product. [Learn more](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/social-justice/inclusive-language-policy.html) about how Cisco is using Inclusive Language.

# Access Control

The following topics explain access
control rules. These rules control which traffic is allowed to pass through the
device, and apply advanced services to the traffic, such as intrusion
inspection.

## Best Practices for Access Control

The access control policy is your primary tool for protecting your internal networks
and preventing your users from accessing undesirable external network resources,
such as inappropriate web sites. Thus, we recommend that you pay special attention
to this policy and fine-tune it to get the level of protection and connectivity that
you need.

The following procedure provides an overview of the basic things you should do with
the access control policy. This is an overview, and does not provide exhaustive
steps for performing each task.

To get to the access control policy, choose Policies > Access Control.

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Configure the default action for the policy.  The default action handles connections that do not match the specific rules in the policy. By default, this action is Block, so that anything you miss in the rules is blocked. Thus, you simply need to write access control rules that allow desirable traffic. This is the traditional way to configure the access control policy.  You can do the opposite, where you allow traffic by default, and write rules that drop known undesirable traffic, so that you do not need to have rules for everything you want to allow. This makes it easy for new services to be used, but opens the risk that new undesirable traffic will get through before you notice it. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click the Access Policy Settings (Gear/Settings button.) button, and enable the TLS Server Identity Discovery option.  This option improves the initial application detection and URL category and reputation identification for TLS 1.3 connections. If you do not enable this option, TLS 1.3 traffic might not match your intended rules. This option can also improve the efficacy of decryption rules. |
| **Step 3** | Create as few access control rules as possible.  With traditional firewalls, you might end up with tens of thousands of rules for various combinations of IP address and port. With a next-generation firewall, you can use advanced inspection and avoid some of these detailed rules. The fewer rules you have, the faster the system can evaluate traffic, and the easier it will be for you to find and fix problems within your rule set. |
| **Step 4** | Enabling logging on your access control rules.  Statistics are collected for matching traffic only if you enable logging. Your monitoring dashboards will be inaccurate if you do not enable logging. |
| **Step 5** | Put very specific rules at the top of the policy, and ensure that specific rules are above any more general rule that would match the connections a specific rule would also match.  The policy is evaluated top-down, first match wins. Thus, if you put in a rule that blocks all traffic to a specific subnet, then follow it with a rule that allows access to a single IP address within the subnet, traffic to that address will not be allowed, because the first rule will block it.  In addition, place rules that target traffic based only on traditional criteria such as ingress/egress interface, and source/destination IP address, port, or Geolocation, ahead of rules that require deep inspection, such as those that apply to user criteria, URL filtering, or application filtering. Because these rules do not require inspection, putting them early can get you quicker access control decisions for matching connections.  For more suggestions, see [Best Practices for Access Control Rule Order](#concept_F36CB276D40F4D9ABBBDB8E771DC32D4). |
| **Step 6** | Pair Block and Allow rules to target subsets of traffic.  For example, it is likely that you want to allow a lot of HTTP/HTTPS traffic, yet block access to some undesirable sites such as pornography or gambling. You can accomplish this by creating the following rules and keeping them sequential within the policy (for example, rules 11 and 12).   * A URL filtering Block rule that targets undesirable URL categories,   applied to the inside security zone (source) and outside security   zone (destination), and any IP address, port, or Geolocation. For   example, Block Botnets, Child Abuse Content, Cryptojacking, DNS   Tunneling, Ebanking Fraud, Exploits, Extreme, Filter Avoidance,   Gambling, Hacking, Hate Speech, High Risk Sites and Locations,   Illegal Activities, Illegal Downloads, Illegal Drugs, Malicious   Sites, Malware Sites, Mobile Threats, P2P Malware Node, Phishing,   Pornography, Spam, Spyware and Adware. * An application filtering Allow rule for the HTTP and HTTPS   applications, applied to the inside security zone (source) and   outside security zone (destination), and any IP address, port, or   Geolocation. After the URL filtering rule blocks access to unwanted   web resources, this rule allows all other HTTP/HTTPS access. |
| **Step 7** | Use advanced next-generation firewall features to target traffic regardless of IP address or port.  Attackers or other bad actors can frequently change IP addresses and ports to evade traditional access control traffic-matching criteria. Instead, use the following next-generation features:   * User criteria—Configure the Identity policy to obtain information   about the user who is initiating the traffic. Ideally, your Active   Directory server organizes users into groups, and you can create   access control rules that allow or block traffic based on user group   membership. For example, allow Engineers to access your development   subnets, but implicitly block anyone who is not in the Engineers   group. Use groups rather than individual user names, so you do not   need to continually update the rules as people are added to the   network. * Application criteria—Use application filtering criteria to allow or   block types of applications. This, if a user changes ports for an   HTTP connection, the system can recognize that it is HTTP, even   though it isn't going to port 80. For more suggestions, see [Best Practices for Application Filtering](#concept_02DF0685418F419EA1CADA6693872521). * URL category and reputation criteria—Use URL filtering based on   category to dynamically allow or block sites based on the type of   site. Within the site type, or category, you can fine-tune your rule   based on whether the site has a reputation as a good actor or a bad   actor. By using category and reputation, you will not need to   constantly adjust your rules as sites change URLs, which you would   have to do if you tried to manually block sites by URL. For more   suggestions, see [Best Practices for Effective URL Filtering](#concept_F6A0AA79F3F54EE7BBFA3646D00596A7).  You can also apply URL   category/reputation filtering rules to the FQDN in a DNS lookup   request. The system can prevent the DNS response for blocked   category/reputation, effectively blocking the user’s connection   attempt. For details, see [Filtering DNS Requests Based on URL Category and Reputation](#Cisco_Task_in_List_GUI.dita_144597f9-f18a-47d8-a82e-35a4b93043d5). |
| **Step 8** | Apply intrusion inspection to all of your Allow rules.  One of the powerful aspects of next-generation firewalls is that you can apply intrusion inspection and access control using the same device. Apply an intrusion policy to each Allow rule, so that if an attack does enter your network through a normally benign path, you can catch it and drop the attacking connection.  If your default action is Allow, you can also apply intrusion protection for traffic that matches the default action. |
| **Step 9** | Also configure the Security Intelligence policy to block unwanted IP addresses and URLs.  The Security Intelligence policy is applied before the access control policy, so it can block unwanted connections before your access control rules are even evaluated. This can provide an early block and help you reduce the complexity of your access control rules. |
| **Step 10** | Consider implementing the SSL Decryption policy.  The system cannot perform deep inspection on encrypted traffic. If you configure the SSL Decryption policy, the access control policy is applied to a decrypted version of the traffic. Thus, deep inspection can identify attacks (using the intrusion policy), and rule matching is better because application and URL filtering can be applied more effectively. Any traffic that the access control policy allows is then re-encrypted before being sent out of the device, so the end user does not lose the protection of encryption. |
| **Step 11** | Enable object group search to simplify the deployment of your rules.  Starting with release 7.2, this feature is enabled by default on new deployments, but is not automatically enabled on upgraded systems.  Enabling object group search reduces memory requirements for access control policies that include network objects. However, it is important to note that object group search might also decrease rule lookup performance and thus increase CPU utilization. You should balance the CPU impact against the reduced memory requirements for your specific access control policy. In most cases, enabling object group search provides a net operational improvement.  You can set this option using FlexConfig by issuing the object-group-searchaccess-control  command; use the no  form of the command in the negate template. |

* [How Other Security Policies Impact Access Control](#concept_903B1EBDCA764E799E26B92F0CF8D608)

### Access Control Rules and the Default Action

Use the access control
policy to allow or block access to network resources. The policy consists of a
set of ordered rules, which are evaluated from top to bottom. The rule applied
to traffic is the first one where all the traffic criteria are matched.

You can control access
based on:

* Traditional
  network characteristics such as source and destination IP addresses, protocol,
  ports, and interfaces (in the form of security zones).
* The fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) of the source or destination (in the form of a network object). Traffic matching is
  based on the IP address returned for the name from a DNS lookup.
* The security group tag (SGT) assigned to the source or destination by the Cisco
  Identity Services Engine (ISE).
* The application
  that is being used. You can control access based on the specific application,
  or you can create rules that cover categories of applications, applications
  tagged with a particular characteristic, the type of application (client,
  server, web), or the application's risk or business relevance rating.
* The destination
  URL of a web request, including the generalized category of the URL. You can
  refine category matches based on the public reputation of the target site.
* The URL category and reputation of an FQDN in a DNS lookup request. You can block
  the DNS response for unwanted categories or poor reputations, effectively
  preventing the subsequent connection attempt.
* The user who is
  making the request, or the user groups to which the user belongs.

For unencrypted
traffic that you allow, you can apply IPS inspection to check for threats and
block traffic that appears to be an attack. You can also use file policies to
check for prohibited files or malware.

Any traffic that does
not match an access rule is handled by the access control
Default
Action. If you allow traffic by default, you can apply intrusion
inspection to the traffic. However, you cannot perform file or malware
inspection on traffic handled by the default action.

### Application Filtering

You can use access
control rules to filter traffic based on the application used in the
connection. The system can recognize a wide variety of applications, so that
you do not need to figure out how to block one web application without blocking
all web applications.

For some popular
applications, you can filter on different aspects of the application. For
example, you could create a rule that blocks Facebook Games without blocking
all of Facebook.

You can also create
rules based on general application characteristics, blocking or allowing entire
groups of applications by selecting risk or business relevance, type, category,
or tag.
**However, as you
select categories in an application filter, look over the list of matching
applications to ensure you are not including unintended applications.** For a
detailed explanation of the possible groupings, see
[Application Criteria](#concept_1F51EAD7EE7D4107BCF4547CD8D0653B).

* [Application Control for Encrypted and Decrypted Traffic](#concept_28D9D3ECCAC8424ABF27B39DC3A92311)
* [Filtering on Common Industrial Protocol (CIP) and Modbus Applications (ISA 3000)](#id_110363)
* [Best Practices for Application Filtering](#concept_02DF0685418F419EA1CADA6693872521)

#### Application Control for Encrypted and Decrypted Traffic

If an application uses encryption, the system might not be able to
identify the application.

The system can detect application traffic encrypted with StartTLS,
including SMTPS, POPS, FTPS, TelnetS, and IMAPS. In addition, it can identify
certain encrypted applications based on the Server Name Indication in the TLS
ClientHello message, or the subject distinguished name value from the server
certificate.

Use the application filters dialog box to determine if your application
requires decryption by selecting the following Tags, then examining the list of
applications.

* SSL Protocol—You do not need to decrypt
  traffic tagged as SSL Protocol. The system can recognize this traffic and apply
  your access control action. Access control rules for the listed applications
  should match to expected connections.
* Decrypted Traffic—The system can recognize this traffic only if you first decrypt the traffic. Configure SSL decryption rules for this traffic.

#### Filtering on Common Industrial Protocol (CIP) and Modbus Applications (ISA 3000)

You can enable the Common Industrial Protocl (CIP) and Modbus pre-processors on Cisco ISA 3000 devices, and filter on CIP and Modbus applications in access control rules. All CIP application names start with “CIP,” such
as CIP Write. There is only one application for Modbus.

To enable the pre-processors, you must go into expert mode in a CLI session (SSH or Console) and issue the following command
to enable one or both of these Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) applications.

sudo /usr/local/sf/bin/enable\_scada.sh {cip | modbus | both}

For example, to enable both pre-processors:

```

> expert
admin@firepower:~$ sudo /usr/local/sf/bin/enable_scada.sh both

```

| **Note** | ---   You must issue this command after every deployment. These pre-processors are disabled during deployment.   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Best Practices for Application Filtering

Please keep the
following recommendations in mind when designing your application filtering
access control rules.

* To handle traffic
  referred by a web server, such as advertisement traffic, match the referred
  application rather than the referring application.
* Avoid combining
  application and URL criteria in the same rule, especially for encrypted
  traffic.
* If you write a
  rule for traffic that is tagged
  Decrypted Traffic, ensure that you have an SSL
  Decryption rule that will decrypt the matching traffic. These applications can
  be identified in decrypted connections only.
* TLS 1.3 encrpyts most handshake messages, so certificate information is not readily available. For traffic encrypted with
  TLS 1.3 to match access rules that use application or URL filtering effectively, the system must obtain a clear-text certificate
  for the server. We recommend that you enable TLS 1.3 Certificate Visibility in the access control settings. If you enable this option, the system checks whether a certificate for the site is stored
  in cache based on the IP address and Server Name Indication (SNI) in the client hello packet. If one is not available, the
  system uses a TLS 1.2 probe to obtain the certicate, which can then be used for application/URL category and reputation identification
  without decrypting the connection.
* The system can
  detect multiple types of Skype application traffic. To control Skype traffic,
  choose the Skype tag from the Application Filters list rather than selecting
  individual applications. This ensures that the system can detect and control
  all Skype traffic the same way.
* To control access to Zoho mail, select both the Zoho and Zoho Mail
  applications.

### URL Filtering

You can use access
control rules to filter traffic based on the URL used in an HTTP or HTTPS
connection. Note that URL filtering for HTTP is more straight-forward than it
is for HTTPS, because HTTPS is encrypted.

You can use the
following techniques to implement URL filtering.

* Category and reputation-based URL filtering—With a URL filtering license, you can control access to web sites based on the
  URL’s general classification (category) and risk level (reputation). This is by far the easiest and most effective way to
  block unwanted sites.
* Manual URL
  filtering—With any license, you can manually specify individual URLs, and
  groups of URLs, to achieve granular, custom control over web traffic. The main
  purpose of manual filtering is to create exceptions to category-based block
  rules, but you can use manual rules for other purposes.

The following topics
provide more information on URL filtering.

* [Filtering URLs by Category and Reputation](#concept_2190C5512921483CB9009A9FF5E3AE74)
* [Looking Up the Category and Reputation for a URL](#id_75010)
* [Manual URL Filtering](#concept_BA45929BE1D543DAA1738FE58F5E4C0C)
* [Filtering HTTPS Traffic](#concept_3DF15D5D32444D5DA55001A3D2BF4816)
* [Comparing URL and Application Filtering](#concept_9B9F5E79222E41DB9ED37367A499BE6E)
* [Best Practices for Effective URL Filtering](#concept_F6A0AA79F3F54EE7BBFA3646D00596A7)
* [What the User Sees When You Block Web Sites](#id_40051)

#### Filtering URLs by Category and Reputation

With a URL filtering license, you can control access to web sites based on the category and reputation of the requested URLs:

* Category—A general classification for the URL. For example, ebay.com
  belongs to the Auctions category, and monster.com belongs to the Job Search
  category. A URL can belong to more than one category.
* Reputation—How likely the URL is to be used for purposes that might be against your organization’s security policy. Reputations range from Untrusted (level 1) to Trusted (level 5).

URL categories and reputations help you quickly configure URL filtering. For example, you can use access control to block untrusted URLs in the Illegal Drugs category.

For a description of the categories, see <https://www.talosintelligence.com/categories>.

Using category and reputation data also simplifies policy creation and
administration. Sites that represent security threats, or that serve
undesirable content, might appear and disappear faster than you can update and
deploy new policies. As Cisco updates the URL database with new sites, changed
classifications, and changed reputations, your rules automatically adjust to
the new information. You do not need to edit your rules to account for new
sites.

If you enable regular URL database updates, you can ensure that the
system uses up-to-date information for URL filtering. You can also enable
communications with Cisco Collective Security Intelligence (CSI) to obtain the
latest threat intelligence for URLs with unknown category and reputation. For
more information, see
[Configuring URL Filtering Preferences](fptd-fdm-system.html#id_16177).

| **Note** | ---   To see URL category and reputation information in events and application details, you must create at least one rule with a URL condition.   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Looking Up the Category and Reputation for a URL

You can check on the category and reputation for a particular URL. You can go to the URL tab of an access control rule, or
SSL decryption rule, or go to Device > System Settings > URL Filtering Preferences. There, you can enter the URL in the URL to Check field and click Go.

You will be taken to a web site that shows the results of the lookup. You can use this information to help you check the behavior
of your category- and reputation-based URL filtering rules.

If you disagree with the categorization, you can click the Submit a URL Category Dispute in the device
manager to tell us what you think.

#### Manual URL Filtering

You can supplement or selectively override category and reputation-based
URL filtering by manually filtering individual URLs or groups of URLs. You can
perform this type of URL filtering without a special license.

For example, you might use access control to block a category of web
sites that are not appropriate for your organization. However, if the category
contains a web site that is appropriate, and to which you want to provide
access, you can create a manual Allow rule for that site and place it before
the Block rule for the category.

To configure manual URL filtering, you create a URL object with the
destination URL. How this URL is interpreted is based on the following rules:

* If you do not include a path (that is, there are no / characters in the URL), the match is based on the server’s hostname
  only. If you include one or more / character, the entire URL string is used for a substring match. Then, a URL is considered
  a match if any of the following are true:

  + The string is at the beginning of the URL.
  + The string follows a dot.
  + The string contains a dot in the beginning.
  + The string follows the :// characters.

  For example, ign.com matches ign.com or www.ign.com, but not versign.com.

  | **Note** | ---   We recommend that you do not use manual URL filtering to block or allow individual web pages or parts of sites (that is, URL strings with / characters), as servers can be reorganized and pages moved to new paths.   --- |
  | --- | --- |
* The system
  disregards the encryption protocol (HTTP vs HTTPS). In other words, if you
  block a website, both HTTP and HTTPS traffic to that website is blocked, unless
  you use an application condition to target a specific protocol. When creating a
  URL object, you do not need to specify the protocol when creating an object.
  For example, use example.com rather than http://example.com.
* If you plan to
  use a URL object to match HTTPS traffic in an access control rule, create the
  object using the subject common name in the public key certificate used to
  encrypt the traffic. Also, the system disregards subdomains within the subject
  common name, so do not include subdomain information. For example, use
  example.com rather than www.example.com.

  However, please
  understand that the subject common name in the certificate might be completely
  unrelated to a web site’s domain name. For example, the subject common name in
  the certificate for youtube.com is \*.google.com (this of course might change at
  any time). You will get more consistent results if you use the SSL Decryption
  policy to decrypt HTTPS traffic so that URL filtering rules work on decrypted
  traffic.

  | **Note** | ---   URL objects will not match HTTPS traffic if the browser resumes a TLS session because the certificate information is no longer available. Thus, even if you carefully configure the URL object, you might get inconsistent results for HTTPS connections.   --- |
  | --- | --- |

#### Filtering HTTPS Traffic

Because HTTPS traffic
is encrypted, performing URL filtering directly on HTTPS traffic is not as
straight-forward as it is on HTTP traffic. For that reason, you should consider
using SSL Decryption policies to decrypt all HTTPS traffic that you intend to
filter. That way, the URL filtering access control policies work on decrypted
traffic, and you get the same results you would get for regular HTTP traffic.

However, if you do
intend to allow some HTTPS traffic to pass undecrypted into the access control
policy, you need to understand that rules match HTTPS traffic differently than
they do for HTTP traffic. To filter encrypted traffic, the system determines
the requested URL based on information passed during the SSL handshake: the
subject common name in the public key certificate used to encrypt the traffic.
There might be little or no relationship between the web site hostname in the
URL and the subject common name.

You can improve HTTPS matching for category/reputation
rules if you enable DNS request filtering. The system can determine the category and
reputation during the DNS resolution phase, and block the DNS reply for unwanted
combinations, before the user can start the HTTPS connection attempt. For allowed DNS
responses, the system will have the category/reputation information available for
subsequent HTTPS connections. See [DNS Request Filtering](#Cisco_Concept.dita_8ecc19cf-1d41-4741-82cd-1bf5661deb22).

HTTPS filtering,
unlike HTTP filtering, disregards subdomains within the subject common name. Do
not include subdomain information when manually filtering HTTPS URLs. For
example, use example.com rather than www.example.com. Also, review the content
of the certificates used by the site to ensure you have the right domain, the
one used in the subject common name, and that this name will not conflict with
your other rules (for example, the name for a site you want to block might
overlap with one you want to allow). For example, the subject common name in
the certificate for youtube.com is \*.google.com (this of course might change at
any time).

| **Note** | ---   URL objects will not match HTTPS traffic if the browser resumes a TLS session because the certificate information is no longer available. Thus, even if you carefully configure the URL object, you might get inconsistent results for HTTPS connections.   --- |
| --- | --- |

##### Controlling Traffic by Encryption Protocol

The system disregards the encryption protocol (HTTP vs HTTPS)
when performing URL filtering. This occurs for both manual and reputation-based
URL conditions. In other words, URL filtering treats traffic to the following
web sites identically:

* http://example.com
* https://example.com

To configure a rule that matches only HTTP or HTTPS traffic, but
not both, either specify the TCP port in the Destination condition or add an
application condition to the rule. For example, you could allow HTTPS access to
a site while disallowing HTTP access by constructing two access control rules,
each with an TCP port or application, and URL, condition.

The first rule allows HTTPS traffic to the website:

* Action: Allow
* TCP port or
  Application: HTTPS (TCP port 443)
* URL: example.com

The second rule blocks HTTP access to the same website:

* Action: Block
* TCP port or
  Application: HTTP (TCP port 80)
* URL: example.com

#### Comparing URL and Application Filtering

URL and application
filtering have similarities. But you should use them for very distinct
purposes:

* URL filtering is
  best used to block or allow access to an entire web server. For example, if you
  do not want to allow any type of gambling on your network, you can create a URL
  filtering rule to block the Gambling category. With this rule, users cannot get
  to any pages on any web server within the category.
* Application
  filtering is useful for blocking specific applications regardless of the
  hosting site, or for blocking specific features of an otherwise allowable web
  site. For example, you could block just the Facebook Games application without
  blocking all of Facebook.

Because combining
application and URL criteria can lead to unexpected results, especially for
encrypted traffic, it is a good policy to create separate rules for URL and
application criteria. If you do need to combine application and URL criteria in
a single rule, you should place these rules after straight-forward
application-only or URL-only rules, unless the application+URL rule is acting
as an exception to a more general application-only or URL-only rule. Because
URL filtering block rules are more broad than application filtering, you should
place them above application-only rules.

If you do combine
application and URL criteria, you might need to monitor your network more
carefully to ensure that you are not allowing access to unwanted sites and
applications.

#### Best Practices for Effective URL Filtering

Please keep the
following recommendations in mind when designing your URL filtering access
control rules.

* Use category and
  reputation blocking whenever possible. This ensures that new sites get blocked
  automatically as they are added to the categories, and that blocking based on
  reputation is adjusted if a site becomes more (or less) reputable.
* When using URL category matching, note that there are cases where the login page for a site is in a different category than
  the site itself. For example, Gmail is in the Web-based Email category, whereas the login page is in the Search Engines and Portals category. If you have different rules with different actions for the categories, you might get unintended results.
* Use URL objects to
  target entire web sites and to make exceptions to category blocking rules. That
  is, to allow specific sites that would otherwise get blocked in a category
  rule.
* If you want to
  manually block a web server (using a URL object), it is much more effective to
  do so in the Security Intelligence policy. The Security Intelligence policy
  drops connections before the access control rules are evaluated, so you get a
  faster, more efficient, block.
* For the most
  effective filtering of HTTPS connections, implement SSL decryption rules to
  decrypt traffic for which you are writing an access control rule. Any decrypted
  HTTPS connections are filtered as HTTP connections in the access control
  policy, so you avoid all of the limitations for HTTPS filtering.
* TLS 1.3 encrpyts most handshake messages, so certificate information is not readily available. For traffic encrypted with
  TLS 1.3 to match access rules that use application or URL filtering effectively, the system must obtain a clear-text certificate
  for the server. We recommend that you enable TLS 1.3 Certificate Visibility in the access control settings. If you enable this option, the system checks whether a certificate for the site is stored
  in cache based on the IP address and Server Name Indication (SNI) in the client hello packet. If one is not available, the
  system uses a TLS 1.2 probe to obtain the certicate, which can then be used for application/URL category and reputation identification
  without decrypting the connection.
* Place URL blocking
  rules before any application filtering rules, because URL filtering blocks
  entire web servers, whereas application filtering targets specific application
  usage regardless of the web server.
* If you want to block high risk sites whose category is unknown, select the Uncategorized category and adjust the reputation slider to Questionable or Untrusted.
* You can improve overall URL filtering efficacy by also enabling DNS request
  filtering. When you use DNS request filtering, the system determines the FQDN’s
  URL category and reputation at DNS lookup time, so the information is available
  if a subsequent HTTP/HTTPS request comes for the same destination. Additionally,
  if you block the category/reputation, the attempted connection gets stopped at
  the DNS request stage, rather than the web-session establishment stage. See
  [DNS Request Filtering](#Cisco_Concept.dita_8ecc19cf-1d41-4741-82cd-1bf5661deb22).

#### What the User Sees When You Block Web Sites

When you block web sites with URL filtering rules, what the user sees
differs based on whether the site is encrypted.

* HTTP connections—The user sees a system default block response page
  instead of the normal browser page for timed out or reset connections. This
  page should make it clear that you blocked the connection on purpose.
* HTTPS (encrypted) connections—The user does not see the system
  default block response page. Instead, the user sees the browser’s default page
  for a secure connection failure. The error message does not indicate the site
  was blocked due to policy. Instead, errors might indicate that there are no
  common encryption algorithms. It will not be obvious from this message that you
  blocked the connection on purpose.

In addition, web sites might be blocked by other access control rules
that are not explicitly URL filtering rules, or even by the default action. For
example, if you block entire networks or geolocations, any web sites on that
network or in that geographic location are also blocked. Users blocked by these
rules may, or may not, get a response page as described in the limitations
below.

If you implement URL filtering, consider explaining to end users what
they might see when a site is intentionally blocked, and what types of site you
are blocking. Otherwise, they might spend a good deal of time troubleshooting
blocked connections.

##### Limitations of HTTP Response Pages

HTTP response pages do not always appear when the system blocks web
traffic.

* The system does not display a response page when web traffic is
  blocked as a result of a promoted access control rule (an early-placed blocking
  rule with only simple network conditions).
* The system does not display a response page when web traffic is
  blocked before the system identifies the requested URL.
* The system does not display a response page for encrypted
  connections blocked by access control rules.

### DNS Request Filtering

You can apply the URL category and reputation database to DNS lookup requests, even for
connection attempts that are not HTTP/HTTPS.

For example, if a user tries to make an FTP connection to www.example.com, you can
configure the system to look up the category and reputation of www.example.com when it
sees the DNS lookup request for that fully-qualified domain name (FQDN). If your DNS/URL
filtering rule for the returned category/reputation is a block rule, the system blocks
the DNS reply. Thus, the user does not get an IP address for the FQDN, and their
connection attempt fails.

By enabling DNS lookup request filtering, you can extend your URL filtering rules to
protocols other than HTTP/HTTPS, and prevent FTP, TFTP, SCP, ICMP, and any other
protocols from establishing a connection to a site that you are blocking for web access.
This works so long as the user uses an FQDN name and thus requires a DNS lookup. If the
user uses an IP address, there is no DNS request and DNS request blocking is not
possible.

For HTTP/HTTPS traffic, doing the category/reputation lookup at DNS request time might
improve system performance, as it can prevent the connection before the attempt to
establish the web session. This might be especially beneficial for HTTPS, which is
encrypted. By denying at the DNS request stage, the system never sees an HTTPS
connection, and thus your decryption rules do not need to be evaluated, nor does the
system need to perform the more difficult task of matching an encrypted session to the
right access control rule.

* [Guidelines for DNS Request Filtering](#Cisco_Concept.dita_878ba506-40a2-456d-b855-c703c8cae058)
* [Filtering DNS Requests Based on URL Category and Reputation](#Cisco_Task_in_List_GUI.dita_144597f9-f18a-47d8-a82e-35a4b93043d5)

#### Guidelines for DNS Request Filtering

Keep the following in mind as you configure DNS request filtering:

* DNS request filtering works on the DNS session only. If you allow the DNS reply
  (that is, the URL filtering rule action is Allow), then the subsequent
  connection that the user establishes with the returned IP address will be
  matched against your access control rules separately. The connection might match
  a different rule, and thus be blocked or allowed for other reasons. For example,
  if you allow an FTP attempt to get an IP address through a DNS lookup, you might
  have another access control rule that prohibits FTP connections, and the
  connection will ultimately be blocked.
* DNS lookup requests that match access control rules that come before your URL/DNS
  request filtering rules will be allowed or blocked according to the matching
  rule. Category/reputation lookup will not be done for these connections.
* This feature requires that you implement URL filtering based on
  category/reputation. You must have the URL filtering license for this type of
  URL filtering. If you have no URL filtering rules based on category/reputation,
  then DNS request filtering is not relevant and you should not enable it.
* Connection events generated by DNS filtering include the following fields of
  special interest: DNS Query, URL Category, and URL Reputation. The DNS Query
  field shows the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) for the lookup request. For
  DNS filtering events, the URL field will be blank.
* DNS request filtering uses the URL category and reputation database only. Any URL
  objects or other manual URL filtering defined in a matching access control rule
  are ignored. If you want to implement manual DNS name blocking, use the Security
  Intelligence DNS policy.

#### Filtering DNS Requests Based on URL Category and Reputation

The following procedure explains how to implement DNS lookup request filtering.

##### Before you begin

You must enable the URL license if it is not already enabled.

##### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Select Policies > Access Control. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | If necessary, click the Access Policy Settings (Gear/Settings button. ) button, select the Reputation Enforcement on DNS Traffic option, and click OK.  This option enables DNS request filtering for the access control policy. The option is enabled by default. |
| **Step 3** | Evaluate existing URL filtering rules, or create new ones, to implement filtering based on URL category and reputation that will also apply to DNS requests.  URL filtering normally applies to HTTP/HTTPS traffic only, so there is no reason to restrict these rules based on application or port. However, if you do have these restrictions, ensure that the rule can also apply to DNS requests:   * On the Source/Destination tab, if the   Destination Ports field has   Any, no change is needed. If you   specified ports, add DNS over UDP and   DNS over TCP to the list. * On the Applications tab, if the application   list simply has Any, no change is needed. If   you specified any applications or application filters, add the   DNS application to the list or filter.   The other DNS-related options are not relevant for this purpose.   For information on creating access control rules, see [Configuring Access Control Rules](#task_68A29B520CFF46608A8E88D8DFE7AEC0). |
| **Step 4** | Evaluate preceding rules to ensure that DNS requests do not match those rules.  Category and reputation determination happens only if the DNS request matches a URL filtering rule that has category and reputation specifications. Any DNS requests that match rules earlier in the access control policy than your URL filtering rule bypass DNS request filtering. Such DNS requests are handled according to the matching rule, either blocked or allowed. |

### Intrusion, File, and Malware Inspection

Intrusion and file
policies work together as the last line of defense before traffic is allowed to
its destination:

* Intrusion policies
  govern the system's intrusion prevention capabilities.
* File policies govern the system's file control and malware defense capabilities.

All other traffic
handling occurs before network traffic is examined for intrusions, prohibited
files, and malware. By associating an intrusion or file policy with an access
control rule, you are telling the system that before it passes traffic that
matches the access control rule's conditions, you first want to inspect the
traffic with an intrusion policy, a file policy, or both.

You can configure
intrusion and file policies on rules that
allow traffic only. Inspection is not performed on
rules set to
trust or
block traffic. In addition, if the default action
for the access control policy is
allow, you can configure an intrusion policy but
not a file policy.

For any single
connection handled by an access control rule, file inspection occurs before
intrusion inspection. That is, the system does not inspect files blocked by a
file policy for intrusions. Within file inspection, simple blocking by type
takes precedence over malware inspection and blocking. Until a file is detected
and blocked in a session, packets from the session may be subject to intrusion
inspection.

| **Note** | ---   By default, the system disables intrusion and file inspection of encrypted payloads. This helps reduce false positives and improve performance when an encrypted connection matches an access control rule that has intrusion and file inspection configured. Inspection works with unencrypted traffic only.   --- |
| --- | --- |

### Best Practices for Access Control Rule Order

Rules are applied on a first-match basis, so you must ensure that rules
with highly specific traffic matching criteria appear above policies that have
more general criteria that would otherwise apply to the matching traffic.
Consider the following recommendations:

* Specific rules should come before general rules, especially when the
  specific rules are exceptions to general rules.
* Any rules that drop traffic based on layer-3/4 criteria only (such
  as IP address, security zone, and port number) should come as early as
  possible. We recommend they come before any rule that requires inspection, such
  as those with application or URL criteria, because Layer-3/4 criteria can be
  evaluated quickly and without inspection. Of course, any exceptions to these
  rules must be placed above them.
* Whenever possible, put specific drop rules near the top of the
  policy. This ensures the earliest possible decision on undesirable traffic.
* Any rules that include both application and URL criteria should come
  after straight-forward application-only or URL-only rules, unless the
  application+URL rule is acting as an exception to a more general
  application-only or URL-only rule. Combining application and URL criteria can
  lead to unexpected results, especially for encrypted traffic, so we recommend
  that you create separate rules for URL and application filtering whenever
  possible.

### NAT and Access Rules

Access rules always use the real IP addresses when determining
an access rule match, even if you configure NAT. For example, if you configure
NAT for an inside server, 10.1.1.5, so that it has a publicly routable IP
address on the outside, 209.165.201.5, then the access rule to allow the
outside traffic to access the inside server needs to reference the server’s
real IP address (10.1.1.5), and not the mapped address (209.165.201.5).

### How Other Security Policies Impact Access Control

Other security
policies can affect how access control rules function and match connections. As
you configure your access rules, keep the following in mind:

* SSL
  Decryption policy—The SSL decryption rules are evaluated before
  access control. Thus, if an encrypted connection matches an SSL decryption rule
  that applies some type of decryption, it is the plain text (decrypted)
  connection that is evaluated by the access control policy. The access rules do
  not see the encrypted version of the connection. Additionally, any connections
  that match SSL decryption rules that drop traffic are never seen by the access
  control policy. Finally, any encrypted connection that matches a Do Not Decrypt
  rule is evaluated in its encrypted state.
* Identity policy—Connections are matched to users
  (and thus, user groups) only if there is a user mapping for the source IP
  address. Access rules that key on user or group membership can match only those
  connections for which user identity was successfully collected by your identity
  policy.
* Security Intelligence policy—Any connection that is dropped is never
  seen by the access control policy. Connections that match the do not block list
  are subsequently matched to access control rules and, ultimately, it is the
  access control rule that determines how the connection is handled (allowed or
  dropped).
* VPN (site-to-site or remote access)—VPN traffic is always evaluated against
  the access control policy, and connections are allowed or dropped based on the
  matching rule. However, the VPN tunnel itself is decrypted before the access
  control policy is evaluated. The access control policy evaluates the
  connections that are embedded within the VPN tunnel, not the tunnel itself.

## License Requirements for Access Control

You do not need a special license to use the access control policy.

However, you do need the following licenses for specific features within
the access control policy. For information on configuring licenses, see
[Enabling or Disabling Optional Licenses](fptd-fdm-license.html#id_12247).

* URL license—To create rules that use URL categories and reputations as match criteria.
* **Threat** license—To configure an intrusion policy on an access rule or the default action. You also need this license to use a file
  policy (the Malware license is also required).
* **Malware** license—To configure a file policy on an access rule. The Threat is also required for file policies.

## Guidelines and Limitations for Access Control Policies

Following are some
additional limitations for access control. Please consider them when evaluating
whether you are getting the expected results from your rules.

* If a URL database update includes added (new, incoming), deprecated (outgoing), or deleted categories, there is a grace period
  for you to make changes to any access control rules that are affected. Impacted rules are marked with informational messages,
  with explanations about the issues that impact the rule and links to the Cisco Talos Intelligence Group
  (Talos) web site for more information about the category changes. You need to update the rule so that it uses the appropriate categories
  available in the latest URL database.

  To accommodate the grace period, add the newly added incoming categories to the appropriate rules without removing the outgoing
  deprecated categories: your rules should contain both the new and old categories. The new categories will be effective when
  the old categories are marked for deletion. When the old categories are finally deleted, you need to edit the rules to remove
  the deleted categories and redeploy the configuration. You will be blocked from deploying the configuration until you fix
  any rules that use deleted categories. Click the See Problem Rules link above the table to filter on rules that need attention.
* Device Manager can download information on up to 50,000 users from the
  directory server. If your directory server includes more than 50,000 user accounts, you will
  not see all possible names when selecting users in an access rule or when
  viewing user-based dashboard information. You can write rules on only those
  names that were downloaded.

  The 50,000 limit also applies to the names associated with groups. If a group has more than 50,000 members, only the 50,000 names that were downloaded can be matched against the group membership.
* If a Vulnerability Database (VDB) update removes (deprecates) applications, you must make changes to any access control rules
  or application filters that use the application that was deleted. You cannot deploy changes until you fix these rules. In
  addition, you cannot install system software updates before fixing the issue. On the Application Filters object page, or the
  Application tab of the rule, these applications say “(Deprecated)” after the application name.
* To use fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) network objects as source or destination criteria, you must also configure DNS for
  the data interfaces on Device > System Settings > DNS Server. The system does not use the management DNS server setting to do lookups for FQDN objects used in access control rules. For
  information on troubleshooting FQDN resolution, see [Troubleshooting General DNS Problems](fptd-fdm-system.html#id_73501).

  Note that controlling access by FQDN is a best-effort mechanism. Consider the following points:

  + Because DNS replies can be spoofed, only use fully trusted internal DNS servers.
  + Some FQDNs, especially for very popular servers, can have multiple and frequently changing IP addresses. Because the system
    uses cached DNS lookup results, users might get new addresses that are not yet in the cache. Thus, it is possible that blocking
    a popular site by FQDN will provide inconsistent results.
  + For popular FQDNs, different DNS servers can return a different set of IP addresses. Thus, if your users use a different DNS
    server than the one you configure, FQDN-based access control rules might not apply to all IP addresses for the site that are
    used by your clients, and you will not get the intended results for your rules.
  + Some FQDN DNS entries have very short time to live (TTL) values. This can result in frequent recompliation of the lookup table,
    which can impact overall system performance.
* If you edit a rule
  that is actively in use, the changes do not apply to established connections
  that are no longer being inspected by Snort. The new rule is used to match
  against future connections. In addition, if Snort is actively inspecting a
  connection, it can apply the changed matching or action criteria to an existing
  connection. If you need to ensure that your changes apply to all current
  connections, you can log into the device CLI and use the
  clear conn
  command to end established connections, on the assumption that the sources for
  the connections will then attempt to reestablish the connection and thus be
  matched appropriately against the new rule.
* It takes 3 to 5
  packets for the system to identify the application or URL in a connection.
  Thus, the correct access control rule might not be matched immediately for a
  given connection. However, once the application/URL is known, the connection is
  handled based on the matching rule. For encrypted connections, this happens
  after the server certificate exchange in the SSL handshake.
* The system applies
  the default policy action to packets that do not have a payload in a connection
  where an application is identified.
* Leave matching criteria empty whenever possible, especially those for security zones, network objects, and port objects. For
  example, the system can more efficiently match traffic for all interfaces if you simply leave the security zone criteria blank,
  rather than if you create zones that contain all interfaces. When you specify multiple criteria, the system must match against
  every combination of the contents of the criteria you specify.
* If you specify IP addresses for source or destination criteria, do not mix IPv4
  and IPv6 addresses in the same rule. Create separate rules for IPv4 and IPv6
  addresses.
* While operating, the threat
  defense device expands access control rules into multiple access control list entries based on the contents of any network objects
  used in the access rule. You can reduce the memory required to search access control rules by enabling object group search.
  With object group search enabled, the system does not expand network objects, but instead searches access rules for matches
  based on those group definitions. Object group search does not impact how your access rules are defined or how they appear
  in the device manager. It impacts only how the device interprets and processes them while matching connections to access control rules.

  Enabling object group search reduces memory requirements for access control policies that include network objects. However,
  it is important to note that object group search might also decrease rule lookup performance and thus increase CPU utilization.
  You should balance the CPU impact against the reduced memory requirements for your specific access control policy. In most
  cases, enabling object group search provides a net operational improvement.

  You can set this option using FlexConfig by issuing the object-group-searchaccess-control  command; use the no  form of the command in the negate template.

  Starting with release 7.2, this feature is enabled by default on new deployments, but is not automatically enabled on upgraded
  systems.
* GRE tunnels that violate the related RFCs will be dropped. For example, if a GRE tunnel contains non-zero values in the reserved
  bits, contrary to the RFCs, it is dropped. If you need to allow non-compliant GRE tunnels, you need to use a remote manager
  and configure a prefilter rule that trusts the sessions. You cannot configure prefilter rules using the device
  manager.

## Configuring the Access Control Policy

Use the access control
policy to control access to network resources. The policy consists of a set of
ordered rules, which are evaluated from top to bottom. The rule applied to
traffic is the first one where all the traffic criteria are matched. If no
rules match the traffic, the default action shown at the bottom of the page is
applied.

To configure the
access control policy, select
Policies > Access
Control.

The access control
table lists all rules in order. For each rule:

* Click the
  > button next to the rule number in the left-most
  column to open the rule diagram. The diagram can help you visualize how the
  rule controls traffic. Click the button again to close the diagram.
* Most cells allow
  inline editing. For example, you can click the action to select a different
  one, or click a source network object to add or change the source criteria.
* To move a rule, hover over the rule until you get the move icon (![Move rule icon.](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/410001-420000/414001-415000/414046.jpg)),
  then click, drag, and drop the rule to the new location. You can also move a
  rule by editing it and selecting the new location in the
  Order list. It is critical that you put the
  rules in the order that you want them processed. Specific rules should be near
  the top, especially for rules that define exceptions to more general rules
* The right-most
  column contains the action buttons for a rule; mouse over the cell to see the
  buttons. You can edit (![edit icon](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/400001-410000/409001-410000/409815.jpg))
  or delete (![delete icon](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/400001-410000/409001-410000/409814.jpg))
  a rule.
* Click the Access Control Settings (![Gear/Settings button.](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/420001-430000/420001-421000/420147.jpg)) button to configure settings that apply to the access control policy, rather
  than to specific rules within the policy.
* Click the Toggle Hit Counts icon (![Toggle hit counts button.](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/430001-440000/432001-433000/432141.jpg)) above the table to add or remove the Hit Counts column in the table. The Hit Count column appears to the right of the Name
  column with the total hit count for the rule and the date and time of the last hit. The hit count information is fetched at
  the time you click the toggle button. Click the refresh icon (![Refresh hit count button.](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/430001-440000/432001-433000/432142.jpg)) to get the latest information.
* If any rules have problems, for example, because of removed or changed URL categories, click the See Problem Rules link next to the search box to filter the table to show only those rules. Please edit and correct (or delete) these rules,
  so that they will provide the service that you require.

The following topics
explain how to configure the policy.

* [Configuring the Default Action](#id_11412)
* [Configuring Access Control Policy Settings](#Cisco_Task_in_List_GUI.dita_179d5e33-2993-4e74-bffe-b87d45bd8142)
* [Configuring Access Control Rules](#task_68A29B520CFF46608A8E88D8DFE7AEC0)

### Configuring the Default Action

If a connection does
not match a specific access rule, it is handled by the default action for the
access control policy.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Select Policies > Access Control. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click anywhere in the Default Action field. |
| **Step 3** | Select the action to apply to matching traffic.   * Trust—Allow   traffic without further inspection of any kind. * Allow—Allow the   traffic subject to the intrusion policy. * Block—Drop the   traffic unconditionally. The traffic is not inspected. |
| **Step 4** | If the action is Allow, select an intrusion policy.  For an explanation of the policy options, see [Intrusion Policy Settings](#concept_990E998E30CF44F2BBE8D32F6D242E00). |
| **Step 5** | (Optional.) Configure logging for the default action.  You must enable logging for traffic that matches the default action to be included in dashboard data or Event Viewer. See [Logging Settings](#id_10392). |
| **Step 6** | Click OK. |

---

### Configuring Access Control Policy Settings

You can configure settings that apply to the access control policy, rather than to
specific rules within the policy.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Select Policy > Access Control. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click the Access Policy Settings (Gear/Settings button.) button. |
| **Step 3** | Configure the settings:   * TLS Server Identity Discovery—TLS 1.3 encrpyts most handshake messages, so certificate information is not readily available. For traffic encrypted with   TLS 1.3 to match access rules that use application or URL filtering, the system must have a clear-text certificate for the   server. If you enable this option, the system checks whether a certificate for the site is stored in cache based on the IP   address and Server Name Indication (SNI) in the client hello packet. If one is not available, the system uses a TLS 1.2 probe   to obtain the certicate, which can then be used for application/URL category and reputation identification. We recommend that   you enable this option to ensure encrypted connections are matched to the right access control rule. The setting obtains the   certificate only; the connection remains encrypted. Enabling this option is sufficient to obtain TLS 1.3 certificates; you   do not need to create a corresponding SSL decryption rule. However, the cached certificates are also used for more effective   decryption rule processing in addition to access control processing. * Reputation Enforcement on DNS Traffic—Enable   this option to apply your URL filtering category and reputation   rules to DNS lookup requests. If the fully-qualified domain name   (FQDN) in the lookup request has a category and reputation that you   are blocking, the system blocks the DNS reply. Because the user does   not receive a DNS resolution, the user cannot complete the   connection. Use this option to apply URL category and reputation   filtering to non-web traffic. For more information, see [DNS Request Filtering](#Cisco_Concept.dita_8ecc19cf-1d41-4741-82cd-1bf5661deb22). |
| **Step 4** | Click OK. |

---

### Configuring Access Control Rules

Use access control
rules to control access to network resources. Rules in the access control
policy are evaluated from top to bottom. The rule applied to traffic is the
first one where all the traffic criteria are matched.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Select Policies > Access Control. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Do any of the following:   * To create a new rule, click   the   + button. * To edit an existing rule,   click the edit icon (edit icon)   for the rule.   To delete a rule you no longer need, click the delete icon (delete icon) for the rule. |
| **Step 3** | In Order, select where you want to insert the rule in the ordered list of rules.  Rules are applied on a first-match basis, so you must ensure that rules with highly specific traffic matching criteria appear above policies that have more general criteria that would otherwise apply to the matching traffic.  The default is to add the rule to the end of the list. If you want to change a rule's location later, edit this option. |
| **Step 4** | In Title, enter a name for the rule.  The name cannot contain spaces. You can use alphanumeric characters and these special characters: + . \_ - |
| **Step 5** | Select the action to apply to matching traffic.   * Trust—Allow   traffic without further inspection of any kind. * Allow—Allow the   traffic subject to the intrusion and other inspection settings in the policy. * Block—Drop the   traffic unconditionally. The traffic is not inspected. |
| **Step 6** | Define the traffic matching criteria using any combination of the following tabs:   * Source/Destination—The   security zones (interfaces) through which the traffic passes, the IP   addresses or the country or continent (geographical location) for the IP   address, the security group tags (SGT)   assigned to the address, or the protocols and ports used in the   traffic. The default is any zone, address, geographical location, SGT, protocol, and port. See [Source/Destination Criteria](#concept_BA8B7882112F45E09AD00B341C64B871). * Application—The   application, or a filter that defines applications by type, category, tag,   risk, or business relevance. The default is any application. See [Application Criteria](#concept_1F51EAD7EE7D4107BCF4547CD8D0653B). * URL—The URL or URL category of a web or DNS   lookup request. The default is any URL. See [URL Criteria](#concept_885AAC35D2A54D34A1A3B602121818E0). * Users—The identity source, user or user group. Your identity policies determine whether user and group information is available for traffic matching.   You must configure identity policies to use this criteria. See [User Criteria](#id_12066).   To modify a condition, you click the + button within that condition, select the desired object or element, and click OK in the popup dialog box. If the criterion requires an object, you can click Create New Object if the object you require does not exist. Click the x for an object or element to remove it from the policy.  When adding conditions to access control rules, consider the following tips:   * You can   configure multiple conditions per rule. Traffic must match all the conditions   in the rule for the rule to apply to traffic. For example, you can use a single   rule to perform URL filtering for specific hosts or networks. * For each   condition in a rule, you can add up to 50 criteria. Traffic that matches any of   a condition's criteria satisfies the condition. For example, you can use a   single rule to apply application control for up to 50 applications or   application filters. Thus, there is an OR relationship among the items in a   single condition, but an AND relationship between condition types (for example,   between source/destination and application). * Some   features require that you enable the appropriate license. |
| **Step 7** | (Optional.) For policies that use the Allow action, you can configure further inspection on unencrypted traffic. Click one of the following links:   * Intrusion Policy—Select Intrusion Policy > On and select the intrusion inspection policy to inspect traffic   for intrusions and exploits. See [Intrusion Policy Settings](#concept_990E998E30CF44F2BBE8D32F6D242E00). * File Policy—Select the   file policy to inspect traffic for files that contain malware and for files   that should be blocked. See [File Policy Settings](#concept_AD893273F89D45FFA5846A9541E3084D). |
| **Step 8** | (Optional.) Configure logging for the rule.  By default, connection events are not generated for traffic that matches a rule, although file events are generated by default if you select a file policy. You can change this behavior. You must enable logging for traffic that matches the policy to be included in dashboard data or Event Viewer. See [Logging Settings](#id_10392).  Intrusion events are always generated for intrusion rules set to drop or alert regardless of the logging configuration on the matching access rule. |
| **Step 9** | Click OK. |

---

#### Source/Destination Criteria

The Source/Destination criteria of an access rule define the security zones (interfaces) through
which the traffic passes, the IP addresses or the country or continent (geographical
location) for the IP address, the security group
tags (SGT) assigned to the address, or the protocols and ports used in the
traffic. The default is any zone, address, geographical location, SGT, protocol, and port.

To modify a condition,
you click the
+ button within that condition, select the desired
object or element, and click
OK. If the criterion requires an object, you can
click
Create New
Object if the object you require does not
exist. Click the
x for an object or element to remove it from the
policy.

You can use the
following criteria to identify the source and destination to match in the rule.

Source Zones,
Destination Zones

The security
zone objects that define the interfaces through which the traffic passes. You
can define one, both, or neither criteria: any criteria not specified applies
to traffic on any interface.

* To match
  traffic leaving the device from an interface in the zone, add that zone to the
  Destination Zones.
* To match
  traffic entering the device from an interface in the zone, add that zone to the
  Source Zones.
* If you add
  both source and destination zone conditions to a rule, matching traffic must
  originate from one of the specified source zones and egress through one of the
  destination zones.

Use this
criteria when the rule should apply based on where the traffic enters or exits
the device. For example, if you want to ensure that all traffic going to inside
hosts gets intrusion inspection, you would select your inside zone as the
Destination Zones while leaving the source zone
empty. To implement intrusion filtering in the rule, the rule action must be
Allow, and you must select an intrusion policy in
the rule.

| **Note** | ---   You cannot mix passive and routed security zones in a single rule. In addition, you can specify passive security zones as source zones only, you cannot specify them as destination zones.   --- |
| --- | --- |

Source Networks,
Destination Networks

The network
objects or geographical locations that define the network addresses or
locations of the traffic.

* To match
  traffic from an IP address or geographical location, configure the
  Source Networks.
* To match traffic to an IP address or geographical location, configure the Destination Networks.
* If you add
  both source and destination network conditions to a rule, matching traffic must
  originate from one of the specified IP addresses and be destined for one of the
  destination IP addresses.

When you add
this criteria, you select from the following tabs:

* Network—Select the network objects or groups that define the source or destination IP addresses for the traffic you want to control.
  You can use objects that define the address using the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN); the address is determined through
  a DNS lookup.
* Geolocation—Select the geographical location to
  control traffic based on its source or destination country or continent.
  Selecting a continent selects all countries within the continent. Besides
  selecting geographical location directly in the rule, you can also select a
  geolocation object that you created to define the location. Using geographical
  location, you could easily restrict access to a particular country without
  needing to know all of the potential IP addresses used there.

  | **Note** | ---   To ensure that you are using up-to-date geographical location data to filter your traffic, Cisco strongly recommends that you regularly update the geolocation database (GeoDB).   --- |
  | --- | --- |

Source Ports,
Destination Ports/Protocols

The port objects
that define the protocols used in the traffic. For TCP/UDP, this can include
ports. For ICMP, it can include codes and types.

* To match
  traffic from a protocol or port, configure the
  Source Ports. Source ports can be TCP/UDP only.
* To match
  traffic to a protocol or port, configure the
  Destination Ports/Protocols. If you add only
  destination ports to a condition, you can add ports that use different
  transport protocols. ICMP and other non-TCP/UDP specifications are allowed in
  destination ports only; they are not allowed in source ports.
* To match
  traffic both originating from specific TCP/UDP ports and destined for specific
  TCP/UDP ports, configure both. If you add both source and destination ports to
  a condition, you can only add ports that share a single transport protocol, TCP
  or UDP. For example, you could target traffic from port TCP/80 to port
  TCP/8080.

Source SGT Groups, Destination SGT Groups

The Security Group Tag (SGT) group objects that identify the SGTs assigned to the traffic,
as downloaded from the Identity Services Engine (ISE). You can use these
objects only if you define an ISE identity source; otherwise, this section
will not appear. For detailed information on how to use SGTs for access
control, see [How to Control Network Access Using TrustSec Security Group Tags](#id_111477).

* To match traffic whose source has one of the SGT defined in the group, configure the
  Source SGT Groups.
* To match traffic to a destination that has one of the SGT defined in the group, configure
  the Destination SGT Groups.
* If you add both source and destination SGT conditions to a rule, matching traffic must
  originate from a source with one of the specified tags and be
  destined for one of the destination tags.

#### Application Criteria

The Application
criteria of an access rule defines the application used in an IP connection, or
a filter that defines applications by type, category, tag, risk, or business
relevance. The default is any application.

Although you can
specify individual applications in the rule, application filters simplify
policy creation and administration. For example, you could create an access
control rule that identifies and blocks all high risk, low business relevance
applications. If a user attempts to use one of those applications, the session
is blocked.

In addition, Cisco
frequently updates and adds additional application detectors via system and
vulnerability database (VDB) updates. Thus, a rule blocking high risk
applications can automatically apply to new applications without you having to
update the rule manually.

You can specify
applications and filters directly in the rule, or create application filter
objects that define those characteristics. The specifications are equivalent,
although using objects can make it easier to stay within the
50-items-per-criteria system limit if you are creating a complex rule.

To modify the
application and filters list, you click the
+ button within the condition, select the desired
applications or application filter objects, which are listed on separate tabs,
and click
OK in the popup dialog box. On either tab, you can
click
Advanced
Filter to select filter criteria or to help you search for specific
applications. Click the
x for an application, filter, or object to remove it
from the policy. Click the
Save As
Filter link to save the combined criteria that is not already an
object as a new application filter object.

| **Note** | ---   If a selected application was removed by a VDB update, “(Deprecated)” appears after the application name. You must remove these applications from the filter, or subsequent deployments and system software upgrades will be blocked.   --- |
| --- | --- |

You can use the
following
Advanced
Filter criteria to identify the application or filter to match in
the rule. These are the same elements used in application filter objects.

| **Note** | ---   Multiple selections within a single filter criteria have an OR relationship. For example, Risk is High OR Very High. The relationship between filters is AND, so Risk is High OR Very High, AND Business Relevance is Low OR Very Low. As you select filters, the list of applications in the display updates to show only those that meet the criteria. You can use these filters to help you find applications that you want to add individually, or to verify that you are selecting the desired filters to add to the rule.   --- |
| --- | --- |

Risks

The likelihood
that the application is used for purposes that might be against your
organization's security policy, from very low to very high.

Business
Relevance

The likelihood
that the application is used within the context of your organization's business
operations, as opposed to recreationally, from very low to very high.

Types

The type of
application:

* Application
  Protocol—Application protocols such as HTTP and SSH, which
  represent communications between hosts.
* Client
  Protocol—Clients such as web browsers and email clients, which
  represent software running on the host.
* Web
  Application—Web applications such as MPEG video and Facebook, which
  represent the content or requested URL for HTTP traffic.

Categories

A general
classification for the application that describes its most essential function.

Tags

Additional
information about the application, similar to category.

For encrypted
traffic, the system can identify and filter traffic using only the applications
tagged
 SSL
Protocol. Applications without this tag can only be detected in
unencrypted or decrypted traffic. Also, the system assigns the
decrypted traffic tag to applications that the
system can detect in decrypted traffic only, not encrypted or unencrypted.

Applications
List (bottom of the display)

This list
updates as you select filters from the options above the list, so you can see
the applications that currently match the filter. Use this list to verify that
your filter is targeting the desired applications when you intend to add filter
criteria to the rule. If your intention is to add specific applications, select
them from this list.

#### URL Criteria

The URL criteria of an
access rule defines the URL used in a web request, or the category to which the
requested URL belongs. For category matches, you can also specify the relative
reputation of sites to allow or block. The default is to allow all URLs.

If you enable DNS lookup request filtering, the category
and reputation settings also apply to the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) in the
lookup request. Only the category and reputation settings apply for DNS request
filtering. Manual URL filtering is ignored.

URL categories and reputations allow you to quickly create URL conditions for access control rules. For example, you could
block all Gambling sites, or untrusted Social Networking sites. If a user attempts to browse to any URL with that category and reputation combination, the session
is blocked.

Using category and
reputation data also simplifies policy creation and administration. It grants
you assurance that the system will control web traffic as expected. Finally,
because Cisco's threat intelligence is continually updated with new URLs, as
well as new categories and risks for existing URLs, you can ensure that the
system uses up-to-date information to filter requested URLs. Malicious sites
that represent security threats such as malware, spam, botnets, and phishing
may appear and disappear faster than you can update and deploy new policies.

To modify the URL
list, you click the
+ button within the condition and select the desired
categories or URLs using one of the following techniques. Click the
x for a category or object to remove it from the
policy.

URL Tab

Click
+, select URL objects or groups, and click
OK. You can click
Create
New URL if the object you require does not exist.

| **Note** | ---   Before configuring URL objects to target specific sites, carefully read the information on manual URL filtering.   --- |
| --- | --- |

Categories Tab

Click
+, select the desired categories, and click
OK.

For a description of the categories, see <https://www.talosintelligence.com/categories>.

The default is
to apply the rule to all URLs in each selected category regardless of
reputation. To limit the rule based on reputation, click the down arrow for
each category, deselect the
Any checkbox, and then use the
Reputation slider to choose the reputation level.
The left of the reputation slider indicates sites that will be allowed, the
right side are sites that will be blocked. How reputation is used depends on
the rule action:

* If the rule blocks or monitors web access, selecting a reputation level also selects all reputations more severe than that
  level. For example, if you configure a rule to block or monitor Questionable sites (level 2), it also automatically blocks or monitors Untrusted (level 1) sites.
* If the rule allows web access, selecting a reputation level also selects all reputations less severe than that level. For
  example, if you configure a rule to allow Favorable sites (level 4), it also automatically allows Trusted (level 5) sites.

Select the Include Sites with
Unknown Reputation option to have URLs with unknown
reputation included in the reputation match. New sites typically are
unrated, and there can be other reasons a site's reputation is unknown or
cannot be determined.

Check the Category for a URL

You can check on the category and reputation for a particular URL. Enter the URL in the URL to Check box and click Go. You will be taken to an external website to see the results. If you disagree with a categorization, click the Submit a URL Category Dispute link and let us know.

#### User Criteria

The User criteria of
an access rule defines the user or user group for an IP connection. You must
configure identity policies and the associated directory server to include user
or user group criteria in an access rule.

Your identity policies
determine whether user identity is collected for a particular connection. If
identity is established, the IP address of the host is associated with the
identified user. Thus, traffic whose source IP address is mapped to a user is
considered to be from that user. IP packets themselves do not include user
identity information, so this IP-address-to-user mapping is the best
approximation available.

Because you can add a
maximum of 50 users or groups to a rule, selecting groups usually makes more
sense than selecting individual users. For example, you could create a rule
allowing the Engineering group access to a development network, and create a
subsequent rule that denies all other access to the network. Then, to make the
rule apply to new engineers, you only need to add the engineer to the
Engineering group in the directory server.

You an also select identity sources to apply to all users within that source. Thus, if you support multiple Active Directory
domains, you can provide differential access to resources based on the domain.

To modify the users list, you click the + button within the condition and select the desired identities using one of the following techniques. Click the x for an identity to remove it from the policy.

* Identity Sources—Select an identity source, such as an AD realm or the local user database, to apply the rule to all users obtained from the
  selected sources. If the realm you need does not yet exist, click Create New Identity Realm and create it now.
* Groups—Select the desired user groups. Groups are available only if you configure groups in the directory server. If you select
  a group, the rule applies to any member of the group, including subgroups. If you want to treat a sub-group differently, you
  need to create a separate access rule for the sub-group and place it above the rule for the parent group in the access control
  policy.
* Users—Select individual users. The user name is prefixed with the identity source, such as Realm\username.

  There are some built-in users under the Special-Identities-Realm:

  + Failed
    Authentication—The user was prompted to authenticate, but failed to
    enter a valid username/password pair within the maximum number of allowed
    attempts. Failure to authenticate does not itself prevent the user from
    accessing the network, but you can write an access rule to limit network access
    for these users.
  + Guest—Guest users
    are like Failed Authentication users, except that your identity rule is
    configured to call these users Guest. Guest users were prompted to authenticate
    and failed to do so within the maximum number of attempts.
  + No Authentication
    Required—The user was not prompted to authentication, because the
    user's connections matched identity rules that specified no authentication.
  + Unknown—There is
    no user mapping for the IP address, and there is no record of failed
    authentication yet. Typically, this means that no HTTP traffic has yet been
    seen from that address.

#### Intrusion Policy Settings

Cisco delivers several intrusion policies with the firewall system. The several intrusion policies delivered by Cisco Cisco Talos Intelligence Group
(Talos) are designed by the Cisco.Talos set the intrusion and preprocessor rule states and advanced settings. For access control
rules that allow traffic, you can select an intrusion policy to inspect traffic for intrusions and exploits. An intrusion
policy examines decoded packets for attacks based on patterns, and can block or alter malicious traffic.

When running Snort 2, these are the only policies available and you cannot modify
them. However, you can change the
action to take for a given rule, as described in [Changing Intrusion Rule Actions (Snort 2)](fptd-fdm-intrusion.html#task_4D5DD40DDCE0426C8846E5684287E63B).

When running Snort 3, you can select one of these policies, or you can create your
own intrusion policies.

To enable intrusion inspection, select Intrusion Policy > On and select the desired policy. Click the info icon for a policy in
the drop-down list to see a description for each policy.

For more information on the pre-defined policies, see [System-Defined Network Analysis and Intrusion Policies](fptd-fdm-intrusion.html#concept_D681E8E136034A9AA863E8389C2A6C03).

#### File Policy Settings

Use file policies to detect malicious software, or *malware*, using malware defense. You can also use file policies to perform file control, which allows control over all files of a
specific type regardless of whether the files contain malware.

Malware defense uses the Secure Malware Analytics
Cloud to retrieve dispositions for possible malware detected in network traffic, and to obtain local malware analysis and file
pre-classification updates. The management interface must have a path to the Internet to reach the Secure Malware Analytics
Cloud and perform malware lookups. When the device detects an eligible file, it uses the file's SHA-256 hash value to query the
Secure Malware Analytics
Cloud for the file's disposition. The possible dispositions are:

* Malware—The Secure Malware Analytics
  Cloud categorized the file as malware. An archive file (e.g. a zip file) is marked as malware if any file within it is malware.
* Clean—The Secure Malware Analytics
  Cloud categorized the file as clean, containing no malware. An archive file is marked as clean if all files within it are clean.
* Unknown—The Secure Malware Analytics
  Cloud has not assigned a disposition to the file yet. An archive file is marked as unknown if any file within it is unknown.
* Unavailable—The system could not query the Secure Malware Analytics
  Cloud to determine the file's disposition. You may see a small percentage of events with this disposition; this is expected behavior.
  If you see a number of "unavailable" events in succession, ensure that the Internet connection for the management address
  is functioning correctly.

##### Available File Policies

You can select one
of the following file policies:

* None—Do not
  evaluate transmitted files for malware and do no file-specific blocking. Select
  this option for rules where file transmissions are trusted or where they are
  unlikely (or impossible), or for rules where you are confident your application
  or URL filtering adequately protects your network.
* Block Malware All—Query the Secure Malware Analytics
  Cloud to determine if files traversing your network contain malware, then block files that represent threats.
* Cloud Lookup All—Query the Secure Malware Analytics
  Cloudto obtain and log the disposition of files traversing your network while still allowing their transmission.
* (Custom File Policy)—You can create your own file policies using the threat
  defense API filepolicies resource, and the other FileAndMalwarePolicies resources (such as filetypes, filetypecategories, ampcloudconfig,
  ampservers, and ampcloudconnections). After you create the policies, and deploy changes, you can select your policies when
  editing an access control rule in the device
  manager. The policy description appears below the policy when you select it.

#### Logging Settings

The logging settings
for an access rule determine whether connection events are issued for traffic
that matches the rule. You must enable logging to see events related to the
rule in the Event Viewer. You must also enable logging for matching traffic to
be reflected in the various dashboards you can use to monitor the system.

You should log
connections according to the security and compliance needs of your
organization. If your goal is to limit the number of events you generate and
improve performance, only enable logging for the connections critical to your
analysis. However, if you want a broad view of your network traffic for
profiling purposes, you can enable logging for additional connections.

| **Caution** | ---   Logging blocked TCP connections during a Denial of Service (DoS) attack can affect system performance and overwhelm the database with multiple similar events. Before you enable logging for a Block rule, consider whether the rule is for an Internet-facing interface or other interface vulnerable to DoS attack.   --- |
| --- | --- |

You can configure the
following logging actions.

Select Log Action

You can select
one of the following actions:

* Log at Beginning and End of
  Connection—Issue events at the start and end of a connection.
  Because end-of-connection events contain everything that start-of-connection
  events contain, plus all of the information that could be gleaned during the
  connection, Cisco recommends that you do not select this option for traffic
  that you are allowing. Logging both events can impact system performance.
  However, this is the only option allowed for blocked traffic.
* Log at End of
  Connection—Select this option if you want to enable connection
  logging at the end of the connection, which is recommended for allowed or
  trusted traffic.
* No Logging at
  Connection—Select this option to disable logging for the rule. This
  is the default.

| **Note** | ---   When an intrusion policy invoked by an access control rule detects an intrusion and generates an intrusion event, the system automatically logs the end of the connection where the intrusion occurred, regardless of the logging configuration of the rule. For connections where an intrusion was blocked, the action for the connection in the connection log is Block, with a reason of Intrusion Block, even though to perform intrusion inspection you must use an Allow rule.   --- |
| --- | --- |

File Events

Select
Log
Files if you want to enable logging of prohibited files or malware
events. You must select a file policy in the rule to configure this option. The
option is enabled by default if you select a file policy for the rule. Cisco
recommends you leave this option enabled.

When the system detects a prohibited file, it automatically logs one of the following types of event:

* *File events*, which represent detected or blocked files, including malware files.
* *Malware events*, which represent detected or blocked malware files only.
* *Retrospective malware events*, which are generated when the malware disposition for a previously detected file changes.

For connections
where a file was blocked, the action for the connection in the connection log
is
Block even though to perform file and malware
inspection you must use an Allow rule. The connection's Reason is either
File
Monitor (a file type or malware was detected), or
Malware Block or
File
Block (a file was blocked).

Send Connection
Events To

If you want to
send a copy of the events to an external syslog server, select the server
object that defines the syslog server. If the required object does not already
exist, click
Create
New Syslog Server and create it. (To disable logging to a syslog
server, select
Any from the server list.)

Because event
storage on the device is limited, sending events to an external syslog server
can provide more long term storage and enhance your event analysis.

This setting applies to connection events only. To send intrusion events to syslog, configure the server in the intrusion
policy settings. To send file/malware events to syslog, configure the server on Device > System Settings > Logging Settings.

## Monitoring Access Control Policies

The following topics explain how you can monitor the access control policy.

* [Monitoring Access Control Statistics in the Dashboards](#id_92397)
* [Examining Rule Hit Counts](#id_92394)
* [Monitoring Syslog Messages for Access Control](#id_92396)
* [Monitoring Access Control Policies in the CLI](#id_92395)

### Monitoring Access Control Statistics in the Dashboards

Most of the data on the Monitoring dashboards are directly related to your access control policy. See [Monitoring Traffic and System Dashboards](fptd-fdm-monitor.html#id_10212).

* Monitoring > Access And SI Rules shows the most-hit access rules and Security Intelligence rule-equivalents and related statistics.
* You can find general statistics on the Network Overview, Destinations, and Zones, dashboards.
* You can find URL filtering results on the URL Categories and Destinations dashboards. You must have at least one URL filtering policy to see any information on the URL Categories dashboard.
* You can find application filtering results on the Applications and Web Applications dashboards.
* You can find user-based statistics on the Users dashboard. You must implement identity policies to collect user information.
* You can find intrusion policy statistics on the Attackers and Targets dashboards. You must apply an intrusion policy to at least one access control rule to see any information on these dashboards.
* You can find file policy and malware filtering statistics on the File Logs and Malware dashboards. You must apply a file policy to at least one access control rule to see any information on these dashboards.
* Monitoring > Events also shows events for connections and data related to the access control rules.

### Examining Rule Hit Counts

You can view the hit count for each access control rule. The hit count indicates how often connections matched the rule. You
can use this information to identify your most active rules and the rules that are less active.

The count persists through reboots and upgrades.

You can also see rule hit count information in the device CLI using the show rule hits  command.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Select Policies > Access Control. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click the Toggle Hit Counts icon (Toggle hit counts button.).  The Hit Count column appears to the right of the Name column with the total hit count for the rule and the date and time of the last hit. The hit count information is fetched at the time you click the toggle button.  You can do the following with the hit count information:   * To the left of the button, you will see information on when the hit count was last updated. Click the refresh icon (Refresh hit count button.) to get the latest numbers. * To open a detailed view of the hit count for a given rule, click the hit count number in the table to open the Hit Count dialog   box. The hit count information includes the number of hits and the date and time of the last connection that matched the rule.   Click the Reset link to reset the counter to zero.  If you want to reset the hit count for all rules at once, open an SSH session to the device and issue the clear rule hits  command. * Click the Toggle Hit Counts icon (Toggle hit counts button.) again to remove the hit count column from the table. |

---

### Monitoring Syslog Messages for Access Control

In addition to seeing events in the Event Viewer, you can configure access control rules, intrusion policies, file/malware policies, and Security Intelligence policies to send events to a syslog server. The events use the following message IDs:

* 430001—Intrusion event.
* 430002—Connection event logged at the beginning of a connection.
* 430003—Connection event logged at the end of a connection.
* 430004—File events.
* 430005—Malware events.

### Monitoring Access Control Policies in the CLI

You can also open the CLI console or log into the device CLI and use the following commands to get more detailed information about access control policies and
statistics.

* show access-control-config  displays summary information about the access control rules along with per-rule hit counts.
* show access-list  displays the access control lists (ACLs) that were generated from the access control rules. The ACLs provide an initial filter
  and attempt to provide quick decisions whenever possible, so that connections that should be dropped do not need to be inspected
  (and thus consume resources unnecessarily). This information includes hit counts.
* show rule hits displays consolidated hit counts that are more accurate than the counts shown with show access-control-config and show access-list. If you want to reset the hit count, use the clear rule hits command.
* show snort statistics  displays information about the Snort inspection engine, which is the main inspector. Snort implements application filtering,
  URL filtering, intrusion protection, and file and malware filtering.
* show conn  displays information about the connections currently established through the interfaces.
* show traffic  displays statistics about traffic flowing through each interface.
* show ipv6 traffic  displays statistics about IPv6 traffic flowing through the device.

Following are additional examples.

* [How to Control Network Access Using TrustSec Security Group Tags](#id_111477)

### How to Control Network Access Using TrustSec Security Group Tags

If you use Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) to define and use security group tags (SGT) for classifying traffic in a Cisco
TrustSec network, you can write access control rules that use SGT as matching criteria. Thus, you can block or allow access
based on security group membership rather than IP addresses directly.

* [About Security Group Tags (SGT)](#id_111478)
* [Configure Access Control Based on Security Group Tag (SGT)](#Cisco_Task_in_List_GUI.dita_96d60f09-ac6d-4d6a-b99d-2c014e0a7927)

#### About Security Group Tags (SGT)

In Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE), you can create security group tags (SGT) and assign host or network IP addresses
to each tag. You can also assign SGTs to user accounts, and the SGT is assigned to the user's traffic. If the switches and
routers in the network are configured to do so, these tags then get assigned to packets as they enter the network controlled
by ISE, the Cisco TrustSec cloud.

When you configure an ISE identity source in the device
manager, the threat
defense system automatically downloads the list of SGTs from ISE. You can then use SGT as a traffic matching condition in access
control rules.

For example, you could create a Production Users tag, and associate the 192.168.7.0/24 network to the tag. This would be appropriate
if you use that network for user end points, such as laptops, Wi-Fi clients, and so forth. You could create a separate tag
for Production Servers, and assign the IP addresses of the relevant servers or subnet to the tag. Then, in the threat
defense, you could allow or block access from the user network to the production servers based on the tag. If you later alter the
host or network addresses associated with the tag in ISE, you do not need to change the access control rule defined for the
threat
defense device.

When the threat
defense evaluates SGT as a traffic matching criteria for an access control rule, it uses the following priority:

1. The source SGT tag defined in the packet, if any. For the SGT tag to be in the
   packet, the switches and routers in the network must be configured to add them.
   See the ISE documentation for information on how to implement this method.
2. The SGT assigned to the user session, as downloaded from the ISE session directory. You need to enable the option to listen
   to session directory information for this kind of SGT matching, but this option is on by default when you first create the
   ISE identity source. The SGT can be matched to source or destination. Although not required, you would also normally set up
   a passive authentication identity rule, using the ISE identity source along with an AD realm, to collect user identity information.
3. The SGT-to-IP address mapping downloaded using SXP. If the IP address is within the range for an SGT, then the traffic matches
   the access control rule that uses the SGT. The SGT can be matched to source or destination.

   ISE uses the Security-group eXchange Protocol (SXP) to propagate the IP-to-SGT mapping database to network devices. When you
   configure the threat
   defense device to use an ISE server, you must turn on the option to listen to the SXP topic from ISE. Thus, the threat
   defense device learns about the security group tags and mappings directly from ISE, and is notified whenever ISE publishes updated
   security group tags and mappings. This ensures that the list of security group tags and mappings stay up-to-date on the device,
   so that the threat
   defense can effectively enforce the policy defined in ISE.

#### Configure Access Control Based on Security Group Tag (SGT)

To configure access control rules that use security group tags (SGT) as matching
criteria, you must first configure the device to obtain the SGT mappings from an ISE
server.

The following procedure explains the end-to-end process based on the assumption that
you want to get all mappings that are defined in ISE, including SGT-to-IP address
mappings published through SXP. Alternatively:

* If you want to use SGT information in the packets only, and not use mappings
  downloaded from ISE, simply create SGT group dynamic objects and use them as
  source SGT criteria in access control rules. Note that in this case, you can
  use SGT tags as a source condition only; these tags will never match
  destination criteria.
* If you want to use SGT in packets plus user session SGT mappings only, you do
  not need to turn on the option to subscribe to the SXP topic in the ISE
  identity source, nor do you need to configure ISE to publish SXP mappings.
  You can use this information for both source and destination matching
  conditions.

##### Before you begin

The assumption here is that you have already configured Cisco TrustSec in your
network, and you are simply adding the threat
defense device as a policy enforcement point. If you have not deployed Cisco TrustSec,
please start with ISE and configure your network, then return to this procedure.
Explaining Cisco TrustSec is outside the scope of this document.

##### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Ensure that SGTs are defined, that ISE is configured correctly to publish the SXP topic, and that any needed static mappings are in place.  See [Configure Security Groups and SXP Publishing in ISE](#id_111604). |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Update the Identity Services Engine object to listen to the SXP topic.  You can use ISE to obtain user session SGT mappings, static SGT-to-IP address mappings through SXP, or both. By default, when you configure the ISE identity source, it obtains user session mappings only; you must turn on the option to listen to the SXP topic from ISE.   1. Choose Objects > Identity Sources. 2. Edit the ISE object. If you have not configured one yet, click + > Identity Services Engine and see [Configure Identity Services Engine](fptd-fdm-identity-sources.html#id_71555). 3. Under Subscribe To, select SXP    Topic.  Ensure that Session Directory Topic is also    selected if you are using passive authentication or want user-to-SGT    mappings.     Subscribe to ISE SXP topic. 4. Click OK. |
| **Step 3** | Deploy your changes and wait for the system to download tags and mappings from ISE.  After you configure the ISE identity source and deploy changes, the system retrieves security group tag (SGT) information from the ISE server. The download will not happen until after you deploy changes. |
| **Step 4** | Create the SGT group objects that are required for your access control rules.  You cannot use the information retrieved from ISE directly in an access control rule. Instead, you need to create SGT groups, which refer to the downloaded SGT information. Your SGT groups can refer to more than one SGT, so you can apply policy based on relevant collections of tags if that is appropriate.  The number and contents of the objects depend on the access control rules that you intend to write. Repeat the following process to create all the objects that you need.   1. Choose Objects > SGT Groups. 2. Click + to add a new object, or edit an existing    object. 3. For new objects, enter a name and optionally a description. 4. Under Tags, click + and    select all the tags that should be included in the group.     SGT group dynamic object. 5. Click OK. |
| **Step 5** | Create access control rules that use the SGT group objects.  As an example, the following rule allows traffic from production users to production servers. The rule depends completely on SGT; it is not limited by source/destination interface or any other criteria. Thus, the rule will dynamically apply to traffic as it comes from different interfaces, and as you change security group membership in ISE. If the packet does not explicitly contain a source SGT, source/destination matching will be based on the packet IP addresses compared to the SGT-to-IP address mappings obtained from user session information or from SXP-published mappings.   1. Choose Policies > Access Control. 2. Click + to create a new rule, or edit an    existing rule. 3. Enter a rule name and select Allow as the    action. 4. On the Source/Destination tab, click    + under Source > SGT Groups and select the object you created for production    users. 5. On the Source/Destination tab, click    + under Destination > SGT Groups, and select the object you created for production    servers. 6. Configure other options as needed. For example, you can enable logging    and apply an intrusion policy. 7. Click OK. |
| **Step 6** | Deploy the configuration. |

##### Configure Security Groups and SXP Publishing in ISE

There is a lot of configuration that you must do in Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) to create the TrustSec policy and
security group tags (SGT). Please look at the ISE documentation for more complete information on implementing TrustSec.

The following procedure picks out the highlights of the core settings you must configure in ISE for the threat
defense device to be able to download and apply static SGT-to-IP address mappings, which can then be used for source and destination
SGT matching in access control rules. See the ISE documentation for detailed information.

The screen shots in this procedure are based on ISE 2.4. The exact paths to these
features might change in subsequent releases, but the concepts and requirements will
be the same. Although ISE 2.4 or later is recommended, and preferably 2.6 or later,
the configuration should work starting with ISE 2.2 patch 1.

###### Before you begin

You must have the ISE Plus license to publish SGT-to-IP address static mappings and
to get user session-to-SGT mappings so that the threat
defense device can receive them.

###### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Choose Work Centers > TrustSec > Settings > SXP Settings, and select the Publish SXP Bindings on PxGrid option.  This option makes ISE send the SGT mappings out using SXP. You must select this option for the threat defense device to “hear” anything from listing to the SXP topic. This option must be selected for the threat defense device to get static SGT-to-IP address mapping information. It is not necessary if you simply want to use SGT tags defined in the packets, or SGTs that are assigned to a user session. Turn on Publish SXP Bindings on PxGrid option in ISE. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Choose Work Centers > TrustSec > SXP > SXP Devices, and add a device.  This does not have to be a real device, you can even use the management IP address of the threat defense device. The table simply needs at least one device to induce ISE to publish the static SGT-to-IP address mappings. This step is not necessary if you simply want to use SGT tags defined in the packets, or SGTs that are assigned to a user session. Add an SXP device in ISE. |
| **Step 3** | Choose Work Centers > TrustSec > Components > Security Groups and verify there are security group tags defined. Create new ones as necessary.  Configure security group tags (SGT) in ISE. |
| **Step 4** | Choose Work Centers > TrustSec > Components > IP SGT Static Mapping and map host and network IP addresses to the security group tags.  This step is not necessary if you simply want to use SGT tags defined in the packets, or SGTs that are assigned to a user session. Configure IP to SGT static mappings in ISE. |

| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: Low C: High C: None  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: Low A: High A: None  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 8.6 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Unproven   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Not Defined  RC: Confirmed   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 8.6 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High  CR: Not Defined   Select Confidentiality Requirement Parameters  Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Select Integrity Requirement Parameters  Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High  AR: Not Defined   Select Availability Requirement Parameters  Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Vector Parameters  Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Complexity Parameters  Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Select Modified Privileges Required Parameters  Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Select Modified User Interaction Parameters  Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Select Modified Scope Parameters  Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Select Modified Confidentiality Parameters  Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Select Modified Integrity Parameters  Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined   Select Modified Availability Parameters    Environmental Score: 8.6 |

# **Cisco Secure Firewall ASA Compatibility**

This document lists the Secure Firewall ASA software and
hardware compatibility and requirements.

## ASA and ASDM Compatibility Per Model

This section lists ASA and ASDM compatibility per model.

| **Note** | ---   For guidance on security issues on the ASA, and which releases contain fixes for each issue, see the [ASA Security Advisories](https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x).   --- |
| --- | --- |

### ASA 9.22

Releases in **bold** are the recommended versions.

| **Note** | ---  * ASA 9.20(x) was the final version for the Firepower 2100 series. * ASDM versions are backwards compatible with all previous ASA versions, unless   otherwise stated. For example, ASDM 7.22(1) can manage an ASA 5516-X on ASA   9.10(1). * New ASA versions require the coordinating ASDM version or a later version; you cannot   use an old version of ASDM with a new version of ASA. For example, you cannot use ASDM   7.20 with ASA 9.22. For ASA maintenance releases and interims, you can continue to use   the current ASDM version, unless otherwise stated. For example, you can use ASA   9.22(1.2) with ASDM 7.22(1). If an ASA maintenance release has significant new   features, then usually there will be a new ASDM version required.  --- |
| --- | --- |

### ASA 9.20 and 9.19

Releases in **bold** are the recommended versions.

| **Note** | ---  * ASA 9.20(x) was the final version for the Firepower 2100 series. * ASA 9.18(x) was the final version for the Firepower 4110, 4120, 4140, 4150, and   Security Modules SM-24, SM-36, and SM-44 for the Firepower 9300. * ASDM versions are backwards compatible with all previous ASA versions, unless   otherwise stated. For example, ASDM 7.19(1) can manage an ASA 5516-X on ASA   9.10(1). See the following   exceptions:    + For the Firepower 1010E, ASDM 7.19(1) is not supported. You must use 7.19(1.90)+     or 7.18(2.1). * New ASA versions require the coordinating ASDM version or a later version; you cannot   use an old version of ASDM with a new version of ASA. For example, you cannot use ASDM   7.18 with ASA 9.19. For ASA maintenance releases and interims, you can continue to use   the current ASDM version, unless otherwise stated. For example, you can use ASA   9.20(1.5) with ASDM 7.20(1). If an ASA maintenance release has significant new   features, then usually there will be a new ASDM version required.  --- |

### ASA 9.18 to 9.17

Releases in **bold** are the recommended versions.

| **Note** | ---  * ASA 9.16(x) was the final version for the ASA 5506-X, 5506H-X, 5506W-X, 5508-X, and   5516-X. * ASDM versions are backwards compatible with all previous ASA versions, unless   otherwise stated. For example, ASDM 7.17(1) can manage an ASA 5516-X on ASA   9.10(1). See the following   exceptions:    + For the Firepower 1010E, ASDM 7.19(1) is not supported. You must use 7.19(1.90)+     or 7.18(2.1). * New ASA versions require the coordinating ASDM version or a later version; you cannot   use an old version of ASDM with a new version of ASA. For example, you cannot use ASDM   7.17 with ASA 9.18. For ASA maintenance releases and interims, you can continue to use   the current ASDM version, unless otherwise stated. For example, you can use ASA   9.17(1.2) with ASDM 7.17(1). If an ASA maintenance release has significant new   features, then usually there will be a new ASDM version required. * ASA 9.17(1.13) and 9.18(2) and later requires ASDM 7.18(1.152) or later. The ASA now   validates whether the ASDM image is a Cisco digitally signed image. If you try to run   an older ASDM image than 7.18(1.152) with an ASA version with this fix, ASDM will be   blocked and the message “%ERROR: Signature not valid for file disk0:/<filename>”   will be displayed at the ASA CLI. ([CSCwb05291](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwb05291),   [CSCwb05264](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwb05264))  --- |

### ASA 9.16 to 9.15

Releases in **bold** are the recommended versions.

| **Note** | ---  * ASA 9.16(x) was the final version for the ASA 5506-X, 5506H-X, 5506W-X, 5508-X, and   5516-X. * ASA 9.14(x) was the final version for the ASA 5525-X, 5545-X, and 5555-X. * ASDM versions are backwards compatible with all previous ASA versions, unless   otherwise stated. For example, ASDM 7.15(1) can manage an ASA 5516-X on ASA   9.10(1). * New ASA versions require the coordinating ASDM version or a later version; you cannot   use an old version of ASDM with a new version of ASA. For example, you cannot use ASDM   7.15 with ASA 9.16. For ASA maintenance releases and interims, you can continue to use   the current ASDM version, unless otherwise stated. For example, you can use ASA   9.16(1.15) with ASDM 7.16(1). If an ASA maintenance release has significant new   features, then usually there will be a new ASDM version required. * ASA 9.16(3.19) and later requires ASDM 7.18(1.152) or later. The ASA now validates   whether the ASDM image is a Cisco digitally signed image. If you try to run an older   ASDM image than 7.18(1.152) with an ASA version with this fix, ASDM will be blocked   and the message “%ERROR: Signature not valid for file disk0:/<filename>” will be   displayed at the ASA CLI.

### ASA 9.14 to 9.13

Releases in **bold** are the recommended versions.

| **Note** | ---  * ASA 9.14(x) was the final version for the ASA 5525-X, 5545-X, and 5555-X. * ASA 9.12(x) was the final version for the ASA 5512-X, 5515-X, 5585-X, and ASASM. * ASDM versions are backwards compatible with all previous ASA versions, unless   otherwise stated. For example, ASDM 7.13(1) can manage an ASA 5516-X on ASA 9.10(1).   ASDM 7.13(1) and ASDM 7.14(1) did not support ASA 5512-X, 5515-X, 5585-X, and ASASM;   you must upgrade to ASDM 7.13(1.101) or 7.14(1.48) to restore ASDM support. * New ASA versions require the coordinating ASDM version or a later version; you cannot   use an old version of ASDM with a new version of ASA. For example, you cannot use ASDM   7.13 with ASA 9.14. For ASA maintenance releases and interims, you can continue to use   the current ASDM version, unless otherwise stated. For example, you can use ASA   9.14(1.2) with ASDM 7.14(1). If an ASA maintenance release has significant new   features, then usually there will be a new ASDM version required. * ASA 9.14(4.14) and later requires ASDM 7.18(1.152) or later. The ASA now validates   whether the ASDM image is a Cisco digitally signed image.

For ASA and VPN compatibility, see [Supported VPN Platforms, Cisco ASA 5500 Series](https://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/security/asa/compatibility/asa-vpn-compatibility.html).

## Firepower 4100/9300 Compatibility with ASA and Threat Defense

For the Firepower 4100/9300, you must maintain compatibility between FXOS and all ASA and
threat
defense logical devices. Upgrade FXOS before you upgrade the sofware. The **bold** versions
the the following table are specially-qualified (enhanced testing) companion releases. Use
these combinations whenever
possible.

Note that for other device models, the FXOS compatibility work is done for you. In most
cases, upgrading the software automatically upgrades
FXOS.
For the Secure Firewall 3100/4200 in multi-instance mode, the management center guides you through upgrading FXOS and then threat
defense.

To upgrade:

* FXOS: From FXOS 2.2.2 and later, you can upgrade directly to
  any higher version. When upgrading from versions earlier than 2.2.2, you need to
  upgrade to each intermediate version. Note that you cannot upgrade FXOS to a version
  that does not support your current logical device version. You will need to upgrade in
  steps: upgrade FXOS to the highest version that supports your current logical device;
  then upgrade your logical device to the highest version supported with that FXOS
  version. For example, if you want to upgrade from FXOS 2.2/ASA 9.8 to FXOS 2.13/ASA
  9.19, you would have to perform the following upgrades:

  1. FXOS 2.2→FXOS 2.11 (the highest version that supports 9.8)
  2. ASA 9.8→ASA 9.17 (the highest version supported by 2.11)
  3. FXOS 2.11→FXOS 2.13
  4. ASA 9.17→ASA 9.19
* Threat Defense: Interim upgrades may be required for threat
  defense, in addition to the FXOS requirements above. For the exact upgrade path, refer to the
  [management center upgrade guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/security/defense-center/products-installation-guides-list.html) for your version.
* ASA: ASA lets you upgrade directly from your current version to any higher version,
  noting the FXOS requirements above.

| **Note** | ---   FXOS 2.8(1.125)+ and later versions do not support ASA 9.14(1) or 9.14(1.10) for ASA SNMP polls and traps; you must use 9.14(1.15)+. Other releases, such as 9.13 or 9.12, are not affected.   --- |

## Cisco Defense Orchestrator (CDO) Compatibility with the ASA

CDO can manage all platforms running ASA 8.4 and later (see [ASA and ASDM Compatibility Per Model](#id_65776)), except for the ASA Services Module (ASASM), which is not
supported by CDO.

CDO can onboard an ASA running ASA 8.3 but cannot deploy changes to it or manage it
in any other way. Support is "read-only."

CDO does not support management of the ASA FirePOWER module, which runs a different
operating system from ASA. You can still use the ASA FirePOWER module in your
system, but you need to manage it separately with Firepower Management Center or
ASDM.

There may be a CDO feature that does not support all versions of ASA, such as ASA
upgrades from pre-9.12 versions. In those cases, the CDO documentation will list any
version exceptions with the prerequisites for that feature.

## ASA REST API Compatibility

This section lists ASA REST API and ASA compatibility.

| **Note** | ---   The REST API is not supported on newer hardware models and is no longer being developed. We recommend that you instead use the ASA HTTP interface for automation. See [Cisco Secure Firewall ASA HTTP Interface for Automation](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/misc/http-interface/asa-http-interface.html).   --- |
| --- | --- |

The ASA REST API is supported only on the following models starting with 9.3(2) and
ending with 9.16:

* ASA
  Virtual
* Firepower 9300
* ISA 3000
* Firepower 4110, 4120, 4140, 4150
* ASA 5585-X
* ASA 5525-X, 5545-X, 5555-X
* ASA 5512-X, 5515-X
* ASA 5506-X, 5506H-X, 5506W-X, 5508-X, 5516-X

  | **Note** | ---   The ASA 5506-X series does not support the REST API if you are running the FirePOWER module Version 6.0 or later. Disable the ASA REST API using the **no rest-api agent** command.   --- |
  | --- | --- |

## Firepower 2100 Network Module Compatibility

| **Note** | ---   If a network module is listed for multiple Firepower models, and the part number only differs in the model number (FPR*X*K-NM-*module*), then that module is compatible with the other Firepower models. For example, the FPR9K-NM-6X10SR-F module is compatible on the Firepower 2100 (FPR2K-NM-6X10SR-F) and Firepower 4100 (FPR4K-NM-6X10SR-F). See the [FXOS compatibility guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/fxos/compatibility/fxos-compatibility.html) for information about Firepower 4100 and 9300 network modules.   --- |

## ASA and Threat Defense Clustering External Hardware Support

Clustering will work with both Cisco and non-Cisco switches from other major
switching vendors with no known interoperability issues if they comply with the
following requirements and recommendations. Clustering is compatible with
technologies such as vPC (Nexus), VSS (Catalyst), and StackWise & StackWise
Virtual (Catalyst).

### Switch Requirements

* All third party switches must be compliant to the IEEE standard (802.3ad) Link Aggregation Control Protocol.
* EtherChannel bundling must be completed within 45 seconds when connected to Firepower devices and 33 seconds when connected
  to ASA devices.
* On the cluster control link, the switch must provide fully unimpeded unicast and broadcast connectivity at Layer 2 between
  all cluster members.
* On the cluster control link, the switch must not impose any limitations on IP addressing or the packet format above Layer
  2 headers.
* On the cluster control link, the switch interfaces must support jumbo frames and be configurable for an MTU above 1600.

### Switch Recommendations

* The switch should provide uniform traffic distribution over the EtherChannel's individual links.
* The switch should have an EtherChannel load-balancing algorithm that provides traffic symmetry.
* The EtherChannel load balance hash algorithm should be configurable using the 5-tuple, 4-tuple, or 2-tuple to calculate the
  hash.

| **Note** | ---   For the Firepower 9300 cluster, intra-chassis clustering can operate with any switch because Firepower 9300-to-switch connections use standard interface types.   --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---   Some switches, such as the Nexus series, do not support LACP rate fast when performing in-service software upgrades (ISSUs), so we do not recommend using ISSUs with clustering.   --- |
| --- | --- |

## **ASA and Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) Compatibility**

The platforms supported include:

* ASA 5525-X, 5545-X, and 5555-X (8.6(x)—9.14(x))
* ASA 5512-X, 5515-X (8.6(x)—9.12(x))
* ASA 5585-X (8.4(x)—9.12(x))
* ASAv (9.2(x) and newer)

# Security Intelligence

The Security Intelligence policy
gives you an early opportunity to drop unwanted traffic based on
source/destination IP address or destination URL. The following topics explain
how to implement Security Intelligence.

## About Security Intelligence

The Security Intelligence policy gives you an early opportunity to drop unwanted traffic based on
source/destination IP address or destination URL. The system drops this unwanted traffic
before evaluating it with the access control policy, thus reducing the amount of system
resources used.

You can block traffic based on the following:

* Cisco Talos Intelligence Group
  (Talos) feeds—Talos provides access to regularly updated security intelligence feeds. Sites representing security threats such as malware, spam,
  botnets, and phishing appear and disappear faster than you can update and deploy custom configurations. The system downloads
  feed updates regularly, and thus new threat intelligence is available without requiring you to redeploy the configuration.

  | **Note** | ---   Talos feeds are updated by default every hour. You can change the update frequency, and even update the feeds on demand, from the Device > Updates page.   --- |
  | --- | --- |
* Network and URL objects—If you know of specific IP addresses or URLs you want to block, you
  can create objects for them and add them to the blocked list or the exception
  list. Note that you cannot use network
  objects with FQDN or range specifications.

You create separate lists for IP addresses (networks) and URLs.

| **Note** | ---   If an HTTP/HTTPS request is to a URL that uses an IP address instead of a hostname, the system looks up the IP address reputation in the network address lists. You do not need to duplicate IP addresses in the network and URL lists.   --- |
| --- | --- |

* [Making Exceptions to the Block Lists](#concept_90669D0D055B4CBDBC13F4C2C53FAFF1)
* [Security Intelligence Feed Categories](#concept_44340209D87C4E058BA274CE5CBF5C0C)

### Making Exceptions to the Block Lists

For each block list, you can create an associated exception list, also known as the do not block
list. The only purpose of the exception list is to exempt IP addresses or URLs that
appear in the block list. That is, if you find an address or URL you need to use, and
you know to be safe, is in a feed configured on the block list, you can exempt that
network/URL without completely removing the category from the block list.

Exempted traffic is subsequently evaluated by the access control policy. The ultimate decision on
whether the connections are allowed or dropped is based on the access control rule the
connections match. The access rule also determines whether intrusion or malware
inspection is applied to the connection.

### Security Intelligence Feed Categories

The following table describes the categories available in the Cisco Talos Intelligence Group
(Talos) feeds. These categories are available for both network and URL blocking.

These categories can change over time, so a newly-downloaded feed might have category
changes. When configuring Security Intelligence, you can click the info icon next to a
category name to see a description.

Table 1. Cisco Talos Intelligence Group
(Talos) Feed Categories

| Security Intelligence Category | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Attackers | Active scanners and hosts known for outbound malicious activity |
| Banking\_fraud | Sites that engage in fraudulent activities that relate to electronic banking |
| Bogon | Bogon networks and unallocated IP addresses |
| Bots | Sites that host binary malware droppers |
| CnC | Sites that host command-and-control servers for botnets |
| Cryptomining | Hosts providing remote access to pools and wallets for the purpose of mining cryptocurrency |
| Dga | Malware algorithms used to generate a large number of domain names acting as rendezvous points with their command-and-control servers |
| Exploitkit | Software kits designed to identify software vulnerabilities in clients |
| High\_risk | Domains and hostnames that match against the OpenDNS predictive security algorithms from security graph |
| Ioc | Hosts that have been observed to engage in Indicators of Compromise (IOC) |
| Link\_sharing | Websites that share copyrighted files without permission |
| Malicious | Sites exhibiting malicious behavior that do not necessarily fit into another, more granular, threat category |
| Malware | Sites that host malware binaries or exploit kits |
| Newly\_seen | Domains that have recently been registered, or not yet seen via telemetry.   | **Attention** | Currently, this category does not have any active feed and is reserved for future use. | | --- | --- | |
| Open\_proxy | Open proxies that allow anonymous web browsing |
| Open\_relay | Open mail relays that are known to be used for spam |
| Phishing | Sites that host phishing pages |
| Response | IP addresses and URLs that are actively participating in malicious or suspicious activity |
| Spam | Mail hosts that are known for sending spam |
| Spyware | Sites that are known to contain, serve, or support spyware and adware activities |
| Suspicious | Files that appear to be suspicious and have characteristics that resemble known malware |
| Tor\_exit\_node | Hosts known to offer exit node services for the Tor Anonymizer network |

## License Requirements for Security Intelligence

You must enable the **Threat** license to use Security Intelligence. See [Enabling or Disabling Optional Licenses](fptd-fdm-license.html#id_12247).

## Configuring Security Intelligence

The Security Intelligence policy gives you an early opportunity to drop unwanted traffic based on source/destination IP address
or destination URL. Any allowed connections are still evaluated by access control policies and might eventually be dropped.
You must enable the IPS license to use Security Intelligence.

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Select Policies > Security Intelligence. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | If the policy is not enabled, click the Enable Security Intelligence button.  You can disable the policy at any time by clicking the Security Intelligence toggle to Off. Your configuration is preserved, so that when you enable the policy again you do not need to reconfigure it. |
| **Step 3** | Configure Security Intelligence.  There are separate block lists for Networks (IP addresses) and URLs.   1. Click the Network or URL    tab to display the list you want to configure. 2. In the block/drop list, click + to select the    objects or feeds whose connections you want to drop immediately.  The object selector organizes the objects and feeds on separate tabs    by type. If the object you want does not yet exist, click the    Create New Object link at the bottom of    the list and create it now. For a description of the Cisco Talos Intelligence Group    (Talos) feeds, click the i button next to the    feed. See also [Security Intelligence Feed Categories](#concept_44340209D87C4E058BA274CE5CBF5C0C).         | **Note** | Security Intelligence ignores IP address blocks using a /0 netmask. This includes the any-ipv4 and any-ipv6 network objects. Do not select these objects for network blocking. |    | --- | --- | 3. In the do not block list, click + and select any    exceptions to the block list.  The only reason to configure this list is to make exceptions for IP    addresses or URLs that are in the block list. Exempted connections    are subsequently evaluated by your access control policy, and might    be dropped anyway. 4. Repeat the process to configure the other block list. |
| **Step 4** | (Optional.) Click the Edit Logging Settings button (Gear/Settings button.) to configure logging.  If you enable logging, any matches to block list entries are logged. Matches to exception entries are not logged, although you get log messages if exempted connections match access control rules with logging enabled.  Configure the following settings:   * Connection Events   Logging—Click the toggle to enable or disable logging. * Syslog—If you   want to send a copy of the events to an external syslog server, select this   option and select the server object that defines the syslog server. If the   required object does not already exist, click   Add Syslog Server and create it.  Because   event storage on the device is limited, sending events to an external syslog   server can provide more long term storage and enhance your event analysis. |

---

## Monitoring Security Intelligence

If you enable logging for the Security Intelligence policy, the system generates Security
Intelligence events for each connection that matches an item on a block list. There are
matching connection events for these connections.

Statistics for dropped connections appear in the various dashboards available on the Monitoring
page.

The
Monitoring > Access and SI
Rules dashboard shows the top access rules and
Security Intelligence rule-equivalents that are matching traffic.

In addition, you can
select
Monitoring > Events, then the
Security
Intelligence view, to see the Security Intelligence events, as well
as the related connection events on the
Connection tab.

* The SI Category ID field in an event indicates the object matched in the block list, such as
  a network or URL object or feed.
* The Reason field in a connection event explains why the action shown in the event was
  applied. For example, a Block action paired with reasons such as IP Block or URL
  Block indicates that a connection was dropped by Security Intelligence.

## Examples for Security Intelligence

The use case chapter includes an example of implementing Security
Intelligence policies. Please see
[How to Block Threats](fptd-fdm-use-cases.html#id_25314).

## Upgrade Feature History

Table 6. Version 7.0.0 Features

| **Feature** | **Details** |
| --- | --- |
| **Threat Defense Upgrade** | |
| Improved FTD upgrade performance and status reporting. | FTD upgrades are now easier faster, more reliable, and take up less disk space. A new Upgrades tab in the Message Center provides further enhancements to upgrade status and error reporting. |
| Easy-to-follow upgrade workflow for FTD devices. | A new device upgrade page (Devices > Device Upgrade) on the FMC provides an easy-to-follow wizard for upgrading Version 6.4+ FTD devices. It walks you through important pre-upgrade stages, including selecting devices to upgrade, copying the upgrade package to the devices, and compatibility and readiness checks.  To begin, use the new Upgrade Firepower Software action on the Device Management page (Devices > Device Management > Select Action).  As you proceed, the system displays basic information about your selected devices, as well as the current upgrade-related status. This includes any reasons why you cannot upgrade. If a device does not "pass" a stage in the wizard, it does not appear in the next stage.  If you navigate away from wizard, your progress is preserved, although other users with Administrator access can reset, modify, or continue the wizard.   | **Note** | You must still use System(system gear icon) > Updates to upload or specify the location of FTD upgrade packages. You must also use the System Updates page to upgrade the FMC itself, as well as all non-FTD managed devices. | | --- | --- |  | **Note** | In Version 7.0, the wizard does not correctly display devices in clusters or high availability pairs. Even though you must select and upgrade these devices as a unit, the wizard displays them as standalone devices. Device status and upgrade readiness are evaluated and reported on an individual basis. This means it is possible for one unit to appear to "pass" to the next stage while the other unit or units do not. However, these devices are still grouped. Running a readiness check on one, runs it on all. Starting the upgrade on one, starts it on all.  To avoid possible time-consuming upgrade failures, *manually* ensure all group members are ready to move on to the next step of the wizard before you click Next. | | --- | --- | |
| Upgrade more FTD devices at once. | The number of devices you can upgrade at once is now limited by your management network bandwidth—not the system's ability to manage simultaneous upgrades. Previously, we recommended against upgrading more than five devices at a time.   | **Important** | Only upgrades to FTD Version 6.7+ using the FTD upgrade wizard see this improvement. If you are upgrading devices to an older FTD release—even if you are using the new upgrade wizard—we still recommend you limit to five devices at a time. | | --- | --- | |
| Upgrade different device models together. | You can now use the FTD upgrade wizard to queue and invoke upgrades for all FTD models at the same time, as long as the system has access to the appropriate upgrade packages.  Previously, you would choose an upgrade package, then choose the devices to upgrade using that package. That meant that you could upgrade multiple devices at the same time *only* if they shared an upgrade package. For example, you could upgrade two Firepower 2100 series devices at the same time, but not a Firepower 2100 series and a Firepower 1000 series. |

Table 7. Version 6.7.0 Features

| **Feature** | **Details** |
| --- | --- |
| **Threat Defense Upgrade** | |
| Upgrades remove PCAP files to save disk space. | Upgrades now remove locally stored PCAP files. To upgrade, you must have enough free disk space or the upgrade fails. |
| Improved FTD upgrade status reporting and cancel/retry options. | You can now view the status of FTD device upgrades and readiness checks in progress on the Device Management page, as well as a 7-day history of upgrade success/failures. The Message Center also provides enhanced status and error messages.  A new Upgrade Status pop-up, accessible from both Device Management and the Message Center with a single click, shows detailed upgrade information, including percentage/time remaining, specific upgrade stage, success/failure data, upgrade logs, and so on.  Also on this pop-up, you can manually cancel failed or in-progress upgrades (Cancel Upgrade), or retry failed upgrades (Retry Upgrade). Canceling an upgrade reverts the device to its pre-upgrade state.   | **Note** | To be able to manually cancel or retry a failed upgrade, you must disable the new auto-cancel option, which appears when you use the FMC to upgrade an FTD device: Automatically cancel on upgrade failure and roll back to the previous version. With the option enabled, the device automatically reverts to its pre-upgrade state upon upgrade failure.  Auto-cancel is not supported for patches. In an HA or clustered deployment, auto-cancel applies to each device individually. That is, if the upgrade fails on one device, only that device is reverted. | | --- | --- |   New/modified screens:   * System(system gear icon) > Updates > Product Updates > Available Updates > Install icon for the FTD upgrade package * Devices > Device Management > Upgrade * Message Center > Tasks   New/modified CLI commands: show upgrade status detail , show upgrade status continuous , show upgrade status , upgrade cancel , upgrade retry |
| **Content Updates** | |
| Custom intrusion rule import warns when rules collide. | The FMC now warns you of rule collisions when you import custom (local) intrusion rules. Previously, the system would silently skip the rules that cause collisions—with the exception of Version 6.6.0.1, where a rule import with collisions would fail entirely.  On the Rule Updates page, if a rule import had collisions, a warning icon is displayed in the Status column. For more information, hover your pointer over the warning icon and read the tooltip.  Note that a collision occurs when you try to import an intrusion rule that has the same SID/revision number as an existing rule. You should always make sure that updated versions of custom rules have new revision numbers.  New/modified screens: We added a warning icon to System(system gear icon) > Updates > Rule Updates. |

Table 8. Version 6.6.0 Features

| **Feature** | **Details** |
| --- | --- |
| **Threat Defense Upgrade** | |
| Get FTD upgrade packages from an internal web server. | FTD devices can now get upgrade packages from your own internal web server, rather than from the FMC. This is especially useful if you have limited bandwidth between the FMC and its devices. It also saves space on the FMC.   | **Note** | This feature is supported only for FTD devices running Version 6.6+. It is not supported for upgrades *to* Version 6.6, nor is it supported for the FMC or Classic devices. | | --- | --- |   New/modified screens: We added a Specify software update source option to the page where you upload upgrade packages. |
| **Content Updates** | |
| Automatic VDB update during initial setup. | When you set up a new or reimaged FMC, the system automatically attempts to update the vulnerability database (VDB).  This is a one-time operation. If the FMC has internet access, we recommend you schedule tasks to perform automatic recurring VDB update downloads and installations. |

Table 9. Version 6.5.0 Features

| **Feature** | **Details** |
| --- | --- |
| **Content Updates** | |
| Automatic software downloads and GeoDB updates. | When you set up a new or reimaged FMC, the system automatically schedules:   * A weekly task to download software updates for the FMC   and its managed devices. * Weekly updates for the GeoDB.   The tasks are scheduled in UTC, which means that when they occur locally depends on the date and your specific location. Also, because tasks are scheduled in UTC, they do not adjust for Daylight Saving Time, summer time, or any such seasonal adjustments that you may observe in your location. If you are affected, scheduled tasks occur one hour “later” in the summer than in the winter, according to local time. We recommend you review the auto-scheduled configurations and adjust them if necessary. |

Table 10. Version 6.4.0 Features

| **Feature** | **Details** |
| --- | --- |
| **Management Center Upgrade** | |
| Upgrades postpone scheduled tasks. | The FMC upgrade process now postpones scheduled tasks. Any task scheduled to begin during the upgrade will begin five minutes after the post-upgrade reboot.   | **Note** | Before you begin any upgrade, you must still make sure running tasks are complete. Tasks running when the upgrade begins are stopped, become failed tasks, and cannot be resumed. | | --- | --- |   Note that this feature is supported for all upgrades *from* a supported version. This includes Version 6.4.0.10 and later patches, Version 6.6.3 and later maintenance releases, and Version 6.7.0+. This feature is not supported for upgrades *to* a supported version from an unsupported version. |
| **Content Updates** | |
| Signed SRU, VDB, and GeoDB updates. | So the system can verify that you are using the correct update files, Version 6.4+ uses *signed* updates for intrusion rules (SRU), the vulnerability database (VDB), and the geolocation database (GeoDB). Earlier versions continue to use unsigned updates.  Unless you manually download updates from the Cisco Support & Download site—for example, in an air-gapped deployment—you should not notice any difference in functionality. If, however, you do manually download and install SRU, VDB, and GeoDB updates, make sure you download the correct package for your current version.  Signed update files begin with 'Cisco' instead of 'Sourcefire,' and terminate in .sh.REL.tar instead of .sh, as follows:   * SRU:   Cisco\_Firepower\_SRU-*date*-*build*-vrt.sh.REL.tar * VDB:   Cisco\_VDB\_Fingerprint\_Database-4.5.0-*version*.sh.REL.tar * GeoDB:   Cisco\_GEODB\_Update-*date*-*build*.sh.REL.tar   We will provide both signed and unsigned updates until the end-of-support for versions that require unsigned updates. Do not untar signed (.tar) packages. If you accidentally upload a signed update to an older FMC or ASA FirePOWER device, you must manually delete it. Leaving the package takes up disk space, and also may cause issues with future upgrades. |

Table 11. Version 6.2.3 Features

| **Feature** | **Details** |
| --- | --- |
| **Device Upgrade** | |
| Copy upgrade packages to managed devices before the upgrade. | You can now copy (or push) an upgrade package from the FMC to a managed device before you run the actual upgrade. This is useful because you can push during times of low bandwidth use, outside of the upgrade maintenance window.  When you push to high availability, clustered, or stacked devices, the system sends the upgrade package to the active/control/primary first, then to the standby/data/secondary.  New/modified screens: System(system gear icon) > Updates |
| **Content Updates** | |
| FMC warns of Snort restart before VDB updates. | The FMC now warns you that Vulnerability Database (VDB) updates restart the Snort process. This interrupts traffic inspection and, depending on how the managed device handles traffic, possibly interrupts traffic flow. You can cancel the install until a more convenient time, such as during a maintenance window.  These warnings can appear:   * After you download and manually install a VDB. * When you create a scheduled task to install the VDB. * When the VDB installs in the background, such as during a   previously scheduled task or as part of a software   upgrade. |
| Deprecated: Geolocation details | In May 2022 we split the GeoDB into two packages: a country code package mapping IP addresses to countries/continents, and an IP package containing additional contextual data associated with routable IP addresses. In January 2024, we stopped providing the IP package. This saves disk space and does not affect geolocation rules or traffic handling in any way. Any contextual data is now stale, and upgrading to most later versions deletes the IP package. Options to view contextual data have no effect, and are removed in later versions. |

Bias-Free Language

### Bias-Free Language

The documentation set for this product strives to use bias-free language. For the purposes of this documentation set, bias-free is defined as language that does not imply discrimination based on age, disability, gender, racial identity, ethnic identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and intersectionality. Exceptions may be present in the documentation due to language that is hardcoded in the user interfaces of the product software, language used based on RFP documentation, or language that is used by a referenced third-party product.

## About Network Malware Protection and File Policies

To detect and block malware, use file policies. You can also use file policies to detect and control traffic by file type.

Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) for Firepower can detect, capture, track, analyze, log, and optionally block the transmission
of malware in network traffic. In the Secure Firewall Management
Center web interface, this feature is called *malware defense*, formerly called *AMP for Firepower*. Advanced Malware Protection identifies malware using managed devices deployed inline and threat data from the Cisco cloud.

You associate file policies with access control rules that handle network traffic as part of your overall access control configuration.

When the system detects malware on your network, it generates file and malware events. To analyze file and malware event data, see the File/Malware Events and Network File Trajectory chapter in the [Cisco Secure Firewall Management
Center Administration Guide](http://www.cisco.com/go/firepower-config)
.

* [File Policies](#ID-2193-000001fb)

### File Policies

A file policy is a set of configurations that the system uses to perform malware protection and file control, as part of your
overall access control configuration. This association ensures that before the system passes a file in traffic that matches
an access control rule’s conditions, it first inspects the file. Consider the following diagram of a simple access control
policy in an inline deployment.

![Diagram illustrating the flow of traffic in a simple access control policy that uses file policies.](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/300001-400000/370001-380000/371001-372000/371859.jpg)

The policy has two access control rules, both of which use the
Allow action and are associated with file policies. The policy’s default action
is also to allow traffic, but without file policy inspection. In this scenario,
traffic is handled as follows:

* Traffic that matches
  `Rule 1` is inspected by
  `File Policy A`.
* Traffic that does not match
  `Rule 1` is evaluated against
  `Rule 2`. Traffic that matches
  `Rule 2` is inspected by
  `File Policy B`.
* Traffic that does not match either rule is allowed; you cannot
  associate a file policy with the default action.

By associating different file policies with different access control rules, you have granular control over how you identify
and block files transmitted on your network.

## Best Practices for File Policies and Malware Detection

In addition to the items described below, follow the steps in [How to Configure Malware Protection](#id_104669) and referenced topics.

* [File Rule Best Practices](#ID-2193-00000382)
* [File Detection Best Practices](#ID-2193-000003ab)
* [File Blocking Best Practices](#ID-2193-000003c6)
* [File Policy Best Practices](#id_98442)

### File Rule Best Practices

Note the following guidelines and limitations when configuring file rules:

* A rule configured to block files in a passive deployment does
  not block matching files. Because the connection continues to transmit the
  file, if you configure the rule to log the beginning of the connection, you may
  see multiple events logged for this connection.
* A policy can include multiple rules. When you create the rules, ensure that no rule is "shadowed" by a previous rule.
* The file types supported for dynamic analysis are a subset of the file types supported for other types of analysis. To view
  the file types supported for each type of analysis, navigate to the file rule configuration page, select the Block Malware action, and select the checkboxes of interest.

  To ensure that the system examines all file types, create separate rules (within the same policy) for dynamic analysis and
  for other types of analysis.
* If a file rule is configured with a Malware Cloud Lookup or Block Malware action and the management center cannot establish connectivity with the AMP cloud, the system cannot perform any configured rule action options until connectivity
  is restored.
* Cisco recommends that you enable
  Reset Connection for the
  Block Files and
  Block Malware actions to prevent blocked application
  sessions from remaining open until the TCP connection resets. If you do not
  reset connections, the client session will remain open until the TCP connection
  resets itself.
* If you are monitoring high volumes of traffic, do
  **not** store all captured files, or submit all captured files
  for dynamic analysis. Doing so can negatively impact system performance.
* You cannot perform malware analysis on all file types detected
  by the system. After you select values from the
  Application Protocol,
  Direction of Transfer, and
  Action drop-down lists, the system constrains the
  list of file types.

### File Detection Best Practices

Consider the following notes and limitations for file detection:

* If adaptive profiling is not enabled, access control rules cannot perform file control, including AMP.
* If a file matches a rule with an application protocol condition,
  file event generation occurs after the system successfully identifies a file’s
  application protocol. Unidentified files do not generate file events.
* FTP transfers commands and data over different channels. In a passive or inline tap mode deployment, the traffic from an FTP
  data session and its control session may not be load-balanced to the same internal resource.
* If the total number of bytes for all file names for files in a
  POP3, POP, SMTP, or IMAP session exceeds 1024, file events from the session may
  not reflect the correct file names for files that were detected after the file
  name buffer filled.
* When transmitting text-based files over SMTP, some mail clients
  convert newlines to the CRLF newline character standard. Since Mac-based hosts
  use the carriage return (CR) character and Unix/Linux-based hosts use the line
  feed (LF) character, newline conversion by the mail client can modify the size
  of the file. Note that some mail clients default to newline conversion when
  processing an unrecognizable file type.
* To detect ISO files, set the "Limit the number of bytes inspected when doing file type detection" option to a value greater
  than 36870, as described in [File and Malware Inspection Performance and Storage Options](#ID-2177-000004e4).
* .Exe files inside some .rar archives cannot be detected, including possibly rar5.

### File Blocking Best Practices

Consider the following notes and limitations for file blocking:

* If an end-of-file marker is not detected for a file, regardless
  of transfer protocol, the file will not be blocked by a
  Block Malware rule or the custom detection list. The
  system waits to block the file until the entire file has been received, as
  indicated by the end-of-file marker, and blocks the file after the marker is
  detected.
* If the end-of-file marker for an FTP file transfer is
  transmitted separately from the final data segment, the marker will be blocked
  and the FTP client will indicate that the file transfer failed, but the file
  will actually completely transfer to disk.
* File rules with
  Block Files and
  Block Malware actions block automatic resumption of
  file download via HTTP by blocking new sessions with the same file, URL,
  server, and client application detected for 24 hours after the initial file
  transfer attempt occurs.
* In rare cases, if traffic from an HTTP upload session is out of
  order, the system cannot reassemble the traffic correctly and therefore will
  not block it or generate a file event.
* If you transfer a file over NetBIOS-ssn (such as an SMB file
  transfer) that is blocked with a
  Block Files rule, you may see a file on the
  destination host. However, the file is unusable because it is blocked after the
  download starts, resulting in an incomplete file transfer.
* If you create file rules to detect or block files transferred over NetBIOS-ssn (such as an SMB file transfer), the system
  does not inspect the ongoing file transfers. However, the system inspects the new files that are transferred after you deploy
  an access control policy invoking the file policy.
* SMB has a functionality called multi-channel which creates multiple parallel sessions with the same IP address and different
  ports. For a given transaction over multi-channel, the file download is multiplexed across these sessions which is not inspected
  by the system as a single file.
* Files transferred concurrently in a single TCP or SMB session are not inspected.
* In a cluster environment, if an existing SMB session is moved to a new device due to a cluster role change or a device failure,
  then the files in any ongoing file transfers may not be inspected.
* Some SMB file transfers between Microsoft Windows systems use very high TCP window size for quick file transfers. To detect
  or block such file transfers, it is recommended that you increase the value of **Maximum Queued Bytes** and **Maximum Queued Segments** under Network Analysis Policy > TCP Stream Configuration > Troubleshooting Options.
* If you configure threat
  defense high availability, and failover occurs while the
  original active device is identifying the file, the file type is not synced.
  Even if your file policy blocks that file type, the new active device
  downloads the file.

### File Policy Best Practices

Note the following general guidelines and limitations when configuring
file policies.

* You can associate a single file policy with an access control rule whose action is Allow, Interactive Block, or Interactive Block with reset.
* You **cannot** use a file policy to inspect traffic handled by the access control default action.
* For a new policy, the web interface indicates that the policy is not in use. If you are editing an in-use file policy, the
  web interface tells you how many access control policies use the file policy. In either case, you can click the text to jump
  to the Access Control Policies page.
* For file blocking to work, the NAP policy you apply to
  the access control policy must be operating in
  Protection mode, also known as Inline mode.
* Based on your configuration, you can either inspect a file the first time the system detects it, and wait for a cloud lookup
  result, or pass the file on this first detection without waiting for the cloud lookup result.
* By default, file inspection of encrypted payloads is disabled. This helps reduce false positives and improve performance when
  an encrypted connection matches an access control rule that has file inspection configured.

  | **Attention** | ---   The File Inpsect preprocessor with the following generator IDs (GIDs) are enabled by default for file/malware policy: GID: 146 and GID: 147.   --- |

### Plan and Prepare for Malware Protection

This procedure is the first set of steps in the complete process for configuring your system to provide malware protection.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Purchase and install licenses.  See [License Requirements for File and Malware Policies](#id_101648) and Licenses in the [Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center Administration Guide](http://www.cisco.com/go/firepower-config). |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Understand how file policies and malware protection fit into your access control plan.  See the chapter [Access Control Overview](access-overview.html#ID-2177-00000004). |
| **Step 3** | Understand the file analysis and malware protection tools.  See [File Rule Actions](#id_98452) and subtopics.  Consider also [Advanced and Archive File Inspection Options](#ID-2193-00000296). |
| **Step 4** | Determine whether you will use public clouds or private (on-premises) clouds for malware protection (file analysis and dynamic analysis.)  See [Cloud Connections for Malware Protection](#concept_44C7496443C44E14AAE2D50D9CA5FE04) and subtopics. |
| **Step 5** | If you will use private (on-premises) clouds for malware protection: Purchase, deploy, and test those products.  For information, contact your Cisco sales representative or authorized reseller. |
| **Step 6** | Configure your firewall to allow communications with your chosen clouds. See Security, Internet Access, and Communication Ports in the [Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center Administration Guide](http://www.cisco.com/go/firepower-config). |
| **Step 7** | Configure connections between Firepower and the malware protection clouds (public or private, as applicable).   * For the AMP cloud, see [Change AMP Options](#ID-2241-00000a18). * If you have deployed an on-premises Secure   Malware Analytics Appliance, see [Connect to an On-Premises Dynamic Analysis Appliance](#task_83FF0624B71842E3B2EEB6DAC13B2CDB). (Access to the public Secure   Malware Analytics Cloud does not require configuration.) |

#### Configuring an Access Control Rule to Perform Malware Protection

| **Caution** | ---   Enabling or disabling Store files in a Detect Files or Block Files rule, or adding the first or removing the last file rule that combines the Malware Cloud Lookup or Block Malware file rule action with an analysis option (Spero Analysis or MSEXE, Dynamic Analysis, or Local Malware Analysis) or a store files option (Malware, Unknown, Clean, or Custom), restarts the Snort process when you deploy configuration changes, temporarily interrupting traffic inspection. Whether traffic drops during this interruption or passes without further inspection depends on how the target device handles traffic. See [Snort Restart Traffic Behavior](get-started-deployment.html#concept_uc1_gtq_ty) for more information.   --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---   Inline normalization is enabled automatically when a file policy is included in an access control rule. For more information, see [The Inline Normalization Preprocessor](advanced-nap-transport-preprocessors.html#ID-2169-0000013f).   --- |
| --- | --- |

##### Before you begin

* Adaptive profiling **must** be enabled (its default state) as described in [Configuring Adaptive Profiles](advanced-nap-adaptive-profiles.html#ID-2173-0000007c) for access control rules to perform file
  control, including AMP.
* You must be an Admin, Access Admin, or Network Admin user to perform this
  task.

##### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | In the access control rule editor (from Policies > Access Control), choose an Action of Allow, Interactive Block, or Interactive Block with reset. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | (Legacy UI only.) Click Inspection. |
| **Step 3** | Choose a File Policy  to inspect traffic that matches the access control rule, or choose None to disable file inspection for matching traffic. |
| **Step 4** | (Optional) Disable logging of file or malware events for matching connections by clicking Logging and unchecking Log Files.   | **Note** | Cisco recommends that you leave file and malware event logging enabled. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 5** | Save the rule. |
| **Step 6** | Click Save to save the policy. |

#### What to do next

Review "What to do next items" in the malware protection workflow:

See [How to Configure Malware Protection](#id_104669).

## Cloud Connections for Malware Protection

Connections to public or private clouds are required in order to protect your network from malware.

### AMP Clouds

The Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) cloud is a Cisco-hosted server that uses big data analytics and continuous analysis
to provide intelligence that the system uses to detect and block malware on your network.

The AMP cloud provides dispositions for possible malware detected in network traffic by managed devices, as well as data updates
for local malware analysis and file pre-classification.

If your organization has deployed AMP for Endpoints and configured Firepower to import its data, the system imports this data
from the AMP cloud, including scan records, malware detections, quarantines, and indications of compromise (IOC).

Cisco offers the following options for obtaining data from the Cisco cloud about known malware threats:

* **AMP public cloud**

  Your Secure Firewall Management
  Center communicates directly with the public Cisco cloud. There are three public AMP clouds, in the United States, Europe, and Asia.
* **An AMP private cloud**

  An AMP private cloud is deployed on your network and acts as a compressed, on-premises AMP cloud, as well as an anonymized proxy to connect to the public AMP cloud. For details, see [Cisco AMP Private Cloud](#ID-2193-0000051c).

  If you integrate with AMP for Endpoints, the AMP private cloud has some limitations. See [AMP for Endpoints and AMP Private Cloud](#id_96160).

### Dynamic Analysis Cloud

* **Secure
  Malware Analytics Cloud**

  Public cloud that processes eligible files that you send for dynamic analysis, and provides threat scores and dynamic analysis
  reports. Firepower supports 200 samples/day for Secure
  Malware Analytics analysis.
* **On-premises Secure
  Malware Analytics Appliance**

  If your organization's security policy does not allow the system to send files outside of your network, you can deploy an
  on-premises appliance. This appliance does not contact the public Secure
  Malware Analytics Cloud.

  For more information, see [Dynamic Analysis On-Premises Appliance (Cisco Secure Malware Analytics)](#concept_71E2BDBBF3FB40F6B660B1165E2B65D8).

* [Managing Connections to the AMP Cloud (Public or Private)](#ID-2193-000005a5)
* [Change AMP Options](#ID-2241-00000a18)

#### Requirements and Best Practices for AMP Cloud Connections

##### Requirements for AMP Cloud Connections

You must be an Admin user to set up the AMP cloud.

To ensure your management center can communicate with the AMP cloud, see the topics under Security, Internet Access, and Communication Ports in the [Cisco Secure Firewall Management
Center Administration Guide](http://www.cisco.com/go/firepower-config).

To use the legacy port for AMP communications, see Communication Port Requirements in the [Cisco Secure Firewall Management
Center Administration Guide](http://www.cisco.com/go/firepower-config)
.

##### AMP and High Availability

Although they share file policies and related configurations, management centers in a high availability pair share neither cloud connections nor captured files, file events, and malware events. To ensure
continuity of operations, and to ensure that detected files’ malware dispositions are the same on both management centers, both Active and Standby management centers must have access to the cloud.

In high availability configurations, you must configure AMP cloud connections independently on the Active and Standby instances
of the Firepower Management Center; these configurations are not synchronized.

These requirements apply to both public and private AMP clouds.

##### AMP Cloud Connections and Multitenancy

In a multidomain deployment, you configure the malware defense connection at the Global level only. Each management center can have only one malware defense connection.

#### Choose an AMP Cloud

By default, a connection to the United States (US) AMP public cloud is configured and enabled for your system. (This connection
appears in the web interface as malware defense and sometimes AMP for Firepower.) You cannot delete or disable an malware defense cloud connection, but you can switch between different geographical AMP clouds, or configure an AMP private cloud connection.

##### Before you begin

* If you will use an AMP private cloud, see [Connecting to an AMP Private Cloud](#ID-2193-0000054d) instead of this topic.
* Unless Firepower is integrated with AMP for Endpoints, you can configure only one AMP cloud connection. This connection is
  labeled AMP for Networks or AMP for Firepower.
* If you have deployed AMP for Endpoints and you want to add one or more AMP clouds to integrate that application with Firepower,
  see [Integrate Firepower and Secure Endpoint](#ID-2193-000004ba).
* See [Requirements and Best Practices for AMP Cloud Connections](#ID-2193-00000481).

##### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Choose Integration > AMP > AMP Management. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click pencil to edit the existing cloud connection. |
| **Step 3** | From the Cloud Name drop-down list, choose the regional cloud nearest to your Secure Firewall Management Center.  `APJC` is Asia/Pacific/Japan/China. |
| **Step 4** | Click Save. |

---

##### What to do next

* If your deployment is a high-availability configuration, see [Requirements and Best Practices for AMP Cloud Connections](#ID-2193-00000481).
* (Optional) [Change AMP Options](#ID-2241-00000a18).

#### Cisco AMP Private Cloud

The management center must connect to the AMP cloud for disposition queries for files detected in network traffic and receipt of retrospective
malware events. This cloud can be public or private.

Your organization may have privacy or security concerns that make frequent or direct connections between your monitored network
and the AMP cloud difficult or impossible. In these situations, you can set up a Cisco AMP Private Cloud, a proprietary Cisco
product that acts as a compressed, on-premises version of the AMP cloud, as well as a secure mediator between your network
and the AMP cloud. Connecting a management center to an AMP private cloud disables existing direct connections to the public AMP cloud.

All connections to the AMP cloud funnel through the AMP private cloud, which acts as an anonymized proxy to ensure the security
and privacy of your monitored network. This includes disposition queries for files detected in network traffic, receiving
of retrospective malware events, and so on. The AMP private cloud does not share any of your endpoint data over an external
connection.

| **Note** | ---   The AMP private cloud does **not** perform dynamic analysis, nor does it support anonymized retrieval of threat intelligence for other features that rely on Cisco Collective Security Intelligence (CSI), such as URL and Security Intelligence filtering.   --- |
| --- | --- |

For information about AMP private cloud (sometimes referred to as "AMPv"), see <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/fireamp-private-cloud-virtual-appliance/index.html>.

* [Connecting to an AMP Private Cloud](#ID-2193-0000054d)

##### Connecting to an AMP Private Cloud

###### Before you begin

* Configure your Cisco AMP private cloud or clouds according to the directions in the documentation for that product. During
  configuration, note the private cloud host name. You will need this host name in order to configure the connection on the
  management center.
* Make sure the management center can communicate with the AMP private cloud, and confirm that the private cloud has internet access so it can communicate
  with the public AMP cloud. See the topics under Security, Internet Access, and Communication Ports in the [Cisco Secure Firewall Management
  Center Administration Guide](http://www.cisco.com/go/firepower-config).
* Unless your deployment is integrated with AMP for Endpoints, each management center can have only one AMP cloud connection. This connection is labeled AMP for Networks or AMP for Firepower.

  If you integrate with AMP for Endpoints, you can configure multiple AMP for Endpoints cloud connections.

###### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Choose Integration > AMP > AMP Management. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click Add AMP Cloud Connection. |
| **Step 3** | From the Cloud Name drop-down list, choose Private Cloud. |
| **Step 4** | Enter a Name.  This information appears in malware events that are generated or transmitted by AMP private cloud. |
| **Step 5** | In the Host field, enter the private cloud host name that you configured when you set up the private cloud. |
| **Step 6** | Click Browse next to the Certificate Upload Path field to browse to the location of a valid TLS or SSL encryption certificate for the private cloud. For more information, see the AMP private cloud documentation. |
| **Step 7** | If you want to use this private cloud for both malware defense and AMP for Endpoints, check the Use for AMP for Firepower check box.  If you configured a different private cloud to handle malware defense communications, you can clear this check box; if this is your only AMP private cloud connection, you cannot.  In a multidomain deployment, this check box appears only in the Global domain. Each management center can have only one malware defense connection. |
| **Step 8** | To communicate with the AMP private cloud using a proxy, check the Use Proxy for Connection check box. |
| **Step 9** | Click Register, confirm that you want to disable existing direct connections to the AMP cloud, and finally confirm that you want to continue to the AMP private cloud management console to complete registration. |
| **Step 10** | Log into the management console and complete the registration process. For further instructions, see the AMP private cloud documentation. |

---

###### What to do next

In high availability configurations, you must configure AMP cloud connections independently on the Active and Standby instances
of the Firepower Management Center; these configurations are not synchronized.

#### Managing Connections to the AMP Cloud (Public or Private)

Use the management center to manage connections to public and private AMP clouds used for malware defense or AMP for Endpoints or both.

You can delete a connection to a public or private AMP cloud if you no longer want to receive malware-related information
from the cloud. Note that deregistering a connection using the AMP for Endpoints or AMP private cloud management console does
not remove the connection from the system. Deregistered connections display a failed state on the Secure Firewall Management
Center web interface.

You can also temporarily disable a connection. When you reenable
a cloud connection, the cloud resumes sending data to the system, including
queued data from the disabled period.

| **Caution** | ---   For disabled connections, the public or private AMP cloud can store malware events, indications of compromise, and so on until you re-enable the connection. In rare cases—for example, with a very high event rate or a long-term disabled connection—the cloud may not be able to store all information generated while the connection is disabled.   --- |
| --- | --- |

In a multidomain deployment, the system displays connections created in the current domain, which you can manage. It also
displays connections created in ancestor domains, which you cannot manage. To manage connections in a lower domain, switch
to that domain. Each management center can have only one malware defense connection, which belongs to the Global domain.

##### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Select Integration > AMP > AMP Management. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Manage your AMP cloud connections:   * Delete — Click Delete (delete icon), then confirm your choice. * Enable or Disable — Click the   slider, then confirm your choice. |

#### Dynamic Analysis On-Premises Appliance (Cisco Secure Malware Analytics)

If your organization has privacy or security concerns around submitting files to the public Secure
Malware Analytics Cloud, you can deploy an on-premises Secure
Malware Analytics Appliance. Like the public cloud, the on-premises appliance runs eligible files in a
sandbox environment, and returns a threat score and dynamic analysis report to the
system. However, the on-premises appliance does not communicate with the public cloud,
or any other system external to your network.

For more information about on-premises Secure
Malware Analytics Appliances, see <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/threat-grid/index.html>.

* [Connect to an On-Premises Dynamic Analysis Appliance](#task_83FF0624B71842E3B2EEB6DAC13B2CDB)

##### Connect to an On-Premises Dynamic Analysis Appliance

If you install an on-premises Secure
Malware Analytics Appliance on your network, you can configure a dynamic analysis connection to
submit files and retrieve reports from the appliance. When configuring the
on-premises appliance dynamic analysis connection, you register the Secure Firewall Management
Center to the on-premises appliance.

###### Before you begin

* Set up your on-premises Secure
  Malware Analytics Appliance.

  Documentation for this appliance is available from <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/security/amp-threat-grid-appliances/tsd-products-support-series-home.html>.

* If your Secure
  Malware Analytics Appliance uses a self-signed public-key certificate, download the
  certificate from the Secure
  Malware Analytics Appliance; see the Administrator's Guide for your Secure
  Malware Analytics Appliance for information.

  If you use a certificate signed by a Certificate Authority (CA), the certificate must meet
  the following requirements:

  + The server key and signed certificate must be installed on the Secure
    Malware Analytics Appliance. Follow the upload instructions in the
    *Administrator's Guide* for your Secure
    Malware Analytics Appliance.
  + If there is a multi-level signing chain of CAs, all required intermediate certificates and
    the root certificate must be contained in a single file that will be
    uploaded to the management center.
  + All certificates must be PEM-encoded.
  + The file's newlines must be UNIX, not DOS.
* If you want to connect to the on-premises appliance using a proxy, configure
  the proxy; see Modify Management
  Center Management Interfaces in the [Cisco Secure Firewall Management
  Center Administration Guide](http://www.cisco.com/go/firepower-config).

#### Enabling Access to Dynamic Analysis Results in the Public Cloud

Secure
Malware Analytics offers more detailed reporting on analyzed files than is available in the
management center. If your organization has a Secure
Malware Analytics Cloud account, you can access the Secure
Malware Analytics portal directly to view additional details about files sent for analysis from
your managed devices. However, for privacy reasons, file analysis details are
available only to the organization that submitted the files. Therefore, before you
can view this information, you must associate your management center with
the files submitted by its managed devices.

##### Before you begin

You must have a Secure
Malware Analytics Cloud account, and have your account credentials ready.

##### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Select Integration > AMP > Dynamic Analysis Connections. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click Associate (associate icon) in the table row corresponding to the Secure Malware Analytics Cloud.  A Secure Malware Analytics portal window opens. |
| **Step 3** | Sign in to the Secure Malware Analytics Cloud. |
| **Step 4** | Click Submit Query.   | **Note** | Do not change the default value in the Devices field. | | --- | --- |   If you have difficulties with this process, contact your Secure Malware Analytics representative at Cisco TAC.  It may take up to 24 hours for this change to take effect. |

---

##### What to do next

After the association is activated, see Viewing Dynamic Analysis Results in the Cisco Cloud in the [Cisco Secure Firewall Management
Center Administration Guide](http://www.cisco.com/go/firepower-config)
.

#### Maintain Your System: Update File Types Eligible for Dynamic Analysis

The list of file types eligible for Dynamic Analysis is determined by the
vulnerability database (VDB), which is updated periodically (but no more than once
per day.) If you are an Admin user, you can update file types eligible for dynamic
analysis.

To ensure that your system has the current list:

##### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Do one of the following:   * (Recommended) See Vulnerability   Database Update Automation as discussed in the [Cisco Secure Firewall Management   Center Administration Guide](http://www.cisco.com/go/firepower-config) * Regularly check for new VDB updates, and Manually Update the VDB as discussed in the [Cisco Secure Firewall Management   Center Administration Guide](http://www.cisco.com/go/firepower-config) when needed.  If you choose this option, we recommend that you schedule regular reminders to do this. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | If your file policies specify individual file types instead of the Dynamic Analysis Capable file type category, update your file policies to use the newly supported file types. |
| **Step 3** | If the list of eligible file types changes, deploy to managed devices. |

| **Step 5** | Save the file policy. |

---

#### What to do next

* If you are configuring policies for malware protection, see other required procedures in
  [Configure File Policies](#id_104661).
* Otherwise:

  + Add the file policy to an access control rule as described in [Add File Policies to Your Access Control Configuration](#id_108783).
  + Deploy configuration changes; see [Deploy Configuration Changes](get-started-deployment.html#task_75E181687ECF4EFC8EB6AF4509C20C0B).

* [Advanced and Archive File Inspection Options](#ID-2193-00000296)

#### Advanced and Archive File Inspection Options

The Advanced Settings in the file policy editor has the following general options:

* First Time File Analysis—Select this option to analyze first-seen files while AMP cloud disposition is pending. The file must match a rule configured
  to perform a malware cloud lookup and Spero, local malware, or dynamic analysis. If you deselect this option, files detected
  for the first time are marked with an Unknown disposition
* Enable Custom Detection List—Block files on the custom detection list.
* Enable Clean List—If enabled, this policy will allow files that are on the clean list.
* If AMP Cloud disposition is Unknown, override disposition based upon threat score—Select an option:

  + If you select **Disabled,** the system will not override
    the disposition provided by the AMP Cloud.
  + If you set a threshold threat score, files with an AMP cloud verdict of Unknown are considered malware if their Dynamic Analysis
    score is equal to or worse than the threshold.
  + If you select a lower threshold value, you increase the number of files treated as malware. Depending on the action selected
    in your file policy, this can result in an increase of blocked files.
  + For numeric threat score ranges, see Threat Scores and Dynamic Analysis Summary
    Reports in the [Cisco Secure Firewall Management
    Center Administration Guide](http://www.cisco.com/go/firepower-config).

The Advanced Settings in the file policy editor has the following archive file inspection options:

* Inspect Archives—Enables inspection of the contents of archive files, for archive files as large as the Maximum file size to store advanced access control setting.
* Block Encrypted Archives—Blocks password-protected archives.
* Block Uninspectable Archives—Blocks archive files with contents that the system is unable to inspect for reasons other than encryption. This usually applies
  to corrupted files, or those that exceed your specified maximum archive depth.
* Max Archive Depth—Blocks nested archive files that exceed the specified depth. The top-level archive file is not considered in this count;
  depth begins at 1 with the first nested file .

* [Archive Files](#id_97761)
* [Override File Disposition Using Custom Lists](#id_97749)

##### Archive Files

Archive files are files that contain other files, such as `.zip` or `.rar` files.

If any individual file in an archive matches a file rule with a block action, the system blocks the entire archive, not just
the individual file.

For details about options for archive file inspection, see [Advanced and Archive File Inspection Options](#ID-2193-00000296).

###### Archive Files That Can Be Inspected

* **File types**

  A complete list of inspectable archive file types appears in the management center web interface on the file rule configuration page. To view that page, see [Creating File Rules](#ID-2193-000003e9).

  Contained files that can be inspected appears in the same page.
* **File size**

  You can inspect archive files as large as the Maximum file size to store file policy advanced access control setting.
* **Nested archives**

  Archive files can contain other archive files, which can in turn contain archive files. The level at which a file is nested
  is its *archive file depth*. Note that the top-level archive file is not included in the depth count; depth begins at 1 with the first nested file.

  The system can inspect up to three levels of nested files beneath the outermost archive file (level 0). You can configure
  your file policy to block archive files that exceed that depth (or a lower maximum depth that you specify).

  If you choose not to block files that exceed the maximum archive file depth of 3, when archive files that contain some extractable
  contents and some contents nested at a depth of 3 or greater appear in monitored traffic, the system examines and reports
  data only for the files it was able to inspect.

  All features applicable to uncompressed files (such as dynamic analysis and file storage) are available for nested files inside
  archive files.
* **Encrypted files**

  You can configure the system to block archives whose contents are encrypted or otherwise cannot be inspected.
* **Archives that are not inspected**

  If traffic that contains an archive file is on a Security Intelligence Block list or Do Not Block list, or if the top-level
  archive file’s SHA-256 value is on the custom detection list, the system does not inspect the contents of the archive file.

  If a nested file is blocked, the entire archive is blocked; however, if a nested file is allowed, the archive is not automatically
  passed (depending on any other nested files and characteristics).

  .Exe files inside some .rar archives cannot be detected, including possibly rar5.

###### Archive File Dispositions

Archive file dispositions are based on the dispositions assigned to the files inside the archive. **All** archives that contain identified malware files receive a disposition of `Malware`. Archives without identified malware files receive a disposition of `Unknown` if they contain any unknown files, and a disposition of `Clean` if they contain only clean files.

Table 2. Archive File Disposition by Contents

| Archive File Disposition | Number of Unknown Files | Number of Clean Files | Number of Malware Files |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Unknown` | 1 or more | Any | 0 |
| `Clean` | 0 | 1 or more | 0 |
| `Malware` | Any | Any | 1 or more |

Archive files, like other files, may have dispositions of `Custom Detection` or `Unavailable` if the conditions for those dispositions apply.

###### Viewing Archive Contents and Details

If your file policy is configured to inspect archive file contents, you can use the context menu in a table on pages under
the Analysis > Files menu, and the network file trajectory viewer to view information about the files inside an archive when
the archive file appears in a file event, malware event, or as a captured file.

All file contents of the archive are listed in table form, with a short summary of their relevant information: name, SHA-256
hash value, type, category, and archive depth. A network file trajectory icon appears by each file, which you can click to
view further information about that specific file.

##### Override File Disposition Using Custom Lists

If a file has a disposition in the AMP cloud that you know to be incorrect, you can add the file’s SHA-256 value to a file
list that overrides the disposition from the cloud:

* To treat a file as if the AMP cloud assigned a clean disposition, add the file to the *clean list*.
* To treat a file as if the AMP cloud assigned a malware disposition, add the file to the *custom detection list.*

On subsequent detection, the device either allows or blocks the file without reevaluating the file's disposition. You can
use the clean list or custom detection list per file policy.

| **Note** | ---   To calculate a file's SHA-256 value, you must configure a rule in the file policy to either perform a malware cloud lookup or block malware on matching files.  --- |
| --- | --- |

For complete information about using file lists in Firepower, see [File List](objects-object-mgmt.html#ID-2243-00000833).

Alternatively, if applicable, use [Centralized File Lists from AMP for Endpoints](#id_97757).

* [Centralized File Lists from AMP for Endpoints](#id_97757)

###### Centralized File Lists from AMP for Endpoints

If your organization has deployed AMP for Endpoints, Firepower can use Block and Allow lists created in AMP for Endpoints
when it queries the AMP cloud for file dispositions.

Requirements:

* Your organization must be using the AMP public cloud.
* Your organization has deployed AMP for Endpoints.
* You have registered your system to AMP for Endpoints using the procedure in [Integrate Firepower and Secure Endpoint](#ID-2193-000004ba).

To create and deploy these lists, see the documentation or online help for AMP for Endpoints.

| **Note** | ---   File lists created in Firepower override file lists created in AMP for Endpoints.   --- |
| --- | --- |

### Managing File Policies

The File Policies
page displays a list of existing file policies along with their last-modified
dates. You can use this page to manage your file policies.

| **Note** | ---   The system checks for updates to the list of file types eligible for dynamic analysis (no more than once a day). If the list of eligible file types changes, this constitutes a change in the file policy; any access control policy using the file policy is marked out-of-date if deployed to any devices. You must deploy policies before the updated file policy can take effect on the device. See [Maintain Your System: Update File Types Eligible for Dynamic Analysis](#id_95728).   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Select Policies > Access Control > Malware & File . |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Manage your file policies:   * Compare—Click Compare Policies; see [Comparing policies](get-started-deployment.html#task_ABA1FE48DBBB44BC9FF40243FCC58BF6). * Create — To   create a file policy, click   New File Policy   and proceed as described in   [Create or Edit a File Policy](#ID-2193-0000025d). * Copy — To copy a file policy, click Copy  (copy icon).  If View (View button) appears instead, the configuration belongs to an ancestor   domain, or you do not have permission to modify the   configuration. * Delete — If you want to delete a file policy, click Delete (delete icon), then click Yes and OK as prompted.  If the controls are dimmed, the configuration belongs to an ancestor domain, or you do not have permission to modify the   configuration. * Deploy—Choose Deploy > Deployment; see [Deploy Configuration Changes](get-started-deployment.html#task_75E181687ECF4EFC8EB6AF4509C20C0B). * Edit — If you want to modify an existing file policy, click Edit (edit icon). * Report—Click Report (Report icon); see [Generate Current Policy Reports](get-started-deployment.html#task_CCED983433824793AF09203FDAD1AF53). |

---

### File Rules

A file policy, like its parent access control policy, contains
rules that determine how the system handles files that match the conditions of
each rule. You can configure separate file rules to take different actions for
different file types, application protocols, or directions of transfer.

For example, when a file matches a rule, the rule can:

* allow or block files based on simple file type matching
* block files based on disposition (whether or not evaluation indicates that it is malicious)
* store files to the device (For information, see [Captured Files and File Storage](#ID-2199-0000067c))
* submit stored (captured) files for local malware, Spero, or dynamic analysis

In addition, the file policy can:

* automatically treat a file as if it is clean or malware based on
  entries in the clean list or custom detection list
* treat a file as if it is malware if the file’s threat score
  exceeds a configurable threshold
* inspect the contents of archive files (such as
  `.zip` or
  `.rar`)
* block archive files whose contents are encrypted, nested beyond
  a specified maximum archive depth, or otherwise uninspectable

* [File Rule Components](#ID-2193-000002e9)
* [File Rule Actions](#id_98452)
* [Creating File Rules](#ID-2193-000003e9)

#### File Rule Components

Table 3. File Rule Components

| File Rule Component | Description |
| --- | --- |
| application protocol | The system can detect and inspect files transmitted via FTP, HTTP, SMTP, IMAP, POP3, and NetBIOS-ssn (SMB). Any, the default, detects files in HTTP, SMTP, IMAP, POP3, FTP, and NetBIOS-ssn (SMB) traffic. To improve performance, you can restrict file detection to only one of those application protocols on a per-file rule basis. |
| direction of transfer | You can inspect incoming FTP, HTTP, IMAP, POP3, and NetBIOS-ssn (SMB) traffic for downloaded files; you can inspect outgoing FTP, HTTP, SMTP, and NetBIOS-ssn (SMB) traffic for uploaded files.   | **Tip** | Use Any to detect files over multiple application protocols, regardless of whether users are sending or receiving. | | --- | --- | |
| file categories and types | The system can detect various types of files. These file types are grouped into basic categories, including multimedia (swf, mp3), executables (exe, torrent), and PDFs. You can configure file rules that detect individual file types, or on entire categories of file types.  For example, you could block all multimedia files, or just ShockWave Flash (swf) files. Or, you could configure the system to alert you when a user downloads a BitTorrent (torrent) file.  Note that executables include file types that can run macros and scripts, since these can contain malware.  For a list of file types the system can inspect, select Policies > Access Control > Malware & File, create a temporary new file policy, then click Add Rule. Select a file type category and the file types that the system can inspect appear in the File Types list.   | **Note** | Frequently triggered file rules can affect system performance. For example, detecting multimedia files in HTTP traffic (YouTube, for example, transmits significant Flash content) could generate an overwhelming number of events. | | --- | --- | |
| file rule action | A file rule’s action determines how the system handles traffic that matches the conditions of the rule.  Depending on the selected action, you can configure whether the system stores the file or performs Spero, local malware, or dynamic analysis on a file. If you select a Block action, you can also configure whether the system also resets the blocked connection.  For descriptions of these actions and options, see [File Rule Actions](#id_98452).  File rules are evaluated in rule-action, not numerical, order. For details, see [File Rule Actions: Evaluation Order](#ID-2193-00000329). |

#### File Rule Actions

File rules give you granular control over which file types you want to log, block, or scan for malware. Each file rule has
an associated action that determines how the system handles traffic that matches the conditions of the rule. To be effective,
a file policy must contain one or more rules. You can use separate rules within a file policy to take different actions for
different file types, application protocols, or directions of transfer.

##### File Rule Actions

* *Detect Files* rules allow you to log the detection of specific file types to the database, while still allowing their transmission.
* *Block Files*  rules allow you to block specific file types. You can configure options to reset the connection when a file transfer is blocked,
  and store captured files to the managed device.
* *Malware Cloud Lookup* rules allow you to obtain and log the disposition of files traversing your network, while still allowing their transmission.
* *Block Malware* rules allow you to calculate the SHA-256 hash value of specific file types, query the AMP cloud to determine if files traversing
  your network contain malware, then block files that represent threats.

##### File Rule Action Options

Depending on the action you select, you have different options:

| File Rule Action Option | Block Files capable? | Block Malware capable? | Detect Files capable? | Malware Cloud Lookup capable? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Spero Analysis\* for MSEXE | no | yes, you can submit executable files | no | yes, you can submit executable files |
| Dynamic Analysis\* | no | yes, you can submit executable files with Unknown file dispositions | no | yes, you can submit executable files with Unknown file dispositions |
| Capacity Handling | no | yes | no | yes |
| Local Malware Analysis\* | no | yes | no | yes |
| Reset Connection | yes (recommended) | yes (recommended) | no | no |
| Store files | yes, you can store all matching file types | yes, you can store file types matching the file dispositions you select | yes, you can store all matching file types | yes, you can store file types matching the file dispositions you select |

\* For complete information about these options, see [Malware Protection Options (in File Rule Actions)](#id_98256) and its subtopics.

| **Caution** | ---   Enabling or disabling Store files in a Detect Files or Block Files rule, or adding the first or removing the last file rule that combines the Malware Cloud Lookup or Block Malware file rule action with an analysis option (Spero Analysis or MSEXE, Dynamic Analysis, or Local Malware Analysis) or a store files option (Malware, Unknown, Clean, or Custom), restarts the Snort process when you deploy configuration changes, temporarily interrupting traffic inspection. Whether traffic drops during this interruption or passes without further inspection depends on how the target device handles traffic. See [Snort Restart Traffic Behavior](get-started-deployment.html#concept_uc1_gtq_ty) for more information.   --- |

* [Malware Protection Options (in File Rule Actions)](#id_98256)
* [File Rule Actions: Evaluation Order](#ID-2193-00000329)

##### Malware Protection Options (in File Rule Actions)

The system applies several methods of file inspection and analysis to determine whether a file contains malware.

Depending on the options you enable in a file rule, the system inspects files using the following tools, in order:

1. [Spero Analysis](#ID-2199-000005fa) and [AMP Cloud Lookup](#id_98270)
2. [Local Malware Analysis](#concept_9CE3D1F1572541C695CE5C7682780311)
3. [Dynamic Analysis](#id_98269)

For a comparison of these tools, see [Comparison of Malware Protection Options](#concept_75BFE5A73EFB4216A109922D991FFD34).

(You can also, if you choose, block all files based on their file type. For more information, see [Block All Files by Type](#ID-2193-0000011a).)

See also information about Cisco's AMP for Endpoints product at [(Optional) Malware Protection with AMP for Endpoints](#id_96014) and subtopics.

* [Block All Files by Type](#ID-2193-0000011a)

###### Comparison of Malware Protection Options

The following table details the benefits and drawbacks of each type of file analysis, as well as the way each malware protection
method determines a file's disposition.

| Analysis Type | Benefit | Limitations | Malware Identification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Spero analysis | Structural analysis of executable files, submits Spero signature to the AMP Cloud for analysis | Less thorough than local malware analysis or dynamic analysis, only for executable files | Disposition changes from Unknown to Malware only on positive identification of malware. |
| Local malware analysis | Consumes fewer resources than dynamic analysis, and returns results more quickly, especially if the detected malware is common | Less thorough results than dynamic analysis | Disposition changes from Unknown to Malware only on positive identification of malware. |
| Dynamic analysis | Thorough analysis of unknown files using Secure Malware Analytics | Eligible files are uploaded to the public cloud or an on-premises appliance. It takes some time to complete analysis | Threat score determines maliciousness of a file. Disposition can be based on the threat score threshold configured in the file policy. |
| Spero analysis and local malware analysis | Consumes fewer resources than configuring local malware analysis and dynamic analysis, while still using AMP cloud resources to identify malware | Less thorough than dynamic analysis, Spero analysis only for executable files | Disposition changes from Unknown to Malware only on positive identification of malware. |
| Spero analysis and dynamic analysis | Uses full capabilities of AMP cloud in submitting files and Spero signatures | Results obtained less quickly than if using local malware analysis | Threat score changes based on dynamic analysis results for files preclassified as possible malware. Disposition changes based on configured threat score threshold in the file policy, and from Unknown to Malware if the Spero analysis identifies malware. |
| Local malware analysis and dynamic analysis | Thorough results in using both types of file analysis | Consumes more resources than either alone | Threat score changes based on dynamic analysis results for files preclassified as possible malware. Disposition changes from Unknown to Malware if local malware analysis identifies malware, or based on configured threat score threshold in the file policy. |
| Spero analysis, local malware analysis and dynamic analysis | Most thorough results | Consumes most resources in running all three types of file analysis | Threat score changes based on dynamic analysis results for files preclassified as possible malware. Disposition changes from Unknown to Malware if Spero analysis or local malware analysis identifies malware, or based on configured threat score threshold in the file policy. |
| (Block transmission of all files of a specified file type) | Does not require a Malware license  (This option is not technically a malware protection option.) | Legitimate files will also be blocked | (No analysis is performed.) |

| **Note** | ---   Preclassification does not itself determine a file's disposition; it is merely one of the factors that determine whether a file is eligible for Dynamic Analysis.   --- |
| --- | --- |

###### Spero Analysis

Spero analysis examines structural characteristics such as metadata and header information in executable files. After generating
a Spero signature based on this information, if the file is an eligible executable file, the device submits it to the Spero
heuristic engine in the AMP cloud. Based on the Spero signature, the Spero engine determines whether the file is malware.
You can also configure rules to submit files for Spero analysis without also submitting them to the AMP cloud.

Note that you cannot manually submit files for Spero analysis.

* [AMP Cloud Lookup](#id_98270)

###### AMP Cloud Lookup

For files that are eligible for assessment using Advanced Malware Protection, the management center performs a *malware cloud lookup*, querying the AMP cloud for the file's disposition based on its SHA-256 hash value.

To improve performance, the system caches dispositions returned by the cloud and uses the cached disposition for known files
rather than querying the AMP cloud. For more information about this cache, see [Cached Disposition Longevity](#id_97957).

###### Local Malware Analysis

Local malware analysis allows a managed device to locally inspect executables, PDFs, office documents, and other types of
files for the most common types of malware, using a detection rule set provided by the Talos Intelligence Group. Because local analysis does not query the AMP cloud, and does not run the file, local malware analysis saves time and system
resources.

If the system identifies malware through local malware analysis, it updates the existing file disposition from Unknown to
Malware. The system then generates a new malware event. If the system does not identify malware, it does not update the file
disposition from Unknown to Clean. After the system runs local malware analysis, it caches file information such as SHA-256
hash value, timestamp, and disposition, so that if detected again within a certain period of time, the system can identify
malware without additional analysis. For more information about the cache, see [Cached Disposition Longevity](#id_97957).

Local malware analysis does not require establishing communications with the Secure
Malware Analytics Cloud. However, you must configure communications with the cloud to submit files for
dynamic analysis, and to download updates to the local malware analysis ruleset.

* [Cached Disposition Longevity](#id_97957)

###### Cached Disposition Longevity

Dispositions returned from an AMP cloud query, associated threat scores, and dispositions assigned by local malware analysis,
have a time-to-live (TTL) value. After a disposition has been held for the duration specified in the TTL value without update,
the system purges the cached information. Dispositions and associated threat scores have the following TTL values:

* Clean — 4 hours
* Unknown — 1 hour
* Malware — 1 hour

If a query against the cache identifies a cached disposition that timed out, the system re-queries the local malware analysis
database and the AMP cloud for a new disposition.

###### Dynamic Analysis

You can configure your file policy to automatically submit files for
dynamic analysis using Secure
Malware Analytics (formerly Threat Grid), Cisco’s file analysis and threat intelligence platform.

Devices submit eligible files to Secure
Malware Analytics (either the public cloud or to an on-premises appliance, whichever you have
specified) regardless of whether the device stores the file.

Secure
Malware Analytics runs the file in a sandbox environment, analyzes the file's behavior to determine
whether the file is malicious, and returns a threat score that indicates the likelihood
that a file contains malware. From the threat score, you can view a dynamic analysis
summary report with the reasons for the assigned threat score. You can also look in Secure
Malware Analytics to view detailed reports for files that your organization submitted, as well as
scrubbed reports with limited data for files that your organization did not submit.

For more information about Cisco Secure
Malware Analytics, see <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/threat-grid/index.html>

To configure your system to perform dynamic analysis, see the topics under [Dynamic Analysis Connections](#concept_FB66F79FEFE4468AA3BFEDC5E8828ACA).

* [Which Files Are Eligible for Dynamic Analysis?](#ID-2199-000005d8)
* [Dynamic Analysis and Capacity Handling](#concept_A984E86C24BB45999649813390D295E3)

###### Which Files Are Eligible for Dynamic Analysis?

A file's eligibility for dynamic analysis depends on:

* the file type
* the file size
* the file rule's
  action

Additionally:

* The system submits only files that match the file rules you configure.
* The file must have a malware cloud lookup disposition of Unknown or Unavailable at the time the file is sent for analysis.
* The system must preclassify the file as potential malware.

###### Dynamic Analysis and Capacity Handling

Capacity handling allows you to temporarily store files that are otherwise eligible for dynamic analysis if the system is
temporarily unable to submit files to the cloud, either because the device cannot communicate with the cloud or because the
maximum number of submissions has been reached. The system submits the stored files when the hindering condition has passed.

Some devices can store files on the device hard drive or in a malware storage pack. See also [Malware Storage Pack](#ID-2199-000006a5).

* [Captured Files and File Storage](#ID-2199-0000067c)
* [Malware Storage Pack](#ID-2199-000006a5)

###### Captured Files and File Storage

The file storage feature allows you to capture selected files detected in traffic, and automatically store a copy of the file
temporarily to a device’s hard drive, or, if installed, to the malware storage pack.

After your device captures the files, you can:

* Store captured files on the device’s hard drive for later
  analysis.
* Download the stored file to a local computer for further manual
  analysis or archival purposes.
* Manually submit eligible captured files for AMP cloud lookup or dynamic analysis.

Note that once a device stores a file, it will not re-capture it
if the file is detected in the future and the device still has that file
stored.

| **Note** | ---   When a file is detected for the first time on your network, you can generate a file event that represents the file’s detection. However, if your file rule performs a malware cloud lookup, the system requires additional time to query the AMP cloud and return a disposition. Due to this delay, the system cannot store this file until the second time it is seen on your network, and the system can immediately determine the file’s disposition.   --- |
| --- | --- |

Whether the system captures or stores a file, you can:

* Review information about the captured file from Analysis > Files > Captured Files, including whether the file was stored or
  submitted for dynamic analysis, file disposition, and threat score, allowing you to quickly review possible malware threats
  detected on your network.
* View the file’s trajectory to determine how it traversed your
  network and which hosts have a copy.
* Add the file to the clean list or custom detection list to
  always treat the file as if it had a clean or malware disposition on future
  detection.

You configure file rules in a file policy to capture and store files of a specific type, or with a particular file disposition,
if available. After you associate the file policy with an access control policy and deploy it to your devices, matching files
in traffic are captured and stored. You can also limit the minimum and maximum file sizes to store.

Stored files are not included in system backups.

You can view captured file information under Analysis > Files > Captured Files, and download a copy for offline analysis.

###### Malware Storage Pack

Based on your file policy configuration, your device may store a
substantial amount of file data to the hard drive. You can install a malware
storage pack in the device; the system stores files to the malware storage
pack, allowing more room on the primary hard drive to store events and
configuration files. The system periodically deletes older files. If the
device's primary hard drive does not have enough available space, and does not
have an installed malware storage pack, you cannot store files.

| **Caution** | ---   Do not attempt to install a hard drive that was not supplied by Cisco in your device. Installing an unsupported hard drive may damage the device. Malware storage pack kits are available for purchase **only** from Cisco. Contact Support if you require assistance with the malware storage pack.   --- |
| --- | --- |

Without a malware storage pack installed, when you configure a
device to store files, it allocates a set portion of the primary hard drive’s
space to captured file storage. If you configure capacity handling to
temporarily store files for dynamic analysis, the system uses the same hard
drive allocation to store these files until it can resubmit them to the cloud.

When you install a
malware storage pack in a device and configure file storage or capacity
handling, the device allocates the entire malware storage pack for storing
these files. The device cannot store any other information on the malware
storage pack.

When the allocated space for captured file storage fills to
capacity, the system deletes the oldest stored files until the allocated space
reaches a system-defined threshold. Based on the number of files stored, you
may see a substantial drop in disk usage after the system deletes files.

If a device has already stored files when you install a malware
storage pack, the next time you restart the device, any captured files or
capacity handling files stored on the primary hard drive are moved to the
malware storage pack. Any future files the device stores are stored to the
malware storage pack.

For more information on using MSP on the Firepower devices, see the [Firepower Hardware Installation Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/security/firepower-ngfw/products-installation-guides-list.html#anchor580) for your device.

###### Block All Files by Type

If your organization wants to block not only the transmission of malware files, but all files of a specific type, regardless
of whether the files contain malware, you can do so.

File control is supported for all file types where the system can detect malware, plus many additional file types. These file
types are grouped into basic categories, such as multimedia (swf, mp3), executables (exe, torrent), and PDFs.

Blocking all files based on their type is not technically a malware protection feature; it does not require a Malware license and does not query the AMP cloud.

##### File Rule Actions: Evaluation Order

A file policy will likely contain multiple rules with different actions for different situations. If more than one rule can
apply to a particular situation, the evaluation order described in this topic applies. In general, simple blocking takes
precedence over malware inspection and blocking, which takes precedence over simple detection and logging.

The order of precedence of file-rule actions is:

* *Block Files*
* *Block Malware*
* *Malware Cloud Lookup*
* *Detect Files*

If configured, TID also impacts action prioritization. For more information, see [Threat Intelligence Director-Management Center Action Prioritization](threat-intelligence-director.html#reference_sfb_wf5_5y).

#### Creating File Rules

| **Caution** | ---   Enabling or disabling Store files in a Detect Files or Block Files rule, or adding the first or removing the last file rule that combines the Malware Cloud Lookup or Block Malware file rule action with an analysis option (Spero Analysis or MSEXE, Dynamic Analysis, or Local Malware Analysis) or a store files option (Malware, Unknown, Clean, or Custom), restarts the Snort process when you deploy configuration changes, temporarily interrupting traffic inspection. Whether traffic drops during this interruption or passes without further inspection depends on how the target device handles traffic. See [Snort Restart Traffic Behavior](get-started-deployment.html#concept_uc1_gtq_ty) for more information.   --- |
| --- | --- |

##### Before you begin

If you are configuring rules for malware protection, see [Configure File Policies](#id_104661).

##### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Select Policies > Access Control > Malware & File. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click the edit icon to modify an existing file policy. |
| **Step 3** | In the file policy editor, click Add Rule. |
| **Step 4** | Select an Application Protocol and Direction of Transfer as described in [File Rule Components](#ID-2193-000002e9). |
| **Step 5** | Select one or more File Types.  The file types you see depend on the selected application protocol, direction of transfer, and action.  You can filter the list of file types in the following ways:   * Select one or more File Type Categories, then click All types in selected Categories. * Search for a file type by its name or description. For example, type `Windows` in the Search name and description field to display a list of Microsoft Windows-specific files.  | **Tip** | Hover your pointer over a file type to view its description. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 6** | Select a file rule Action as described in [File Rule Actions](#id_98452), with consideration for [File Rule Actions: Evaluation Order](#ID-2193-00000329).  The actions available to you depend on the licenses you have installed. See [License Requirements for File and Malware Policies](#id_101648). |
| **Step 7** | Depending on the action you selected, configure options:   * reset the connection after blocking the file * store files that match the rule * enable Spero analysis\* * enable local malware analysis\* * enable dynamic analysis\* and capacity handling   \* For information about these options, see [File Rule Actions](#id_98452) and [Malware Protection Options (in File Rule Actions)](#id_98256) and its subtopics. |

##### What to do next

* If you are configuring policies for malware protection, return to [Configure File Policies](#id_104661).
* Deploy configuration changes; see [Deploy Configuration Changes](get-started-deployment.html#task_75E181687ECF4EFC8EB6AF4509C20C0B).

### Access Control Rule Logging for Malware Protection

When the system detects a prohibited file (including malware)
according to the settings in the file policy, it automatically logs an event to
the
Secure Firewall Management
Center
database. If you do not want to log file or malware events, you can disable
this logging on a per-access-control-rule basis.

The system also logs the end of the associated connection to the
Secure Firewall Management
Center
database, regardless of the logging configuration of the invoking access
control rule.

## Retrospective Disposition Changes

File dispositions can change. For example, as new information is discovered, the AMP cloud can determine that a file that
was previously thought to be clean is now identified as malware, or the reverse—that a malware-identified file is actually
clean. When the disposition changes for a file you queried in the past week, the AMP cloud notifies the system so it can automatically
take action the next time it detects that file being transmitted. A changed disposition is called a *retrospective* disposition.

## File and Malware Inspection Performance and Storage Options

Increasing the file sizes can affect the performance of the
system.

Table 4. Advanced Access Control File and malware defense Options

| Field | Description | Guidelines and Restrictions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Limit the number of bytes inspected when doing file type detection | Specifies the number of bytes inspected when performing file type detection. | 0 - 4294967295 (4GB)  0 removes the restriction.  The default value is the maximum segment size of a TCP packet (1460 bytes). In most cases, the system can identify common file types using the first packet.  To detect ISO files, enter a value greater than 36870. |
| Allow file if cloud lookup for Block Malware takes longer than (seconds) | Specifies how long the system will hold the last byte of a file that matches a Block Malware rule and that does not have a cached disposition, while malware cloud lookup occurs. If the time elapses without the system obtaining a disposition, the file passes.

## (Optional) Malware Protection with AMP for Endpoints

Cisco's AMP for Endpoints is a separate malware-protection product that can supplement malware protection provided by the
system and be integrated with your Firepower deployment.

AMP for Endpoints is Cisco’s enterprise-class Advanced Malware Protection solution that runs as a lightweight connector on
individual users' *endpoints* (computers and mobile devices) to discover, understand, and block advanced malware outbreaks, advanced persistent threats,
and targeted attacks.

Benefits of AMP for Endpoints include:

* configure custom malware detection policies and profiles for your entire organization, as well as perform flash and full scans
  on all your users’ files
* perform malware analysis, including view heat maps, detailed file information, network file trajectory, and threat root causes
* configure multiple aspects of outbreak control, including automatic quarantines, application blocking to stop non-quarantined
  executables from running, and exclusion lists
* create custom protections, block execution of certain applications based on group policy, and create custom Allowed Applications
  lists
* use the AMP for Endpoints management console to help you mitigate the effect of malware. The management console provides a
  robust, flexible web interface where you control all aspects of your AMP for Endpoints deployment and manage all phases of
  an outbreak.

For detailed information about AMP for Endpoints, see:

* <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/amp-for-endpoints/index.html>.
* Online help in the AMP for Endpoints management console.

### About Integrating Firepower with AMP for Endpoints

If your organization has deployed AMP for Endpoints, you can optionally integrate that product with your Firepower deployment.

Integration with AMP for Endpoints does not require a dedicated Firepower license.

* [Benefits of Integrating Firepower and AMP for Endpoints](#id_96013)
* [AMP for Endpoints and AMP Private Cloud](#id_96160)
* [Integrate Firepower and Secure Endpoint](#ID-2193-000004ba)

#### Benefits of Integrating Firepower and AMP for Endpoints

Integrating your AMP for Endpoints deployment with your system offers the following benefits:

* Centralized Blocked Applications and Allowed Applications lists configured in AMP for Endpoints can determine verdicts for
  file SHAs sent from Firepower to the AMP cloud for disposition.

  See [Centralized File Lists from AMP for Endpoints](#id_97757).
* The system can import malware events detected by AMP for Endpoints into Secure Firewall Management
  Center so you can manage these events along with malware events generated by the system. Imported data for these events includes
  scans, malware detections, quarantines, blocked executions, and cloud recalls, as well as indications of compromise (IOCs)
  that management center displays for hosts that it monitors.

  For more information, see Malware Event Analysis with AMP for Endpoints in the [Cisco Secure Firewall Management
  Center Administration Guide](http://www.cisco.com/go/firepower-config)
  .
* You can view file trajectory and other details in the AMP for Endpoints console.

  For details, see Work with Event Data in the AMP for Endpoints
  Console in the [Cisco Secure Firewall Management
  Center Administration Guide](http://www.cisco.com/go/firepower-config)
  .

| **Important** | ---   If you use a Cisco AMP Private Cloud, see limitations at [AMP for Endpoints and AMP Private Cloud](#id_96160).   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### AMP for Endpoints and AMP Private Cloud

If you configure a Cisco AMP private cloud to collect AMP endpoint data on your network, all AMP for Endpoints connectors
send data to the private cloud, which forwards that data to the Secure Firewall Management
Center. The private cloud does not share any of your endpoint data over an external connection.

If your organization has deployed an AMP private cloud, all connections to the AMP cloud funnel through the private cloud,
which acts as an anonymized proxy to ensure the security and privacy of your monitored network. This includes importing AMP
for Endpoints data. The private cloud does not share any of your endpoint data over an external connection.

The following integration features are not available if you use an AMP private cloud:

* Use of Blocked Applications and Allowed Applications lists configured in AMP for Endpoints. (These lists are used to block
  or allow files.)
* Visibility in AMP for Endpoints of malware events generated from Firepower.

You can configure multiple private clouds to support the capacity you require.

#### Integrate Firepower and Secure Endpoint

If your organization has deployed Cisco's Secure Endpoint product, you can integrate that application with Firepower to achieve the benefits described in [Benefits of Integrating Firepower and AMP for Endpoints](#id_96013).

When you integrate with Secure Endpoint, you must configure the Secure Endpoint connection even if you already have malware defense (AMP for Firepower) connections configured. You can configure multiple Secure Endpoint cloud connections.

| **Note** | ---   The Secure Endpoint connections that have not registered successfully does not affect malware defense.   --- |
| --- | --- |

##### Before you begin

* You must be an Admin user to perform this task.
* If your deployment uses Cisco AMP Private Cloud, see limitations at [AMP for Endpoints and AMP Private Cloud](#id_96160).
* Secure Endpoint must be set up and working properly on your network.
* The management center must have direct access to the Internet.
* Make sure your management center and Secure Endpoint can communicate with each other. See the topics
  under Security, Internet Access, and Communication Ports in
  the [Cisco Secure Firewall Management
  Center Administration Guide](http://www.cisco.com/go/firepower-config).
* If you are
  connecting to the AMP cloud after either restoring your
  Secure Firewall Management
  Center
  to factory defaults or reverting to a previous version, use the AMP for
  Endpoints management console to remove the previous connection.
* You will need your Secure Endpoint credentials to log in to the Secure Endpoint console during this procedure.

##### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Choose Integration > AMP > AMP Management. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click Add AMP Cloud Connection. |
| **Step 3** | From the Cloud Name drop-down list, choose the cloud you want to use:   * The AMP cloud closest to the geographical location of your Secure Firewall Management   Center.  `APJC` is Asia/Pacific/Japan/China. * For AMP private cloud (AMPv), choose Private Cloud and proceed as described in [Cisco AMP Private Cloud](#ID-2193-0000051c). |
| **Step 4** | If you want to use this cloud for both malware defense and Secure Endpoint, select the Use for AMP for Firepower check box.  If you configured a different cloud to handle malware defense (AMP for Firepower) communications, you can clear this check box; if this is your only AMP cloud connection, you cannot. |
| **Step 5** | Click Register.  A spinning state icon indicates that a connection is pending, for example, after you configure a connection on the Secure Firewall Management Center, but before you authorize it using the Secure Endpoint management console. A Denied  (denied icon) indicates that the cloud denied the connection or the connection failed for another reason. |
| **Step 6** | Confirm that you want to continue to the Secure Endpoint management console, then log into the management console. |
| **Step 7** | Using the management console, authorize the AMP cloud to send Secure Endpoint data to management center. |
| **Step 8** | If you want to restrict the data that the management center receives, select specific groups within your organization for which you want to receive information.  By default, the AMP cloud sends data for all groups. To manage groups, choose Management > Groups on the Secure Endpoint management console. For detailed information, see the management console online help. |
| **Step 9** | Click Allow to enable the connection and start the transfer of data.  Clicking Deny returns you to the Secure Firewall Management Center, where the connection is marked as denied. If you navigate away from the Applications page on the Secure Endpoint management console, and neither deny nor allow the connection, the connection is marked as pending on the Secure Firewall Management Center’s web interface. The health monitor does **not** alert you of a failed connection in either of these situations. If you want to connect to the AMP cloud later, delete the failed or pending connection, then recreate it.  Incomplete registration of the Secure Endpoint connection does not disable the malware defense connection. |
| **Step 10** | To verify that the connection is correctly configured:   1. On the Integration > AMP > AMP Management page, click the Cloud Name that includes `AMP for Endpoints` in the Cisco AMP Solution Type column. 2. In the AMP for Endpoints console window that displays, choose Accounts > Applications. 3. Verify that your management center is on the list. 4. In the AMP for Endpoints console window, choose Manage > Computers. 5. Verify that your management center is on the list. |

---

##### What to do next

* In the AMP for Endpoints console window, configure settings as needed. For example, define group membership for your management
  center and assign policies. For information, see the AMP for Endpoints online help or other documentation.
* In high availability configurations, you must configure AMP cloud connections independently on the Active and Standby instances
  of the Firepower Management Center; these configurations are not synchronized.
* The default health policy warns you if the management center cannot connect to the AMP for Endpoints portal after an initial successful connection, or if the connection is deregistered
  using the AMP portal.

  Verify that the AMP for Endpoints Status monitor is enabled under System > Health > Policy.

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

## URL Filtering Overview

Use the URL filtering feature to control the websites that users on your network can access:

* Category and reputation-based URL filtering—With a URL Filtering license, you can control access to websites based on the
  URL’s general classification (category) and risk level (reputation). This is the recommended option.
* Manual URL filtering—With any license, you can manually specify individual URLs, groups of URLs, and URL lists and feeds to
  achieve granular, custom control over web traffic. For more information, see [Manual URL Filtering](#ID-2189-0000027e).

See also [Security Intelligence](access-security-intelligence.html#ID-2192-00000004), a similar but different feature for blocking malicious URLs, domains, and IP addresses.

* [About URL Filtering with Category and Reputation](#ID-2189-000001c1)

### About URL Filtering with Category and Reputation

With a URL Filtering license, you can control access to websites
based on the category and reputation of requested URLs:

* Category—A general classification for the URL. For example, ebay.com belongs to the Auctions category, and monster.com belongs
  to the Job Search category.

  A URL can belong to more than one category.
* Reputation—How likely the URL is to be used for purposes that might be against your organization’s security policy. Reputations
  range from Unknown risk (level 0) or
  Untrusted (level 1) to
  Trusted (level 5).

#### Benefits of Category and Reputation-Based URL Filtering

URL categories and reputations help you quickly configure URL filtering. For example, you can use access control to block
untrusted URLs in the Hacking category. Or, you can use QoS to rate limit traffic from sites in the Streaming Video category. There are also categories for types of threats, such as a Spyware and Adware category.

Using category and reputation data simplifies policy creation and administration. It grants you assurance that the system
controls web traffic as expected. Because Cisco continually updates its threat intelligence with new URLs, as well as new
categories and risks for existing URLs, the system uses up-to-date information to filter requested URLs. Sites that (for example)
represent security threats, or that serve undesirable content, may appear and disappear faster than you can update and deploy
new policies.

Some examples of how the system can adapt include:

* If an access control rule blocks all gaming sites, as new domains get registered and classified as Games, the system can block
  those sites automatically. Similarly, if a QoS rule rate limits all streaming video sites, the system can automatically limit traffic to new
  Streaming Video sites.
* If an access control rule blocks all malware sites and a shopping page gets infected with malware, the system can recategorize
  the URL from Shopping to Malware Sites and block that site.
* If an access control rule blocks
  untrusted social networking sites and somebody posts a link on their profile page that contains links to malicious payloads, the system
  can change the reputation of that page from
  Favorable to
  Untrusted and block it.

#### Limitations of category-based filtering in SSL policy Do Not Decrypt rules

You can optionally choose to include categories in your SSL policies. These categories, also referred to as *URL filtering*, are updated by the Cisco Talos intelligence group. Updates are based on machine learning and human analysis according to
content that is retrievable from the website destination and sometimes from its hosting and registration information. Categorization
is *not* based on the declared company vertical, intent, or security.

| **Note** | ---   Don't confuse URL filtering with application detection, which relies on reading some of the packet from a website to determine more specifically what it is (for example, Facebook Message or Salesforce). For more information, see [Best Practices for Configuring Application Control](access-overview.html#Cisco_Reference.dita_f97efb5c-8bf6-4955-8797-98763fbddba0).   --- |

#### URL Category and Reputation Descriptions

##### Category Descriptions

A description of each URL category is available from <https://www.talosintelligence.com/categories>.

Be sure to click Threat Categories to see those categories.

##### Reputation Level Descriptions

Go to <https://talosintelligence.com/reputation_center/support> and look in the Common Questions section.

#### URL Filtering Data from the Cisco Cloud

Adding a URL Filtering license automatically enables the URL
filtering feature. This allows traffic handling based on a website’s general
classification, or *category*, and risk level, or *reputation*.

Adding a URL Filtering license automatically enables the
URL filtering feature. This allows traffic handling based on a website’s general
classification, or *category*, and risk level, or *reputation*.

When you enable (or re-enable) URL filtering, the management center queries Cisco for URL data and pushes the dataset to managed devices.
Automatic updates of this dataset are enabled by default; we strongly recommend
you do not disable these updates.

When users browse the web, the system uses the local
dataset for category and reputation information. When users browse to an URL
whose category and reputation is not in the local dataset or a cache of
previously accessed websites, by default the system submits it to the cloud for
threat intelligence evaluation and adds the result to the cache. (You can
disable this cloud lookup; see [URL Filtering Options](#id_74537).)

The set of URL categories may change periodically. When you receive a change
notification, review your URL filtering configurations to make sure traffic is
handled as expected. For more information, see [If the URL Category Set Changes, Take Action](#id_119222).

## Best Practices for URL Filtering

Keep in mind the following guidelines and limitations for URL filtering:

### Filter by Category and Reputation

Follow the instructions in [How to Configure URL Filtering with Category and Reputation](#id_92450).

### Configure Your Policy to Inspect Packets That Must Pass Before a URL Can Be Identified

The system cannot filter URLs before:

* A monitored connection is established between a client and server.
* The system identifies the DNS, HTTP or HTTPS application in the session.
* The system identifies the requested domain or URL (for encrypted sessions, from a non-encrypted domain name, the ClientHello message or the server certificate).

This identification should occur within 3 to 5 packets, or after the server certificate exchange in the TLS/SSL handshake if the traffic is encrypted.

**Important!** To ensure that your system examines these initial packets that would otherwise pass, see [Inspection of Packets That Pass Before Traffic Is Identified](advanced-nap-access-control.html#ID-2194-0000001f) and subtopics.

If early traffic matches all other rule conditions but identification is incomplete, the system allows the packet to pass
and the connection to be established (or the TLS/SSL handshake to complete). After the system completes its identification, the system applies the appropriate rule action to
the remaining session traffic.

### Block Threat Categories

Be sure that your policies specifically address Threat categories, which identify known malicious sites. Do this in addition
to blocking sites with poor reputations.

For example, to protect your network from malicious sites, you must block all Threat categories. Additionally, Talos recommends
that you block only sites with Poor category. You can block questionable reputations if you have an aggressive security posture,
but this may result in a higher amount of false positives.

For specifics, see Threat Categories at the URL in [URL Category and Reputation Descriptions](#id_70529).

### URL Conditions and Rule Order

* Position URL rules after all other rules that *must* be hit.
* URLs can belong to more than one category. It is possible to want to allow one category of websites and block another—whether
  explicitly or by relying on the default action. In this case, make sure you create and order URL rules so you get the desired
  effect, depending on whether the allow or the block should take precedence.

For additional guidelines for rules, see the following topics: [Best Practices for Access Control Rules](access-overview.html#ID-2176-000005b6).

### Uncategorized or Reputationless URLs

When you build a URL rule, you first choose the category you want to match. If you explicitly choose Uncategorized URLs, you cannot further constrain by reputation.

Uncategorized URLs with Untrusted reputation are handled by the Malicious Sites category. If you want to block uncategorized sites with any other reputation level (such as Questionable), you must block
all uncategorized sites.

After selecting a category and a reputation level, you can optionally select Apply to unknown reputation. For example, you can create a rule that applies to sites with Untrusted, Questionable, and unknown reputations.

You cannot manually assign categories and reputations to URLs, but in access control and QoS policies, you can manually block
specific URLs. See [Manual URL Filtering](#ID-2189-0000027e). See also [Dispute URL Category and Reputation](#id_68485).

### URL Filtering for Encrypted Web Traffic

When performing URL filtering on encrypted web traffic, the
system:

* (If DNS filtering is enabled) Checks to see if the system has previously seen the originating domain or the domain is in the
  local reputation database, and if so, takes action based on the reputation and category of the domain. Otherwise, the system
  processes the traffic based on your configurations for encrypted traffic, even if Retry URL cache miss lookup is enabled in the access control policy's advanced settings.
* Disregards the encryption protocol; a rule matches both HTTPS
  and HTTP traffic if the rule has a URL condition but not an application
  condition that specifies the protocol.
* Does not use
  URL lists. You must use URL objects and groups instead.
* Matches HTTPS traffic based on the subject common name
  in the public key certificate used to encrypt the traffic, and also
  evaluates the reputation of any other URLs presented at any time during the
  transaction, including the post-decryption HTTP URL.
* Disregards subdomains within the subject common name.
* Does not
  display an HTTP response page for encrypted connections blocked by access
  control rules (or any other configuration); see
  [Limitations to HTTP Response Pages](#id_28700).

### URL Filtering and TLS Server Identity Discovery

The latest version of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol 1.3, defined by [RFC 8446](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8446), is the preferred protocol for many web servers to provide secure communications. Because the TLS 1.3 protocol encrypts the
server's certificate for additional security, and the certificate is needed to match application and URL filtering criteria
in access control rules, the Firepower System provides a way to extract the server certificate *without* decrypting the entire packet.

Access control policy advanced settings offer an Early application detection and URL categorization option for TLS Server Identity Discovery.

We strongly recommend enabling it for any traffic you want to match on application or URL criteria, especially if you want
to perform deep inspection of that traffic. An
SSL policy is not required because *traffic is not decrypted* in the process of extracting the server certificate.

| **Note** | ---  * Because the certificate is decrypted, TLS server identity discovery can reduce performance depending on the hardware platform. * TLS server identity discovery is not supported in inline tap mode or passive mode deployments. * Enabling TLS server identity discovery is not supported on any Secure Firewall   Threat Defense Virtual deployed to AWS. If you have any such managed devices managed by the Secure Firewall Management   Center, the connection event PROBE\_FLOW\_DROP\_BYPASS\_PROXY  increments every time the device attempts to extract the server certificate. * TLS Server Identity Discovery also operates on TLS 1.2 sessions.  --- |
| --- | --- |

For more information, see [Access Control Policy Advanced Settings](access-policies.html#ID-2176-00000314).

### HTTP/2

The system can extract HTTP/2 URLs from TLS certificates, but not from a payload.

### Manual URL Filtering

* Specify URLs using a custom Security Intelligence list or feed object. Do not use a URL object or directly enter a URL into
  the rule. For details, see [Manual URL Filtering Options](#Cisco_Reference.dita_72248e9a-706c-4e53-9bf1-de72f87b1beb).
* If you manually filter specific URLs using URL objects or by entering URLs directly into the rule, carefully consider other
  traffic that might be affected. To determine whether network traffic matches a URL condition, the system performs a simple
  substring match. If the requested URL matches any part of the string, the URLs are considered to match.
* If you use manual URL filtering to create exceptions to other rules, position the specific rule with the exceptions above
  the general rule that would otherwise apply.

### Search Query Parameters in URLs

The system does not use search query parameters in the URL to
match URL conditions. For example, consider a scenario where you block all
shopping traffic. In that case, using a web search to search for amazon.com is
not blocked, but browsing to amazon.com is.

### URL Filtering in High Availability Deployments

For guidelines for URL filtering with Firepower Management Centers in high availability, see URL Filtering and Security Intelligence in the [Cisco Secure Firewall Management
Center Administration Guide](http://www.cisco.com/go/firepower-config)
.

### Memory Limitations for Selected Device Models

* Device models with less memory store less URL data locally, and the system may therefore check the cloud more frequently to
  determine category and reputation for sites that are not in the local database.

  Lower-memory devices include:

  + Firepower 1010
  + Threat Defense Virtual with 8 GB of RAM

### URL Matching for TLS session Resumption on Threat Defense

Use URL matching with Snort 2 under the following conditions:

* If there is no TLS session resumption and SSL policy is enabled or the Client Hello message contains Server Name Indication
  (SNI) extension.
* If there is TLS session resumption and SSL policy is not enabled or the Client Hello message does not contain SNI extension.

* [Filtering HTTPS Traffic](#concept_292D0D26F9414181910DCC3265D95E91)
* [Use Categories in URL Filtering](#recommendations-for-using-categories-in-url-filtering)

### Filtering HTTPS Traffic

To filter encrypted traffic, the system determines the requested URL based on information passed during the TLS/SSL handshake: the subject common name in the public key certificate used to encrypt the traffic.

HTTPS filtering,
unlike HTTP filtering, disregards subdomains within the subject common name. Do
not include subdomain information when manually filtering HTTPS URLs in access
control or QoS policies. For example, use example.com rather than
www.example.com.

| **Tip** | ---   In an SSL policies, you can handle and decrypt traffic to specific URLs by defining a distinguished name SSL policy rule condition. The common name attribute in a certificate’s subject distinguished name contains the site’s URL. Decrypting HTTPS traffic allows access control rules to evaluate the decrypted session, which improves URL filtering.   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Controlling Traffic by Encryption Protocol

The system disregards the encryption protocol (HTTP vs HTTPS)
when performing URL filtering in access control or QoS policies. This occurs for both manual and
reputation-based URL conditions. In other words, URL filtering treats traffic
to the following websites identically:

* http://example.com/
* https://example.com/

To configure a rule that matches only HTTP or HTTPS traffic, add
an application condition to the rule. For example, you could allow HTTPS access
to a site while disallowing HTTP access by constructing two access control
rules, each with an application and URL condition.

The first rule allows HTTPS traffic to the website:

* Action: Allow
* Application:
  HTTPS
* URL: example.com

The second rule blocks HTTP access to the same website:

* Action: Block
* Application:
  HTTP
* URL: example.com

### Use Categories in URL Filtering

#### Limitations of categories in Do Not Decrypt rules

You can optionally choose to include categories in your SSL policies. These categories, also referred to as *URL filtering*, are updated by the Cisco Talos intelligence group. Updates are based on machine learning and human analysis according to
content that is retrievable from the website destination and sometimes from its hosting and registration information. Categorization
is *not* based on the declared company vertical, intent, or security. While we strive to continuously update and improve URL filtering
categories, it is not an exact science. Some websites are not categorized at all and it's possible some websites might be
improperly categorized.

Avoid overusing categories in do not decrypt rules to avoid decrypting traffic without a reason; for example, the Health and
Medicine category includes the [WebMD](https://www.webmd.com/) website, which does not threaten patient privacy.

Following is a sample decryption policy that can prevent decryption for websites in the Health and Medicine category but allow
decryption for [WebMD](https://www.webmd.com/) and everything else. General information about decryption rules can be found in [Guidelines for Using TLS/SSL Decryption](encrypted-traffic-rules.html#id_103862).

| **Note** | ---   Don't confuse URL filtering with application detection, which relies on reading some of the packet from a website to determine more specifically what it is (for example, Facebook Message or Salesforce). For more information, see [Best Practices for Configuring Application Control](access-overview.html#Cisco_Reference.dita_f97efb5c-8bf6-4955-8797-98763fbddba0).   --- |

### Enable URL Filtering Using Category and Reputation

You must be an Admin user to perform this task.

#### Before you begin

Complete prerequisites described in [How to Configure URL Filtering with Category and Reputation](#id_92450).

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Choose Integration > Other Integrations. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click Cloud Services. |
| **Step 3** | Configure [URL Filtering Options](#id_74537). |
| **Step 4** | Click Save. |

---

* [URL Filtering Options](#id_74537)

#### URL Filtering Options

Adding a URL Filtering license automatically
enables the URL filtering feature. This allows traffic handling
based on a website’s general classification, or *category*, and
risk level, or *reputation*.

When you enable (or re-enable) URL
filtering, the management center automatically queries Cisco for URL data and pushes the dataset
to managed devices. This process may take some
time.

If you use SSL rules to handle encrypted traffic, also see [TLS/SSL Rule Guidelines and Limitations](encrypted-traffic-rules.html#id_65029).

##### Enable Automatic Updates

If you Enable Automatic
Updates (the default), the management center checks the cloud every 30 minutes for updates.
If you
need strict control over when the system contacts external
resources, disable automatic updates and instead create a recurring
task using the scheduler. See Automated URL Filtering Updates Using a
Scheduled Task in the [Cisco Secure Firewall Management
Center Administration Guide](http://www.cisco.com/go/firepower-config)
.

##### Update Now

Click Update Now to perform
a one-time, on-demand URL data update. You cannot start an on-demand
update if an update is already in progress. Although daily updates
tend to be small, if it has been more than five days since your last
update, new URL data may take up to 20 minutes to download,
depending on your bandwidth. Then, it may take up to 30 minutes to
perform the update itself.

##### Query Cisco Cloud for Unknown URLs

Allows the system to submit URLs to the cloud for
threat intelligence evaluation when users browse to a website whose
category and reputation are not in the local dataset. This option is
enabled by
default.
Disable this option if you do not want to submit your uncategorized
URLs, for example, for privacy reasons. However, note that
connections to uncategorized URLs do *not* match rules with
category or reputation-based URL conditions. You cannot assign
categories or reputations to URLs manually.

##### Cached URLs Expire

This setting is relevant only
if Query Cisco Cloud for Unknown URLs
is enabled.

Caching category and reputation data makes web browsing faster. By
default, cached data for URLs never expires, for fastest
performance.

To minimize instances of URLs matching on stale data, you can set URLs in
the cache to expire. For greater accuracy and currency of threat
data, choose a shorter expiration time. A cached URL refreshes
*after* the first time a user on the network accesses
it after the specified time has passed. The first user does not see
the refreshed result, but the next user who visits this URL does see
the refreshed result.

### Configuring URL Conditions

Protect your network by controlling access to sites based on URL category and reputation.

#### Before you begin

| **Attention** | ---   As a prerequisite, ensure that you create at least a Monitor rule at the top of your access control policy, containing Category or Reputation parameters. This is essential to see ANY category or reputation data for ANY URLs that hit the particular access control policy.  If there is no rule in the access control policy with the category or reputation parameters configured, the Connection Events page in the management center shows no data for Category or Reputation for any URL traffic that hits the access control policy.   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | In the rule editor, click the following for URL conditions:   * Access control or QoS—Click URLs. In the new access control UI, select this option from the Destinations and Applications column. * SSL—Click Category. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Find and choose the URL categories that you want to control:  In an access control or QoS rule, click Category.  For effective protection from malicious sites, you must block URLs in all Threat categories. Additionally, Talos recommends that you block only sites with Poor category. You can block questionable reputations if you have an aggressive security posture, but this may result in a higher amount of false positives. For a list of Threat categories, see [URL Category and Reputation Descriptions](#id_70529).  Be sure to click the arrows at the bottom of the list to see all available categories. |
| **Step 3** | (Optional) Constrain URL categories by choosing a Reputation.  Note that if you explicitly match Uncategorized URLs, you cannot further constrain by reputation. Choosing a reputation level also includes other reputations either more or less severe than the level you choose, depending on the rule action:   * Includes less severe reputations—If the rule allows or trusts web traffic. For example, if you configure an access control   rule to allow Favorable (level 4), it also automatically allows Trusted (level 5) sites. * Includes more severe reputations—If the rule rate limits, decrypts, blocks, or monitors web traffic. For example, if you configure   an access control rule to block Questionable sites (level 2), it also blocks Untrusted (level 1) sites.   If you change the rule action, the system automatically changes the reputation levels in URL conditions.  Optionally, select Apply to unknown reputation. |
| **Step 4** | Click Add to Rule, or drag and drop. In the new access control UI, click Add URL. |
| **Step 5** | (Optional) To choose predefined URL objects, or URL lists and feeds in an access control or QoS rule, click URL, select the objects, and add them to the destination.  These objects implement manual URL filtering rather than category-based filtering. |
| **Step 6** | Save or continue editing the rule. |

---

#### Example: URL Condition in an Access Control Rule

The following graphic shows the URL condition for an access control rule that blocks all malware sites, all untrusted sites,
and all social networking sites with a reputation level of Neutral or worse.

![Screenshot of a sample URL condition](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/440001-450000/447001-448000/447694.jpg)

The following table summarizes how you build the condition.

| Blocked URL | Category | Reputation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Malware sites, regardless of reputation | Malware Sites | Any |
| Any untrusted URL (level 1) | Any | 1 - Untrusted |
| Social networking sites with a reputation level of Neutral or worse (levels 1 through 3) | Social Network | 3 - Neutral |

* [Rules with URL Conditions](#id_86143)
* [URL Rule Order](#id_61103)

#### Rules with URL Conditions

The following table lists rules that support URL conditions, and the types of filtering that each rule type supports.

| Rule Type | Supports Category and Reputation Filtering? | Supports Manual Filtering? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Access control | Yes | Yes |
| SSL policy | Yes | No; use distinguished name conditions instead |
| QoS | Yes | Yes |

To use URL filtering in an
SSL policy that has Do Not Decrypt rule conditions, see [Use Categories in URL Filtering](#recommendations-for-using-categories-in-url-filtering).

#### URL Rule Order

For the most effective URL matching, place rules that include URL conditions before other rules, particularly if the URL rules
are block rules and the other rules meet both of the following criteria:

* They include application conditions.
* The traffic to be inspected is encrypted.

If you configure exceptions to a rule, put the exception above the other rule.

### DNS Filtering: Identify URL Reputation and Category During DNS Lookup

The Enable reputation enforcement on DNS traffic option is enabled by default on the Advanced tab of each new access control policy. This option slightly modifies URL filtering behavior and is applicable only when URL filtering is enabled and configured.

When this option is enabled:

* The system evaluates domain category and reputation early in URL transactions, when the browser looks up the domain name to
  get the IP address
* Category and reputation of encrypted traffic can often be determined without decryption

  If DNS filtering cannot determine the URL of encrypted traffic, that traffic is processed using your configurations for encrypted
  traffic.

* [Enable DNS Filtering to Identify URLs During Domain Lookup](#Cisco_Task_in_List_GUI.dita_098595b1-f5dd-401a-a771-ff02f2585de5)
* [DNS Filtering Limitations](#id_116398)
* [DNS Filtering and Events](#Cisco_Concept.dita_062304ce-d79c-4cc3-8225-81a0f4774ef6)

#### Enable DNS Filtering to Identify URLs During Domain Lookup

DNS filtering is enabled by default in new access control policies. However, additional configurations may be required in
order for this setting to take effect.

##### Before you begin

* URL filtering using category and reputation must be licensed, enabled, and configured.

  (DNS filtering does not use the following settings in the URLs tab: URL groups, URL objects, URL lists and feeds, and URLs
  entered into the "Enter URL" text box.)
* See limitations at [DNS Filtering Limitations](#id_116398).

##### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | In your access control policy's advanced settings, select Enable reputation enforcement on DNS traffic. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | In the same policy, for each access control rule that has URL category and reputation blocking configured:   * Application conditions—If the application condition is anything other   than any (or empty), add   DNS to that list. Other DNS-related   options are not relevant for this purpose. * Port condition—If the port/protocol condition is anything other than   any (or empty), add   DNS\_over\_TCP and   DNS\_over\_UDP. |
| **Step 3** | Save your changes. |

---

##### What to do next

If you are done making changes: [Deploy Configuration Changes](get-started-deployment.html#task_75E181687ECF4EFC8EB6AF4509C20C0B).

#### DNS Filtering Limitations

Traffic that matches rules having action Block with reset, Interactive Block, or Interactive Block with reset will be treated as if the rule action were Block.

End users trying to access a blocked URL will experience this as an unexplained inability to connect to their page; the connection
will spin and then time out.

#### DNS Filtering and Events

Connection events generated by DNS filtering are logged using the following fields: DNS Query, URL Category, URL Reputation,
and Destination Port. The DNS Query field holds the domain name; the URL field will be blank for DNS filtering matches. The
Destination Port will be 53.

Also:

* When the access control rule action is Allow or Trust, two connection events will be generated for the same traffic, one for DNS filtering (with the DNS Query field populated) and one for URL filtering (with the URL field populated).
* The first time the system encounters a particular URL, you will see two events for that single session: One event showing
  uncategorized/reputationless for the DNS Query, and one event showing the actual category and reputation for the URL, which
  were retrieved during the DNS Query and applied to the session while processing using standard URL filtering.

## Manual URL Filtering

In access control and QoS rules, you can supplement or selectively override category and reputation-based URL filtering by manually filtering individual
URLs, groups of URLs, or URL lists and feeds.

For example, you might use access control to block a category of websites that are not appropriate for your organization.
However, if the category contains a website that is appropriate, and to which you want to provide access, you can create a
manual Allow rule for that site and place it before the Block rule for the category.

You can perform this type of URL filtering without a special license.

Manual URL filtering is not supported in SSL rules; instead, use distinguished name conditions.

| **Caution** | ---   Depending on how you implement manual URL filtering, URL matching may not be what you intend. See [Manual URL Filtering Options](#Cisco_Reference.dita_72248e9a-706c-4e53-9bf1-de72f87b1beb).   --- |
| --- | --- |

* [Manual URL Filtering Options](#Cisco_Reference.dita_72248e9a-706c-4e53-9bf1-de72f87b1beb)
* [Supplement or Selectively Override Category and Reputation-Based URL Filtering](#Cisco_Task_in_List_GUI.dita_31c1591a-3048-4536-bf40-2d5e34f06303)

### Manual URL Filtering Options

There are several ways to specify URLs for manual URL filtering:

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **(Best practice)**  Use custom Security Intelligence URL list or feed objects. | This is the recommended method for manual URL filtering.  You can create a new list or feed, or choose an existing one in an access control or QoS rule.  For more information, see [Custom Security Intelligence Lists and Feeds](objects-object-mgmt.html#Cisco_Concept.dita_b07428de-9d37-469f-bf9a-8169dc59b585) and subtopics. |
| Use URL objects, individually or as groups. URL objects are described at [URL](objects-object-mgmt.html#ID-2243-00000414).  Or  Enter URLs directly into the access control rule. (The Enter URL option on the rule page in the web interface.) | If you do not include a path (that is, there are no / characters in the URL), the match is based on the server’s hostname only. If you include one or more / character, the entire URL string is used for a substring match. Then, a URL is considered a match if any of the following are true:   * The string is at the beginning of the URL. * The string follows a dot. * The string contains a dot in the beginning. * The string follows the :// characters.   For example, ign.com matches ign.com or www.ign.com, but not versign.com.   | **Note** | We recommend that you do not use manual URL filtering to block or allow individual web pages or parts of sites (that is, URL strings with / characters), as servers can be reorganized and pages moved to new paths. | | --- | --- |   The Enter URL option does not support wildcards. |

### Supplement or Selectively Override Category and Reputation-Based URL Filtering

In access control or QoS rules, you can use Security Intelligence URL lists and feeds
to supplement, or to specify exceptions to, your category and reputation-based URL
filtering rules.

**Important!** If the list or feed you are configuring in this procedure contains
exceptions to category- or reputation-based rules, put this rule above those rules
in the rule order.

In SSL rules, use distinguished name conditions to configure parallel behavior.

#### Before you begin

* Configure URL filtering using category and reputation. See [Configuring URL Conditions](#id_17110).
* Understand important best practices for manual URL filtering. See [Best Practices for URL Filtering](#ID-2189-00000301) and [Manual URL Filtering Options](#Cisco_Reference.dita_72248e9a-706c-4e53-9bf1-de72f87b1beb).
* Configure one or more Security Intelligence objects (lists or feeds) containing the URLs that you want to use for manual filtering.
  See [Custom Security Intelligence Lists and Feeds](objects-object-mgmt.html#Cisco_Concept.dita_b07428de-9d37-469f-bf9a-8169dc59b585).

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Navigate to the access control or QoS policy in which you will define the rule. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Create or edit the rule in which you will add the new condition:   * If you are supplementing a category- or reputation-based URL filtering   rule, edit the existing rule. * If you are overriding or creating exceptions to a category- or   reputation-based URL filtering rule, create a new rule. |
| **Step 3** | Select the list or feed you created as the destination URL criteria. |
| **Step 4** | Save the rule. |

---

## Configure HTTP Response Pages

As part of access control, you can configure an *HTTP response page* to display when the system blocks web requests, using either access control rules or the access control policy default action.

The response page displayed depends on how you block the session:

* Block Response Page: Overrides the default browser or server page that explains that the connection was denied.
* Interactive Block Response Page: Warns users, but also allows them to click a button (or refresh the page) to load the originally requested site. Users may
  have to refresh after bypassing the response page to load page elements that did not load.

If you do not choose a response page, the system blocks sessions without interaction or explanation.

* [Limitations to HTTP Response Pages](#id_28700)
* [Requirements and Prerequisites for HTTP Response Pages](#Cisco_Reference.dita_cceb3d1a-32f1-40c8-8d22-cc8f988ec2fd)
* [Choosing HTTP Response Pages](#ID-2189-0000041e)
* [Configure Interactive Blocking with HTTP Response Pages](#id_28702)

### Limitations to HTTP Response Pages

* The system displays a response page only for unencrypted or decrypted HTTP/HTTPS connections blocked (or interactively blocked)
  either by access control rules or by the access control policy default action. The system does not display a response page
  for connections that are blocked by any other policy or mechanism.
* The system cannot display a response page if the connection is reset (RST packet sent). If you enable response pages, the
  system prioritizes that configuration. Even if you choose Block with reset or Interactive Block with reset as the rule action, the system displays the response page and does not reset matching web connections. To ensure that blocked
  web connections are reset, you must disable response pages.

  Note that all non-web traffic that matches the rule *is* blocked with reset.
* The system does not display a response page for encrypted connections that are blocked by access control rules (or any other
  configuration). Access control rules evaluate encrypted connections if you did not configure an SSL policy, or your SSL policy
  passes encrypted traffic.

  For example, the system cannot decrypt HTTP/2 or SPDY sessions. If web traffic encrypted using one of these protocols reaches
  access control rule evaluation, the system does not display a response page if the session is blocked.

  However, the system does display a response page for connections that are decrypted by the SSL policy, then blocked (or interactively
  blocked) either by access control rules or by the access control policy default action. In these cases, the system encrypts
  the response page and sends it at the end of the reencrypted SSL stream.
* The system does not display a response page when web traffic is blocked because of a promoted access control rule (an early-placed
  blocking rule with only simple network conditions).
* If a URL is entered without specifying "http" or "https", and the browser initiates the connection on port 80, and the user
  clicks through a response page, and the connection is subsequently redirected to port 443, the user will not see a second
  interactive response page because the response to this URL is already cached.
* The system does not display a response page when web traffic is blocked before the system identifies the requested URL; see
  [Best Practices for URL Filtering](#ID-2189-00000301).
* The system does not display a response page if the block URL access control rule is configured after the allow application
  rule.

### Requirements and Prerequisites for HTTP Response Pages

#### Model Support

Any

#### Supported Domains

Any

#### User Roles

* Admin
* Access Admin
* Network Admin

### Choosing HTTP Response Pages

Reliable display of HTTP response pages depends on your network configuration, traffic loads, and size of the page. Smaller
pages are more likely to display successfully.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | In the access control policy editor, click HTTP Responses. In the new UI, select this option from the More drop-down arrow at the end of the packet flow line.  If the controls are dimmed, settings are inherited from an ancestor policy, or you do not have permission to modify the configuration. If the configuration is unlocked, uncheck Inherit from base policy to enable editing. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Choose the Block Response Page and Interactive Block Response Page:   * System-provided—Displays a generic response. Click View (View button) to view the code for this page. * Custom—Create a custom response page. A pop-up window appears, prepopulated with system-provided code that you can replace   or modify by clicking Edit (edit icon). A counter shows how many characters you have used. * None—Disables the response page and blocks sessions without interaction or explanation. To quickly disable interactive blocking   for the whole access control policy, choose this option. |
| **Step 3** | Click Save to save the policy. |

---

#### What to do next

* Deploy configuration changes; see [Deploy Configuration Changes](get-started-deployment.html#task_75E181687ECF4EFC8EB6AF4509C20C0B).

### Configure Interactive Blocking with HTTP Response Pages

When you configure interactive blocking, users can load an originally requested site after reading a warning. Users may have
to refresh after bypassing the response page to load page elements that did not load.

| **Tip** | ---   To quickly disable interactive blocking for the whole access control policy, display neither the system-provided page nor a custom page. The system then blocks all connections without interaction.   --- |
| --- | --- |

If a user does not bypass an interactive block, matching traffic is denied without further inspection. If a user bypasses
an interactive block, the access control rule allows the traffic, although the traffic may still be subject to deep inspection
and blocking.

By default, a user bypass is in effect for 10 minutes (600 seconds) without displaying the warning page on subsequent visits.
You can set the duration to as long as a year, or you can force the user to bypass the block every time. This limit applies
to every Interactive Block rule in the policy. You cannot set the limit per rule.

Logging options for interactively blocked traffic are identical to those in allowed traffic, but if a user does not bypass
the interactive block, the system can log only beginning-of-connection events. When the system initially warns the user, it
marks any logged beginning-of-connection event with the `Interactive Block` or `Interactive Block with reset` action. If the user bypasses the block, additional connection events logged for the session have an action of `Allow`.

* [Configuring Interactive Blocking](#ID-2189-0000037d)
* [Setting the User Bypass Timeout for a Blocked Website](#ID-2189-000003b4)

#### Configuring Interactive Blocking

The following procedure explains how to allow users to bypass URL filtering rules.

##### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | As part of access control, configure an access control rule that matches web traffic; see [Create and Edit Access Control Rules](access-rules.html#ID-2190-00000090):   * Action—Set the rule action to Interactive   Block or Interactive Block with   reset; see [Access Control Rule Interactive Blocking Actions](access-rules.html#ID-2190-000002a8). * Conditions—Use URL conditions to specify the web traffic to   interactively block; see [URL Conditions (URL Filtering)](#ID-2189-00000181). * Logging—Assume users will bypass the block and choose logging options accordingly; see Logging for   Allowed Connections in the [Cisco Secure Firewall Management   Center Administration Guide](http://www.cisco.com/go/firepower-config)   . * Inspection—Assume users will bypass the block and choose deep inspection   options accordingly; see [Access Control Overview](access-overview.html#ID-2177-00000004). |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | (Optional) In the access control policy HTTP Responses, choose a custom interactive-block HTTP response page; see [Choosing HTTP Response Pages](#ID-2189-0000041e). |
| **Step 3** | (Optional) In access control policy Advanced settings, change the user bypass timeout; see [Setting the User Bypass Timeout for a Blocked Website](#ID-2189-000003b4).  After a user bypasses a block, the system allows the user to browse to that page without warning until the timeout period elapses. |
| **Step 4** | Save the access control policy. |
| **Step 5** | Deploy configuration changes; see [Deploy Configuration Changes](get-started-deployment.html#task_75E181687ECF4EFC8EB6AF4509C20C0B). |

---

#### Setting the User Bypass Timeout for a Blocked Website

The following procedure explains how to set the time allowed for browsing after the
user bypasses a URL filtering block. After the timeout expires, the user must bypass
the block again.

##### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Click Policies > Access Control and edit the policy. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click Advanced. In the new UI, select Advanced Settings from the More drop-down arrow at the end of the packet flow line. |
| **Step 3** | Click Edit (edit icon) next to General Settings.  If View (View button) appears instead, settings are inherited from an ancestor policy, or you do not have permission to modify the settings. If the configuration is unlocked, uncheck Inherit from base policy to enable editing. |
| **Step 4** | In the Allow an Interactive Block to bypass blocking for (seconds) field, enter the number of seconds that must elapse before the user bypass expires.  Setting this value to 0 means the interactive block response is displayed once and the user bypass never expires. |
| **Step 5** | Click OK. |
| **Step 6** | Click Save to save the policy. |

## Dispute URL Category and Reputation

If you disagree with a category or reputation assigned by Talos, you can submit a request for re-evaluation.

### Before you begin

You will need your Cisco account credentials.

### Procedure

---

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | In the management center web interface, do one of the following:      | Location of Dispute Option | Path to Dispute Option | | --- | --- | | Cloud Services configuration page | a. Navigate to the Integration > Other Integration > Cloud Services page.  b. Select Dispute URL categories and reputations. | | Manual URL Lookup page | a. Navigate to the manual URL Lookup page: Analysis > Advanced > URL.  b. Look up the URL in question.  c. To see Dispute at the end of the table row, hover over the relevant entry in the list of results, then click dispute. | | URL Connection Event | a. Navigate to any page under the Analysis > Connections menu that has a table that includes URLs.  b. Right-click an item in the URL Category or URL Reputation column (show hidden columns if needed) and select an option. |   The Talos web site opens in a separate browser window. |
| **Step 2** | Sign in to the Talos site with your Cisco credentials. |
| **Step 3** | Review the information and follow the instructions on the Talos page. |
| **Step 4** | Look for information on the Talos site about how submitted disputes are handled and what response to expect, if any.  The dispute process is independent of Firepower products. |

## If the URL Category Set Changes, Take Action

The set of URL Filtering categories may occasionally change, in order to accommodate new web trends and evolving usage patterns.

These changes affect both policies and events.

Shortly before URL category changes are scheduled to occur, and after they occur, you will see alerts in the list of rules
in any access control, SSL, and QoS policy that is affected by the changes, and on URL or Category in rules that you edit.

You should take action when you see these alerts.

| **Note** | ---   Updates to the URL category set as described in this topic are distinct from the changes that simply add new URLs to existing categories or re-classify misclassified URLs. This topic does not apply to category changes for individual URLs.   --- |
| --- | --- |

### Procedure

---

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | If you see an alert beside a rule in an access control policy, hover over the alert to see details. |
| **Step 2** | If the alert mentions changes to URL categories, edit the rule to see further details. |
| **Step 3** | Hover over the URL or Category in the rule dialog to see general information about the type of changes. |
| **Step 4** | If you see an alert beside a category, click the alert to view details. |
| **Step 5** | If you see a "More information" link in the description of a change, click it to view information about the category on the Talos web site.  Alternately, see a list and descriptions all categories at the link in [URL Category and Reputation Descriptions](#id_70529). |
| **Step 6** | Depending on the type of change, take appropriate action:       | Type of Category Change | What The System Will Do | What You Should Do | | --- | --- | --- | | Existing category will soon be deprecated | Nothing yet. You have a few weeks to change affected rules.  If you do not take action in that time, the system eventually will not be able to redeploy the policy. | Remove this category from all rules that include it. If there is a similar new category, consider using that category instead. | | New category is added | By default, the system does not use newly added categories. | Consider creating new rules for the new category. | | Existing category is deleted | The category will appear in the rule in strikethrough text (that is, with a line through the category name.) | You must delete the obsolete category from the rule before you can deploy the policy. | |
| **Step 7** | Check your SSL rules (Category) for these changes and take action as needed. |
| **Step 8** | Check your QoS rules (URL) for these changes and take action as needed. |

---

### What to do next

Deploy configuration changes; see [Deploy Configuration Changes](get-started-deployment.html#task_75E181687ECF4EFC8EB6AF4509C20C0B).

* [URL Category and Reputation Changes: Effect on Events](#id_92548)

### URL Category and Reputation Changes: Effect on Events

* When URL categories change, events that the system processed before the category change will be associated with their original
  category names and will be labeled with Legacy. Events that the system processed after the category change will be associated with the new categories.

  Older, legacy events will age out of the system over time.
* If a URL does not have a reputation at the time it was processed, the URL Reputation column in the event viewer will be empty.

## Troubleshoot URL Filtering

### Expected URL Category is Missing from the Categories List

The URL filtering feature uses a different set of categories than the Security Intelligence feature; the category that you
expect to see may be a Security Intelligence category. To see those categories, look at the URLs tab on the Security Intelligence tab in an access control policy.

### Initial Packets Are Passing Uninspected

See [Inspection of Packets That Pass Before Traffic Is Identified](advanced-nap-access-control.html#ID-2194-0000001f) and subtopics.

See also [DNS Filtering: Identify URL Reputation and Category During DNS Lookup](#Cisco_Concept.dita_405e2fba-4c20-4874-822d-fa1e7079f928).

### Health alert: "URL Filtering registration failure"

Verify that your management center and any proxies can connect to the Cisco cloud. You may need information about URL Filtering and URL categories in the following
topics: Internet Access Requirements and Communication Port Requirements in the [Cisco Secure Firewall Management
Center Administration Guide](http://www.cisco.com/go/firepower-config).

### How can I find the category and reputation of a particular URL?

Do a manual lookup. See Finding URL Category and Reputation in the [Cisco Secure Firewall Management
Center Administration Guide](http://www.cisco.com/go/firepower-config).

### Error when attempting a manual lookup: "Cloud Lookup Failure for <URL>"

Make sure the feature is properly enabled. See the prerequisites in Finding URL Category and Reputation in the [Cisco Secure Firewall Management
Center Administration Guide](http://www.cisco.com/go/firepower-config).

### URL appears to be incorrectly handled based on its URL category and reputation

**Problem:** The system does not handle the URL correctly based on its URL category and reputation.

**Solutions:**

* Verify that the URL category and reputation associated with the URL are what you think they are. See Finding URL Category and Reputation in the [Cisco Secure Firewall Management
  Center Administration Guide](http://www.cisco.com/go/firepower-config).
* The following issues may be addressed by settings described in [URL Filtering Options](#id_74537), accessible using [Enable URL Filtering Using Category and Reputation](#id_86512).

  + The URL cache may hold stale information. See information about
    the Cached URLs Expire setting in [URL Filtering Options](#id_74537).
  + The local data set may not be updated with current information from the cloud. See information about the Enable Automatic Updates setting in [URL Filtering Options](#id_74537).
  + The system may be configured to *not* check the cloud for
    current data. See information about the Query Cisco
    cloud for unknown URLs setting in [URL Filtering Options](#id_74537).
* Your access control policy may be configured to pass traffic to the URL without checking the cloud. See information about
  the Retry URL cache miss lookup setting in [Access Control Policy Advanced Settings](access-policies.html#ID-2176-00000314).
* See also [Best Practices for URL Filtering](#ID-2189-00000301).
* If the URL is processed using an SSL rule, see [TLS/SSL Rule Guidelines and Limitations](encrypted-traffic-rules.html#id_65029) and [SSL Rule Order](#id_29380)
* Verify that the URL is being handled using the access control rule that you think it is being handled by, and that the rule
  does what you think it does. Consider rule order.
* Verify that the local URL category and reputation database on the management center is successfully being updated from the cloud and that managed devices are successfully being updated from the management center.

  Status of these processes are reported in the Health Monitor, in the URL Filtering Monitor module and the Threat Data Updates on Devices module. For details, see Health in the [Cisco Secure Firewall Management
  Center Administration Guide](http://www.cisco.com/go/firepower-config)
  .

If you want to immediately update the local URL category and reputation database, go to Integration > Other Integrations, click Cloud
Services, then click Update Now. For more information, see [URL Filtering Options](#id_74537).

### A URL category or reputation is not correct

For access control or QoS rules: Use manual filtering, paying careful attention to rule order. See [Manual URL Filtering](#ID-2189-0000027e) and [Configuring URL Conditions](#id_17110).

For SSL rules: Manual filtering is not supported. Instead, use distinguished name conditions.

See also [Dispute URL Category and Reputation](#id_68485).

### Web pages are slow to load

There is a tradeoff between security and performance. Some options:

* Consider modifying the Cached URLs Expire setting. Click Integration > Other Integrations, then select Cloud
  Services. For information, see [URL Filtering Options](#id_74537).
* Consider deselecting the Retry URL cache miss lookup setting in [Access Control Policy Advanced Settings](access-policies.html#ID-2176-00000314).

### Events Do Not Include URL Category and Reputation

* Make sure you have included applicable URL rules in an access control policy, the rules are active, and the policies have
  been deployed to the relevant devices.
* URL category and reputation do not appear in an event if the connection is processed before it matches a URL rule.
* The rule that handles the connection must be configured for URL category and reputation.
* Even if you have configured URL categories in the Categories tab in an SSL rule, you must also configure the URLs tab in a
  rule in your access control policy.

### DNS Filtering is not working

Make sure you have completed all prerequisites and steps in [Enable DNS Filtering to Identify URLs During Domain Lookup](#Cisco_Task_in_List_GUI.dita_098595b1-f5dd-401a-a771-ff02f2585de5).

### An End User Tries to Access a Blocked URL and the Page Just Spins and Times Out

When DNS Filtering is enabled and end users access a URL that is blocked, the page will spin but not load. End users are
not notified that the page is blocked. This is currently a limitation when DNS filtering is enabled.

See [DNS Filtering Limitations](#id_116398).

### Events Include URL Category and Reputation but URL Field is Blank

If the DNS Query field is populated and the URL field is empty, this is expected when the DNS filtering feature is enabled.

See [DNS Filtering and Events](#Cisco_Concept.dita_062304ce-d79c-4cc3-8225-81a0f4774ef6).

### Multiple Events are Generated for a Single Transaction

A single web transaction sometimes generates two connection events, one for DNS filtering and one for URL filtering. This
is expected when DNS filtering is enabled and:

* the access control rule action for the traffic is Allow or Trust.
* the system encounters a URL for the first time.

See [DNS Filtering and Events](#Cisco_Concept.dita_062304ce-d79c-4cc3-8225-81a0f4774ef6).

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |
| **Hours** | 24 hours a day, 7 days a week |

## Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco

There are several ways to stay connected and receive the latest security vulnerability information from Cisco. Customers should review the following table, and subsequent summaries, to determine the appropriate option for them:

| **Cisco.com** | <https://www.cisco.com/security/> |
| --- | --- |
| **Email** | cust-security-announce@cisco.com |
| **RSS** | <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44> |
| **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API** | [https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT/](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) |
| **My Notifications** | <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html> |

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

### **RSS Feeds**

Cisco security vulnerability information is also available via RSS feeds from Cisco.com. These feeds are free and do not require an active Cisco.com registration. For information on how to subscribe to the RSS feeds, visit the [Cisco Security RSS Feeds page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44).

### **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API**

The Cisco PSIRT openVuln application programming interface (API) is a RESTful API that conforms to the [representational state transfer](https://restfulapi.net/) (REST) software architectural style and allows customers to obtain Cisco security vulnerability information in different machine-consumable formats. To learn about accessing and using the API, visit the [PSIRT page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) on the Cisco DevNet website.

### **My Notifications**

The [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) allows registered Cisco.com users to subscribe to and receive important Cisco product and technology information, including Cisco Security Advisories. This service provides an improved unified subscription experience, allowing users to choose the timing of notifications as well as the notification delivery method (email or RSS feed). The level of access will be determined by the subscriber's relationship with Cisco.

### Creating a Notification

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

The following topics explain access
control rules. These rules control which traffic is allowed to pass through the
device, and apply advanced services to the traffic, such as intrusion
inspection.

## Best Practices for Access Control

The access control policy is your primary tool for protecting your internal networks
and preventing your users from accessing undesirable external network resources,
such as inappropriate web sites. Thus, we recommend that you pay special attention
to this policy and fine-tune it to get the level of protection and connectivity that
you need.

The following procedure provides an overview of the basic things you should do with
the access control policy. This is an overview, and does not provide exhaustive
steps for performing each task.

To get to the access control policy, choose Policies > Access Control.

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Configure the default action for the policy.  The default action handles connections that do not match the specific rules in the policy. By default, this action is Block, so that anything you miss in the rules is blocked. Thus, you simply need to write access control rules that allow desirable traffic. This is the traditional way to configure the access control policy.  You can do the opposite, where you allow traffic by default, and write rules that drop known undesirable traffic, so that you do not need to have rules for everything you want to allow. This makes it easy for new services to be used, but opens the risk that new undesirable traffic will get through before you notice it. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click the Access Policy Settings (Gear/Settings button.) button, and enable the TLS Server Identity Discovery option.  This option improves the initial application detection and URL category and reputation identification for TLS 1.3 connections. If you do not enable this option, TLS 1.3 traffic might not match your intended rules. This option can also improve the efficacy of decryption rules. |
| **Step 3** | Create as few access control rules as possible.  With traditional firewalls, you might end up with tens of thousands of rules for various combinations of IP address and port. With a next-generation firewall, you can use advanced inspection and avoid some of these detailed rules. The fewer rules you have, the faster the system can evaluate traffic, and the easier it will be for you to find and fix problems within your rule set. |
| **Step 4** | Enabling logging on your access control rules.  Statistics are collected for matching traffic only if you enable logging. Your monitoring dashboards will be inaccurate if you do not enable logging. |
| **Step 5** | Put very specific rules at the top of the policy, and ensure that specific rules are above any more general rule that would match the connections a specific rule would also match.  The policy is evaluated top-down, first match wins. Thus, if you put in a rule that blocks all traffic to a specific subnet, then follow it with a rule that allows access to a single IP address within the subnet, traffic to that address will not be allowed, because the first rule will block it.  In addition, place rules that target traffic based only on traditional criteria such as ingress/egress interface, and source/destination IP address, port, or Geolocation, ahead of rules that require deep inspection, such as those that apply to user criteria, URL filtering, or application filtering. Because these rules do not require inspection, putting them early can get you quicker access control decisions for matching connections.  For more suggestions, see [Best Practices for Access Control Rule Order](#concept_F36CB276D40F4D9ABBBDB8E771DC32D4). |
| **Step 6** | Pair Block and Allow rules to target subsets of traffic.  For example, it is likely that you want to allow a lot of HTTP/HTTPS traffic, yet block access to some undesirable sites such as pornography or gambling. You can accomplish this by creating the following rules and keeping them sequential within the policy (for example, rules 11 and 12).   * A URL filtering Block rule that targets undesirable URL categories,   applied to the inside security zone (source) and outside security   zone (destination), and any IP address, port, or Geolocation. For   example, Block Botnets, Child Abuse Content, Cryptojacking, DNS   Tunneling, Ebanking Fraud, Exploits, Extreme, Filter Avoidance,   Gambling, Hacking, Hate Speech, High Risk Sites and Locations,   Illegal Activities, Illegal Downloads, Illegal Drugs, Malicious   Sites, Malware Sites, Mobile Threats, P2P Malware Node, Phishing,   Pornography, Spam, Spyware and Adware. * An application filtering Allow rule for the HTTP and HTTPS   applications, applied to the inside security zone (source) and   outside security zone (destination), and any IP address, port, or   Geolocation. After the URL filtering rule blocks access to unwanted   web resources, this rule allows all other HTTP/HTTPS access. |
| **Step 7** | Use advanced next-generation firewall features to target traffic regardless of IP address or port.  Attackers or other bad actors can frequently change IP addresses and ports to evade traditional access control traffic-matching criteria. Instead, use the following next-generation features:   * User criteria—Configure the Identity policy to obtain information   about the user who is initiating the traffic. Ideally, your Active   Directory server organizes users into groups, and you can create   access control rules that allow or block traffic based on user group   membership. For example, allow Engineers to access your development   subnets, but implicitly block anyone who is not in the Engineers   group. Use groups rather than individual user names, so you do not   need to continually update the rules as people are added to the   network. * Application criteria—Use application filtering criteria to allow or   block types of applications. This, if a user changes ports for an   HTTP connection, the system can recognize that it is HTTP, even   though it isn't going to port 80. For more suggestions, see [Best Practices for Application Filtering](#concept_02DF0685418F419EA1CADA6693872521). * URL category and reputation criteria—Use URL filtering based on   category to dynamically allow or block sites based on the type of   site. Within the site type, or category, you can fine-tune your rule   based on whether the site has a reputation as a good actor or a bad   actor. By using category and reputation, you will not need to   constantly adjust your rules as sites change URLs, which you would   have to do if you tried to manually block sites by URL. For more   suggestions, see [Best Practices for Effective URL Filtering](#concept_F6A0AA79F3F54EE7BBFA3646D00596A7).  You can also apply URL   category/reputation filtering rules to the FQDN in a DNS lookup   request. The system can prevent the DNS response for blocked   category/reputation, effectively blocking the user’s connection   attempt. For details, see [Filtering DNS Requests Based on URL Category and Reputation](#Cisco_Task_in_List_GUI.dita_144597f9-f18a-47d8-a82e-35a4b93043d5). |
| **Step 8** | Apply intrusion inspection to all of your Allow rules.  One of the powerful aspects of next-generation firewalls is that you can apply intrusion inspection and access control using the same device. Apply an intrusion policy to each Allow rule, so that if an attack does enter your network through a normally benign path, you can catch it and drop the attacking connection.  If your default action is Allow, you can also apply intrusion protection for traffic that matches the default action. |
| **Step 9** | Also configure the Security Intelligence policy to block unwanted IP addresses and URLs.  The Security Intelligence policy is applied before the access control policy, so it can block unwanted connections before your access control rules are even evaluated. This can provide an early block and help you reduce the complexity of your access control rules. |
| **Step 10** | Consider implementing the SSL Decryption policy.  The system cannot perform deep inspection on encrypted traffic. If you configure the SSL Decryption policy, the access control policy is applied to a decrypted version of the traffic. Thus, deep inspection can identify attacks (using the intrusion policy), and rule matching is better because application and URL filtering can be applied more effectively. Any traffic that the access control policy allows is then re-encrypted before being sent out of the device, so the end user does not lose the protection of encryption. |
| **Step 11** | Enable object group search to simplify the deployment of your rules.  Starting with release 7.2, this feature is enabled by default on new deployments, but is not automatically enabled on upgraded systems.  Enabling object group search reduces memory requirements for access control policies that include network objects. However, it is important to note that object group search might also decrease rule lookup performance and thus increase CPU utilization. You should balance the CPU impact against the reduced memory requirements for your specific access control policy. In most cases, enabling object group search provides a net operational improvement.  You can set this option using FlexConfig by issuing the object-group-searchaccess-control  command; use the no  form of the command in the negate template. |

* [How Other Security Policies Impact Access Control](#concept_903B1EBDCA764E799E26B92F0CF8D608)

### Access Control Rules and the Default Action

Use the access control
policy to allow or block access to network resources. The policy consists of a
set of ordered rules, which are evaluated from top to bottom. The rule applied
to traffic is the first one where all the traffic criteria are matched.

You can control access
based on:

* Traditional
  network characteristics such as source and destination IP addresses, protocol,
  ports, and interfaces (in the form of security zones).
* The fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) of the source or destination (in the form of a network object). Traffic matching is
  based on the IP address returned for the name from a DNS lookup.
* The security group tag (SGT) assigned to the source or destination by the Cisco
  Identity Services Engine (ISE).
* The application
  that is being used. You can control access based on the specific application,
  or you can create rules that cover categories of applications, applications
  tagged with a particular characteristic, the type of application (client,
  server, web), or the application's risk or business relevance rating.
* The destination
  URL of a web request, including the generalized category of the URL. You can
  refine category matches based on the public reputation of the target site.
* The URL category and reputation of an FQDN in a DNS lookup request. You can block
  the DNS response for unwanted categories or poor reputations, effectively
  preventing the subsequent connection attempt.
* The user who is
  making the request, or the user groups to which the user belongs.

For unencrypted
traffic that you allow, you can apply IPS inspection to check for threats and
block traffic that appears to be an attack. You can also use file policies to
check for prohibited files or malware.

Any traffic that does
not match an access rule is handled by the access control
Default
Action. If you allow traffic by default, you can apply intrusion
inspection to the traffic. However, you cannot perform file or malware
inspection on traffic handled by the default action.

### Application Filtering

You can use access
control rules to filter traffic based on the application used in the
connection. The system can recognize a wide variety of applications, so that
you do not need to figure out how to block one web application without blocking
all web applications.

For some popular
applications, you can filter on different aspects of the application. For
example, you could create a rule that blocks Facebook Games without blocking
all of Facebook.

You can also create
rules based on general application characteristics, blocking or allowing entire
groups of applications by selecting risk or business relevance, type, category,
or tag.
**However, as you
select categories in an application filter, look over the list of matching
applications to ensure you are not including unintended applications.** For a
detailed explanation of the possible groupings, see
[Application Criteria](#concept_1F51EAD7EE7D4107BCF4547CD8D0653B).

* [Application Control for Encrypted and Decrypted Traffic](#concept_28D9D3ECCAC8424ABF27B39DC3A92311)
* [Filtering on Common Industrial Protocol (CIP) and Modbus Applications (ISA 3000)](#id_110363)
* [Best Practices for Application Filtering](#concept_02DF0685418F419EA1CADA6693872521)

#### Application Control for Encrypted and Decrypted Traffic

If an application uses encryption, the system might not be able to
identify the application.

The system can detect application traffic encrypted with StartTLS,
including SMTPS, POPS, FTPS, TelnetS, and IMAPS. In addition, it can identify
certain encrypted applications based on the Server Name Indication in the TLS
ClientHello message, or the subject distinguished name value from the server
certificate.

Use the application filters dialog box to determine if your application
requires decryption by selecting the following Tags, then examining the list of
applications.

* SSL Protocol—You do not need to decrypt
  traffic tagged as SSL Protocol. The system can recognize this traffic and apply
  your access control action. Access control rules for the listed applications
  should match to expected connections.
* Decrypted Traffic—The system can recognize this traffic only if you first decrypt the traffic. Configure SSL decryption rules for this traffic.

#### Filtering on Common Industrial Protocol (CIP) and Modbus Applications (ISA 3000)

You can enable the Common Industrial Protocl (CIP) and Modbus pre-processors on Cisco ISA 3000 devices, and filter on CIP and Modbus applications in access control rules. All CIP application names start with “CIP,” such
as CIP Write. There is only one application for Modbus.

To enable the pre-processors, you must go into expert mode in a CLI session (SSH or Console) and issue the following command
to enable one or both of these Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) applications.

sudo /usr/local/sf/bin/enable\_scada.sh {cip | modbus | both}

For example, to enable both pre-processors:

```

> expert
admin@firepower:~$ sudo /usr/local/sf/bin/enable_scada.sh both

```

| **Note** | ---   You must issue this command after every deployment. These pre-processors are disabled during deployment.   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Best Practices for Application Filtering

Please keep the
following recommendations in mind when designing your application filtering
access control rules.

* To handle traffic
  referred by a web server, such as advertisement traffic, match the referred
  application rather than the referring application.
* Avoid combining
  application and URL criteria in the same rule, especially for encrypted
  traffic.
* If you write a
  rule for traffic that is tagged
  Decrypted Traffic, ensure that you have an SSL
  Decryption rule that will decrypt the matching traffic. These applications can
  be identified in decrypted connections only.
* TLS 1.3 encrpyts most handshake messages, so certificate information is not readily available. For traffic encrypted with
  TLS 1.3 to match access rules that use application or URL filtering effectively, the system must obtain a clear-text certificate
  for the server. We recommend that you enable TLS 1.3 Certificate Visibility in the access control settings. If you enable this option, the system checks whether a certificate for the site is stored
  in cache based on the IP address and Server Name Indication (SNI) in the client hello packet. If one is not available, the
  system uses a TLS 1.2 probe to obtain the certicate, which can then be used for application/URL category and reputation identification
  without decrypting the connection.
* The system can
  detect multiple types of Skype application traffic. To control Skype traffic,
  choose the Skype tag from the Application Filters list rather than selecting
  individual applications. This ensures that the system can detect and control
  all Skype traffic the same way.
* To control access to Zoho mail, select both the Zoho and Zoho Mail
  applications.

### URL Filtering

You can use access
control rules to filter traffic based on the URL used in an HTTP or HTTPS
connection. Note that URL filtering for HTTP is more straight-forward than it
is for HTTPS, because HTTPS is encrypted.

You can use the
following techniques to implement URL filtering.

* Category and reputation-based URL filtering—With a URL filtering license, you can control access to web sites based on the
  URL’s general classification (category) and risk level (reputation). This is by far the easiest and most effective way to
  block unwanted sites.
* Manual URL
  filtering—With any license, you can manually specify individual URLs, and
  groups of URLs, to achieve granular, custom control over web traffic. The main
  purpose of manual filtering is to create exceptions to category-based block
  rules, but you can use manual rules for other purposes.

The following topics
provide more information on URL filtering.

* [Filtering URLs by Category and Reputation](#concept_2190C5512921483CB9009A9FF5E3AE74)
* [Looking Up the Category and Reputation for a URL](#id_75010)
* [Manual URL Filtering](#concept_BA45929BE1D543DAA1738FE58F5E4C0C)
* [Filtering HTTPS Traffic](#concept_3DF15D5D32444D5DA55001A3D2BF4816)
* [Comparing URL and Application Filtering](#concept_9B9F5E79222E41DB9ED37367A499BE6E)
* [Best Practices for Effective URL Filtering](#concept_F6A0AA79F3F54EE7BBFA3646D00596A7)
* [What the User Sees When You Block Web Sites](#id_40051)

#### Filtering URLs by Category and Reputation

With a URL filtering license, you can control access to web sites based on the category and reputation of the requested URLs:

* Category—A general classification for the URL. For example, ebay.com
  belongs to the Auctions category, and monster.com belongs to the Job Search
  category. A URL can belong to more than one category.
* Reputation—How likely the URL is to be used for purposes that might be against your organization’s security policy. Reputations range from Untrusted (level 1) to Trusted (level 5).

URL categories and reputations help you quickly configure URL filtering. For example, you can use access control to block untrusted URLs in the Illegal Drugs category.

For a description of the categories, see <https://www.talosintelligence.com/categories>.

Using category and reputation data also simplifies policy creation and
administration. Sites that represent security threats, or that serve
undesirable content, might appear and disappear faster than you can update and
deploy new policies. As Cisco updates the URL database with new sites, changed
classifications, and changed reputations, your rules automatically adjust to
the new information. You do not need to edit your rules to account for new
sites.

If you enable regular URL database updates, you can ensure that the
system uses up-to-date information for URL filtering. You can also enable
communications with Cisco Collective Security Intelligence (CSI) to obtain the
latest threat intelligence for URLs with unknown category and reputation. For
more information, see
[Configuring URL Filtering Preferences](fptd-fdm-system.html#id_16177).

| **Note** | ---   To see URL category and reputation information in events and application details, you must create at least one rule with a URL condition.   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Looking Up the Category and Reputation for a URL

You can check on the category and reputation for a particular URL. You can go to the URL tab of an access control rule, or
SSL decryption rule, or go to Device > System Settings > URL Filtering Preferences. There, you can enter the URL in the URL to Check field and click Go.

You will be taken to a web site that shows the results of the lookup. You can use this information to help you check the behavior
of your category- and reputation-based URL filtering rules.

If you disagree with the categorization, you can click the Submit a URL Category Dispute in the device
manager to tell us what you think.

#### Manual URL Filtering

You can supplement or selectively override category and reputation-based
URL filtering by manually filtering individual URLs or groups of URLs. You can
perform this type of URL filtering without a special license.

For example, you might use access control to block a category of web
sites that are not appropriate for your organization. However, if the category
contains a web site that is appropriate, and to which you want to provide
access, you can create a manual Allow rule for that site and place it before
the Block rule for the category.

To configure manual URL filtering, you create a URL object with the
destination URL. How this URL is interpreted is based on the following rules:

* If you do not include a path (that is, there are no / characters in the URL), the match is based on the server’s hostname
  only. If you include one or more / character, the entire URL string is used for a substring match. Then, a URL is considered
  a match if any of the following are true:

  + The string is at the beginning of the URL.
  + The string follows a dot.
  + The string contains a dot in the beginning.
  + The string follows the :// characters.

  For example, ign.com matches ign.com or www.ign.com, but not versign.com.

  | **Note** | ---   We recommend that you do not use manual URL filtering to block or allow individual web pages or parts of sites (that is, URL strings with / characters), as servers can be reorganized and pages moved to new paths.   --- |
  | --- | --- |
* The system
  disregards the encryption protocol (HTTP vs HTTPS). In other words, if you
  block a website, both HTTP and HTTPS traffic to that website is blocked, unless
  you use an application condition to target a specific protocol. When creating a
  URL object, you do not need to specify the protocol when creating an object.
  For example, use example.com rather than http://example.com.
* If you plan to
  use a URL object to match HTTPS traffic in an access control rule, create the
  object using the subject common name in the public key certificate used to
  encrypt the traffic. Also, the system disregards subdomains within the subject
  common name, so do not include subdomain information. For example, use
  example.com rather than www.example.com.

  However, please
  understand that the subject common name in the certificate might be completely
  unrelated to a web site’s domain name. For example, the subject common name in
  the certificate for youtube.com is \*.google.com (this of course might change at
  any time). You will get more consistent results if you use the SSL Decryption
  policy to decrypt HTTPS traffic so that URL filtering rules work on decrypted
  traffic.

  | **Note** | ---   URL objects will not match HTTPS traffic if the browser resumes a TLS session because the certificate information is no longer available. Thus, even if you carefully configure the URL object, you might get inconsistent results for HTTPS connections.   --- |
  | --- | --- |

#### Filtering HTTPS Traffic

Because HTTPS traffic
is encrypted, performing URL filtering directly on HTTPS traffic is not as
straight-forward as it is on HTTP traffic. For that reason, you should consider
using SSL Decryption policies to decrypt all HTTPS traffic that you intend to
filter. That way, the URL filtering access control policies work on decrypted
traffic, and you get the same results you would get for regular HTTP traffic.

However, if you do
intend to allow some HTTPS traffic to pass undecrypted into the access control
policy, you need to understand that rules match HTTPS traffic differently than
they do for HTTP traffic. To filter encrypted traffic, the system determines
the requested URL based on information passed during the SSL handshake: the
subject common name in the public key certificate used to encrypt the traffic.
There might be little or no relationship between the web site hostname in the
URL and the subject common name.

You can improve HTTPS matching for category/reputation
rules if you enable DNS request filtering. The system can determine the category and
reputation during the DNS resolution phase, and block the DNS reply for unwanted
combinations, before the user can start the HTTPS connection attempt. For allowed DNS
responses, the system will have the category/reputation information available for
subsequent HTTPS connections. See [DNS Request Filtering](#Cisco_Concept.dita_8ecc19cf-1d41-4741-82cd-1bf5661deb22).

HTTPS filtering,
unlike HTTP filtering, disregards subdomains within the subject common name. Do
not include subdomain information when manually filtering HTTPS URLs. For
example, use example.com rather than www.example.com. Also, review the content
of the certificates used by the site to ensure you have the right domain, the
one used in the subject common name, and that this name will not conflict with
your other rules (for example, the name for a site you want to block might
overlap with one you want to allow). For example, the subject common name in
the certificate for youtube.com is \*.google.com (this of course might change at
any time).

| **Note** | ---   URL objects will not match HTTPS traffic if the browser resumes a TLS session because the certificate information is no longer available. Thus, even if you carefully configure the URL object, you might get inconsistent results for HTTPS connections.   --- |
| --- | --- |

##### Controlling Traffic by Encryption Protocol

The system disregards the encryption protocol (HTTP vs HTTPS)
when performing URL filtering. This occurs for both manual and reputation-based
URL conditions. In other words, URL filtering treats traffic to the following
web sites identically:

* http://example.com
* https://example.com

To configure a rule that matches only HTTP or HTTPS traffic, but
not both, either specify the TCP port in the Destination condition or add an
application condition to the rule. For example, you could allow HTTPS access to
a site while disallowing HTTP access by constructing two access control rules,
each with an TCP port or application, and URL, condition.

The first rule allows HTTPS traffic to the website:

* Action: Allow
* TCP port or
  Application: HTTPS (TCP port 443)
* URL: example.com

The second rule blocks HTTP access to the same website:

* Action: Block
* TCP port or
  Application: HTTP (TCP port 80)
* URL: example.com

#### Comparing URL and Application Filtering

URL and application
filtering have similarities. But you should use them for very distinct
purposes:

* URL filtering is
  best used to block or allow access to an entire web server. For example, if you
  do not want to allow any type of gambling on your network, you can create a URL
  filtering rule to block the Gambling category. With this rule, users cannot get
  to any pages on any web server within the category.
* Application
  filtering is useful for blocking specific applications regardless of the
  hosting site, or for blocking specific features of an otherwise allowable web
  site. For example, you could block just the Facebook Games application without
  blocking all of Facebook.

Because combining
application and URL criteria can lead to unexpected results, especially for
encrypted traffic, it is a good policy to create separate rules for URL and
application criteria. If you do need to combine application and URL criteria in
a single rule, you should place these rules after straight-forward
application-only or URL-only rules, unless the application+URL rule is acting
as an exception to a more general application-only or URL-only rule. Because
URL filtering block rules are more broad than application filtering, you should
place them above application-only rules.

If you do combine
application and URL criteria, you might need to monitor your network more
carefully to ensure that you are not allowing access to unwanted sites and
applications.

#### Best Practices for Effective URL Filtering

Please keep the
following recommendations in mind when designing your URL filtering access
control rules.

* Use category and
  reputation blocking whenever possible. This ensures that new sites get blocked
  automatically as they are added to the categories, and that blocking based on
  reputation is adjusted if a site becomes more (or less) reputable.
* When using URL category matching, note that there are cases where the login page for a site is in a different category than
  the site itself. For example, Gmail is in the Web-based Email category, whereas the login page is in the Search Engines and Portals category. If you have different rules with different actions for the categories, you might get unintended results.
* Use URL objects to
  target entire web sites and to make exceptions to category blocking rules. That
  is, to allow specific sites that would otherwise get blocked in a category
  rule.
* If you want to
  manually block a web server (using a URL object), it is much more effective to
  do so in the Security Intelligence policy. The Security Intelligence policy
  drops connections before the access control rules are evaluated, so you get a
  faster, more efficient, block.
* For the most
  effective filtering of HTTPS connections, implement SSL decryption rules to
  decrypt traffic for which you are writing an access control rule. Any decrypted
  HTTPS connections are filtered as HTTP connections in the access control
  policy, so you avoid all of the limitations for HTTPS filtering.
* TLS 1.3 encrpyts most handshake messages, so certificate information is not readily available. For traffic encrypted with
  TLS 1.3 to match access rules that use application or URL filtering effectively, the system must obtain a clear-text certificate
  for the server. We recommend that you enable TLS 1.3 Certificate Visibility in the access control settings. If you enable this option, the system checks whether a certificate for the site is stored
  in cache based on the IP address and Server Name Indication (SNI) in the client hello packet. If one is not available, the
  system uses a TLS 1.2 probe to obtain the certicate, which can then be used for application/URL category and reputation identification
  without decrypting the connection.
* Place URL blocking
  rules before any application filtering rules, because URL filtering blocks
  entire web servers, whereas application filtering targets specific application
  usage regardless of the web server.
* If you want to block high risk sites whose category is unknown, select the Uncategorized category and adjust the reputation slider to Questionable or Untrusted.
* You can improve overall URL filtering efficacy by also enabling DNS request
  filtering. When you use DNS request filtering, the system determines the FQDN’s
  URL category and reputation at DNS lookup time, so the information is available
  if a subsequent HTTP/HTTPS request comes for the same destination. Additionally,
  if you block the category/reputation, the attempted connection gets stopped at
  the DNS request stage, rather than the web-session establishment stage. See
  [DNS Request Filtering](#Cisco_Concept.dita_8ecc19cf-1d41-4741-82cd-1bf5661deb22).

#### What the User Sees When You Block Web Sites

When you block web sites with URL filtering rules, what the user sees
differs based on whether the site is encrypted.

* HTTP connections—The user sees a system default block response page
  instead of the normal browser page for timed out or reset connections. This
  page should make it clear that you blocked the connection on purpose.
* HTTPS (encrypted) connections—The user does not see the system
  default block response page. Instead, the user sees the browser’s default page
  for a secure connection failure. The error message does not indicate the site
  was blocked due to policy. Instead, errors might indicate that there are no
  common encryption algorithms. It will not be obvious from this message that you
  blocked the connection on purpose.

In addition, web sites might be blocked by other access control rules
that are not explicitly URL filtering rules, or even by the default action. For
example, if you block entire networks or geolocations, any web sites on that
network or in that geographic location are also blocked. Users blocked by these
rules may, or may not, get a response page as described in the limitations
below.

If you implement URL filtering, consider explaining to end users what
they might see when a site is intentionally blocked, and what types of site you
are blocking. Otherwise, they might spend a good deal of time troubleshooting
blocked connections.

##### Limitations of HTTP Response Pages

HTTP response pages do not always appear when the system blocks web
traffic.

* The system does not display a response page when web traffic is
  blocked as a result of a promoted access control rule (an early-placed blocking
  rule with only simple network conditions).
* The system does not display a response page when web traffic is
  blocked before the system identifies the requested URL.
* The system does not display a response page for encrypted
  connections blocked by access control rules.

### DNS Request Filtering

You can apply the URL category and reputation database to DNS lookup requests, even for
connection attempts that are not HTTP/HTTPS.

For example, if a user tries to make an FTP connection to www.example.com, you can
configure the system to look up the category and reputation of www.example.com when it
sees the DNS lookup request for that fully-qualified domain name (FQDN). If your DNS/URL
filtering rule for the returned category/reputation is a block rule, the system blocks
the DNS reply. Thus, the user does not get an IP address for the FQDN, and their
connection attempt fails.

By enabling DNS lookup request filtering, you can extend your URL filtering rules to
protocols other than HTTP/HTTPS, and prevent FTP, TFTP, SCP, ICMP, and any other
protocols from establishing a connection to a site that you are blocking for web access.
This works so long as the user uses an FQDN name and thus requires a DNS lookup. If the
user uses an IP address, there is no DNS request and DNS request blocking is not
possible.

For HTTP/HTTPS traffic, doing the category/reputation lookup at DNS request time might
improve system performance, as it can prevent the connection before the attempt to
establish the web session. This might be especially beneficial for HTTPS, which is
encrypted. By denying at the DNS request stage, the system never sees an HTTPS
connection, and thus your decryption rules do not need to be evaluated, nor does the
system need to perform the more difficult task of matching an encrypted session to the
right access control rule.

* [Guidelines for DNS Request Filtering](#Cisco_Concept.dita_878ba506-40a2-456d-b855-c703c8cae058)
* [Filtering DNS Requests Based on URL Category and Reputation](#Cisco_Task_in_List_GUI.dita_144597f9-f18a-47d8-a82e-35a4b93043d5)

#### Guidelines for DNS Request Filtering

Keep the following in mind as you configure DNS request filtering:

* DNS request filtering works on the DNS session only. If you allow the DNS reply
  (that is, the URL filtering rule action is Allow), then the subsequent
  connection that the user establishes with the returned IP address will be
  matched against your access control rules separately. The connection might match
  a different rule, and thus be blocked or allowed for other reasons. For example,
  if you allow an FTP attempt to get an IP address through a DNS lookup, you might
  have another access control rule that prohibits FTP connections, and the
  connection will ultimately be blocked.
* DNS lookup requests that match access control rules that come before your URL/DNS
  request filtering rules will be allowed or blocked according to the matching
  rule. Category/reputation lookup will not be done for these connections.
* This feature requires that you implement URL filtering based on
  category/reputation. You must have the URL filtering license for this type of
  URL filtering. If you have no URL filtering rules based on category/reputation,
  then DNS request filtering is not relevant and you should not enable it.
* Connection events generated by DNS filtering include the following fields of
  special interest: DNS Query, URL Category, and URL Reputation. The DNS Query
  field shows the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) for the lookup request. For
  DNS filtering events, the URL field will be blank.
* DNS request filtering uses the URL category and reputation database only. Any URL
  objects or other manual URL filtering defined in a matching access control rule
  are ignored. If you want to implement manual DNS name blocking, use the Security
  Intelligence DNS policy.

#### Filtering DNS Requests Based on URL Category and Reputation

The following procedure explains how to implement DNS lookup request filtering.

##### Before you begin

You must enable the URL license if it is not already enabled.

##### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Select Policies > Access Control. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | If necessary, click the Access Policy Settings (Gear/Settings button. ) button, select the Reputation Enforcement on DNS Traffic option, and click OK.  This option enables DNS request filtering for the access control policy. The option is enabled by default. |
| **Step 3** | Evaluate existing URL filtering rules, or create new ones, to implement filtering based on URL category and reputation that will also apply to DNS requests.  URL filtering normally applies to HTTP/HTTPS traffic only, so there is no reason to restrict these rules based on application or port. However, if you do have these restrictions, ensure that the rule can also apply to DNS requests:   * On the Source/Destination tab, if the   Destination Ports field has   Any, no change is needed. If you   specified ports, add DNS over UDP and   DNS over TCP to the list. * On the Applications tab, if the application   list simply has Any, no change is needed. If   you specified any applications or application filters, add the   DNS application to the list or filter.   The other DNS-related options are not relevant for this purpose.   For information on creating access control rules, see [Configuring Access Control Rules](#task_68A29B520CFF46608A8E88D8DFE7AEC0). |
| **Step 4** | Evaluate preceding rules to ensure that DNS requests do not match those rules.  Category and reputation determination happens only if the DNS request matches a URL filtering rule that has category and reputation specifications. Any DNS requests that match rules earlier in the access control policy than your URL filtering rule bypass DNS request filtering. Such DNS requests are handled according to the matching rule, either blocked or allowed. |

### Intrusion, File, and Malware Inspection

Intrusion and file
policies work together as the last line of defense before traffic is allowed to
its destination:

* Intrusion policies
  govern the system's intrusion prevention capabilities.
* File policies govern the system's file control and malware defense capabilities.

All other traffic
handling occurs before network traffic is examined for intrusions, prohibited
files, and malware. By associating an intrusion or file policy with an access
control rule, you are telling the system that before it passes traffic that
matches the access control rule's conditions, you first want to inspect the
traffic with an intrusion policy, a file policy, or both.

You can configure
intrusion and file policies on rules that
allow traffic only. Inspection is not performed on
rules set to
trust or
block traffic. In addition, if the default action
for the access control policy is
allow, you can configure an intrusion policy but
not a file policy.

For any single
connection handled by an access control rule, file inspection occurs before
intrusion inspection. That is, the system does not inspect files blocked by a
file policy for intrusions. Within file inspection, simple blocking by type
takes precedence over malware inspection and blocking. Until a file is detected
and blocked in a session, packets from the session may be subject to intrusion
inspection.

| **Note** | ---   By default, the system disables intrusion and file inspection of encrypted payloads. This helps reduce false positives and improve performance when an encrypted connection matches an access control rule that has intrusion and file inspection configured. Inspection works with unencrypted traffic only.   --- |
| --- | --- |

### Best Practices for Access Control Rule Order

Rules are applied on a first-match basis, so you must ensure that rules
with highly specific traffic matching criteria appear above policies that have
more general criteria that would otherwise apply to the matching traffic.
Consider the following recommendations:

* Specific rules should come before general rules, especially when the
  specific rules are exceptions to general rules.
* Any rules that drop traffic based on layer-3/4 criteria only (such
  as IP address, security zone, and port number) should come as early as
  possible. We recommend they come before any rule that requires inspection, such
  as those with application or URL criteria, because Layer-3/4 criteria can be
  evaluated quickly and without inspection. Of course, any exceptions to these
  rules must be placed above them.
* Whenever possible, put specific drop rules near the top of the
  policy. This ensures the earliest possible decision on undesirable traffic.
* Any rules that include both application and URL criteria should come
  after straight-forward application-only or URL-only rules, unless the
  application+URL rule is acting as an exception to a more general
  application-only or URL-only rule. Combining application and URL criteria can
  lead to unexpected results, especially for encrypted traffic, so we recommend
  that you create separate rules for URL and application filtering whenever
  possible.

### NAT and Access Rules

Access rules always use the real IP addresses when determining
an access rule match, even if you configure NAT. For example, if you configure
NAT for an inside server, 10.1.1.5, so that it has a publicly routable IP
address on the outside, 209.165.201.5, then the access rule to allow the
outside traffic to access the inside server needs to reference the server’s
real IP address (10.1.1.5), and not the mapped address (209.165.201.5).

### How Other Security Policies Impact Access Control

Other security
policies can affect how access control rules function and match connections. As
you configure your access rules, keep the following in mind:

* SSL
  Decryption policy—The SSL decryption rules are evaluated before
  access control. Thus, if an encrypted connection matches an SSL decryption rule
  that applies some type of decryption, it is the plain text (decrypted)
  connection that is evaluated by the access control policy. The access rules do
  not see the encrypted version of the connection. Additionally, any connections
  that match SSL decryption rules that drop traffic are never seen by the access
  control policy. Finally, any encrypted connection that matches a Do Not Decrypt
  rule is evaluated in its encrypted state.
* Identity policy—Connections are matched to users
  (and thus, user groups) only if there is a user mapping for the source IP
  address. Access rules that key on user or group membership can match only those
  connections for which user identity was successfully collected by your identity
  policy.
* Security Intelligence policy—Any connection that is dropped is never
  seen by the access control policy. Connections that match the do not block list
  are subsequently matched to access control rules and, ultimately, it is the
  access control rule that determines how the connection is handled (allowed or
  dropped).
* VPN (site-to-site or remote access)—VPN traffic is always evaluated against
  the access control policy, and connections are allowed or dropped based on the
  matching rule. However, the VPN tunnel itself is decrypted before the access
  control policy is evaluated. The access control policy evaluates the
  connections that are embedded within the VPN tunnel, not the tunnel itself.

## License Requirements for Access Control

You do not need a special license to use the access control policy.

However, you do need the following licenses for specific features within
the access control policy. For information on configuring licenses, see
[Enabling or Disabling Optional Licenses](fptd-fdm-license.html#id_12247).

* URL license—To create rules that use URL categories and reputations as match criteria.
* **Threat** license—To configure an intrusion policy on an access rule or the default action. You also need this license to use a file
  policy (the Malware license is also required).
* **Malware** license—To configure a file policy on an access rule. The Threat is also required for file policies.

## Guidelines and Limitations for Access Control Policies

Following are some
additional limitations for access control. Please consider them when evaluating
whether you are getting the expected results from your rules.

* If a URL database update includes added (new, incoming), deprecated (outgoing), or deleted categories, there is a grace period
  for you to make changes to any access control rules that are affected. Impacted rules are marked with informational messages,
  with explanations about the issues that impact the rule and links to the Cisco Talos Intelligence Group
  (Talos) web site for more information about the category changes. You need to update the rule so that it uses the appropriate categories
  available in the latest URL database.

  To accommodate the grace period, add the newly added incoming categories to the appropriate rules without removing the outgoing
  deprecated categories: your rules should contain both the new and old categories. The new categories will be effective when
  the old categories are marked for deletion. When the old categories are finally deleted, you need to edit the rules to remove
  the deleted categories and redeploy the configuration. You will be blocked from deploying the configuration until you fix
  any rules that use deleted categories. Click the See Problem Rules link above the table to filter on rules that need attention.
* Device Manager can download information on up to 50,000 users from the
  directory server. If your directory server includes more than 50,000 user accounts, you will
  not see all possible names when selecting users in an access rule or when
  viewing user-based dashboard information. You can write rules on only those
  names that were downloaded.

  The 50,000 limit also applies to the names associated with groups. If a group has more than 50,000 members, only the 50,000 names that were downloaded can be matched against the group membership.
* If a Vulnerability Database (VDB) update removes (deprecates) applications, you must make changes to any access control rules
  or application filters that use the application that was deleted. You cannot deploy changes until you fix these rules. In
  addition, you cannot install system software updates before fixing the issue. On the Application Filters object page, or the
  Application tab of the rule, these applications say “(Deprecated)” after the application name.
* To use fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) network objects as source or destination criteria, you must also configure DNS for
  the data interfaces on Device > System Settings > DNS Server. The system does not use the management DNS server setting to do lookups for FQDN objects used in access control rules. For
  information on troubleshooting FQDN resolution, see [Troubleshooting General DNS Problems](fptd-fdm-system.html#id_73501).

  Note that controlling access by FQDN is a best-effort mechanism. Consider the following points:

  + Because DNS replies can be spoofed, only use fully trusted internal DNS servers.
  + Some FQDNs, especially for very popular servers, can have multiple and frequently changing IP addresses. Because the system
    uses cached DNS lookup results, users might get new addresses that are not yet in the cache. Thus, it is possible that blocking
    a popular site by FQDN will provide inconsistent results.
  + For popular FQDNs, different DNS servers can return a different set of IP addresses. Thus, if your users use a different DNS
    server than the one you configure, FQDN-based access control rules might not apply to all IP addresses for the site that are
    used by your clients, and you will not get the intended results for your rules.
  + Some FQDN DNS entries have very short time to live (TTL) values. This can result in frequent recompliation of the lookup table,
    which can impact overall system performance.
* If you edit a rule
  that is actively in use, the changes do not apply to established connections
  that are no longer being inspected by Snort. The new rule is used to match
  against future connections. In addition, if Snort is actively inspecting a
  connection, it can apply the changed matching or action criteria to an existing
  connection. If you need to ensure that your changes apply to all current
  connections, you can log into the device CLI and use the
  clear conn
  command to end established connections, on the assumption that the sources for
  the connections will then attempt to reestablish the connection and thus be
  matched appropriately against the new rule.
* It takes 3 to 5
  packets for the system to identify the application or URL in a connection.
  Thus, the correct access control rule might not be matched immediately for a
  given connection. However, once the application/URL is known, the connection is
  handled based on the matching rule. For encrypted connections, this happens
  after the server certificate exchange in the SSL handshake.
* The system applies
  the default policy action to packets that do not have a payload in a connection
  where an application is identified.
* Leave matching criteria empty whenever possible, especially those for security zones, network objects, and port objects. For
  example, the system can more efficiently match traffic for all interfaces if you simply leave the security zone criteria blank,
  rather than if you create zones that contain all interfaces. When you specify multiple criteria, the system must match against
  every combination of the contents of the criteria you specify.
* If you specify IP addresses for source or destination criteria, do not mix IPv4
  and IPv6 addresses in the same rule. Create separate rules for IPv4 and IPv6
  addresses.
* While operating, the threat
  defense device expands access control rules into multiple access control list entries based on the contents of any network objects
  used in the access rule. You can reduce the memory required to search access control rules by enabling object group search.
  With object group search enabled, the system does not expand network objects, but instead searches access rules for matches
  based on those group definitions. Object group search does not impact how your access rules are defined or how they appear
  in the device manager. It impacts only how the device interprets and processes them while matching connections to access control rules.

  Enabling object group search reduces memory requirements for access control policies that include network objects. However,
  it is important to note that object group search might also decrease rule lookup performance and thus increase CPU utilization.
  You should balance the CPU impact against the reduced memory requirements for your specific access control policy. In most
  cases, enabling object group search provides a net operational improvement.

  You can set this option using FlexConfig by issuing the object-group-searchaccess-control  command; use the no  form of the command in the negate template.

  Starting with release 7.2, this feature is enabled by default on new deployments, but is not automatically enabled on upgraded
  systems.
* GRE tunnels that violate the related RFCs will be dropped. For example, if a GRE tunnel contains non-zero values in the reserved
  bits, contrary to the RFCs, it is dropped. If you need to allow non-compliant GRE tunnels, you need to use a remote manager
  and configure a prefilter rule that trusts the sessions. You cannot configure prefilter rules using the device
  manager.

## Configuring the Access Control Policy

Use the access control
policy to control access to network resources. The policy consists of a set of
ordered rules, which are evaluated from top to bottom. The rule applied to
traffic is the first one where all the traffic criteria are matched. If no
rules match the traffic, the default action shown at the bottom of the page is
applied.

To configure the
access control policy, select
Policies > Access
Control.

The access control
table lists all rules in order. For each rule:

* Click the
  > button next to the rule number in the left-most
  column to open the rule diagram. The diagram can help you visualize how the
  rule controls traffic. Click the button again to close the diagram.
* Most cells allow
  inline editing. For example, you can click the action to select a different
  one, or click a source network object to add or change the source criteria.
* To move a rule, hover over the rule until you get the move icon (![Move rule icon.](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/410001-420000/414001-415000/414046.jpg)),
  then click, drag, and drop the rule to the new location. You can also move a
  rule by editing it and selecting the new location in the
  Order list. It is critical that you put the
  rules in the order that you want them processed. Specific rules should be near
  the top, especially for rules that define exceptions to more general rules
* The right-most
  column contains the action buttons for a rule; mouse over the cell to see the
  buttons. You can edit (![edit icon](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/400001-410000/409001-410000/409815.jpg))
  or delete (![delete icon](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/400001-410000/409001-410000/409814.jpg))
  a rule.
* Click the Access Control Settings (![Gear/Settings button.](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/420001-430000/420001-421000/420147.jpg)) button to configure settings that apply to the access control policy, rather
  than to specific rules within the policy.
* Click the Toggle Hit Counts icon (![Toggle hit counts button.](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/430001-440000/432001-433000/432141.jpg)) above the table to add or remove the Hit Counts column in the table. The Hit Count column appears to the right of the Name
  column with the total hit count for the rule and the date and time of the last hit. The hit count information is fetched at
  the time you click the toggle button. Click the refresh icon (![Refresh hit count button.](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/430001-440000/432001-433000/432142.jpg)) to get the latest information.
* If any rules have problems, for example, because of removed or changed URL categories, click the See Problem Rules link next to the search box to filter the table to show only those rules. Please edit and correct (or delete) these rules,
  so that they will provide the service that you require.

The following topics

### Configuring the Default Action

If a connection does
not match a specific access rule, it is handled by the default action for the
access control policy.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Select Policies > Access Control. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click anywhere in the Default Action field. |
| **Step 3** | Select the action to apply to matching traffic.   * Trust—Allow   traffic without further inspection of any kind. * Allow—Allow the   traffic subject to the intrusion policy. * Block—Drop the   traffic unconditionally. The traffic is not inspected. |
| **Step 4** | If the action is Allow, select an intrusion policy.  For an explanation of the policy options, see [Intrusion Policy Settings](#concept_990E998E30CF44F2BBE8D32F6D242E00). |
| **Step 5** | (Optional.) Configure logging for the default action.  You must enable logging for traffic that matches the default action to be included in dashboard data or Event Viewer. See [Logging Settings](#id_10392). |
| **Step 6** | Click OK. |

---

### Configuring Access Control Policy Settings

You can configure settings that apply to the access control policy, rather than to
specific rules within the policy.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Select Policy > Access Control. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click the Access Policy Settings (Gear/Settings button.) button. |
| **Step 3** | Configure the settings:   * TLS Server Identity Discovery—TLS 1.3 encrpyts most handshake messages, so certificate information is not readily available. For traffic encrypted with   TLS 1.3 to match access rules that use application or URL filtering, the system must have a clear-text certificate for the   server. If you enable this option, the system checks whether a certificate for the site is stored in cache based on the IP   address and Server Name Indication (SNI) in the client hello packet. If one is not available, the system uses a TLS 1.2 probe   to obtain the certicate, which can then be used for application/URL category and reputation identification. We recommend that   you enable this option to ensure encrypted connections are matched to the right access control rule. The setting obtains the   certificate only; the connection remains encrypted. Enabling this option is sufficient to obtain TLS 1.3 certificates; you   do not need to create a corresponding SSL decryption rule. However, the cached certificates are also used for more effective   decryption rule processing in addition to access control processing. * Reputation Enforcement on DNS Traffic—Enable   this option to apply your URL filtering category and reputation   rules to DNS lookup requests. If the fully-qualified domain name   (FQDN) in the lookup request has a category and reputation that you   are blocking, the system blocks the DNS reply. Because the user does   not receive a DNS resolution, the user cannot complete the   connection. Use this option to apply URL category and reputation   filtering to non-web traffic. For more information, see [DNS Request Filtering](#Cisco_Concept.dita_8ecc19cf-1d41-4741-82cd-1bf5661deb22). |
| **Step 4** | Click OK. |

---

### Configuring Access Control Rules

Use access control
rules to control access to network resources. Rules in the access control
policy are evaluated from top to bottom. The rule applied to traffic is the
first one where all the traffic criteria are matched.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Select Policies > Access Control. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Do any of the following:   * To create a new rule, click   the   + button. * To edit an existing rule,   click the edit icon (edit icon)   for the rule.   To delete a rule you no longer need, click the delete icon (delete icon) for the rule. |
| **Step 3** | In Order, select where you want to insert the rule in the ordered list of rules.  Rules are applied on a first-match basis, so you must ensure that rules with highly specific traffic matching criteria appear above policies that have more general criteria that would otherwise apply to the matching traffic.  The default is to add the rule to the end of the list. If you want to change a rule's location later, edit this option. |
| **Step 4** | In Title, enter a name for the rule.  The name cannot contain spaces. You can use alphanumeric characters and these special characters: + . \_ - |
| **Step 5** | Select the action to apply to matching traffic.   * Trust—Allow   traffic without further inspection of any kind. * Allow—Allow the   traffic subject to the intrusion and other inspection settings in the policy. * Block—Drop the   traffic unconditionally. The traffic is not inspected. |
| **Step 6** | Define the traffic matching criteria using any combination of the following tabs:   * Source/Destination—The   security zones (interfaces) through which the traffic passes, the IP   addresses or the country or continent (geographical location) for the IP   address, the security group tags (SGT)   assigned to the address, or the protocols and ports used in the   traffic. The default is any zone, address, geographical location, SGT, protocol, and port. See [Source/Destination Criteria](#concept_BA8B7882112F45E09AD00B341C64B871). * Application—The   application, or a filter that defines applications by type, category, tag,   risk, or business relevance. The default is any application. See [Application Criteria](#concept_1F51EAD7EE7D4107BCF4547CD8D0653B). * URL—The URL or URL category of a web or DNS   lookup request. The default is any URL. See [URL Criteria](#concept_885AAC35D2A54D34A1A3B602121818E0). * Users—The identity source, user or user group. Your identity policies determine whether user and group information is available for traffic matching.   You must configure identity policies to use this criteria. See [User Criteria](#id_12066).   To modify a condition, you click the + button within that condition, select the desired object or element, and click OK in the popup dialog box. If the criterion requires an object, you can click Create New Object if the object you require does not exist. Click the x for an object or element to remove it from the policy.  When adding conditions to access control rules, consider the following tips:   * You can   configure multiple conditions per rule. Traffic must match all the conditions   in the rule for the rule to apply to traffic. For example, you can use a single   rule to perform URL filtering for specific hosts or networks. * For each   condition in a rule, you can add up to 50 criteria. Traffic that matches any of   a condition's criteria satisfies the condition. For example, you can use a   single rule to apply application control for up to 50 applications or   application filters. Thus, there is an OR relationship among the items in a   single condition, but an AND relationship between condition types (for example,   between source/destination and application). * Some   features require that you enable the appropriate license. |
| **Step 7** | (Optional.) For policies that use the Allow action, you can configure further inspection on unencrypted traffic. Click one of the following links:   * Intrusion Policy—Select Intrusion Policy > On and select the intrusion inspection policy to inspect traffic   for intrusions and exploits. See [Intrusion Policy Settings](#concept_990E998E30CF44F2BBE8D32F6D242E00). * File Policy—Select the   file policy to inspect traffic for files that contain malware and for files   that should be blocked. See [File Policy Settings](#concept_AD893273F89D45FFA5846A9541E3084D). |
| **Step 8** | (Optional.) Configure logging for the rule.  By default, connection events are not generated for traffic that matches a rule, although file events are generated by default if you select a file policy. You can change this behavior. You must enable logging for traffic that matches the policy to be included in dashboard data or Event Viewer. See [Logging Settings](#id_10392).  Intrusion events are always generated for intrusion rules set to drop or alert regardless of the logging configuration on the matching access rule. |
| **Step 9** | Click OK. |

---

#### Source/Destination Criteria

The Source/Destination criteria of an access rule define the security zones (interfaces) through
which the traffic passes, the IP addresses or the country or continent (geographical
location) for the IP address, the security group
tags (SGT) assigned to the address, or the protocols and ports used in the
traffic. The default is any zone, address, geographical location, SGT, protocol, and port.

To modify a condition,
you click the
+ button within that condition, select the desired
object or element, and click
OK. If the criterion requires an object, you can
click
Create New
Object if the object you require does not
exist. Click the
x for an object or element to remove it from the
policy.

You can use the
following criteria to identify the source and destination to match in the rule.

Source Zones,
Destination Zones

The security
zone objects that define the interfaces through which the traffic passes. You
can define one, both, or neither criteria: any criteria not specified applies
to traffic on any interface.

* To match
  traffic leaving the device from an interface in the zone, add that zone to the
  Destination Zones.
* To match
  traffic entering the device from an interface in the zone, add that zone to the
  Source Zones.
* If you add
  both source and destination zone conditions to a rule, matching traffic must
  originate from one of the specified source zones and egress through one of the
  destination zones.

Use this
criteria when the rule should apply based on where the traffic enters or exits
the device. For example, if you want to ensure that all traffic going to inside
hosts gets intrusion inspection, you would select your inside zone as the
Destination Zones while leaving the source zone
empty. To implement intrusion filtering in the rule, the rule action must be
Allow, and you must select an intrusion policy in
the rule.

| **Note** | ---   You cannot mix passive and routed security zones in a single rule. In addition, you can specify passive security zones as source zones only, you cannot specify them as destination zones.   --- |
| --- | --- |

Source Networks,
Destination Networks

The network
objects or geographical locations that define the network addresses or
locations of the traffic.

* To match
  traffic from an IP address or geographical location, configure the
  Source Networks.
* To match traffic to an IP address or geographical location, configure the Destination Networks.
* If you add
  both source and destination network conditions to a rule, matching traffic must
  originate from one of the specified IP addresses and be destined for one of the
  destination IP addresses.

When you add
this criteria, you select from the following tabs:

* Network—Select the network objects or groups that define the source or destination IP addresses for the traffic you want to control.
  You can use objects that define the address using the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN); the address is determined through
  a DNS lookup.
* Geolocation—Select the geographical location to
  control traffic based on its source or destination country or continent.
  Selecting a continent selects all countries within the continent. Besides
  selecting geographical location directly in the rule, you can also select a
  geolocation object that you created to define the location. Using geographical
  location, you could easily restrict access to a particular country without
  needing to know all of the potential IP addresses used there.

  | **Note** | ---   To ensure that you are using up-to-date geographical location data to filter your traffic, Cisco strongly recommends that you regularly update the geolocation database (GeoDB).   --- |
  | --- | --- |

Source Ports,
Destination Ports/Protocols

The port objects
that define the protocols used in the traffic. For TCP/UDP, this can include
ports. For ICMP, it can include codes and types.

* To match
  traffic from a protocol or port, configure the
  Source Ports. Source ports can be TCP/UDP only.
* To match
  traffic to a protocol or port, configure the
  Destination Ports/Protocols. If you add only
  destination ports to a condition, you can add ports that use different
  transport protocols. ICMP and other non-TCP/UDP specifications are allowed in
  destination ports only; they are not allowed in source ports.
* To match
  traffic both originating from specific TCP/UDP ports and destined for specific
  TCP/UDP ports, configure both. If you add both source and destination ports to
  a condition, you can only add ports that share a single transport protocol, TCP
  or UDP. For example, you could target traffic from port TCP/80 to port
  TCP/8080.

Source SGT Groups, Destination SGT Groups

The Security Group Tag (SGT) group objects that identify the SGTs assigned to the traffic,
as downloaded from the Identity Services Engine (ISE). You can use these
objects only if you define an ISE identity source; otherwise, this section
will not appear. For detailed information on how to use SGTs for access
control, see [How to Control Network Access Using TrustSec Security Group Tags](#id_111477).

* To match traffic whose source has one of the SGT defined in the group, configure the
  Source SGT Groups.
* To match traffic to a destination that has one of the SGT defined in the group, configure
  the Destination SGT Groups.
* If you add both source and destination SGT conditions to a rule, matching traffic must
  originate from a source with one of the specified tags and be
  destined for one of the destination tags.

#### Application Criteria

The Application
criteria of an access rule defines the application used in an IP connection, or
a filter that defines applications by type, category, tag, risk, or business
relevance. The default is any application.

Although you can
specify individual applications in the rule, application filters simplify
policy creation and administration. For example, you could create an access
control rule that identifies and blocks all high risk, low business relevance
applications. If a user attempts to use one of those applications, the session
is blocked.

In addition, Cisco
frequently updates and adds additional application detectors via system and
vulnerability database (VDB) updates. Thus, a rule blocking high risk
applications can automatically apply to new applications without you having to
update the rule manually.

You can specify
applications and filters directly in the rule, or create application filter
objects that define those characteristics. The specifications are equivalent,
although using objects can make it easier to stay within the
50-items-per-criteria system limit if you are creating a complex rule.

To modify the
application and filters list, you click the
+ button within the condition, select the desired
applications or application filter objects, which are listed on separate tabs,
and click
OK in the popup dialog box. On either tab, you can
click
Advanced
Filter to select filter criteria or to help you search for specific
applications. Click the
x for an application, filter, or object to remove it
from the policy. Click the
Save As
Filter link to save the combined criteria that is not already an
object as a new application filter object.

| **Note** | ---   If a selected application was removed by a VDB update, “(Deprecated)” appears after the application name. You must remove these applications from the filter, or subsequent deployments and system software upgrades will be blocked.   --- |
| --- | --- |

You can use the
following
Advanced
Filter criteria to identify the application or filter to match in
the rule. These are the same elements used in application filter objects.

| **Note** | ---   Multiple selections within a single filter criteria have an OR relationship. For example, Risk is High OR Very High. The relationship between filters is AND, so Risk is High OR Very High, AND Business Relevance is Low OR Very Low. As you select filters, the list of applications in the display updates to show only those that meet the criteria. You can use these filters to help you find applications that you want to add individually, or to verify that you are selecting the desired filters to add to the rule.   --- |
| --- | --- |

Risks

The likelihood
that the application is used for purposes that might be against your
organization's security policy, from very low to very high.

Business
Relevance

The likelihood
that the application is used within the context of your organization's business
operations, as opposed to recreationally, from very low to very high.

Types

The type of
application:

* Application
  Protocol—Application protocols such as HTTP and SSH, which
  represent communications between hosts.
* Client
  Protocol—Clients such as web browsers and email clients, which
  represent software running on the host.
* Web
  Application—Web applications such as MPEG video and Facebook, which
  represent the content or requested URL for HTTP traffic.

Categories

A general
classification for the application that describes its most essential function.

Tags

Additional
information about the application, similar to category.

For encrypted
traffic, the system can identify and filter traffic using only the applications
tagged
 SSL
Protocol. Applications without this tag can only be detected in
unencrypted or decrypted traffic. Also, the system assigns the
decrypted traffic tag to applications that the
system can detect in decrypted traffic only, not encrypted or unencrypted.

Applications
List (bottom of the display)

This list
updates as you select filters from the options above the list, so you can see
the applications that currently match the filter. Use this list to verify that
your filter is targeting the desired applications when you intend to add filter
criteria to the rule. If your intention is to add specific applications, select
them from this list.

#### URL Criteria

The URL criteria of an
access rule defines the URL used in a web request, or the category to which the
requested URL belongs. For category matches, you can also specify the relative
reputation of sites to allow or block. The default is to allow all URLs.

If you enable DNS lookup request filtering, the category
and reputation settings also apply to the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) in the
lookup request. Only the category and reputation settings apply for DNS request
filtering. Manual URL filtering is ignored.

URL categories and reputations allow you to quickly create URL conditions for access control rules. For example, you could
block all Gambling sites, or untrusted Social Networking sites. If a user attempts to browse to any URL with that category and reputation combination, the session
is blocked.

Using category and
reputation data also simplifies policy creation and administration. It grants
you assurance that the system will control web traffic as expected. Finally,
because Cisco's threat intelligence is continually updated with new URLs, as
well as new categories and risks for existing URLs, you can ensure that the
system uses up-to-date information to filter requested URLs. Malicious sites
that represent security threats such as malware, spam, botnets, and phishing
may appear and disappear faster than you can update and deploy new policies.

To modify the URL
list, you click the
+ button within the condition and select the desired
categories or URLs using one of the following techniques. Click the
x for a category or object to remove it from the
policy.

URL Tab

Click
+, select URL objects or groups, and click
OK. You can click
Create
New URL if the object you require does not exist.

| **Note** | ---   Before configuring URL objects to target specific sites, carefully read the information on manual URL filtering.   --- |
| --- | --- |

Categories Tab

Click
+, select the desired categories, and click
OK.

For a description of the categories, see <https://www.talosintelligence.com/categories>.

The default is
to apply the rule to all URLs in each selected category regardless of
reputation. To limit the rule based on reputation, click the down arrow for
each category, deselect the
Any checkbox, and then use the
Reputation slider to choose the reputation level.
The left of the reputation slider indicates sites that will be allowed, the
right side are sites that will be blocked. How reputation is used depends on
the rule action:

* If the rule blocks or monitors web access, selecting a reputation level also selects all reputations more severe than that
  level. For example, if you configure a rule to block or monitor Questionable sites (level 2), it also automatically blocks or monitors Untrusted (level 1) sites.
* If the rule allows web access, selecting a reputation level also selects all reputations less severe than that level. For
  example, if you configure a rule to allow Favorable sites (level 4), it also automatically allows Trusted (level 5) sites.

Select the Include Sites with
Unknown Reputation option to have URLs with unknown
reputation included in the reputation match. New sites typically are
unrated, and there can be other reasons a site's reputation is unknown or
cannot be determined.

Check the Category for a URL

You can check on the category and reputation for a particular URL. Enter the URL in the URL to Check box and click Go. You will be taken to an external website to see the results. If you disagree with a categorization, click the Submit a URL Category Dispute link and let us know.

#### User Criteria

The User criteria of
an access rule defines the user or user group for an IP connection. You must
configure identity policies and the associated directory server to include user
or user group criteria in an access rule.

Your identity policies
determine whether user identity is collected for a particular connection. If
identity is established, the IP address of the host is associated with the
identified user. Thus, traffic whose source IP address is mapped to a user is
considered to be from that user. IP packets themselves do not include user
identity information, so this IP-address-to-user mapping is the best
approximation available.

Because you can add a
maximum of 50 users or groups to a rule, selecting groups usually makes more
sense than selecting individual users. For example, you could create a rule
allowing the Engineering group access to a development network, and create a
subsequent rule that denies all other access to the network. Then, to make the
rule apply to new engineers, you only need to add the engineer to the
Engineering group in the directory server.

You an also select identity sources to apply to all users within that source. Thus, if you support multiple Active Directory
domains, you can provide differential access to resources based on the domain.

To modify the users list, you click the + button within the condition and select the desired identities using one of the following techniques. Click the x for an identity to remove it from the policy.

* Identity Sources—Select an identity source, such as an AD realm or the local user database, to apply the rule to all users obtained from the
  selected sources. If the realm you need does not yet exist, click Create New Identity Realm and create it now.
* Groups—Select the desired user groups. Groups are available only if you configure groups in the directory server. If you select
  a group, the rule applies to any member of the group, including subgroups. If you want to treat a sub-group differently, you
  need to create a separate access rule for the sub-group and place it above the rule for the parent group in the access control
  policy.
* Users—Select individual users. The user name is prefixed with the identity source, such as Realm\username.

  There are some built-in users under the Special-Identities-Realm:

  + Failed
    Authentication—The user was prompted to authenticate, but failed to
    enter a valid username/password pair within the maximum number of allowed
    attempts. Failure to authenticate does not itself prevent the user from
    accessing the network, but you can write an access rule to limit network access
    for these users.
  + Guest—Guest users
    are like Failed Authentication users, except that your identity rule is
    configured to call these users Guest. Guest users were prompted to authenticate
    and failed to do so within the maximum number of attempts.
  + No Authentication
    Required—The user was not prompted to authentication, because the
    user's connections matched identity rules that specified no authentication.
  + Unknown—There is
    no user mapping for the IP address, and there is no record of failed
    authentication yet. Typically, this means that no HTTP traffic has yet been
    seen from that address.

#### Intrusion Policy Settings

Cisco delivers several intrusion policies with the firewall system. The several intrusion policies delivered by Cisco Cisco Talos Intelligence Group
(Talos) are designed by the Cisco.Talos set the intrusion and preprocessor rule states and advanced settings. For access control
rules that allow traffic, you can select an intrusion policy to inspect traffic for intrusions and exploits. An intrusion
policy examines decoded packets for attacks based on patterns, and can block or alter malicious traffic.

When running Snort 2, these are the only policies available and you cannot modify
them. However, you can change the
action to take for a given rule, as described in [Changing Intrusion Rule Actions (Snort 2)](fptd-fdm-intrusion.html#task_4D5DD40DDCE0426C8846E5684287E63B).

When running Snort 3, you can select one of these policies, or you can create your
own intrusion policies.

To enable intrusion inspection, select Intrusion Policy > On and select the desired policy. Click the info icon for a policy in
the drop-down list to see a description for each policy.

For more information on the pre-defined policies, see [System-Defined Network Analysis and Intrusion Policies](fptd-fdm-intrusion.html#concept_D681E8E136034A9AA863E8389C2A6C03).

#### File Policy Settings

Use file policies to detect malicious software, or *malware*, using malware defense. You can also use file policies to perform file control, which allows control over all files of a
specific type regardless of whether the files contain malware.

Malware defense uses the Secure Malware Analytics
Cloud to retrieve dispositions for possible malware detected in network traffic, and to obtain local malware analysis and file
pre-classification updates. The management interface must have a path to the Internet to reach the Secure Malware Analytics
Cloud and perform malware lookups. When the device detects an eligible file, it uses the file's SHA-256 hash value to query the
Secure Malware Analytics
Cloud for the file's disposition. The possible dispositions are:

* Malware—The Secure Malware Analytics
  Cloud categorized the file as malware. An archive file (e.g. a zip file) is marked as malware if any file within it is malware.
* Clean—The Secure Malware Analytics
  Cloud categorized the file as clean, containing no malware. An archive file is marked as clean if all files within it are clean.
* Unknown—The Secure Malware Analytics
  Cloud has not assigned a disposition to the file yet. An archive file is marked as unknown if any file within it is unknown.
* Unavailable—The system could not query the Secure Malware Analytics
  Cloud to determine the file's disposition. You may see a small percentage of events with this disposition; this is expected behavior.
  If you see a number of "unavailable" events in succession, ensure that the Internet connection for the management address
  is functioning correctly.

##### Available File Policies

You can select one
of the following file policies:

* None—Do not
  evaluate transmitted files for malware and do no file-specific blocking. Select
  this option for rules where file transmissions are trusted or where they are
  unlikely (or impossible), or for rules where you are confident your application
  or URL filtering adequately protects your network.
* Block Malware All—Query the Secure Malware Analytics
  Cloud to determine if files traversing your network contain malware, then block files that represent threats.
* Cloud Lookup All—Query the Secure Malware Analytics
  Cloudto obtain and log the disposition of files traversing your network while still allowing their transmission.
* (Custom File Policy)—You can create your own file policies using the threat
  defense API filepolicies resource, and the other FileAndMalwarePolicies resources (such as filetypes, filetypecategories, ampcloudconfig,
  ampservers, and ampcloudconnections). After you create the policies, and deploy changes, you can select your policies when
  editing an access control rule in the device
  manager. The policy description appears below the policy when you select it.

#### Logging Settings

The logging settings
for an access rule determine whether connection events are issued for traffic
that matches the rule. You must enable logging to see events related to the
rule in the Event Viewer. You must also enable logging for matching traffic to
be reflected in the various dashboards you can use to monitor the system.

You should log
connections according to the security and compliance needs of your
organization. If your goal is to limit the number of events you generate and
improve performance, only enable logging for the connections critical to your
analysis. However, if you want a broad view of your network traffic for
profiling purposes, you can enable logging for additional connections.

| **Caution** | ---   Logging blocked TCP connections during a Denial of Service (DoS) attack can affect system performance and overwhelm the database with multiple similar events. Before you enable logging for a Block rule, consider whether the rule is for an Internet-facing interface or other interface vulnerable to DoS attack.   --- |
| --- | --- |

You can configure the
following logging actions.

Select Log Action

You can select
one of the following actions:

* Log at Beginning and End of
  Connection—Issue events at the start and end of a connection.
  Because end-of-connection events contain everything that start-of-connection
  events contain, plus all of the information that could be gleaned during the
  connection, Cisco recommends that you do not select this option for traffic
  that you are allowing. Logging both events can impact system performance.
  However, this is the only option allowed for blocked traffic.
* Log at End of
  Connection—Select this option if you want to enable connection
  logging at the end of the connection, which is recommended for allowed or
  trusted traffic.
* No Logging at
  Connection—Select this option to disable logging for the rule. This
  is the default.

| **Note** | ---   When an intrusion policy invoked by an access control rule detects an intrusion and generates an intrusion event, the system automatically logs the end of the connection where the intrusion occurred, regardless of the logging configuration of the rule. For connections where an intrusion was blocked, the action for the connection in the connection log is Block, with a reason of Intrusion Block, even though to perform intrusion inspection you must use an Allow rule.   --- |
| --- | --- |

File Events

Select
Log
Files if you want to enable logging of prohibited files or malware
events. You must select a file policy in the rule to configure this option. The
option is enabled by default if you select a file policy for the rule. Cisco
recommends you leave this option enabled.

When the system detects a prohibited file, it automatically logs one of the following types of event:

* *File events*, which represent detected or blocked files, including malware files.
* *Malware events*, which represent detected or blocked malware files only.
* *Retrospective malware events*, which are generated when the malware disposition for a previously detected file changes.

For connections
where a file was blocked, the action for the connection in the connection log
is
Block even though to perform file and malware
inspection you must use an Allow rule. The connection's Reason is either
File
Monitor (a file type or malware was detected), or
Malware Block or
File
Block (a file was blocked).

Send Connection
Events To

If you want to
send a copy of the events to an external syslog server, select the server
object that defines the syslog server. If the required object does not already
exist, click
Create
New Syslog Server and create it. (To disable logging to a syslog
server, select
Any from the server list.)

Because event
storage on the device is limited, sending events to an external syslog server
can provide more long term storage and enhance your event analysis.

This setting applies to connection events only. To send intrusion events to syslog, configure the server in the intrusion
policy settings. To send file/malware events to syslog, configure the server on Device > System Settings > Logging Settings.

### Monitoring Access Control Statistics in the Dashboards

Most of the data on the Monitoring dashboards are directly related to your access control policy. See [Monitoring Traffic and System Dashboards](fptd-fdm-monitor.html#id_10212).

* Monitoring > Access And SI Rules shows the most-hit access rules and Security Intelligence rule-equivalents and related statistics.
* You can find general statistics on the Network Overview, Destinations, and Zones, dashboards.
* You can find URL filtering results on the URL Categories and Destinations dashboards. You must have at least one URL filtering policy to see any information on the URL Categories dashboard.
* You can find application filtering results on the Applications and Web Applications dashboards.
* You can find user-based statistics on the Users dashboard. You must implement identity policies to collect user information.
* You can find intrusion policy statistics on the Attackers and Targets dashboards. You must apply an intrusion policy to at least one access control rule to see any information on these dashboards.
* You can find file policy and malware filtering statistics on the File Logs and Malware dashboards. You must apply a file policy to at least one access control rule to see any information on these dashboards.
* Monitoring > Events also shows events for connections and data related to the access control rules.

### Examining Rule Hit Counts

You can view the hit count for each access control rule. The hit count indicates how often connections matched the rule. You
can use this information to identify your most active rules and the rules that are less active.

The count persists through reboots and upgrades.

You can also see rule hit count information in the device CLI using the show rule hits  command.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Select Policies > Access Control. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click the Toggle Hit Counts icon (Toggle hit counts button.).  The Hit Count column appears to the right of the Name column with the total hit count for the rule and the date and time of the last hit. The hit count information is fetched at the time you click the toggle button.  You can do the following with the hit count information:   * To the left of the button, you will see information on when the hit count was last updated. Click the refresh icon (Refresh hit count button.) to get the latest numbers. * To open a detailed view of the hit count for a given rule, click the hit count number in the table to open the Hit Count dialog   box. The hit count information includes the number of hits and the date and time of the last connection that matched the rule.   Click the Reset link to reset the counter to zero.  If you want to reset the hit count for all rules at once, open an SSH session to the device and issue the clear rule hits  command. * Click the Toggle Hit Counts icon (Toggle hit counts button.) again to remove the hit count column from the table. |

### Monitoring Syslog Messages for Access Control

In addition to seeing events in the Event Viewer, you can configure access control rules, intrusion policies, file/malware policies, and Security Intelligence policies to send events to a syslog server. The events use the following message IDs:

* 430001—Intrusion event.
* 430002—Connection event logged at the beginning of a connection.
* 430003—Connection event logged at the end of a connection.
* 430004—File events.
* 430005—Malware events.

### Monitoring Access Control Policies in the CLI

You can also open the CLI console or log into the device CLI and use the following commands to get more detailed information about access control policies and
statistics.

* show access-control-config  displays summary information about the access control rules along with per-rule hit counts.
* show access-list  displays the access control lists (ACLs) that were generated from the access control rules. The ACLs provide an initial filter
  and attempt to provide quick decisions whenever possible, so that connections that should be dropped do not need to be inspected
  (and thus consume resources unnecessarily). This information includes hit counts.
* show rule hits displays consolidated hit counts that are more accurate than the counts shown with show access-control-config and show access-list. If you want to reset the hit count, use the clear rule hits command.
* show snort statistics  displays information about the Snort inspection engine, which is the main inspector. Snort implements application filtering,
  URL filtering, intrusion protection, and file and malware filtering.
* show conn  displays information about the connections currently established through the interfaces.
* show traffic  displays statistics about traffic flowing through each interface.
* show ipv6 traffic  displays statistics about IPv6 traffic flowing through the device.

* [How to Control Network Access Using TrustSec Security Group Tags](#id_111477)

### How to Control Network Access Using TrustSec Security Group Tags

If you use Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) to define and use security group tags (SGT) for classifying traffic in a Cisco
TrustSec network, you can write access control rules that use SGT as matching criteria. Thus, you can block or allow access
based on security group membership rather than IP addresses directly.

* [About Security Group Tags (SGT)](#id_111478)
* [Configure Access Control Based on Security Group Tag (SGT)](#Cisco_Task_in_List_GUI.dita_96d60f09-ac6d-4d6a-b99d-2c014e0a7927)

#### About Security Group Tags (SGT)

In Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE), you can create security group tags (SGT) and assign host or network IP addresses
to each tag. You can also assign SGTs to user accounts, and the SGT is assigned to the user's traffic. If the switches and
routers in the network are configured to do so, these tags then get assigned to packets as they enter the network controlled
by ISE, the Cisco TrustSec cloud.

When you configure an ISE identity source in the device
manager, the threat
defense system automatically downloads the list of SGTs from ISE. You can then use SGT as a traffic matching condition in access
control rules.

For example, you could create a Production Users tag, and associate the 192.168.7.0/24 network to the tag. This would be appropriate
if you use that network for user end points, such as laptops, Wi-Fi clients, and so forth. You could create a separate tag
for Production Servers, and assign the IP addresses of the relevant servers or subnet to the tag. Then, in the threat
defense, you could allow or block access from the user network to the production servers based on the tag. If you later alter the
host or network addresses associated with the tag in ISE, you do not need to change the access control rule defined for the
threat
defense device.

When the threat
defense evaluates SGT as a traffic matching criteria for an access control rule, it uses the following priority:

1. The source SGT tag defined in the packet, if any. For the SGT tag to be in the
   packet, the switches and routers in the network must be configured to add them.
   See the ISE documentation for information on how to implement this method.
2. The SGT assigned to the user session, as downloaded from the ISE session directory. You need to enable the option to listen
   to session directory information for this kind of SGT matching, but this option is on by default when you first create the
   ISE identity source. The SGT can be matched to source or destination. Although not required, you would also normally set up
   a passive authentication identity rule, using the ISE identity source along with an AD realm, to collect user identity information.
3. The SGT-to-IP address mapping downloaded using SXP. If the IP address is within the range for an SGT, then the traffic matches
   the access control rule that uses the SGT. The SGT can be matched to source or destination.

   ISE uses the Security-group eXchange Protocol (SXP) to propagate the IP-to-SGT mapping database to network devices. When you
   configure the threat
   defense device to use an ISE server, you must turn on the option to listen to the SXP topic from ISE. Thus, the threat
   defense device learns about the security group tags and mappings directly from ISE, and is notified whenever ISE publishes updated
   security group tags and mappings. This ensures that the list of security group tags and mappings stay up-to-date on the device,
   so that the threat
   defense can effectively enforce the policy defined in ISE.

#### Configure Access Control Based on Security Group Tag (SGT)

To configure access control rules that use security group tags (SGT) as matching
criteria, you must first configure the device to obtain the SGT mappings from an ISE
server.

The following procedure explains the end-to-end process based on the assumption that
you want to get all mappings that are defined in ISE, including SGT-to-IP address
mappings published through SXP. Alternatively:

* If you want to use SGT information in the packets only, and not use mappings
  downloaded from ISE, simply create SGT group dynamic objects and use them as
  source SGT criteria in access control rules. Note that in this case, you can
  use SGT tags as a source condition only; these tags will never match
  destination criteria.
* If you want to use SGT in packets plus user session SGT mappings only, you do
  not need to turn on the option to subscribe to the SXP topic in the ISE
  identity source, nor do you need to configure ISE to publish SXP mappings.
  You can use this information for both source and destination matching
  conditions.

##### Before you begin

The assumption here is that you have already configured Cisco TrustSec in your
network, and you are simply adding the threat
defense device as a policy enforcement point. If you have not deployed Cisco TrustSec,
please start with ISE and configure your network, then return to this procedure.
Explaining Cisco TrustSec is outside the scope of this document.

##### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Ensure that SGTs are defined, that ISE is configured correctly to publish the SXP topic, and that any needed static mappings are in place.  See [Configure Security Groups and SXP Publishing in ISE](#id_111604). |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Update the Identity Services Engine object to listen to the SXP topic.  You can use ISE to obtain user session SGT mappings, static SGT-to-IP address mappings through SXP, or both. By default, when you configure the ISE identity source, it obtains user session mappings only; you must turn on the option to listen to the SXP topic from ISE.   1. Choose Objects > Identity Sources. 2. Edit the ISE object. If you have not configured one yet, click + > Identity Services Engine and see [Configure Identity Services Engine](fptd-fdm-identity-sources.html#id_71555). 3. Under Subscribe To, select SXP    Topic.  Ensure that Session Directory Topic is also    selected if you are using passive authentication or want user-to-SGT    mappings.     Subscribe to ISE SXP topic. 4. Click OK. |
| **Step 3** | Deploy your changes and wait for the system to download tags and mappings from ISE.  After you configure the ISE identity source and deploy changes, the system retrieves security group tag (SGT) information from the ISE server. The download will not happen until after you deploy changes. |
| **Step 4** | Create the SGT group objects that are required for your access control rules.  You cannot use the information retrieved from ISE directly in an access control rule. Instead, you need to create SGT groups, which refer to the downloaded SGT information. Your SGT groups can refer to more than one SGT, so you can apply policy based on relevant collections of tags if that is appropriate.  The number and contents of the objects depend on the access control rules that you intend to write. Repeat the following process to create all the objects that you need.   1. Choose Objects > SGT Groups. 2. Click + to add a new object, or edit an existing    object. 3. For new objects, enter a name and optionally a description. 4. Under Tags, click + and    select all the tags that should be included in the group.     SGT group dynamic object. 5. Click OK. |
| **Step 5** | Create access control rules that use the SGT group objects.  As an example, the following rule allows traffic from production users to production servers. The rule depends completely on SGT; it is not limited by source/destination interface or any other criteria. Thus, the rule will dynamically apply to traffic as it comes from different interfaces, and as you change security group membership in ISE. If the packet does not explicitly contain a source SGT, source/destination matching will be based on the packet IP addresses compared to the SGT-to-IP address mappings obtained from user session information or from SXP-published mappings.   1. Choose Policies > Access Control. 2. Click + to create a new rule, or edit an    existing rule. 3. Enter a rule name and select Allow as the    action. 4. On the Source/Destination tab, click    + under Source > SGT Groups and select the object you created for production    users. 5. On the Source/Destination tab, click    + under Destination > SGT Groups, and select the object you created for production    servers. 6. Configure other options as needed. For example, you can enable logging    and apply an intrusion policy. 7. Click OK. |
| **Step 6** | Deploy the configuration. |

* [Configure Security Groups and SXP Publishing in ISE](#id_111604)

##### Configure Security Groups and SXP Publishing in ISE

There is a lot of configuration that you must do in Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) to create the TrustSec policy and
security group tags (SGT). Please look at the ISE documentation for more complete information on implementing TrustSec.

The following procedure picks out the highlights of the core settings you must configure in ISE for the threat
defense device to be able to download and apply static SGT-to-IP address mappings, which can then be used for source and destination
SGT matching in access control rules. See the ISE documentation for detailed information.

The screen shots in this procedure are based on ISE 2.4. The exact paths to these
features might change in subsequent releases, but the concepts and requirements will
be the same. Although ISE 2.4 or later is recommended, and preferably 2.6 or later,
the configuration should work starting with ISE 2.2 patch 1.

###### Before you begin

You must have the ISE Plus license to publish SGT-to-IP address static mappings and
to get user session-to-SGT mappings so that the threat
defense device can receive them.

###### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Choose Work Centers > TrustSec > Settings > SXP Settings, and select the Publish SXP Bindings on PxGrid option.  This option makes ISE send the SGT mappings out using SXP. You must select this option for the threat defense device to “hear” anything from listing to the SXP topic. This option must be selected for the threat defense device to get static SGT-to-IP address mapping information. It is not necessary if you simply want to use SGT tags defined in the packets, or SGTs that are assigned to a user session. Turn on Publish SXP Bindings on PxGrid option in ISE. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Choose Work Centers > TrustSec > SXP > SXP Devices, and add a device.  This does not have to be a real device, you can even use the management IP address of the threat defense device. The table simply needs at least one device to induce ISE to publish the static SGT-to-IP address mappings. This step is not necessary if you simply want to use SGT tags defined in the packets, or SGTs that are assigned to a user session. Add an SXP device in ISE. |
| **Step 3** | Choose Work Centers > TrustSec > Components > Security Groups and verify there are security group tags defined. Create new ones as necessary.  Configure security group tags (SGT) in ISE. |
| **Step 4** | Choose Work Centers > TrustSec > Components > IP SGT Static Mapping and map host and network IP addresses to the security group tags.  This step is not necessary if you simply want to use SGT tags defined in the packets, or SGTs that are assigned to a user session. Configure IP to SGT static mappings in ISE. |

# Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense Compatibility Guide

This guide provides software and hardware compatibility for Cisco Secure
Firewall Threat Defense. For related compatibility guides, see the following table.

| **Note** | ---   Not all software versions, especially patches, apply to all platforms. A quick way to tell if a version is supported is that its upgrade/installation packages are posted on the Cisco Support & Download site. If the site is "missing" an upgrade or installation package, that version is not supported. You can also check the release notes and [End-of-Life Announcements](#id_85448). If you feel a version is missing in error, contact Cisco TAC.   --- |

## Suggested Release: Version 7.4.2

To take advantage of new features and resolved issues, we recommend you upgrade all
eligible appliances to at least the suggested release, including the latest patch.
On the Cisco Support & Download
site, the suggested release is marked with a gold star. In Version 7.2.6+/7.4.1+, the
management center notifies you when a new suggested release is available, and
indicates suggested releases on its product upgrades page.

### Suggested Releases for Older Appliances

If an appliance is too old to run the suggested release and you do not plan to
refresh the hardware right now, choose a major version then patch as far as
possible. Some major versions are designated *long-term* or *extra
long-term*, so consider one of those. For an explanation of these terms, see
[Cisco NGFW Product Line Software
Release and Sustaining Bulletin](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/security/firewalls/bulletin-c25-743178.html).

If you are interested in a hardware refresh, contact your Cisco representative or
partner contact.

## Threat Defense Hardware

### Firepower 1000/2100 Series

Firepower 1000/2100 series devices use the FXOS operating
system. Upgrading threat defense automatically upgrades FXOS. For information on bundled
FXOS versions, see [Bundled Components](#id_67425). These devices can also run ASA instead of threat defense; see [Cisco Secure Firewall ASA
Compatibility](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/compatibility/asamatrx.html).

### Secure Firewall 1200 Series

Secure Firewall 1200 series devices use the FXOS operating system. Upgrading threat
defense automatically upgrades FXOS. For information on bundled FXOS versions, see
[Bundled Components](#id_67425). These devices can also run ASA instead of threat defense; see
[Cisco Secure Firewall ASA
Compatibility](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/compatibility/asamatrx.html).

| **Threat Defense** | **Secure Firewall 1210**  **Secure Firewall 1220** |
| --- | --- |
| 7.6 | **YES** |

### Secure Firewall 3100/4200 Series

Secure Firewall 3100/4200 series devices use the FXOS operating system. How FXOS is upgraded depends on
whether the device is in application mode or multi-instance mode. These devices can
also run ASA instead of threat defense; see [Cisco Secure Firewall ASA
Compatibility](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/compatibility/asamatrx.html).

#### Application Mode

In application mode, upgrading threat
defense automatically upgrades FXOS. For information on bundled FXOS versions, see [Bundled Components](#id_67425).

Table 6. Secure Firewall 3100/4200 Series Application Mode Compatibility

| **Threat Defense** | **Secure Firewall 4215**  **Secure Firewall 4225**  **Secure Firewall 4245** | **Secure Firewall 3105** | **Secure Firewall 3110**  **Secure Firewall 3120**  **Secure Firewall 3130**  **Secure Firewall 3140** |

| 7.3 | — | **YES** | **YES** |
| 7.2 | — | — | **YES** |
| 7.1 | — | — | **YES** |

#### Multi-Instance Mode

In multi-instance mode, you upgrade the chassis (FXOS and firmware) and threat
defense separately. However, one package contains both components. It is possible to
have a chassis-only upgrade or a threat defense-only upgrade. For information on
bundled FXOS versions, see [Bundled Components](#id_67425).

Although you can run older threat defense instances on a newer
FXOS, new features and resolved issues
often require a full upgrade.

| **Threat Defense** | **Secure Firewall 4215**  **Secure Firewall 4225**  **Secure Firewall 4245** | **Secure Firewall 3110**  **Secure Firewall 3120**  **Secure Firewall 3130**  **Secure Firewall 3140** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 7.6 | **YES** | **YES** |
| 7.4.1–7.4.x | — | **YES** |

### Firepower 4100/9300

For the Firepower 4100/9300, major threat
defense versions have a specially qualified and recommended companion FXOS version,
listed below in **bold**. Use these combinations whenever possible, because we
perform enhanced testing for them. Note that the table lists the minimum build for
each FXOS version, but in most cases we recommend the latest. For more information,
see the [Cisco Firepower 4100/9300 FXOS Release
Notes](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/security/firepower-9000-series/products-release-notes-list.html).

| **Note** | ---   Although we document that FXOS 2.14.1.163+ is required for threat defense 7.4.x, this is for reimaging to 7.4.2+. If you are already running an earlier FXOS 2.14.1 build, you can successfully upgrade to 7.4.2+ without upgrading FXOS ([CSCwf64429](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwf64429)).   --- |
| --- | --- |

These devices can also run ASA instead of threat
defense. With ASA 9.12+ and threat
defense 6.4.0+, you can run both ASA and threat
defense on separate modules in the same Firepower 9300 chassis. For more information, see
[Cisco Firepower 4100/9300 FXOS
Compatibility](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/fxos/compatibility/fxos-compatibility.html).

### ASA 5500-X Series and ISA 3000

ASA 5500-X series and ISA 3000 devices use the ASA operating
system. Upgrading threat
defense automatically upgrades ASA. For information on the bundled ASA versions, see [Bundled Components](#id_67425).

Version 7.0 is the last major threat
defense release that supports ASA 5500-X series devices.

## Threat Defense High Availability and Clustering

These tables list threat defense support for high availability and clustering. For
threat defense hardware, support differs depending on whether you are using
standalone devices (also called native instances or application mode) or container
instances (also called multi-instance mode). Threat defense virtual does not support
container instances.

### Standalone Devices

This table lists threat defense hardware support for high availability and clustering
with standalone devices. In management center deployments, all threat defense
hardware supports high availability. For device manager, high availability support
begins in Version 6.3 and clustering is not supported.

Threat Defense Management

## On-Prem Management Center

All devices support remote management with a customer-deployed (*on-prem*)
management center.

Versions are major (A.x), maintenance (A.x.y), or patch (A.x.y.z). The management
center should run the same or newer version as its devices. New features and
resolved issues often require the latest version on both the management center and its devices, including patches. Upgrade the management center first—you will still be able to manage older devices, usually a few major
versions
back

| **Note** | ---   You cannot upgrade a device past the management center to a newer major or maintenance version. Although a patched device (fourth-digit) can be managed with an unpatched management center, fully patched deployments undergo enhanced testing.   --- |
| --- | --- |

Note
that in most cases you can upgrade an older device directly to the management center's major or maintenance version. However, sometimes you can manage an older
device that you cannot directly upgrade, even though the target version is
supported on the device. And rarely, there are issues with specific management center-device combinations. For release-specific requirements, see the release
notes.

## Cloud-delivered Firewall Management Center

The cloud-delivered Firewall Management Center can manage threat
defense devices running **Version 7.0.3 to 7.6.0 (except Version 7.1)**.

You can co-manage a cloud-managed device with a Version 7.2+ on-prem management center for event logging and analytics purposes only. Or, you can send security events
to the Cisco cloud with Security
Analytics and Logging (SaaS).

### Co-managing Devices with an Analytics Management Center

The cloud-delivered Firewall
Management Center supports a wider range of managed device versions than on-prem management
centers. This can cause issues if you use an on-prem management center for
analytics because devices can be "too old" or "too new" to co-manage.

You can be prevented from:

* Registering newer devices to the analytics management center because
  older devices are blocking the required management center upgrade.
* Upgrading co-managed devices to the latest release, because the analytics
  management center is "stuck" at an older release.
* Reverting device upgrade, if revert would take the device out of
  compatibility with the analytics management center.

For example, consider a scenario where you want to add co-managed Version 7.6.0
devices to a deployment that currently includes co-managed Version 7.0.x
devices. The cloud-delivered Firewall
Management Center can manage this full range of devices, but the on-prem analytics management
center cannot.

In order of preference, you can:

* Upgrade the Version 7.0.x devices to at least Version 7.2.0, upgrade the
  analytics management center to Version 7.6.0, then add the Version 7.6.0
  devices to both management centers.
* Remove the Version 7.0.x devices from the analytics management center,
  upgrade the analytics management center to Version 7.6.0, then add the
  Version 7.6.0 devices to both management centers.
* Leave the analytics management center as it is and do not add your
  Version 7.6.0 devices.

That is, your choices are:

* To get events from all devices, upgrade (or replace) the analytics
  management center and your older devices.
* To forgo events from older devices, upgrade (or replace) the analytics
  management center only.
* To forgo events from newer devices, leave the analytics management center
  at an older release.

## Device Manager

You can use device
manager to locally manage a single threat
defense device. Most models suppport local management.

Optionally, add Cisco Security Cloud Control to remotely manage multiple threat
defense devices, as an alternative to the management center. Although some configurations still require device
manager, Security Cloud Control allows you to establish and maintain consistent security policies across your threat
defense deployment.

## Bundled Components

These tables list the versions of various
components bundled with threat
defense. Use this information to identify open or resolved bugs in bundled components
that may affect your deployment.

Note that sometimes we release updated builds for select releases. If bundled
components change from build to build, we list the components in the *latest*
build. (In most cases, only the latest build is available for
download.)
For details on new builds and the issues they resolve, see the release notes for
your version.

### Operating Systems

ASA 5500-X series and ISA 3000 devices use the ASA operating system. Firepower
1000/2100, Secure Firewall 1200, and Secure Firewall 3100/4200 series devices use
the FXOS operating system. For the Firepower 4100/9300, see [Firepower 4100/9300](#reference_6DF211D8F60F423387D0316000333539).

### System Databases

The vulnerability database (VDB) is a database of known vulnerabilities to which
hosts may be susceptible, as well as fingerprints for operating systems, clients,
and applications. The system uses the VDB to help determine whether a particular
host increases your risk of compromise.

The geolocation database (GeoDB) is a database that you can leverage to view and
filter traffic based on geographical location.

## Browser Requirements

### Browsers

We test with the latest versions of these popular browsers, running on currently
supported versions of macOS and Microsoft Windows:

Table 24. Browsers

| Browser | Device Manager Version |
| --- | --- |
| Google Chrome | Any |
| Mozilla Firefox | Any |
| Microsoft Edge (Windows only) | Version 6.7+ |
| Apple Safari | Not extensively tested. Feedback welcome. |

If you encounter issues with any other browser, or are running an operating system
that has reached end of life, we ask that you switch or upgrade. If you continue to
encounter issues or have feedback, contact Cisco TAC.

### Browser Settings and Extensions

Regardless of browser, keep JavaScript and
cookies enabled.
If you are using Microsoft Edge, do *not* enable IE mode.

Note that some browser extensions can prevent you from saving values in fields like
the certificate and key in PKI objects. These extensions include, but are not
limited to, Grammarly and Whatfix Editor. This happens because these extensions
insert characters (such as HTML) in the fields, which causes the system to see them
invalid. We recommend you disable these extensions while you’re logged into our
products.

### Screen Resolution

Table 25. Screen Resolution

| **Interface** | **Minimum Resolution** |

When you first log in, the system uses a self-signed digital certificate to secure
web communications. Your browser should display an untrusted authority warning, but
also should allow you to add the certificate to the trust store. Although this will
allow you to continue, we do recommend that you replace the self-signed certificate
with a certificate signed by a globally known or internally trusted certificate
authority (CA).

To begin replacing the self-signed certificate on device manager, click
Device, then the System Settings > Management Access link, then the Management Web Server tab.
For detailed procedures, see the online help or the [Cisco
Secure Firewall Device Manager Configuration
Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/security/firepower-ngfw/products-installation-and-configuration-guides-list.html).

| **Note** | ---   If you do not replace the self-signed certificate:   * Google Chrome does not cache static content, such as images, CSS, or   JavaScript. Especially in low bandwidth environments, this can extend   page load times. * Mozilla Firefox can stop trusting the self-signed certificate when the   browser updates. If this happens, you can refresh Firefox, keeping in   mind that you will lose some settings; see Mozilla's *[Refresh Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/refresh-firefox-reset-add-ons-and-settings)* support   page.  --- |
| --- | --- |

### Browsing from a Monitored Network

Many browsers use Transport Layer Security (TLS) v1.3 by default. If you are using an
SSL policy to handle encrypted traffic, and people in your monitored network use
browsers with TLS v1.3 enabled, websites that support TLS v1.3 may fail to load.

| **Note** | ---   In Version 6.2.3 and earlier, websites that support TLS v1.3 always fail to load. As a workaround, you can configure managed devices to remove extension 43 (TLS 1.3) from ClientHello negotiation; see the software advisory titled: [*Failures loading websites using TLS 1.3 with SSL inspection enabled*](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/SA/SW_Advisory_CSCvh22181.html). In Version 6.2.3.7+, you can specify when to downgrade; see the system support  commands in the [Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense Command Reference](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/command_ref/b_Command_Reference_for_Firepower_Threat_Defense.html) after consulting with Cisco TAC.   --- |

## End-of-Life Announcements

The following tables provide end-of-life details. Dates that have passed
are in **bold**.

### Snort

If you are still using the Snort 2 inspection engine with threat defense, switch to Snort 3
now for improved detection and performance. It is available starting in threat defense
Version 6.7+ (with device manager) and Version 7.0+ (with management center). Snort 2 will
be deprecated in a future release. You will eventually be unable to upgrade
Snort 2 devices.

In management center deployments, upgrading to threat defense Version
7.2+ also upgrades eligible Snort 2 devices to Snort
3.
For devices that are ineligible because they use custom intrusion or network analysis
policies, manually upgrade Snort. See Migrate from Snort 2 to Snort 3 in the
[Cisco Secure Firewall
Management Center Snort 3 Configuration
Guide](https://www.cisco.com/go/fmc-snort3).

In device manager deployments, manually upgrade Snort. See Intrusion Policies
in the [Cisco
Secure Firewall Device Manager Configuration
Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/security/firepower-ngfw/products-installation-and-configuration-guides-list.html).

These software versions on still-supported branches have been removed
from the Cisco Support & Download
site.

| **Note** | ---   In Version 6.2.3+, uninstalling a patch (fourth-digit release) results in an appliance running the version you upgraded from. This means that you can end up running a deprecated version simply by uninstalling a later patch. Unless otherwise stated, do *not* remain at a deprecated version. Instead, we recommend you upgrade. If upgrade is impossible, uninstall the deprecated patch.   --- |
