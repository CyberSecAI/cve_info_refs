- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper path handling leading to insecure redirects.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure redirect vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated attacker can redirect a victim to an attacker-controlled domain, potentially leading to sensitive information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need any authentication to exploit the vulnerability, and the user needs to be tricked to click on a malicious URL.
