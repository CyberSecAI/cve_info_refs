The provided content is a security bulletin from MediaTek, which includes information about CVE-2023-20666.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**CVE-2023-20666**

*   **Title:** Improper input validation in display drm
*   **Severity:** Medium
*   **Vulnerability Type:** EoP (Elevation of Privilege)
*   **CWE:** CWE-20 Improper Input Validation
*   **Description:** In display drm, there is a possible out of bounds write due to a missing bounds check. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.
*   **Affected Chipsets:** MT6789, MT6855, MT6895, MT6983, MT8188, MT8195, MT8365, MT8781, MT8795T, MT8798
*  **Affected Software Versions:** Android 12.0, 13.0

**Summary of Vulnerability**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is caused by a missing bounds check in the display drm module, leading to a potential out-of-bounds write.
*   **Weaknesses:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper input validation, specifically the absence of a check to ensure data does not exceed buffer boundaries.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to local escalation of privilege (EoP), potentially giving the attacker system level access.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited locally, implying a malicious application or process running on the device.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker requires System execution privileges. User interaction is not required.
