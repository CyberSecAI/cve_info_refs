  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to an issue with the implementation of the ciphers that are used by the CloudSec encryption feature on affected switches.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Weak implementation of cryptographic ciphers"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker with an on-path position between the ACI sites could exploit this vulnerability by intercepting intersite encrypted traffic and using cryptanalytic techniques to break the encryption. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read or modify the traffic that is transmitted between the sites.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote",
      "On-path position between ACI sites"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be positioned on the path between ACI sites to intercept and manipulate the traffic. No authentication is required."
