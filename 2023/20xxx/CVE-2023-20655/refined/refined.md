- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation in the mmsdk component leading to a parcel format mismatch.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing bounds check, parcel format mismatch.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Local code execution with no additional execution privileges needed.
- **Attack vectors**: Local exploitation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Local access to the device. No user interaction needed.
