Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2023-20053:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is due to insufficient user input validation in the web-based management interface of Cisco Nexus Dashboard.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Arbitrary Script Execution: A successful exploit enables an attacker to execute arbitrary script code within the context of the affected web interface.
- Access to Browser-Based Information: The attacker can potentially access sensitive, browser-based information, such as cookies or session tokens.
- The injected script can access cookies, session tokens or other sensitive browser information and can even rewrite the content of the HTML page.
- Depending on the injected script and the capabilities of the vulnerable website the attacker could also perform other malicious activities like redirecting the user to attacker controlled content, or modifying the presentation of content.

**Attack Vectors:**

- Crafted Link: An attacker can craft a malicious link designed to inject the malicious script.
- User Interaction: The attack requires a user of the web interface to click the crafted link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- Remote, Unauthenticated Attacker: The attacker does not need to be authenticated on the affected system to conduct the attack.
- Social Engineering: The attacker needs to use social engineering techniques to convince the user to click the malicious link.

**Additional Details:**

- **Affected Product:** Cisco Nexus Dashboard
- **Fix:** Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability. The specific fixed release is version 2.3(1c).
- **Workaround:** There are no known workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability other than updating to the fixed version.
- **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.1 base score of 6.1 (Medium severity), with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
- The vulnerability was discovered during internal security testing.
- There is no public announcement or malicious use of this vulnerability known by Cisco PSIRT.

**Summary of XSS from OWASP Content:**

The OWASP content provides a good general overview of XSS vulnerabilities.  The main points to consider about XSS are:
- XSS is a type of injection attack.
- It involves injecting malicious scripts into trusted websites.
- It occurs when a web application uses input from a user within its output without proper validation.
- Attackers can use XSS to steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.
- The different types of XSS are Reflected, Stored, and DOM based.
- Reflected XSS is when the injected script is reflected off the web server.
- Stored XSS is when the injected script is permanently stored on the server.
- DOM based XSS is less known.

The OWASP document also highlights ways to avoid, review code, and test for XSS vulnerabilities. It also mentions that HTTP TRACE should be turned off as it can be used to steal cookie data via Javascript.
