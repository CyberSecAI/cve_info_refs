**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a missing bounds check in the preloader component.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Input Validation (CWE-20):** The preloader doesn't validate input, leading to an out-of-bounds write. This occurs because a necessary boundary check is absent.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Local Escalation of Privilege (EoP):** Successful exploitation can grant an attacker higher privileges on the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
