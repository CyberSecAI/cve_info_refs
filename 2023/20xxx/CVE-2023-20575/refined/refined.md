The content is related to CVE-2023-20575.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A power side-channel attack using the Running Average Power Limit (RAPL) interface on AMD SEV VMs. This vulnerability stems from the ability to monitor a program's execution inside an AMD SEV VM using power reporting functionality, potentially leaking sensitive information.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Power side-channel vulnerability in some AMD processors, specifically exploitable via the RAPL interface in AMD SEV virtual machines. This allows for the monitoring of power consumption which can leak information about the execution within the VM.

- **Impact of exploitation**: Information disclosure. An attacker can monitor program execution within a virtual machine, potentially gaining access to sensitive information.

- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves utilizing the RAPL interface to monitor the power consumption of a virtual machine running on an AMD processor.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be authenticated and have the ability to monitor power consumption. It is not clearly specified if the attacker needs to be within the same VM, or if it is possible to attack from another VM or the host.
