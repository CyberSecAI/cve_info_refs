- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The session ID is logged to the standard output stream when using `HeaderHttpSessionIdResolver` in Spring Session version 3.0.0.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Exposure of sensitive information (session IDs) in application logs.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Session hijacking is possible if an attacker gains access to the application logs.
- **Attack vectors:** Access to application logs.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have access to the application logs where the session IDs are being printed.
