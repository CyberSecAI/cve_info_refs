  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2023-20970",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input validation when handling MAC addresses and WPS device types in the supplicant/hostapd implementation.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Out-of-bounds read operation due to missing sanity checks for MAC address length and WPS device type length."
      ],
      "impact": "Information disclosure.",
      "attack_vectors": "An attacker could potentially trigger out-of-bounds reads by providing crafted input with invalid lengths for MAC addresses or WPS device types during P2P or SoftAp functions.",
       "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to interact with the Wi-Fi functionality of the device, specifically through P2P or SoftAp connections. An attacker also needs to be able to influence the parameters of Wi-Fi connections and potentially provide malformed MAC addresses or WPS device types."
    }
  ],
  "additional_notes": "The provided information includes the commit that addresses this vulnerability, highlighting that the fix involves adding sanity checks to validate the length of MAC addresses and WPS device types. Multiple bugs are referenced in the commit message, suggesting that this fix is part of a larger security report bug fix effort. This information is more detailed than the placeholder CVE description."
