Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-20948:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to an out-of-bounds read in the `dropFramesUntilIframe` function within the AAVCAssembler. Additionally, there were missing boundary checks in the `pickStartSeq` function of AHEVCAssembler.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:** The `dropFramesUntilIframe` function reads data beyond the allocated memory boundaries.
- **Missing boundary checks:** The `pickStartSeq` function lacks proper input validation and boundary checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
The vulnerability could lead to information disclosure due to out-of-bounds memory access. The provided document states that this vulnerability is rated as "High" severity with an "ID" (Information Disclosure) type.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector involves exploiting the vulnerable functions within the AAVCAssembler and AHEVCAssembler components by providing specially crafted input that triggers the out-of-bounds read and bypasses missing boundary checks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker would likely need the ability to provide media content to the vulnerable component, suggesting a local attack vector that needs no additional execution privileges to achieve its goals.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involves adding missing boundary checks in the `pickStartSeq` function of `AHEVCAssembler` and fixing the out-of-bounds read in the `dropFramesUntilIframe` function in the `AAVCAssembler`.
- The vulnerability is addressed in AOSP versions 12, 12L, and 13.
