Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-20956:

**CVE-2023-20956**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an issue in how `WorkSource` objects handle the parceling and unparceling of their `WorkChain` lists. Specifically, when a `WorkSource` object with a non-null but empty list of `WorkChain` is parceled, the size of the list is written to the parcel, but the list itself is never read back when unparceled. This leaves the single size element unread which can cause corruption on items that are read afterwards.
*   **Weakness:** Improper handling of empty but non-null lists during serialization and deserialization (parceling and unparceling). The code writes the list's size but fails to actually read the list leading to the corruption of later items.
*  **Impact:** Information disclosure
*   **Attack Vector:** Exploitation involves manipulating `WorkSource` objects, which are used to track which applications are responsible for certain work being done in the system. By creating a `WorkSource` object with an empty `WorkChain` list and then passing it to the system or another app using IPC, an attacker could corrupt the parcel being transmitted, leading to an information disclosure.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs the ability to create and manipulate `WorkSource` objects. The attacker must be able to interact with system components that use `WorkSource` objects.

**Additional Details from the provided source:**

*   The fix involves ensuring that if the `WorkChain` list is non-null, both the size and the contents of the list are read from the parcel.
*   The AOSP commit associated with this fix is  [https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/av/%2B/ce7a476857997b615745b13adaa5465cf4bc6cfe](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/av/%2B/ce7a476857997b615745b13adaa5465cf4bc6cfe).
