{
  "CVE-2023-20920": {
    "Description": "The provided text describes a vulnerability in the DevicePolicyResourcesManager, specifically how it retrieves string values. The core issue is that `clearCallingIdentity` was not consistently called before `DeviceConfig.getBoolean()`, leading to a SecurityException due to a mismatch in attribution source and context. This could cause unexpected behavior, such as packages failing to uninstall by an admin.",
    "Root cause": "Inconsistent use of `clearCallingIdentity` before calling `DeviceConfig.getBoolean()` within `DevicePolicyResourcesManager.getString()`. This resulted in a context mismatch.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect permission handling",
      "Inconsistent context handling",
      "Lack of proper identity clearing"
    ],
    "Impact": "Unexpected behavior such as packages failing to uninstall by an admin. It could also potentially lead to other undefined behavior within the system server.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability exists within the system server context. It is triggered when `DevicePolicyResourcesManager.getString()` is called from inside the system server without properly clearing the calling identity.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need to be able to trigger the vulnerable code path within the system server. This could potentially be achieved by exploiting another vulnerability or by gaining some form of control over the system server through other means."
