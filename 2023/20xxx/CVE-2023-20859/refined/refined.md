- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the insertion of sensitive information (specifically, batch tokens) into log files when a token revocation attempt fails. This occurs during the `LifecycleAwareSessionManager.destroy()` method call when the logging level is set to `WARN` or more detailed levels.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    -  Insecure logging of sensitive data. Batch tokens, which should be treated as confidential, are exposed in logs when revocation fails.
    -  Improper handling of failed token revocation attempts.
    - The issue is specific to applications using `LifecycleAwareSessionManager` in imperative-only setups.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker who gains access to log files could potentially obtain valid batch tokens, which could then be used to gain unauthorized access to resources or perform malicious actions within the Vault environment.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Accessing log files where the application logs token revocation failures. This can happen if an attacker compromises the system where logs are stored or if the logs are exposed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker must gain access to the log files generated by the application. This implies the attacker may need to compromise the system, or have access to the logging system or storage.
    - The target application must be configured to use Spring Vault with batch tokens and use `LifecycleAwareSessionManager` with a logging level of `WARN` or more detailed for the relevant loggers.
    - The token revocation must fail, which may require the attacker to have the ability to induce failures in Vault.
