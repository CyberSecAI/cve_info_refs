#### Issue/Introduction

VMware vRealize Orchestrator contains an XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability. This has been addressed in the following VMSA:
<https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2023-0005.html>

#### Environment

VMware Cloud Foundation 4.x

#### Resolution

To remediate VMSA-2023-0005 in a VMware Cloud Foundation 4.x environment, please upgrade VMware vRealize Orchestrator and/or VMware vRealize Automation to version 8.11.1.

1. Starting with VCF version 4.4, the SDDC Manager no longer manages the upgrades of vRealize components (even if they were originally deployed via SDDC Manager). Refer to [VMware Cloud Foundation 4.4 Release Notes](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Foundation/4.4/rn/vmware-cloud-foundation-44-release-notes/index.html) for more details.
2. If the user is on a version prior to VCF 4.5, first upgrade to VCF 4.5 or higher.
3. Once on VCF 4.5, upgrade the vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager in place to version 8.10 or above using the vRSLCM UI. Refer to [vRealize Suite Install and Upgrade Paths on VMware Cloud Foundation 4.4 and above](https://broadcomcms-software-agent.wolkenservicedesk.com/wolken/esd/knowledge-base-view/view-kb-article?articleNumber=314665) for more information on upgrade paths.
4. Use the vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager to upgrade vRealize Automation to  8.11.1 or higher.

**SaltStack Config Upgrade Requirements**

Before you can upgrade your SaltStack Config appliance you must upgrade the Master plugin. For information on upgrading the Master plugin, see [Upgrade the Master Plugin](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vRealize-Automation-SaltStack-Config/8.10/install-configure-saltstack-config/GUID-1637E178-B1A7-4FAC-A348-1516A6F0C4F0.html#upgrade-the-master-plugin-9).

## March 2023/ vRA 8.11.2 What's New

* **Upgrade Deprecated Cloud Extensibility Proxy Versions**

  As of April 28, all vRealize Automation Cloud Extensibility Proxies on versions 8.3 to 8.8 will be deprecated and no longer supported by VMware. Customers are encouraged to upgrade their extensibility proxy before April 28th 2023. For information on how to upgrade the extensibility proxy, refer to [Upgrading a cloud extensibility proxy](https://docs.vmware.com/en/vRealize-Automation/SaaS/Using-and-Managing-Cloud-Assembly/GUID-9C90D275-FFC5-4EF2-852E-F4E7F1520026.html).
* **vRealize Automation API Documentation for some services are now upgraded to OpenAPI 3.0 standard**

  vRealize Automation API Documentation for services like Blueprint, Catalog, Deployment and Migration Assistant are now upgraded from OpenAPI 2.0 to OpenAPI 3.0 standard.

  If a new API client library needs to be generated for these services, it is recommended to use to OpenAPI 3.0 standard.
* **Day 0 support for Azure disk performance tiers**

  vRealize Automation supports Azure performance tiers when provisioning Azure Premium managed disks. In your VMware Cloud Template, you can set the performanceTier property for Azure managed disks to specify the applicable performance tier.
* **Ability to upgrade the Salt Master plugin from SaltStack Config**

  SaltStack Config now provides the ability to upgrade Master Plugin to the latest version directly from the UI.
* **Support for Azure Government Cloud with vRealize Automation**

  vRealize Automation now supports Azure for US Government Regions as an endpoint.

* [Known Issues](#March 2023/ vRA 8.11.2 What's New-Known Issues)
* [Resolved Issues](#March 2023/ vRA 8.11.2 What's New-Resolved Issues)

### Known Issues

* **Storage policy not taken into account when picking datastore**

  During the allocation phase of a deployment, when a datastore is being selected for the disks included in the deployment it is possible that the storage profiles are not taken into account. Hence, a datastore that does not mach the constraints set by the storage profiles could be selected for the disk.
* **A file with user credentials is created in the CD-ROM unit for some Windows VMs**

  Deploying a Windows VM in vCenter Server with the usernamePassword authentication method for remoteAccess in Cloud Template creates a file with user credentials in the CD-ROM unit of the VM.

  **Impacts:** This known issue impacts vRealize Automation 8.10.2 and later.

  **Workaround:**

  + Use any key based authentication method: publicPrivateKey or generatedPublicPrivatekey for remoteAccess in Cloud Template
  + Automatically change the password on first logon: configure cloudbase-init to force the user to change the password at next logon, by adding to cloudbase-init.conf: first\_logon\_behaviour=always.[Learn More](https://docs.vmware.com/en/vRealize-Automation/SaaS/Using-and-Managing-Cloud-Assembly/GUID-02019167-3613-4509-9963-89A3B69A38DA.html)
  + Manually change the password on first logon

### Resolved Issues

* **Logs stop getting compressed after 6 months uptime**

  After an extended period of uptime, vRA logs might stop getting compressed. Old logs will keep getting deleted, but the log rotation might not get compressed. This can cause the log bundle to get too large to collect. This issue has been fixed in 8.11.2, and a KB article outlining the fix can be found here [https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/91113.](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/91113)
* **Change Project is greyed out for Deployments of Onboarded VMs that were migrated from 7.6**

  When migrating a deployment that includes machines and attached disks, the origin of the disks (including boot, attached, and inline disks) is updated to "ONBOARDED" during the subsequent resource sync cycle. This is incorrect, as the origin should remain as "MIGRATED".

  This causes the "Change Project Day 2" action to be greyed out. The "Change Project Day2" operation should only be greyed out for hybrid deployments with resources from different origins. The bug was introduced in the 8.10.0 release and will persist until version 8.11.1.

  The bug fix is included in version 8.11.2 onwards. This change will address all affected disks without impacting newly created ones.
* **Deprecate NodeJS 14 Polyglot Runtime**

  Starting this release, vRealize Orchestrator Polyglot supports NodeJS 18.14.2 runtime. The old NodeJS 14 runtime is now deprecated and will be removed when that version reaches EOL (<https://github.com/nodejs/release#release-schedule>)

  It is recommended to review and run the scripts with NodeJS 18.14.2 runtime.
* **Tags on Azure cloud zone and compute deleted after upgrade**

  When upgrading to vRealize Automation 8.11.0, some users noticed that tags on Azure availability zone computes were no longer available.
* **Deprecate an identity service endpoint in vRealize Automation**

  The `GET /am/api/auth/token-public-key` endpoint is deprecated and instead `GET /.well-known/openid-configuration` endpoint is introduced in this release that returns OpenID configuration information.

  To prevent any scripts from breaking once the deprecated endpoint is removed after a few releases, update Any automation that uses `GET /am/api/auth/token-public-key` endpoint  to get the Identity service's public key to use `GET /.well-known/openid-configuration` endpoint and then use the URL contained in the "jwks\_uri" element in order to achieve the same.

  For more information on this endpoint, refer to: <https://developer.vmware.com/docs/17860//GUID-6561CDF8-A174-498D-9FBD-F9BD89EF7660.html> and to access all Swagger specifications from a single landing page, go to https://<vRA-FQDN>/automation-ui/api-docs where vRA-FQDN is the FQDN of your vRealize Automation appliance.
* **Secure strings in Composite types inside a configuration element get lost after pulling the remote git repo**

  Pulling the remote git repository causes the Configurations that contain CompositeTypes with secure strings to become invalid and lose the secure string value.
* **SaltStack Config - "Disconnected" Salt Masters are ranked higher in the report**

  Any Salt Masters that are disconnected show up higher in the report when both Present and Disconnected filters are enabled. While disconnected masters are important information, the default focus should be on the masters that are active and present.

## February 2023/ vRA 8.11.1 What's New

* **SaltStack Day2 Action Enhancements**

  You can now configure  "*additionalAuthParams*", "*additionalMinionParams*", and "*pillarEnvironment*" properties to SaltStack Day-2 action "*Attach SaltStack Resource" .*
* **vRealize Automation Terraform Service and accompanying Terraform provider now supports Terraform 1.0**

  The vRealize Automation Terraform Service and accompanying Terraform provider now supports Terraform 1.0.  This will allow our vRA customers the ability to consume Terraform 1.0 and provide the latest support for it.
* **Customized notifications in Service Broker**

  You can now customize the look and feel of notification emails sent out from VMware vRealize Automation Service Broker. The email header and footer can be standardized to your organization's branding requirements across all notification templates. For each notification scenario, you can now edit the email's body text and utilize dynamic attributes of deployments in the text. [Learn more](https://docs.vmware.com/en/vRealize-Automation/SaaS/Using-and-Managing-Service-Broker/GUID-24B1AF75-CA97-4A6E-A3BA-94D2B80F26EF.html).
* **Capacity management enhancements - Storage allocation limits**

  You can now specify a maximum storage allocation at the datastore level for all managed Disks. During provisioning, these properties are checked for placements to prevent storage overallocation.

  This is controlled by a feature toggle PREVENT\_COMPUTE\_STORAGE\_OVERALLOCATION that is turned off by default.
* **Deprecation of an identity service endpoint in vRealize Automation**

  Starting with this release, the `POST /am/idp/auth/login` endpoint is being deprecated; however, the `POST /csp/gateway/am/api/login` endpoint performs the same operation.

  For more information on this endpoint, refer to the [API Programming Guide](https://developer.vmware.com/docs/17860/GUID-6561CDF8-A174-498D-9FBD-F9BD89EF7660.html) . To access all Swagger specifications from a single landing page, go to https://<vRA-FQDN>/automation-ui/api-docs where vRA-FQDN is the FQDN of your vRealize Automation appliance.

  To prevent any scripts from breaking once the deprecated endpoint is removed after a few releases, perform this update:

  + Any automation that uses `POST /am/idp/auth/login` endpoint will have to be reworked to use the `POST /csp/gateway/am/api/login` endpoint.
* **Provision GCP TCP Load Balancers and perform Day 2 actions**

  You can now provision Google Compute Engine TCP Load Balancers, modify their properties, and setup health checks for the load balancers from vRealize Automation.
* **Provision GCP storage bucket resources**

  vRealize Automation now supports GCP storage buckets that allow users to easily create and manage their storage buckets.  This includes the creation of multi-regional/dual-regional buckets, restricted public access, and encryption support.

* [Resolved Issues](#February 2023/ vRA 8.11.1 What's New-Resolved Issues)

### Resolved Issues

* **Restore support for vRA Console to establish VMRC connections**

  vRA 8.11.1 restored the way VM Remote Console (VMRC) works as in pre-vRA 8.10.2 versions. Now, both ticket types (Mks & WebMks) are supported again and it is possible to leverage the vRA Console Proxy when establishing VMRC connections with Mks tickets. It is no longer required to open ESXi port 443 to public.

  **Note:** Since vCenter version 8.0 and newer only supports WebMks tickets, the only option when working with vRA VMRC is to use WebMks tickets. As a result, the Console Proxy cannot be used for VMRC functionality with vCenter 8.0 version.
* **Enhance Identity service (on-prem) endpoint to have more restrictive access**

  Some endpoints from vRealize Automation Identity API can now be accessed only by users with org owner role. It is recommended to review if the user accessing those endpoints has org owner role.

  Please reach out to VMware support for more information.
* **vRealize Orchestrator - StackOverFlowError during garbage collection of the Version History repository**

  The nightly garbage collection process of the Version History repository would fail due to a StackOverFlowError and would leave the Version History repository in a non-functional state.
* **Pushing an object using the Version button results in all local changes being pushed**

  Whenever you have an integrated active remote Git repository and you attempt to push either a single content object using the **Version** button, or a subset of your available **Local changes**, more than the expected number of selected items could be pushed to the remote Git repository. This issue would occur after a **Remote Branch** change, or after switching between active repositories.
* **When deployments with missing resources are deleted, those resources are still displayed as missing**

  When deployments with all missing resources are deleted, those resources are orphaned and still show in the UI as missing. These orphaned resources can no longer be removed from vRealize Automation.
* **External vRealize Orchestrator fail to start after change of vRealize Automation certificate**

  In vRO server version 8.10.2, if the system property **com.vmware.o11n.certPathValidator** is enabled with vRO is configured to use an external vRA as authentication provider, and vRA certificates are replaced with a certificate from the same Certificate Authority, then vRO UI throws an 404 error in the browser.

  For more info on this property, refer to: [Enabling the Certificate Path Validation Algorithm](https://docs.vmware.com/en/vRealize-Orchestrator/8.10/com.vmware.vrealize.orchestrator-install-config.doc/GUID-B9C498AA-611B-4AF6-8DF6-2BE963700F9F.html)
* **Composite types are not visible as input parameters when adding new input type in a workflow or day 2 actions**

  CompositeTypes that are declared only as part of Arrays ( e.g. Array/CompositeType(name:string,grade:number):Student ) will now be indexed and available for use in the type selectors across browser tabs and instances.

## API Documentation and Versioning

**Notice:** Release Notes for previous releases are archived yearly:

* [vRealize Automation Release Notes 2022 (8.8.1 - 8.11)](https://docs.vmware.com/en/vRealize-Automation/2022/vrealize_automation_release_notes_2022.pdf) The list of API changes for each release starts on page 40.

API documentation is available with the product. To access all Swagger documents from a single landing page, go to:

* https://www.mgmt.cloud.vmware.com/automation-ui/api-docs/ for vRealize Automation Cloud.
* https://<*appliance.domain.com*>/automation-ui/api-docs for vRealize Automation 8.x, where *appliance.domain.com* is your vRealize Automation appliance.

Before using the API, consider the latest API updates and changes for this release, and note any changes to the API services that you use. If you have not locked your API using the apiVersion variable before, you might encounter a change in an API response. Any API updates and changes are provided in the What's New section for each release.

For unlocked APIs, the default behavior varies depending upon the API.

* For Cloud Assembly IaaS APIs, all requests which are executed without the apiVersion parameter will be redirected to the first version which is 2019-01-15. This redirect will allow every user who did not previously specify the apiVersion parameter to transition smoothly to the latest version without experiencing breaking changes.

  NOTE: For the Cloud Assembly IaaS APIs, the latest version is apiVersion=2021-07-15. If left unlocked, IaaS API requests will be redirected to the first version which is 2019-01-15. The first version is deprecated and will be supported for 24 months. To ensure a smooth transition to the new version, lock your IaaS API requests with the apiVersion parameter assigned to 2021-07-15.

* For other APIs, your API requests will default to the latest version. If you select one of the earlier version dates listed for the Swagger spec, the API behavior will reflect APIs that were in effect as of that date and any date until the next most recent version date. APIs are not versioned for every vRealize Automation release and not all APIs support the apiVersion parameter.

For more information about using the apiVersion parameter, see the Programming Guides listed in [vRealize Automation APIs and CLI](https://docs.vmware.com/en/vRealize-Automation/index.html#vrealize-automation-apis-and-cli-2).

* [vRealize Orchestrator 7.4.0](https://docs.vmware.com/en/vRealize-Orchestrator/7.4/rn/VMware-vRealize-Orchestrator-74.html)

## Resolved Issues

* **Composite types are not available as input parameters when adding a new input type in a workflow or day 2 actions.**

  Previously, composite types were not available as input types for workflows or day 2 actions. Composite types declared only as part of Arrays, such as `Array/CompositeType(name:string,grade:number):Student`, are now indexed and available for use in the type selectors across browser tabs and instances.
* **User receives a stack overflow error during the garbage collection of the Version History repository.**

  vRealize Orchestrator performs a nightly garbage collection process for the content included under the Version History repository. During this process, you can receive a stack overflow error which causes the repository to become non-functional. The issue was resolved by doubling the running stack memory size of the vRealize Orchestrator Appliance server.

## Known Issues

* **The Generate Heap Dump option in the Control Center does not work.**

  An error occurs when attempting to use the **Generate Heap Dump** option found in the vRealize Orchestrator Control Center.

  **Workaround:**

  1. Log in to the vRealize Orchestrator Appliance command line over SSH as **root**.

  2. Run the following command to collect a heap dump:

  ```
  VCO_APP_PODS=$(kubectl get pod -n prelude -l app=vco-app -o jsonpath="{.items[*].metadata.name}"); for VCO_APP in $VCO_APP_PODS; do kubectl -n prelude exec -it $VCO_APP -c vco-server-app -- bash -c "jcmd 1 GC.heap_dump /var/log/collected-logs/heapdump-$( date '+%Y-%m-%d_%H:%M' ).hprof"; done
  ```

  The heap dump files are available in the `/services-logs/prelude/vco-app/file-logs/` directory on each of the appliance nodes. Heap dumps are included in generated log bundles.
* **Issue with displaying vCenter metamodel data in the API Explorer.**

  When adding or removing a vAPI endpoint by running the **Import vAPI metamodel** or **Remote vAPI metamodel** workflows, the changes (vCenter metamodel) are not displayed in the API Explorer when using the Apple Safari browser.

  This issue is valid for the DynamicTypes plug-in and any other plug-ins that include the dynamic addition or removal of types. This issue is not applicable for users using the Google Chrome browser.

  **Workaround:** Restart the vRealize Orchestrator Appliance.
* **User receives a "could not execute batch" error when trying to perform a Pull operation from an integrated Git repository.**

  In certain cases, whenever you have an integrated active remote Git repository and you attempt to perform an initial **Pull** operation from the **Git History** tab, the operation never succeeds and an error message stating `Error: could not execute batch` appears. This issue can occur after a migration from a vRealize Orchestrator 7.6 deployment or after previously having an integration with a remote Git repository which might contain duplicate content.

  **Workaround**:

  1. Create a package, containing all of your current local changes as seen in the **Git History** tab.
  2. Export the package with all available options selected.
  3. Delete the package but keep its content.
  4. Navigate to the **Git History** tab and click **Discard All** from the **Local changes** section. When a new window appears, confirm the request by clicking **Discard**.
  5. Re-import the package by navigating back to the **Packages** tab and clicking the **Import** button.
  6. Select your previously created package with all of your previous local changes.
  7. Make sure to have all package elements selected to be imported under the **Package elements** tab.
  8. Make sure the **Import configuration attribute values**, **Import configuration SecureString attribute values**, and **Tag import mode** settings are properly set.
  9. Click **Import**.

## Previously Known Issues

This section contains previously known issues (known issues remaining from earlier releases of vRealize Orchestrator that still exist in the product).

* **The Storage VSAN workflows of the vCenter Server plug-in do not support adding Solid-State Drive (SSD) disks to an ESXi host.**

  The **Add disks to disk group** and **Remove disks from disk groups** workflows do not support adding SSD disks as capacity disks to ESXi hosts.

  No workaround.
* **Action code for actions set as external sources does not update properly.**

  The script content of actions set as external sources within workflow input forms is cached for one minute after the last form evaluation, which is performed when the input form was opened for the last time. If an action is updated and the form is opened within the one minute timeframe, the cached script is performed and the content of the updated action script is not displayed in the input form.

  **Workaround:** Wait for a period of one or two minutes after the last opening of the input form so the updated action script can be run.
* **Problems handling non-ASCII characters in certain contexts.**

  Using non-ASCII characters in input parameters results in incorrect behavior in the following situations:

  + If you run the **SCP put** or **SCP get** workflows from the SSH folder on a file with a name that contains non-ASCII characters, the workflow runs but the name of the resulting file on the destination machine is unreadable.
  + If you try to insert non-ASCII characters into variable names, the characters do not appear. This issue occurs for workflow variables and action variables.

  No workaround.
* **The SSH plug-in encounters firewall connectivity issues.**

  The SSH plug-in cannot connect to a Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) firewall.

  **Workaround:** The SSH plug-in for vRealize Orchestrator 7.1 does not support connectivity to a Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) firewall.
* **If you experience issues connecting to a SOAP or a REST host, or importing a certificate, you might have to explicitly enable certain versions of SSL or TLS.**

  For information about this issue, see [the Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE) Reference Guide](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/jsse/JSSERefGuide.html).

  **Workaround:** For information about explicitly enabling SSLv3 and TLSv1 for outgoing HTTPS connections, see [How to enable TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 for outgoing HTTPS connections in vRO 6.0.x (KB 2144316)](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2144316).
* **The SOAP plug-in cannot connect through an authenticated proxy server.**

  When attempting to run the **Add a SOAP host** workflow, you encounter an issue with the proxy server authentication.

  **Workaround:** When running the workflow, use a proxy server that does not require authentication.
* **The vRealize Orchestrator authentication configuration might become invalid if the authentication provider certificate changes or regenerates.**

  When the SSL certificate of the vRealize Automation or vSphere instance that is configured as the authentication provider in Control Center is changed or regenerated, the vRealize Orchestrator authentication configuration becomes invalid, and the vRealize Orchestrator server cannot start.

  **Workaround:** Import the new authentication provider certificate:

  1. Log in to Control Center as **root**.
  2. Click **Certificates**.
  3. Click the **Import on the Trusted Certificates** tab.
  4. Load the SSL certificate from a URL or a file.
  5. Click **Import**.
* **During the installation of a plug-in in the vRealize Orchestrator Control Center, an error message appears.**

  When you install a plug-in from the **Manage Plug-Ins** page in Control Center, the following error message appears: **Plug-in 'name\_of\_the\_plug-in' (plug-in\_file\_name) is not compatible with the current platform version. Supported platform versions are 'names\_of\_the\_supported\_versions'. Clicking on the 'Install' button will install it anyway**.

  **Workaround:** You can safely ignore this error and proceed with the installation of the plug-in.
* Adding values to vCenter Server data object properties of the **Array** type is not possible.

  When vRealize Orchestrator runs scripts, the vCenter Server plug-in converts JavaScript arrays to Java arrays of a fixed size. As a result, you cannot add new values to vCenter Server data objects that take arrays as property values. You can create an object that takes an array as a property if you instantiate that object by passing it a pre-filled array. However, after you instantiate the object, you cannot add values to the array.

  For example, the following code does not work:

  ```
  var spec = new VcVirtualMachineConfigSpec();
  spec.deviceChange = [];
  spec.deviceChange[0] = new VcVirtualDeviceConfigSpec();
  System.log(spec.deviceChange[0]);
  ```

  In the above code, vRealize Orchestrator converts the empty **spec.deviceChange** JavaScript array into the fixed-size Java array **VirtualDeviceConfigSpec[]** before it calls **setDeviceChange()**. When calling **spec.deviceChange[0] = new VcVirtualDeviceConfigSpec()**, vRealize Orchestrator calls **getDeviceChange()** and the array remains a fixed, empty Java array. Calling s**pec.deviceChange.add()** results in the same behavior.

  **Workaround**: Declare the array as a local variable:

  ```
  var spec = new VcVirtualMachineConfigSpec();
  var deviceSpec = [];
  deviceSpec[0] = new VcVirtualDeviceConfigSpec();
  spec.deviceChange = deviceSpec;
  System.log(spec.deviceChange[0]);
  ```
