Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2023-20201:

**1. Verification:**

The content explicitly mentions "CVE-2023-20201" in the context of a Cisco Security Advisory regarding Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Cisco Prime Infrastructure and Cisco Evolved Programmable Network Manager (EPNM). This confirms the content is related to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is insufficient validation of user-supplied input within the web-based management interface of Cisco Prime Infrastructure and EPNM. This lack of validation allows an attacker to inject malicious HTML or script content.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

The primary vulnerability is a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This means malicious scripts can be persistently stored on the server and executed when a user interacts with the affected page. There is also a reflected XSS vulnerability identified which allows an attacker to craft a URL that injects malicious code, when a user clicks on the malicious link, submitting a specially crafted form, or even just browsing to a malicious site, the injected code travels to the vulnerable web site, which reflects the attack back to the user’s browser. The browser then executes the code because it came from a “trusted” server.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

A successful exploit could allow an attacker to:

*   Execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface.
*   Access sensitive, browser-based information (e.g., cookies, session tokens).

**5. Attack Vectors:**

The attack vector involves an authenticated, remote attacker who:

*   Has valid credentials to access the web-based management interface of the affected device.
*   Persuades a user of the interface to view a page containing the malicious code, which would execute within the user's browser context.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker must possess valid credentials to access the web interface of the Cisco Prime Infrastructure or EPNM.
*   **Remote Access:** The attacker can conduct the attack remotely.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker must persuade a user to interact with malicious content, usually through a link or crafted page.

**Additional Details:**
*   **Affected Products:** Cisco Prime Infrastructure and Cisco EPNM.
*   **Fixed Software:** Cisco has released software updates for both products, specifically version 3.10.4 for Prime Infrastructure and version 7.1 for EPNM.
*   **Workarounds:** There are no workarounds available.
*   **CVSS Score:** The base CVSS score is 4.8 (Medium severity) with the vector:  CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N.
*   **CWE:** The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation).
*   **Internal Discovery:** The vulnerability was found during internal security testing.

**Summary:**

CVE-2023-20201 details a medium-severity stored XSS vulnerability in Cisco Prime Infrastructure and EPNM. An attacker with valid credentials could inject malicious code via the web interface which, when viewed by another authenticated user, could result in the execution of arbitrary script code and access to sensitive browser data. The vulnerability is caused by inadequate input validation and requires a user to interact with the malicious content for successful exploitation.
