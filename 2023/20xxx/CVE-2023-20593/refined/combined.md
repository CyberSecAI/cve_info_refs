Hi,

Thank you Xen security team for indirectly bringing the various CPU
issues in here.  This is very helpful, as your messages on them serve
two purposes at once - informing the community about issues fixed in Xen
(so directly on-topic here, with Xen being Open Source) and about the
CPU issues that typically also need to be mitigated by other projects.

The above link is wrong - it's for CVE-2023-20593 Zenbleed in Zen2.

The correct link for CVE-2023-20588, the DIV bug in Zen1, appears to be:

<https://www.amd.com/en/resources/product-security/bulletin/amd-sb-7007.html>

While I am at it, here's the corresponding mitigation in Linux kernel:

An impressive finding, indeed!

On a related note:

A few months earlier, Tavis found a _different_ AMD Zen1/Zen2 bug, which
turned out to have already been known and patched in AMD microcode
updates for many affected parts (but apparently not all).  There's also
a kernel level workaround, which was included into Linux in response to
Tavis' rediscovery of that issue.  Here are the links for that other
issue/fix, for distros to double-check they're fixing this one as well:

x86/CPU/AMD: Disable XSAVES on AMD family 0x17 (Mar 8, 2023)

Once again, it's a different bug - not the one that this oss-security
thread is mainly about - but both have cross-process security impact,
affect similar AMD CPUs, and need to be taken care of by similar means
(microcode updates or/and disabling of affected CPU features in the
kernel).

Package        : linux
CVE ID         : CVE-2023-3390 CVE-2023-3610 CVE-2023-20593

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2023-3390

    A use-after-free flaw in the netfilter subsystem caused by incorrect
    error path handling may result in denial of service or privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2023-3610

    A use-after-free flaw in the netfilter subsystem caused by incorrect
    refcount handling on the table and chain destroy path may result in
    denial of service or privilege escalation.

CVE-2023-20593

    Tavis Ormandy discovered that under specific microarchitectural
    circumstances, a vector register in AMD "Zen 2" CPUs may not be
    written to 0 correctly.  This flaw allows an attacker to leak
    sensitive information across concurrent processes, hyper threads
    and virtualized guests.

    For details please refer to
    <<https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/zenbleed.html>> and
    <<https://github.com/google/security-research/security/advisories/GHSA-v6wh-rxpg-cmm8>>.

    This issue can also be mitigated by a microcode update through the
    amd64-microcode package or a system firmware (BIOS/UEFI) update.
    However, the initial microcode release by AMD only provides
    updates for second generation EPYC CPUs.  Various Ryzen CPUs are
    also affected, but no updates are available yet.

For the oldstable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed
in version 5.10.179-3.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

For the detailed security status of linux please refer to its security
tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux>

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

OS vendors can include it in microcode updates just fine assuming the change is minor (Spectre/Meltdown did take quite some time to iron out stability to live patch it).

Sure, but that's orthogonal to my concern, which was about areas of
responsibility and control (such as sysadmin vs. tools).

Anyway, it was pointed out to me off-list that Linux kernel does the
same thing, also explicitly disabling chickenbit when deemed safe:

<https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=522b1d69219d8f083173819fde04f994aa051a98>

+	if (!cpu_has_zenbleed_microcode()) {
+		pr_notice_once("Zenbleed: please update your microcode for the most optimal fix\n");
+		msr_set_bit(MSR_AMD64_DE_CFG, MSR_AMD64_DE_CFG_ZEN2_FP_BACKUP_FIX_BIT);
+	} else {
+		msr_clear_bit(MSR_AMD64_DE_CFG, MSR_AMD64_DE_CFG_ZEN2_FP_BACKUP_FIX_BIT);
+	}

So at least it's a consistent approach by these two projects, and a
reason for Xen to be doing it this way.

I see this one goes from December 2022 to present:

<https://github.com/omniosorg/omnios-build/blob/r151044/doc/ReleaseNotes.md>

and this one from May 2022 to April 2023:

<https://github.com/omniosorg/omnios-build/blob/r151042/doc/ReleaseNotes.md>

So that's already more than a year, and I don't need to look further.

Also, I note this reply by Bob Friesenhahn:

So I think we can accept OmniOS as new distros list member, if that's
desired and Dan would represent OmniOS on the list.  This subscription
on its own would not allow sharing of info with other illumos distros.

In special cases, Dan would be able to ask the issue reporters their
explicit permission to share with other illumos distros.

If those distros do typically need the info, they may request direct
list membership.

How does this sound to you, Dan?

This looks pretty good for OmniOS, e.g. for OpenSSL CVE-2023-3817 it
appears to be 4 days from OpenSSL advisory on "31st July 2023" to OmniOS
"r151046n (2023-08-03)", and even something like 1 day for OpenSSH
update to "9.3p2, fixing CVE-2023-38408" and for "AMD CPU microcode
updated to 20230719, mitigating CVE-2023-20593 on some Zen2 processors"
in "r151046m (2023-07-25)" (it was brought to oss-security on July 24).

That page above goes back to May 2023.  Were there separate ones for
older releases?  For "a publicly verifiable track record, dating back at
least 1 year and continuing to present day".

This sounds very different from how the existing distros list members
operate.  In fact, it may be inconsistent with our current policy for
list members, which says:

<https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/distros#list-policy-and-instructions-for-members>

"Aside from your participation in discussions with the reporter and on
the (linux-)distros lists (including possibly continuing to CC other
prior recipients of the information), the information you receive
through the (linux-)distros lists must not be made public, shared, nor
even hinted at anywhere beyond the need-to-know within your distro's
team except with the reporter's explicit approval, until the agreed upon
public disclosure date/time or substantially complete publication by
others.  Neither you nor others you inform may use the information for
anything other than getting the issue fixed for your distro's users and,
only in rare extreme cases, for deployment of maximally non-revealing
changes to maintain security of your distro's infrastructure most
essential to the distro users' security in face of the security issue
being dealt with.  The need-to-know condition is met only if the person
needs to participate in one of these two activities."

Note the words "within your distro's team".  However, now you say you'll
"warn distro-runners", and in your first message you wrote:

> Like Linux, we have downstream distros.  Unlike Linux, illumos is more
> than what Linux would call, "kernel".

So you'd be joining as upstream for multiple other distros, who you'd be
sharing the info with.  I'd say that per the current criteria and policy
for members, those individual distros would need to qualify and join (or
not) one by one.  I actually doubt all of them would meet our current
criteria, so your warning all of them would be a bypass.

Now, given good enough reasons, the criteria could be changed or an
exception could be made.  I think illumos is a great project, it's great
that you have a distro ecosystem, and several people I recognize have
spoken in favor (including off-list).  However, I am not convinced we
have a case here where we'd want to accept indirect sharing of info with
distros some of which might not qualify on their own.  If we were to do
that, then why would we be subjecting other distros (non-illumos)
applying on their own to these same criteria, or would we relax for all?

Please correct me if I misunderstood something, or/and suggest a way
forward (either fully consistent with the constraints above or with
specific changes you'd propose and the community would find reasonable).

Thanks,

Alexander

Subject: Re: CVE-2023-20593: A use-after-free in AMD Zen2
 Processors

Hi,

There seems to be confusion regarding which is the correct commit:

Your blog post says it's 0bc3126c9cfa0b8c761483215c25382f831a7c6f which is for
family 17h.

This post says it's b250b32ab1d044953af2dc5e790819a7703b7ee6 which is for family
19h.

I assume the 17h family one is the correct one?

Thanks,

Marc.

Package        : amd64-microcode
CVE ID         : CVE-2023-20593
Debian Bug     : 1041863

Tavis Ormandy discovered that under specific microarchitectural
circumstances, a vector register in "Zen 2" CPUs may not be written to 0
correctly. This flaw allows an attacker to leak register contents across
concurrent processes, hyper threads and virtualized guests.

For details please refer to
<https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/zenbleed.html>
<https://github.com/google/security-research/security/advisories/GHSA-v6wh-rxpg-cmm8>

The initial microcode release by AMD only provides updates for second
generation EPYC CPUs: Various Ryzen CPUs are also affected, but no
updates are available yet. Fixes will be provided in a later update once
they are released.

For more specific details and target dates please refer to the AMD
advisory at
<https://www.amd.com/en/resources/product-security/bulletin/amd-sb-7008.html>

For the oldstable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed
in version 3.20230719.1~deb11u1. Additionally the update contains a fix
for CVE-2019-9836.

For the stable distribution (bookworm), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.20230719.1~deb12u1.
We recommend that you upgrade your amd64-microcode packages.

For the detailed security status of amd64-microcode please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/amd64-microcode>

Does AMD make OS-loadable μcode patches available for client platforms,
or must all μcode loading on clients be done by the firmware?  If the
latter, then it will take a very long time for clients to get patched,
even if AMD released the updates promptly.  Also, server platforms can
usually reflash the firmware via the BMC, but client platforms do not
have this option.

Package        : linux-5.10
Version        : 5.10.179-3~deb10u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2023-2156 CVE-2023-3390 CVE-2023-3610 CVE-2023-20593
                 CVE-2023-31248 CVE-2023-35001

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2023-2156

    It was discovered that a flaw in the handling of the RPL protocol
    may allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause a denial of
    service if RPL is enabled (not by default in Debian).

CVE-2023-3390

    A use-after-free flaw in the netfilter subsystem caused by
    incorrect error path handling may result in denial of service or
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2023-3610

    A use-after-free flaw in the netfilter subsystem caused by
    incorrect refcount handling on the table and chain destroy path
    may result in denial of service or privilege escalation.

CVE-2023-20593

    Tavis Ormandy discovered that under specific microarchitectural
    circumstances, a vector register in AMD "Zen 2" CPUs may not be
    written to 0 correctly.  This flaw allows an attacker to leak
    sensitive information across concurrent processes, hyper threads
    and virtualized guests.

    For details please refer to
    <<https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/zenbleed.html>> and
    <<https://github.com/google/security-research/security/advisories/GHSA-v6wh-rxpg-cmm8>>.

    This issue can also be mitigated by a microcode update through the
    amd64-microcode package or a system firmware (BIOS/UEFI) update.
    However, the initial microcode release by AMD only provides
    updates for second generation EPYC CPUs.  Various Ryzen CPUs are
    also affected, but no updates are available yet.

CVE-2023-31248

    Mingi Cho discovered a use-after-free flaw in the Netfilter
    nf_tables implementation when using nft_chain_lookup_byid, which
    may result in local privilege escalation for a user with the
    CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any user or network namespace.

CVE-2023-35001

    Tanguy DUBROCA discovered an out-of-bounds reads and write flaw in
    the Netfilter nf_tables implementation when processing an
    nft_byteorder expression, which may result in local privilege
    escalation for a user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any
    user or network namespace.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
5.10.179-3~deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-5.10 packages.

For the detailed security status of linux-5.10 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux-5.10>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

According to the writeup [1] in Google's security repo "AMD unexpectedly
published patches" and was then forced to agree on an earlier disclosure
date.

Mistakes happens to everyone...

It is not a coincidence that Xen and Linux are similar here.  The areas
of responsibility aspect was raised during review - we did consider
combining with the old value.

AMD's position AIUI is that prior to Zenbleed, this bit was unsupported
and not used.  Therefore we went for the simpler approach (and as you
saw, still managed to screw that up).

and that patch then corrects the truncation by changing the type of the
chickenbit variable to 64-bit.  The context is:

+	/*
+	 * Microcode is the preferred mitigation, in terms of performance.
+	 * However, without microcode, this chickenbit (specific to the Zen2

+	val &= ~chickenbit;

+		val |= chickenbit;

This leaves me wondering: why have this line at all?  I understand Xen
wanting to enable the chicken bit on vulnerable CPUs, but why disable it
on other AMD CPUs?  If someone or something had enabled the bit, that's
probably intentional, and even if not it probably shouldn't be Xen's
business to alter CPU behavior beyond what's necessary for Xen itself to
work reliably and securely.

Am I missing something?

the updated amd64-microcode only contains the fixes published to linux-firmware,
which only affects epyc cpus, as noted. unless you're running epyc cpus (which
is slightly unlikely so i thought i'd mention it, but apologies if that is
indeed the case) you didn't actually receive any fix.

the latest kernel released today sets the chicken bit if no patched ucode is
loaded which also works to mitigate the issue.

you can test this by running the zenbleed reproduction, from
<https://cmpxchg8b.com/files/zenbleed-v5.tar.gz>

(if it outputs anything, you're vulnerable)

There is an earlier exit in this function for any non-Zen2 system.

So here, we are strictly on Zen2 (all vulnerable), and either have good
microcode or not.

The microcode fix is far more performant than the chickenbit.

This chickenbit is something unrelated to FP move-elimination on other
microarchitectures.

Package        : linux
CVE ID         : CVE-2023-20593

Tavis Ormandy discovered that under specific microarchitectural
circumstances, a vector register in AMD "Zen 2" CPUs may not be
written to 0 correctly.  This flaw allows an attacker to leak
sensitive information across concurrent processes, hyper threads
and virtualized guests.

For details please refer to
<<https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/zenbleed.html>> and
<<https://github.com/google/security-research/security/advisories/GHSA-v6wh-rxpg-cmm8>>.

This issue can also be mitigated by a microcode update through the
amd64-microcode package or a system firmware (BIOS/UEFI) update.
However, the initial microcode release by AMD only provides
updates for second generation EPYC CPUs.  Various Ryzen CPUs are
also affected, but no updates are available yet.

For the stable distribution (bookworm), this problem has been fixed in
version 6.1.38-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

For the detailed security status of linux please refer to its security
tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux>

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

Yes, very disappointing. Pure speculation; perhaps they were planning on
disclosing at the end of the year with full set of Microcode ready but
something we don't know (yet) forced them to disclose early. Who knows.

Very unscientific and limited test but I just compiled qemu 7.2.4 on a
gentoo workstation with a Ryzen 7 3700X (Zen 2) running linux kernel
5.15.119. Took 5 min 37s. Rebooted into 5.15.122 with the chicken bit fix
(confirmed in dmesg appears to be applied), compiled qemu again, this time
it took 5 min 25s. So my initial impression is the chicken bit fix is fine
in general but remains to be seen if certain workloads significantly
impacted I guess.

Yes, but it by no means covers all zen 2 models.  See amd-ucode/README

  Family=0x17 Model=0x31 Stepping=0x00: Patch=0x0830107a Length=3200 bytes
  Family=0x17 Model=0xa0 Stepping=0x00: Patch=0x08a00008 Length=3200 bytes

17-31-00 Rome/Castle Peak	0x0830107a
17-a0-00 Mendocino		0x08a00008

Models missing include:

17-60-01 Renoir			0x0860010b
17-68-01 Lucienne		0x08608105
17-71-00 Matisse		0x08701032
17-90-02 Van Gogh

The known good patch levels are used by xen and linux.  But the
microcode for Renoir, Lucienne and Matisse is not available as far as
I can tell.

            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2023-20593 / XSA-433
                              version 2

                          x86/AMD: Zenbleed

UPDATES IN VERSION 2
====================

Include the CVE, which was missed accidentally in the rush of
timelines repeatedly moving underfoot.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

Researchers at Google have discovered Zenbleed, a hardware bug causing
corruption of the vector registers.

When a VZEROUPPER instruction is discarded as part of a bad transient
execution path, its effect on internal tracking are not unwound
correctly.  This manifests as the wrong micro-architectural state
becoming architectural, and corrupting the vector registers.

Note: While this malfunction is related to speculative execution, this
      is not a speculative sidechannel vulnerability.

The corruption is not random.  It happens to be stale values from the
physical vector register file, a structure competitively shared between
sibling threads.  Therefore, an attacker can directly access data from
the sibling thread, or from a more privileged context.

For more details, see:
  <https://www.amd.com/en/resources/product-security/bulletin/amd-sb-7008.html>
  <https://github.com/google/security-research/security/advisories/GHSA-v6wh-rxpg-cmm8>

IMPACT
======

With very low probability, corruption of the vector registers can occur.
This data corruption causes mis-calculations in subsequent logic.

An attacker can exploit this bug to read data from different contexts on
the same core.  Examples of such data includes key material, cypher and
plaintext from the AES-NI instructions, or the contents of REP-MOVS
instructions, commonly used to implement memcpy().

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Systems running all versions of Xen are affected.

This bug is specific to the AMD Zen2 microarchitecture.  AMD do not
believe that other microarchitectures are affected.

MITIGATION
==========

This issue can be mitigated by disabling AVX, either by booting Xen with
`cpuid=no-avx` on the command line, or by specifying `cpuid="host:avx=0"` in
the vm.cfg file of all untrusted VMs.  However, this will come with a
significant impact on the system and is not recommended for anyone able to
deploy the microcode or patch described below.

RESOLUTION
==========

AMD are producing microcode updates to address the bug.  Consult your
dom0 OS vendor.  This microcode is effective when late-loaded, which can
be performed on a live system without reboot.

In cases where microcode is not available, the appropriate attached
patch updates Xen to use a control register to avoid the issue.

Note that patches for released versions are generally prepared to
apply to the stable branches, and may not apply cleanly to the most
recent release tarball.  Downstreams are encouraged to update to the
tip of the stable branch before applying these patches.

If you remove the first word from the string `"hello world"`, what should the result be? This is the story of how we discovered that the answer could be your root password!

## Introduction

All x86-64 CPUs have a set of 128-bit vector registers called the `XMM` registers. You can never have enough bits, so recent CPUs have extended the width of those registers up to 256-bit and even 512-bits.

The 256-bit extended registers are called `YMM`, and the 512-bit registers are `ZMM`.

These big registers are useful in lots of situations, not just number crunching! Theyâre even used by standard C library functions, like `strcmp`, `memcpy`, `strlen` and so on.

Letâs take a look at an example. Here are the first few instructions of glibcâs AVX2 optimized `strlen`:

```
(gdb) x/20i __strlen_avx2
...
   <__strlen_avx2+9>:   vpxor  xmm0,xmm0,xmm0
...
   <__strlen_avx2+29>:  vpcmpeqb ymm1,ymm0,YMMWORD PTR [rdi]
   <__strlen_avx2+33>:  vpmovmskb eax,ymm1
...
   <__strlen_avx2+41>:  tzcnt  eax,eax
   <__strlen_avx2+45>:  vzeroupper
   <__strlen_avx2+48>:  ret
```

The full routine is complicated and handles lots of cases, but letâs step through this simple case. Bear with me, I promise thereâs a point!

The first step is to initialize `ymm0` to zero, which is done by just `xor`ing `xmm0` with itself[1](#fn1).

> ![](img/zb-vpxor.svg)
>
> VPXOR xmm0, xmm0, xmm0
>
>
> ```
>     > vpxor xmm0, xmm0, xmm0
>       vpcmpeqb ymm1, ymm0, [rdi]
>       vpmovmskb eax, ymm1
>       tzcnt eax, eax
>       vzeroupper
> ```

Here `rdi` contains a pointer to our string, so `vpcmpeqb` will check which bytes in `ymm0` match our string, and stores the result in `ymm1`.

As weâve already set `ymm0` to all zero bytes, only nul bytes will match.

> ![](img/zb-vpcmpeqb.svg)
>
> vpcmpeqb ymm1, ymm0, rdi
>
>
> ```
>       vpxor xmm0, xmm0, xmm0
>     > vpcmpeqb ymm1, ymm0, [rdi]
>       vpmovmskb eax, ymm1
>       tzcnt eax, eax
>       vzeroupper
> ```

Now we can extract the result into a general purpose register like `eax` with `vpmovmskb`.

Any nul byte will create a 1 bit, and any other value will create a 0 bit.

> ![](img/zb-vpmovmskb.svg)
>
> vpmovmskb eax, ymm1
>
>
> ```
>       vpxor xmm0, xmm0, xmm0
>       vpcmpeqb ymm1, ymm0, [rdi]
>     > vpmovmskb eax, ymm1
>       tzcnt eax, eax
>       vzeroupper
> ```

Finding the first zero byte is now just a case of counting the number of trailing zero bits.

Thatâs a common enough operation that thereâs an instruction for it - `tzcnt` (Trailing Zero Count).

> ![](img/zb-tzcnt.svg)
>
> tzcnt eax, eax
>
>
> ```
>       vpxor xmm0, xmm0, xmm0
>       vpcmpeqb ymm1, ymm0, [rdi]
>       vpmovmskb eax, ymm1
>     > tzcnt eax, eax
>       vzeroupper
> ```

Now we have the position of the first nul byte, in just four machine instructions!

You can probably imagine just how often `strlen` is running on your system right now, but suffice to say, bits and bytes are flowing into these vector registers from all over your system constantly.

#### Zeroing Registers

You might have noticed that I missed one instruction, and thatâs `vzeroupper`.

> ![](img/zb-vzeroupper.svg)
>
> vzeroupper
>
>
> ```
>       vpxor xmm0, xmm0, xmm0
>       vpcmpeqb ymm1, ymm0, [rdi]
>       vpmovmskb eax, ymm1
>       tzcnt eax, eax
>     > vzeroupper
> ```

You guessed it, `vzeroupper` will zero the upper bits of the vector registers.

The reason we do this is because if you mix `XMM` and `YMM` registers, the `XMM` registers automatically get promoted to full width. Itâs a bit like integer promotion in C.

This works fine, but [superscalar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superscalar) processors need to track dependencies so that they know which operations can be parallelized. This promotion adds a dependency on those upper bits, and that causes unnecessary stalls while the processor waits for results it didnât really need.

These stalls are what glibc is trying to avoid with `vzeroupper`. Now any future results wonât depend on what those bits are, so we safely avoid that bottleneck!

#### The Vector Register File

Now that we know *what* `vzeroupper` does, *how* does it do it?

Your processor doesnât have a single physical location where each register lives, it has whatâs called a *[Register File](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_file)* and a *Register Allocation Table*. This is a bit like managing the heap with `malloc` and `free`, if you think of each register as a pointer. The RAT keeps track of what space in the register file is assigned to which register.

In fact, when you zero an `XMM` register, the processor doesnât store those bits anywhere at all - it just sets a flag called the [z-bit](https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/amd/microarchitectures/zen_2#Floating_Point_Unit) in the RAT. This flag can be applied to the upper and lower parts of `YMM` registers independently, so `vzeroupper` can simply set the z-bit and then release any resources assigned to it in the register file.

> ![Z-Bit](img/zb-zbit.svg "fig:")
>
>
> A register allocation table (left) and a physical register file (right).

#### Speculation

Hold on, thereâs another complication! Modern processors use [speculative execution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculative_execution), so sometimes operations have to be rolled back.

What should happen if the processor *speculatively* executed a `vzeroupper`, but then discovers that there was a branch misprediction? Well, we will have to revert that operation and put things back the way they wereâ¦ maybe we can just unset that z-bit?

If we return to the analogy of `malloc` and `free`, you can see that it canât be that simple - that would be like calling `free()` on a pointer, and then changing your mind!

That would be a use-after-free vulnerability, but there is no such thing as a use-after-free in a CPUâ¦ or is there?

Spoiler: ***yes there is*** ð

## Vulnerability

It turns out that with precise scheduling, you *can* cause some processors to recover from a mispredicted `vzeroupper` incorrectly!

This technique is CVE-2023-20593 and it works on all Zen 2 class processors, which includes at least the following products:

* AMD Ryzen 3000 Series Processors
* AMD Ryzen PRO 3000 Series Processors
* AMD Ryzen Threadripper 3000 Series Processors
* AMD Ryzen 4000 Series Processors with Radeon Graphics
* AMD Ryzen PRO 4000 Series Processors
* AMD Ryzen 5000 Series Processors with Radeon Graphics
* AMD Ryzen 7020 Series Processors with Radeon Graphics
* AMD EPYC âRomeâ Processors

The bug works like this, first of all you need to trigger something called the *XMM Register Merge Optimization*[2](#fn2), followed by a [register rename](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_renaming) and a mispredicted `vzeroupper`. This all has to happen within a precise window to work.

We now know that basic operations like `strlen`, `memcpy` and `strcmp` will use the vector registers - so we can effectively spy on those operations happening anywhere on the system! It doesnât matter if theyâre happening in other virtual machines, sandboxes, containers, processes, whatever!

This works because the register file is shared by everything on the same physical core. In fact, two hyperthreads even share the same physical register file.

Donât believe me? Letâs write an exploit ð

## Exploitation

There are quite a few ways to trigger this, but letâs examine a very simple example.

```
    vcvtsi2s{s,d}   xmm, xmm, r64
    vmovdqa         ymm, ymm
    jcc             overzero
    vzeroupper
overzero:
    nop
```

Here `cvtsi2sd` is used to trigger the merge optimization. Itâs not important what `cvtsi2sd` is *supposed* to do, Iâm just using it because itâs one of the instructions the manual says use that optimization[3](#fn3).

Then we need to trigger a [register rename](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_renaming), `vmovdqa` will work. If the conditional branch[4](#fn4) is taken but the CPU predicts the not-taken path, the `vzeroupper` will be mispredicted and the bug occurs!

#### Optimization

![](img/zb-exploit.gif)

Exploit Running

It turns out that mispredicting on purpose is difficult to optimize! It took a bit of work, but I found a variant that can leak about 30 kb per core, per second.

This is fast enough to monitor encryption keys and passwords as users login!

Weâre releasing our full technical advisory, along with all the associated code today. Full details will be available in our [security research repository](https://github.com/google/security-research/tree/master/pocs/cpus).

If you want to test the exploit, the code is available [here](/files/zenbleed-v5.tar.gz).

Note that the code is for Linux, but the bug is not dependent on any particular operating system - all operating systems are affected!

## Discovery

I found this bug by fuzzing, big surprise ð Iâm not the first person to apply fuzzing techniques to finding hardware flaws. In fact, vendors fuzz their own products extensively - the industry term for it is *Post-Silicon Validation*.

So how come this bug wasnât found earlier? I think I did a couple of things differently, perhaps with a new perspective as I donât have an EE background!

#### Feedback

The best performing fuzzers are guided by coverage [feedback](https://google.github.io/clusterfuzz/reference/coverage-guided-vs-blackbox/). The problem is that there is nothing really analogous to code coverage in CPUsâ¦ However, we do have [performance counters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_performance_counter)!

These will let us know when all kinds of [interesting architectural events](https://perfmon-events.intel.com/skylake.html) happen.

Feeding this data to the fuzzer lets us gently guide it towards exploring interesting features that we wouldnât have been able to find by chance alone!

It was challenging to get the details right, but I used this to teach my fuzzer to find interesting instruction sequences. This allowed me to discover features like merge optimization automatically, without any input from me!

#### Oracle

When we fuzz software, weâre usually looking for crashes. Software isnât supposed to crash, so we know something must have gone wrong if it does.

How can we know if a a CPU is executing a randomly generated program correctly? It might be completely correct for it to crash!

Well, a few solutions have been proposed to this problem. One approach is called [reversi](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4751878). The general idea is that for every random instruction you generate, you also generate the inverse (e.g.Â `ADD r1, r2` â `SUB r1, r2`). Any deviation from the initial state at the end of execution must have been an error, neat!

The reversi approach is clever, but it makes generating testcases very complicated for a CISC architecture like x86.

A simpler solution is to use an *oracle*. An oracle is just another CPU or a simulator that we can use to check the result. If we compare the results from our test CPU to our oracle CPU, any mismatch would suggest that something went wrong.

I developed a new approach with a combination of these two ideas, I call it *Oracle Serialization*.

#### Oracle Serialization

As developers we monitor the *macro-architectural state*, thatâs just things like register values. There is also the *micro-architectural state* which is mostly invisible to us, like the branch predictor, [out-of-order execution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-of-order_execution) state and the instruction [pipeline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_pipelining).

Serialization lets us have *some* control over that, by instructing the CPU to reset [instruction-level parallelism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction-level_parallelism). This includes things like store/load barriers, speculation fences, cache line flushes, and so on.

The idea of a Serialized Oracle is to generate a random program, then automatically transform it into a [serialized](https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/serialize#description) form.

---

A randomly generated sequence of instructions, and the same sequence but with randomized alignment, serialization and speculation fences added.

| `movnti [rbp+0x0],ebx` | `movnti [rbp+0x0],ebx` |
| --- | --- |
|  | `sfence` |
| `rcr dh,1` | `rcr dh,1` |
|  | `lfence` |
| `sub r10, rax` | `sub r10, rax` |
|  | `mfence` |
| `rol rbx, cl` | `rol rbx, cl` |
|  | `nop` |
| `xor edi,[rbp-0x57]` | `xor edi,[rbp-0x57]` |

---

These two program might have very different performance characteristics, but they should produce identical output. The serialized form can now be my oracle!

If the final states donât match, then there must have been some error in how they were executed micro-architecturally - that could indicate a bug.

This is exactly how we first discovered this vulnerability, the output of the serialized oracle didnât match!

## Solution

We reported this vulnerability to AMD on the 15th May 2023.

AMD have [released](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/firmware/linux-firmware.git/commit/?id=0bc3126c9cfa0b8c761483215c25382f831a7c6f) an microcode update for affected processors. Your BIOS or Operating System vendor may already have an update available that includes it.

#### Workaround

It is highly recommended to use the microcode update.

If you canât apply the update for some reason, there is a software workaround: you can set the [chicken bit](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/chicken_bit) `DE_CFG[9]`.

This may have some performance cost.

##### Linux

You can use `msr-tools` to set the chicken bit on all cores, like this:

```
# wrmsr -a 0xc0011029 $(($(rdmsr -c 0xc0011029) | (1<<9)))
```

##### FreeBSD

On FreeBSD you would use `cpucontrol(8)`.

##### Others

If youâre using some other operating system and donât know how to set MSRs, ask your vendor for assistance.

Note that it is *not* sufficient to disable SMT.

#### Detection

I am not aware of any reliable techniques to detect exploitation. This is because no special system calls or privileges are required.

It is definitely *not* possible to detect improper usage of `vzeroupper` statically, please donât try!

## Conclusion

It turns out that memory management is hard, even in silicon ð

#### Acknowledgements

This bug was discovered by me, Tavis Ormandy from Google Information Security!

I couldnât have found it without help from my colleagues, in particular Eduardo Vela Nava and Alexandra Sandulescu. I also had help analyzing the bug from Josh Eads.

Related, Ubuntu released an updated amd64-microcode around (or before)
1:45 PM EST today. My Ubuntu machines have already been patched.

I was kind of surprised to see how quickly it landed.

                 CVE-2023-35828

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2023-1380

    Jisoo Jang reported a heap out-of-bounds read in the brcmfmac
    Wi-Fi driver.  On systems using this driver, a local user could
    exploit this to read sensitive information or to cause a denial of
    service (crash).

CVE-2023-2002

    Ruiahn Li reported an incorrect permissions check in the Bluetooth
    subsystem.  A local user could exploit this to reconfigure local
    Bluetooth interfaces, resulting in information leaks, spoofing, or
    denial of service (loss of connection).

CVE-2023-2007

    Lucas Leong (@_wmliang_) and Reno Robert of Trend Micro Zero Day
    Initiative discovered a time-of-check-to-time-of-use flaw in the
    dpt_i2o SCSI controller driver.  A local user with access to a
    SCSI device using this driver could exploit this for privilege
    escalation.

    This flaw has been mitigated by removing support for the I2OUSRCMD
    operation.

CVE-2023-2269

    Zheng Zhang reported that improper handling of locking in the
    device mapper implementation may result in denial of service.

CVE-2023-3090

    It was discovered that missing initialization in ipvlan networking
    may lead to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, resulting in
    denial of service or potentially the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2023-3111

    The TOTE Robot tool found a flaw in the Btrfs filesystem driver
    that can lead to a use-after-free.  It's unclear whether an
    unprivileged user can exploit this.

CVE-2023-3141

    A flaw was discovered in the r592 memstick driver that could lead
    to a use-after-free after the driver is removed or unbound from a
    device.  The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2023-3268

    It was discovered that an out-of-bounds memory access in relayfs
    could result in denial of service or an information leak.

CVE-2023-3338

    Ornaghi Davide discovered a flaw in the DECnet protocol
    implementation which could lead to a null pointer dereference or
    use-after-free.  A local user can exploit this to cause a denial
    of service (crash or memory corruption) and probably for privilege
    escalation.

    This flaw has been mitigated by removing the DECnet protocol
    implementation.

CVE-2023-20593

    Tavis Ormandy discovered that under specific microarchitectural
    circumstances, a vector register in AMD "Zen 2" CPUs may not be
    written to 0 correctly.  This flaw allows an attacker to leak
    sensitive information across concurrent processes, hyper threads
    and virtualized guests.

    For details please refer to
    <<https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/zenbleed.html>> and
    <<https://github.com/google/security-research/security/advisories/GHSA-v6wh-rxpg-cmm8>>.

    This issue can also be mitigated by a microcode update through the
    amd64-microcode package or a system firmware (BIOS/UEFI) update.
    However, the initial microcode release by AMD only provides
    updates for second generation EPYC CPUs.  Various Ryzen CPUs are
    also affected, but no updates are available yet.

CVE-2023-31084

    It was discovered that the DVB Core driver does not properly
    handle locking of certain events, allowing a local user to cause a
    denial of service.

CVE-2023-32233

    Patryk Sondej and Piotr Krysiuk discovered a use-after-free flaw
    in the Netfilter nf_tables implementation when processing batch
    requests, which may result in local privilege escalation for a
    user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any user or network
    namespace.

CVE-2023-34256

    The syzbot tool found a time-of-check-to-time-of-use flaw in the
    ext4 filesystem driver.  An attacker able to mount a disk image or
    device that they can also write to directly could exploit this to
    cause an out-of-bounds read, possibly resulting in a leak of
    sensitive information or denial of service (crash).

CVE-2023-35788

    Hangyu Hua discovered an out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the
    Flower classifier which may result in denial of service or the
    execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2023-35823

    A flaw was discovered in the saa7134 media driver that could lead
    to a use-after-free after the driver is removed or unbound from a
    device.  The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2023-35824

CVE-2023-35828

    A flaw was discovered in the renesas_udc USB device-mode driver
    that could lead to a use-after-free after the driver is removed or
    unbound from a device.  The security impact of this is unclear.

    This driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
4.19.289-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

For the detailed security status of linux please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux>

the amd security bulletin at
<https://www.amd.com/en/resources/product-security/bulletin/amd-sb-7008.html>
states that really only 2nd-gen epyc is fixed. etas for all other cpus (consumer
level) are in october/november/december.

quoting above:
2nd Gen AMD EPYC™ Processors "Rome" (fixed)
AMD Ryzen 3000 Series Desktop Processors "Matisse" (Target Dec 2023)
AMD Ryzen 4000 Series Desktop Processors with Radeon Graphics "Renoir" AM4 (Target Dec 2023)
AMD Ryzen Threadripper 3000 Series Processors "Castle Peak" HEDT (Target Oct 2023)
AMD Ryzen Threadripper PRO 3000WX Series Processors "Castle Peak" WS SP3 (Target Nov 2023/Dec 2023)
AMD Ryzen 5000 Series Mobile Processors with Radeon Graphics "Lucienne" (Target Dec 2023)
AMD Ryzen 4000 Series Mobile Processors with Radeon Graphics "Renoir" (Target Nov 2023)
AMD Ryzen 7020 Series Processors "Mendocino" FT6 (Target Dec 2023)

this is a disaster of a security announcement from AMD. nothing is fixed except
for epyc. the only workaround anyone really has is the chicken bit, thankfully.

            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2023-20593 / XSA-433
                               version 3

                          x86/AMD: Zenbleed

UPDATES IN VERSION 3
====================

The patch provided with earlier versions was buggy.  It unintentionally
disable more bits than expected in the control register.  The contents of this
register is not generally known, so the effects on the system are unknown.

A patch correcting this error has been committed and backported to all stable
trees which got the XSA-433 fix originally.  Additionally, it is attached to
this advisory as xsa433-bugfix.patch, and applicable to all branches in this
form.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

Researchers at Google have discovered Zenbleed, a hardware bug causing
corruption of the vector registers.

When a VZEROUPPER instruction is discarded as part of a bad transient
execution path, its effect on internal tracking are not unwound
correctly.  This manifests as the wrong micro-architectural state
becoming architectural, and corrupting the vector registers.

Note: While this malfunction is related to speculative execution, this
      is not a speculative sidechannel vulnerability.

The corruption is not random.  It happens to be stale values from the
physical vector register file, a structure competitively shared between
sibling threads.  Therefore, an attacker can directly access data from
the sibling thread, or from a more privileged context.

For more details, see:
  <https://www.amd.com/en/resources/product-security/bulletin/amd-sb-7008.html>
  <https://github.com/google/security-research/security/advisories/GHSA-v6wh-rxpg-cmm8>

IMPACT
======

With very low probability, corruption of the vector registers can occur.
This data corruption causes mis-calculations in subsequent logic.

An attacker can exploit this bug to read data from different contexts on
the same core.  Examples of such data includes key material, cypher and
plaintext from the AES-NI instructions, or the contents of REP-MOVS
instructions, commonly used to implement memcpy().

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Systems running all versions of Xen are affected.

This bug is specific to the AMD Zen2 microarchitecture.  AMD do not
believe that other microarchitectures are affected.

MITIGATION
==========

This issue can be mitigated by disabling AVX, either by booting Xen with
`cpuid=no-avx` on the command line, or by specifying `cpuid="host:avx=0"` in
the vm.cfg file of all untrusted VMs.  However, this will come with a
significant impact on the system and is not recommended for anyone able to
deploy the microcode or patch described below.

RESOLUTION
==========

AMD are producing microcode updates to address the bug.  Consult your
dom0 OS vendor.  This microcode is effective when late-loaded, which can
be performed on a live system without reboot.

In cases where microcode is not available, the appropriate attached
patch updates Xen to use a control register to avoid the issue.

Note that patches for released versions are generally prepared to
apply to the stable branches, and may not apply cleanly to the most
recent release tarball.  Downstreams are encouraged to update to the
tip of the stable branch before applying these patches.

**[Full Disclosure](/fulldisclosure/)** — A public, vendor-neutral forum for detailed discussion of vulnerabilities and exploitation techniques, as well as tools, papers, news, and events of interest to the community. The relaxed atmosphere of this quirky list provides some comic relief and certain industry gossip. More importantly, fresh vulnerabilities sometimes hit this list many hours or days before they pass through the Bugtraq moderation queue.

Subject: Xen Security Advisory 433 v3 (CVE-2023-20593) - x86/AMD: Zenbleed

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2023-20593 / XSA-433
                               version 3

                          x86/AMD: Zenbleed

UPDATES IN VERSION 3
====================

The patch provided with earlier versions was buggy.  It unintentionally
disable more bits than expected in the control register.  The contents of this
register is not generally known, so the effects on the system are unknown.

A patch correcting this error has been committed and backported to all stable
trees which got the XSA-433 fix originally.  Additionally, it is attached to
this advisory as xsa433-bugfix.patch, and applicable to all branches in this
form.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

Researchers at Google have discovered Zenbleed, a hardware bug causing
corruption of the vector registers.

When a VZEROUPPER instruction is discarded as part of a bad transient
execution path, its effect on internal tracking are not unwound
correctly.  This manifests as the wrong micro-architectural state
becoming architectural, and corrupting the vector registers.

Note: While this malfunction is related to speculative execution, this
      is not a speculative sidechannel vulnerability.

The corruption is not random.  It happens to be stale values from the
physical vector register file, a structure competitively shared between
sibling threads.  Therefore, an attacker can directly access data from
the sibling thread, or from a more privileged context.

For more details, see:
  <https://www.amd.com/en/resources/product-security/bulletin/amd-sb-7008.html>
  <https://github.com/google/security-research/security/advisories/GHSA-v6wh-rxpg-cmm8>

IMPACT
======

With very low probability, corruption of the vector registers can occur.
This data corruption causes mis-calculations in subsequent logic.

An attacker can exploit this bug to read data from different contexts on
the same core.  Examples of such data includes key material, cypher and
plaintext from the AES-NI instructions, or the contents of REP-MOVS
instructions, commonly used to implement memcpy().

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Systems running all versions of Xen are affected.

This bug is specific to the AMD Zen2 microarchitecture.  AMD do not
believe that other microarchitectures are affected.

MITIGATION
==========

This issue can be mitigated by disabling AVX, either by booting Xen with
`cpuid=no-avx` on the command line, or by specifying `cpuid="host:avx=0"` in
the vm.cfg file of all untrusted VMs.  However, this will come with a
significant impact on the system and is not recommended for anyone able to
deploy the microcode or patch described below.

RESOLUTION
==========

AMD are producing microcode updates to address the bug.  Consult your
dom0 OS vendor.  This microcode is effective when late-loaded, which can
be performed on a live system without reboot.

In cases where microcode is not available, the appropriate attached
patch updates Xen to use a control register to avoid the issue.

Note that patches for released versions are generally prepared to
apply to the stable branches, and may not apply cleanly to the most
recent release tarball.  Downstreams are encouraged to update to the
tip of the stable branch before applying these patches.

The microcode is effective when late-loaded, and this code might run
after a microcode update and/or kexec.  Not sure if this is the actual
explanation.

Oops.  I thought I'd fixed that, but apparently not.

You're correct.  I'll issue an update in a moment.

Not really.  That patch entirely misunderstood the vulnerability.  I
went through several rounds of getting AMD to better-understand their bug.

Linux's fix was rewritten in
<https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=f58d6fbcb7c848b7f2469be339bc571f2e9d245b>
and this implements the same logic as I implemented in Xen.

It's worth noting that because AMD did not allocate a $FOO_NO CPUID bit,
there's no ability for a VM to figure out that it might move to
vulnerable hardware and therefore should engage the workaround.  The
best a VM can do is best-effort based on whether it looks like it's
booting on a Zen1 system.

Also the cross-thread nature is also poorly reported in public.

Thanks,

~Andrew
