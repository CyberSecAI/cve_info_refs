{
  "CVE-2023-20593": {
    "Root cause": "Under specific microarchitectural circumstances, a vector register in AMD Zen 2 CPUs may not be written to 0 correctly due to a use-after-free condition.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can leak sensitive information across concurrent processes, hyper threads and virtualized guests, potentially gaining access to sensitive data like keys and passwords.",
     "Attack vectors": [
      "Speculative execution",
      "Specific instruction sequences involving merge optimization, register rename, and mispredicted VZEROUPPER instruction"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "No special system calls or privileges are required, the attacker needs to be able to execute code on a vulnerable AMD Zen 2 CPU."
