- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A bug in the gorouter process where prematurely closed client connections lead to incorrect backend removal from the routing pool.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The gorouter marks backends as failed and removes them from the routing pool upon client disconnects, without proper checks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Repeated premature closing of client connections can lead to a denial of service (DOS) by removing all backends from an application's route.
- **Attack vectors:** Attackers can cause a DOS by repeatedly closing client connections prematurely, triggering the faulty logic in gorouter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attackers need to be able to establish connections to the gorouter and then close them prematurely.
