Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-20971:

**1. Verification:**
   - The provided content from the Android Security Bulletin, specifically the August 2024 bulletin and the Pixel Update Bulletinâ€”June 2023, directly mentions CVE-2023-20971.
   - The commit messages from android.googlesource.com also relate to this CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in improper error handling for non-dynamic permissions. The vulnerability exists when the `removePermission()` function is called for a non-dynamic permission.  The code should have returned early to avoid an unnecessary call to removePermission().

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - Incorrect handling of non-dynamic permissions when attempting to remove them. Specifically, a function intended for removing dynamic permissions was being called on non-dynamic permissions.
   - The vulnerability exists in the framework component.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability to elevate their privileges.
   - The August 2024 bulletin indicates that this vulnerability can lead to "local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed" and is considered "High" severity. The June 2023 pixel bulletin also classifies it as EoP and moderate.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - **Local:** The vulnerability is exploitable through local access to the affected device.
   - An attacker would need to find a way to call the vulnerable `removePermission()` function on a non-dynamic permission.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - The attacker must have local access to the device.
   - The attacker needs to have the ability to invoke the vulnerable function (i.e., they would need to find a path that leads to the vulnerable code).

**Additional Notes:**
   - The provided commit messages fix the issue by adding an early return in the `removePermission()` function when it's called for a non-dynamic permission, preventing the unnecessary call to the removal logic.
   - The vulnerability exists in Android versions 12, 12L, 13 and 14
