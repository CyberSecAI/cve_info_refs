Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-20756:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow within the `keyinstall` component.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-190 Integer Overflow or Wraparound**: The core issue is that a calculation within the `keyinstall` component is susceptible to integer overflow. This happens when the result of an arithmetic operation exceeds the maximum value that the variable can hold.
- **Out-of-bounds Write:** The integer overflow leads to an out-of-bounds write, potentially corrupting memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Local Escalation of Privilege (EoP):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to an attacker gaining elevated privileges, specifically System execution privileges, on the affected device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local:** The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to have some level of access to the device to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute code with System execution privileges.
- No user interaction is required for exploitation.

**Affected Chipsets:**
- A large number of MediaTek chipsets are affected, including: MT6580, MT6731, MT6735, MT6737, MT6739, MT6753, MT6757, MT6757C, MT6757CD, MT6757CH, MT6761, MT6762, MT6763, MT6765, MT6768, MT6769, MT6771, MT6779, MT6781, MT6785, MT6789, MT6833, MT6835, MT6853, MT6853T, MT6855, MT6873, MT6875, MT6877, MT6879, MT6883, MT6885, MT6886, MT6889, MT6891, MT6893, MT6895, MT6983, MT6985, MT8185, MT8321, MT8385, MT8666, MT8667, MT8765, MT8766, MT8768, MT8781, MT8786, MT8788, MT8789, MT8791, MT8791T, MT8797.

**Affected Software Versions:**
- Android 12.0 and 13.0 are affected by this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is rated as "Medium" severity.
- The exploit does not require user interaction, meaning it can potentially be exploited silently.
