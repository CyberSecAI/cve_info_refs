- **Root cause of vulnerability:**  A missing bounds check in the `apu` component.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper input validation leading to a potential out-of-bounds write.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Local escalation of privilege.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access is required, no user interaction needed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** System execution privileges are needed for exploitation.
