# Planning Your Upgrade

Before upgrading the Secure Firewall ASA, you should perform the following preparation:

* Check the upgrade path for the current version to the target version; ensure you plan for any intermediate versions required
  for each operating system.
* Check for guidelines and limitations that affect your intermediate and target versions, or that affect failover and clustering
  zero downtime upgrading.
* Download all software packages required from Cisco.com.
* Back up your configurations, especially if there is a configuration migration.

The following topics explain how to upgrade your ASA.

## Important Guidelines Before You Upgrade

Check for upgrade guidelines and limitations, and configuration migrations for each operating system.

* [ASA Upgrade Guidelines](#id_47465)
* [FXOS Upgrade Guidelines](#concept_svt_h1k_ddb)

### ASA Upgrade Guidelines

Before you upgrade, check for migrations and any other guidelines.

* [Version-Specific Guidelines and Migrations](#id_28407)
* [Clustering Guidelines](#id_47469)
* [Failover Guidelines](#id_47468)
* [Additional Guidelines](#id_30935)

#### Version-Specific Guidelines and Migrations

Depending on your current version, you might experience one or more configuration migrations, and have to consider configuration
guidelines for all versions between the starting version and the ending version when you upgrade.

* [9.22 Guidelines](#reference_vhz_k1p_2bc)
* [9.20 Guidelines](#reference_sg1_cfr_ryb)
* [9.19 Guidelines](#reference_ufy_bvb_w5b)
* [9.18 Guidelines](#reference_jt1_mnq_3tb)
* [9.17 Guidelines](#reference_atw_r5v_wpb)
* [9.16 Guidelines](#reference_ljp_k1w_wpb)
* [9.15 Guidelines](#reference_rql_v5v_wpb)
* [9.14 Guidelines](#reference_dsk_w5v_wpb)
* [9.13 Guidelines](#reference_ecm_x5v_wpb)

* [9.4 Guidelines and Migration](#id_28718)
* [9.3 Guidelines and Migration](#id_47473)
* [9.2 Guidelines and Migration](#reference_nxf_5ts_bz)
* [9.1 Guidelines and Migration](#reference_rkb_zm1_cz)
* [9.0 Guidelines and Migration](#reference_ckl_4n1_cz)
* [8.4 Guidelines and Migration](#reference_v1n_h41_cz)
* [8.3 Guidelines and Migration](#reference_xvt_541_cz)

##### 9.22 Guidelines

* **Smart licensing default transport changed in 9.22**—In 9.22, the smart licensing
  default transport changed from Smart Call Home to Smart Transport. You can
  configure the ASA to use Smart Call Home if necessary using the
  transport type callhome  command. When you
  upgrade to 9.22, the transport is automatically changed Smart Transport. If
  you downgrade, the transport is set back to Smart Call Home, and if you want
  to use Smart Transport, you need to specify transport type
  smart .

##### 9.20 Guidelines

* **OSPF redistribute commands that specify a route-map that matches a
  prefix-list will be removed in 9.20(2)**—When you upgrade to 9.20(2),
  OSPF **redistribute** commands where the specified **route-map** uses
  a **match ip address prefix-list** will be removed from the
  configuration. Although prefix lists have never been supported, the parser
  still accepted the command. Before upgrading, you should reconfigure OSPF to
  use route maps that specify an ACL in the **match ip address** command.

##### 9.19 Guidelines

* **ASDM 7.19(1) requires Oracle Java version 8u261 or later**—Before you
  upgrade to ASDM 7.19, be sure to update Oracle Java (if used) to version
  8u261 or later. This version supports TLSv1.3, which is required to upgrade
  the ASDM Launcher. OpenJRE is not affected.

##### 9.18 Guidelines

* **ASDM signed-image support in 9.18(2)/7.18(1.152) and later**—The ASA now validates
  whether the ASDM image is a Cisco digitally signed image. If you try to run
  an older ASDM image with an ASA version with this fix, ASDM will be blocked
  and the message “%ERROR: Signature not valid for file disk0:/<filename>”
  will be displayed at the ASA CLI. ASDM release 7.18(1.152) and later are
  backwards compatible with all ASA versions, even those without this fix.
  ([CSCwb05291](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwb05291), [CSCwb05264](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwb05264))
* **9.18(1) upgrade issue if you enabled HTTPS/ASDM (with HTTPS authentication) and SSL on
  the same interface with the same port**—If you enable both SSL
  (**webvpn** > **enable**
  *interface*) and HTTPS/ASDM (http ) access on
  the same interface, you can access AnyConnect from
  **https://***ip\_address* and ASDM from
  **https://***ip\_address***/admin**, both on port 443.
  However, if you also enable HTTPS authentication (**aaa authentication http
  console**), then you must specify a different port for ASDM access
  starting in 9.18(1). Make sure you change the port before you upgrade using
  the http  command. ([CSCvz92016](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvz92016))
* **ASDM Upgrade Wizard**—Due to ASD API migration, you must use ASDM 7.18 or later to
  upgrade to ASA 9.18 or later. Because ASDM is backwards compatible with
  earlier ASA versions, you can upgrade ASDM to 7.18 or later for any ASA
  version.

##### 9.17 Guidelines

* **ASDM signed-image support in 9.17(1.13)/7.18(1.152) and later**—The ASA
  now validates whether the ASDM image is a Cisco digitally signed image. If
  you try to run an older ASDM image with an ASA version with this fix, ASDM
  will be blocked and the message “%ERROR: Signature not valid for file
  disk0:/<filename>” will be displayed at the ASA CLI. ASDM release
  7.18(1.152) and later are backwards compatible with all ASA versions, even
  those without this fix. ([CSCwb05291](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwb05291), [CSCwb05264](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwb05264))
* **No support for Clientless SSL VPN in 9.17(1) and later**—Clientless SSL VPN is no
  longer supported.

  + **webvpn**—The following subcommands are removed:

    - **apcf**
    - **java-trustpoint**
    - **onscreen-keyboard**
    - **port-forward**
    - **portal-access-rule**
    - **rewrite**
    - **smart-tunnel**
  + **group-policy webvpn**—The following subcommands are removed:

    - **port-forward**
    - **smart-tunnel**
    - **ssl-clientless**
* **ASDM Upgrade Wizard**—Due to an internal change, starting in March 2022 the upgrade
  wizard will no longer work with pre-ASDM 7.17(1.152) versions. You must
  manually upgrade to 7.17(1.152) to use the wizard.

##### 9.16 Guidelines

* **ASDM signed-image support in 9.16(3.19)/7.18(1.152) and later**—The ASA
  now validates whether the ASDM image is a Cisco digitally signed image. If
  you try to run an older ASDM image with an ASA version with this fix, ASDM
  will be blocked and the message “%ERROR: Signature not valid for file
  disk0:/<filename>” will be displayed at the ASA CLI. ASDM release
  7.18(1.152) and later are backwards compatible with all ASA versions, even
  those without this fix. ([CSCwb05291](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwb05291), [CSCwb05264](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwb05264))
* **SNMPv3 users using MD5 hashing and DES encryption are no longer supported, and the users
  will be removed when you upgrade to 9.16(1)**—Be sure to change any
  user configuration to higher security algorithms using the
  snmp-server user  command before you
  upgrade.
* **SSH host key action required in 9.16(1)**—In addition to RSA, we added
  support for the EDDSA and ECDSA host keys for SSH. The ASA tries to use keys
  in the following order if they exist: EDDSA, ECDSA, and then RSA. When you
  upgrade to 9.16(1), the ASA will fall back to using the existing RSA key.
  However, we recommend that you generate higher-security keys as soon as
  possible using the crypto key generate {eddsa |
  ecdsa}  command. Moreover, if you explicitly
  configure the ASA to use the RSA key with the ssh key-exchange
  hostkey rsa  command, you must generate a key that is
  2048 bits or higher. For upgrade compatibility, the ASA will use smaller RSA
  host keys only when the default host key setting is used. RSA support will
  be removed in a later release.
* **In 9.16 and later, certificates with RSA keys are not compatible with
  ECDSA ciphers**—When you use the ECDHE\_ECDSA cipher group, configure
  the trustpoint with a certificate that contains an ECDSA-capable key.
* ssh version
  **command removed in 9.16(1)**—This command has been removed. Only SSH
  version 2 is supported.
* **When you upgrade to 9.16 or later, you might see a different certificate
  serial number**—In 9.16, the ASA started using OpenSSL, which causes
  negative values in certificates to be computed differently, so you may see a
  different serial number after upgrading. This change does not affect
  operation. (CSCvv30338)
* **SAMLv1 feature removed in 9.16(1)**—Support for SAMLv1 was removed.
* **No support for DH groups 2, 5, and 24 in 9.16(1)**—Support has been
  removed for the DH groups 2, 5, and 24 in SSL DH group configuration. The
  ssl dh-group command has been updated to remove
  the command options group2, group5, and
  group24.

##### 9.15 Guidelines

* **No support in ASA 9.15(1) and later for the ASA 5525-X, ASA 5545-X, and
  ASA 5555-X**—ASA 9.14(x) is the last supported version. For the ASA
  FirePOWER module, the last supported version is 6.6.
* **Cisco announces the feature deprecation for Clientless SSL VPN effective with ASA version
  9.17(1)**—Limited support will continue on releases prior to
  9.17(1).
* **For the Firepower 1010, invalid VLAN IDs can cause problems**—Before you
  upgrade to 9.15(1), make sure you are not using a VLAN for switch ports in
  the range 3968 to 4047. These IDs are for internal use only, and 9.15(1)
  includes a check to make sure you are not using these IDs. For example, if
  these IDs are in use after upgrading a failover pair, the failover pair will
  go into a suspended state. See [CSCvw33057](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvw33057) for more information.
* **SAMLv1 feature deprecation**—Support for SAMLv1 is deprecated.
* **Low-Security Cipher Removal in ASA 9.15(1)**—Support for the following
  less secure ciphers used by IKE and IPsec have been removed:

  + Diffie-Hellman groups: 2 and 24
  + Encryption algorithms: DES, 3DES, AES-GMAC, AES-GMAC-192,
    AES-GMAC-256, NULL, ESP-3DES, ESP-DES, ESP-MD5-HMAC
  + Hash algorithms: MD5

  | **Note** | ---   Low-security SSH and SSL ciphers have not yet been removed.   --- |
  | --- | --- |

  Before you upgrade from an earlier version of ASA to Version 9.15(1), you
  must update your VPN configuration to use the ciphers supported in 9.15(1),
  or else the old configuration will be rejected. When the configuration is
  rejected, one of the following actions will occur, depending on the
  command:

  + The command will use the default cipher.
  + The command will be removed.

  Fixing your configuration before upgrading is especially important for
  clustering or failover deployments. For example, if the secondary unit is
  upgraded to 9.15(1), and the removed ciphers are synced to this unit from
  the primary, then the secondary unit will reject the configuration. This
  rejection might cause unexpected behavior, like failure to join the
  cluster.

  **IKEv1**: The following subcommands are removed:

  + **crypto ikev1 policy**
    *priority*:

    - **hash md5**
    - **encryption 3des**
    - **encryption des**
    - **group 2**

  **IKEv2**: The following subcommands are removed:

  + **crypto ikev2 policy**
    *priority*:

    - **prf md5**
    - **integrity md5**
    - **group 2**
    - **group 24**
    - **encryption 3des**
    - **encryption des**
    - **encryption null**

  **IPsec**: The following subcommands are removed:

  + **crypto ipsec ikev1 transform-set *name* esp-3des esp-des
    esp-md5-hmac**
  + **crypto ipsec ikev2 ipsec-proposal *name***

    - **protocol esp integrity md5**
    - **protocol esp encryption 3des aes-gmac aes-gmac- 192
      aes-gmac -256 des**
  + **crypto ipsec profile *name***

    - **set pfs group2 group24**

  **Crypto Map**: The following subcommands are removed:

  + **crypto map *name sequence* set pfs group2**
  + **crypto map *name sequence* set pfs group24**
  + **crypto map *name sequence* set ikev1 phase1-mode aggressive
    group2**
* **Re-introduction of CRL Distribution Point configuration**—The static CDP
  URL configuration option, that was removed in 9.13(1), was re-introduced in
  the  match-certificate  command.
* **Restoration of bypass certificate validity checks option**—The option to
  bypass revocation checking due to connectivity problems with the CRL or OCSP
  server was restored.

  The following subcommands were restored:

  + **revocation-check crl none**
  + **revocation-check ocsp none**
  + **revocation-check crl ocsp none**
  + **revocation-check ocsp crl none**

##### 9.14 Guidelines

* **ASDM signed-image support in 9.14(4.14)/7.18(1.152) and later**—The ASA
  now validates whether the ASDM image is a Cisco digitally signed image. If
  you try to run an older ASDM image with an ASA version with this fix, ASDM
  will be blocked and the message “%ERROR: Signature not valid for file
  disk0:/<filename>” will be displayed at the ASA CLI. ASDM release
  7.18(1.152) and later are backwards compatible with all ASA versions, even
  those without this fix. ([CSCwb05291](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwb05291), [CSCwb05264](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwb05264))
* **ASDM Cisco.com Upgrade Wizard failure on Firepower 1000 and 2100 in
  Appliance mode**—The ASDM Cisco.com Upgrade Wizard does not work for
  upgrading to 9.14 (Tools > Check for ASA/ASDM
  Updates). The wizard can upgrade ASDM from 7.13 to 7.14, but the
  ASA image upgrade is grayed out. ([CSCvt72183](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvt72183)) As a workaround, use one of the following
  methods:

  + Use Tools > Upgrade Software from Local
    Computer for both ASA and ASDM. Note that the ASDM
    image (7.14(1)) in the 9.14(1) bundle also has the bug [CSCvt72183](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvt72183); you should download the newer 7.14(1.46)
    image to enable correct functioning of the wizard.
  + Use Tools > Check for ASA/ASDM Updates to
    upgrade to ASDM 7.14 (the version will be 7.14(1.46); then use the
    new ASDM to upgrade the ASA image. Note that you may see a
    Fatal Installation Error; in this case,
    click OK. You must then set the boot image
    manually on the Configuration > Device Management  > System Image/Configuration > Boot Image/Configuration screen. Save the configuration and reload the
    ASA.
* **For Failover pairs in 9.14(1)+, the ASA no longer shares SNMP client
  engine data with its peer.**
* **No support in ASA 9.14(1)+ for cnatAddrBindNumberOfEntries and
  cnatAddrBindSessionCount OIDs ([CSCvy22526](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvy22526))**.
* **Upgrade issue for 9.14(4)24 and RADIUS challenges for AnyConnect mobile
  users**—To restore RADIUS functionality, upgrade to 9.18(4)22 or
  later.
* **Upgrading the Firepower 2100 in Platform mode**—When you upgrade to 9.14
  or later, if your EtherChannel (port-channel) was disabled at the time of
  upgrade, then you will need to manually enable both the EtherChannel and its
  member interfaces after upgrade.
* **Downgrade issue for the Firepower 2100 in Platform mode from 9.13/9.14 to
  9.12 or earlier**—For a Firepower 2100 with a fresh installation of
  9.13 or 9.14 that you converted to Platform mode: If you downgrade to 9.12
  or earlier, you will not be able to configure new interfaces or edit
  existing interfaces in FXOS (note that 9.12 and earlier only supports
  Platform mode). You either need to restore your version to 9.13 or later, or
  you need to clear your configuration using the FXOS erase configuration
  command. This problem does not occur if you originally upgraded to 9.13 or
  9.14 from an earlier release; only fresh installations are affected, such as
  a new device or a re-imaged device. ([CSCvr19755](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvr19755))
* **The tls-proxy  keyword, and support for
  SCCP/Skinny encrypted inspection, was removed** from the
  inspect skinny  command.
* **ASDM Upgrade Wizard**—Due to an internal change, the wizard is only
  supported using ASDM 7.10(1) and later; also, due to an image naming change,
  you must use ASDM 7.12(1) or later to upgrade to ASA 9.10(1) and later.
  Because ASDM is backwards compatible with earlier ASA releases, you can
  upgrade ASDM no matter which ASA version you are running. Note that ASDM
  7.13 and 7.14 did not support the ASA 5512-X, 5515-X, 5585-X, or ASASM; you
  must upgrade to ASDM 7.13(1.101) or 7.14(1.48) to restore ASDM support.

##### 9.13 Guidelines

* **ASAv requires 2GB memory in 9.13(1) and later**—Beginning with 9.13(1),
  the minimum memory requirement for the ASAv is 2GB. If your current ASAv
  runs with less than 2GB of memory, you cannot upgrade to 9.13(1) from an
  earlier version. You must adjust the memory size before upgrading. See the
  [ASAv Getting Started Guide](https://www.cisco.com/go/asa-quick) for information about
  the resource allocations (vCPU and memory) supported in version 9.13(1).
* **Downgrade issue for the Firepower 2100 in Platform mode from 9.13 to 9.12
  or earlier**—For a Firepower 2100 with a fresh installation of 9.13
  that you converted to Platform mode: If you downgrade to 9.12 or earlier,
  you will not be able to configure new interfaces or edit existing interfaces
  in FXOS (note that 9.12 and earlier only supports Platform mode). You either
  need to restore your version to 9.13, or you need to clear your
  configuration using the FXOS erase configuration command. This problem does
  not occur if you originally upgraded to 9.13 from an earlier release; only
  fresh installations are affected, such as a new device or a re-imaged
  device. (CSCvr19755)
* **Cluster control link MTU change in 9.13(1)**—Starting in 9.13(1), many
  cluster control packets are larger than they were in previous releases. The
  recommended MTU for the cluster control link has always been 1600 or
  greater, and this value is appropriate. However, if you set the MTU to 1600
  but then failed to match the MTU on connecting switches (for example, you
  left the MTU as 1500 on the switch), then you will start seeing the effects
  of this mismatch with dropped cluster control packets. Be sure to set all
  devices on the cluster control link to the same MTU, specifically 1600 or
  higher.
* **Beginning with 9.13(1), the ASA establishes an LDAP/SSL connection only if
  one of the following certification criteria is satisfied**:

  + The LDAP server certificate is trusted (exists in a trustpoint or the
    ASA trustpool) and is valid.
  + A CA certificate from servers issuing chain is trusted (exists in a
    trustpoint or the ASA trustpool) and all subordinate CA certificates
    in the chain are complete and valid.
* **Local CA server is removed in 9.13(1)**—When the ASA is configured as
  local CA server, it can issue digital certificates, publish Certificate
  Revocation Lists (CRLs), and securely revoke issued certificates. This
  feature has become obsolete and hence the crypto ca
  server  command is removed.
* **Removal of CRL Distribution Point commands**—The static CDP URL
  configuration commands, namely crypto-ca-trustpoint
  crl  and crl url  were removed
  with other related logic. The CDP URL was moved to match certificate
  command.

  | **Note** | ---   The CDP URL configuration was enhanced to allow multiple instances of the CDP override for a single map (refer [CSCvu05216](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvu05216)).   --- |
  | --- | --- |
* **Removal of bypass certificate validity checks option**—The option to
  bypass revocation checking due to connectivity problems with the CRL or OCSP
  server was removed.

  The following subcommands are removed:

  + **revocation-check crl none**
  + **revocation-check ocsp none**
  + **revocation-check crl ocsp none**
  + **revocation-check ocsp crl none**

  Thus, after an upgrade, any revocation-check command that is no longer
  supported will transition to the new behavior by ignoring the trailing
  none.

  | **Note** | ---   These commands were restored later (refer [CSCtb41710](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtb41710)).   --- |
  | --- | --- |
* **Low-Security Cipher Deprecation**— Several encryption ciphers used by
  the ASA IKE, IPsec, and SSH modules are considered insecure and have been
  deprecated. They will be removed in a later release.

  IKEv1: The following subcommands are deprecated:

  + **crypto ikev1 policy**
    *priority*:

    - **hash md5**
    - **encryption 3des**
    - **encryption des**
    - **group 2**
    - **group 5**

  IKEv2: The following subcommands are deprecated:

  + **crypto ikev2 policy**
    *priority*

    - **integrity md5**
    - **prf md5**
    - **group 2**
    - **group 5**
    - **group 24**
    - **encryption 3des**
    - **encryption des** (this command is still available when
      you have the DES encryption license only)
    - **encryption null**

  IPsec: The following commands are deprecated:

  + **crypto ipsec ikev1 transform-set *name* esp-3des esp-des
    esp-md5-hmac**
  + **crypto ipsec ikev2 ipsec-proposal *name***

    - **protocol esp integrity md5**
    - **protocol esp encryption 3des aes-gmac aes-gmac- 192
      aes-gmac -256 des**
  + **crypto ipsec profile *name***

    - **set pfs group2 group5 group24**

  SSH: The following commands are deprecated:

  + **ssh cipher integrity custom hmac-sha1-96:hmac-md5:
    hmac-md5-96**
  + **ssh key-exchange group dh-group1-sha1**

  SSL: The following commands are deprecated:

  + **ssl dh-group group2**
  + **ssl dh-group group5**
  + **ssl dh-group group24**

  Crypto Map: The following commands are deprecated:

  + **crypto map *name sequence* set pfs group2**
  + **crypto map *name sequence* set pfs group5**
  + **crypto map *name sequence* set pfs group24**
  + **crypto map *name sequence* set ikev1 phase1-mode aggressive
    group2**
  + **crypto map *name sequence* set ikev1 phase1-mode aggressive
    group5**
* **In 9.13(1), Diffie-Hellman Group 14 is now the default** for the
  group  command under crypto
  ikev1 policy , ssl dh-group ,
  and crypto ikev2 policy for IPsec PFS using
  crypto map set pfs , crypto
  ipsec profile , crypto dynamic-map set
  pfs , and crypto map set ikev1
  phase1-mode . The former default Diffie-Hellman group
  was Group 2.

  When you upgrade from a pre-9.13(1) release, if you need to use the old
  default (Diffie-Hellman Group 2), then you must *manually* configure
  the DH group as **group 2** or else your tunnels will default to Group
  14. Because group 2 will be removed in a future release, you should move
  your tunnels to group 14 as soon as
  possible.

##### 9.12 Guidelines

* **ASDM signed-image support in 9.12(4.50)/7.18(1.152) and later**—The ASA
  now validates whether the ASDM image is a Cisco digitally signed image. If
  you try to run an older ASDM image with an ASA version with this fix, ASDM
  will be blocked and the message “%ERROR: Signature not valid for file
  disk0:/<filename>” will be displayed at the ASA CLI. ASDM release
  7.18(1.152) and later are backwards compatible with all ASA versions, even
  those without this fix. ([CSCwb05291](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwb05291), [CSCwb05264](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwb05264))
* ASDM Upgrade Wizard—Due to an internal change, the wizard is only supported using ASDM 7.10(1) and later; also, due to an
  image naming change, you must use ASDM 7.12(1) or later to upgrade to ASA 9.10(1) and later. Because ASDM is backwards compatible
  with earlier ASA releases, you can upgrade ASDM no matter which ASA version you are running.
* SSH security improvements and new defaults in 9.12(1)—See the following SSH security improvements:

  + SSH version 1 is no longer supported; only version 2 is supported. The ssh version 1  command will be migrated to ssh version 2 .
  + Diffie-Hellman Group 14 SHA256 key exchange support. This setting is now the default (ssh key-exchange group dh-group14-sha256 ). The former default was Group 1 SHA1. Make sure that your SSH client supports Diffie-Hellman Group 14 SHA256. If it does
    not, you may see an error such as "Couldn't agree on a key exchange algorithm." For example, OpenSSH supports Diffie-Hellman
    Group 14 SHA256.
  + HMAC-SHA256 integrity cipher support. The default is now the high security set of ciphers (hmac-sha1 and hmac-sha2-256 as
    defined by the ssh cipher integrity high  command). The former default was the medium set.
* The NULL-SHA TLSv1 cipher is deprecated and removed in 9.12(1)—Because NULL-SHA doesn't offer encryption and is no longer
  considered secure against modern threats, it will be removed when listing supported ciphers for TLSv1 in the output of tls-proxy  mode commands/options and show ssl ciphers all . The ssl cipher tlsv1 all  and ssl cipher tlsv1 custom NULL-SHA  commands will also be deprecated and removed.
* The default trustpool is removed in 9.12(1)—In order to comply with PSB requirement, SEC-AUT-DEFROOT, the "default" trusted
  CA bundle is removed from the ASA image. As a result, crypto ca trustpool import default  and crypto ca trustpool import clean default  commands are also removed along with other related logic. However, in existing deployments, certificates that were previously
  imported using these command will remain in place.
* The ssl encryption  command is removed in 9.12(1)—In 9.3(2) the deprecation was announced and replaced by ssl cipher . In 9.12(1), ssl encryption  is removed and no longer supported.

##### 9.10 Guidelines

* Due to an internal change, the ASDM Upgrade wizard is only supported using ASDM 7.10(1) and later; also, due to an image naming
  change, you must use ASDM 7.12(1) or later to upgrade to ASA 9.10(1) and later. Because ASDM is backwards compatible with
  earlier ASA releases, you can upgrade ASDM no matter which ASA version you are running.

##### 9.9 Guidelines

* ASA 5506-X memory issues with large configurations on 9.9(2) and later—If you upgrade to 9.9(2) or later, parts of a very
  large configuration might be rejected due to insufficient memory with the following message: "ERROR: Insufficient memory to
  install the rules". One option is to enter the **object-group-search access-control** command to improve memory usage for ACLs; your performance might be impacted, however. Alternatively, you can downgrade to
  9.9(1).

##### 9.8 Guidelines

* **ASDM signed-image support in 9.8(4.45)/7.18(1.152) and later**—The ASA
  now validates whether the ASDM image is a Cisco digitally signed image. If
  you try to run an older ASDM image with an ASA version with this fix, ASDM
  will be blocked and the message “%ERROR: Signature not valid for file
  disk0:/<filename>” will be displayed at the ASA CLI. ASDM release
  7.18(1.152) and later are backwards compatible with all ASA versions, even
  those without this fix. ([CSCwb05291](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwb05291), [CSCwb05264](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwb05264))
* Before upgrading to 9.8(2) or later, FIPS mode requires the failover key to
  be at least 14 characters—Before you upgrade to to 9.8(2) or later in FIPS
  mode, you must change the failover key  or
  failover ipsec pre-shared-key  to be at
  least 14 characters long. If your failover key is too short, when you
  upgrade the first unit, the failover key will be rejected, and both units
  will become active until you set the failover key to a valid value.
* Do not upgrade to 9.8(1) for ASAv on Amazon Web Services--Due to [CSCve56153](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCve56153), you should not upgrade to 9.8(1). After upgrading, the ASAv becomes unreachable. Upgrade to 9.8(1.5) or later instead.

##### 9.7 Guidelines

* Upgrade issue with 9.7(1) to 9.7(1.x) and later for VTI and VXLAN VNI—If you configure both Virtual Tunnel Interfaces (VTIs)
  and VXLAN Virtual Network Identifier (VNI) interfaces, then you cannot perform a zero downtime upgrade for failover; connections
  on these interface types will not replicate to the standby unit until both units are on the same version. (CSCvc83062)

##### 9.6 Guidelines

* (ASA 9.6(2) through 9.7(x)) Upgrade impact when using SSH public key authentication—Due to updates to SSH authentication,
  additional configuration is required to enable SSH public key authentication; as a result, existing SSH configurations using
  public key authentication no longer work after upgrading. Public key authentication is the default for the ASAv on Amazon
  Web Services (AWS), so AWS users will see this issue. To avoid loss of SSH connectivity, you can update your configuration
  *before* you upgrade. Or you can use ASDM after you upgrade (if you enabled ASDM access) to fix the configuration.

  | **Note** | ---   The original behavior was restored in 9.8(1).   --- |
  | --- | --- |

  Sample original
  configuration for a username "admin":

  ```

  username admin nopassword privilege 15
  username admin attributes
    ssh authentication publickey 55:06:47:eb:13:75:fc:5c:a8:c1:2c:bb:
    07:80:3a:fc:d9:08:a9:1f:34:76:31:ed:ab:bd:3a:9e:03:14:1e:1b hashed

  ```

  To use the
  ssh
  authentication  command, before you upgrade, enter the following
  commands:

  ```

  aaa authentication ssh console LOCAL
  username admin password <password> privilege 15

  ```

  We recommend
  setting a password for the username as opposed to keeping the
  nopassword
  keyword, if present. The
  nopassword
  keyword means that
  *any*
  password can be entered, not that
  *no*
  password can be entered. Prior to 9.6(2), the
  aaa  command was
  not required for SSH public key authentication, so the
  nopassword
  keyword was not triggered. Now that the
  aaa  command is
  required, it automatically also allows regular password authentication for a
  username  if the
  password  (or
  nopassword )
  keyword is present.

  After you
  upgrade, the
  username
  command no longer requires the
  password  or
  nopassword
  keyword; you can require that a user cannot enter a password. Therefore, to
  force public key authentication only, re-enter the
  username
  command:

  ```

  username admin privilege 15

  ```
* Upgrade impact when upgrading the ASA on the Firepower 9300— Due to license entitlement naming changes on the back-end, when
  you upgrade to ASA 9.6(1)/FXOS 1.1(4), the startup configuration may not parse correctly upon the initial reload; configuration
  that corresponds to add-on entitlements is rejected.

  For a standalone ASA, after the unit reloads with the new version,
  wait until all the entitlements are processed and are in an "Authorized" state
  (**show license all** or
  **Monitoring > Properties > Smart License**), and simply
  reload again (**reload** or
  **Tools > System Reload**)
  *without* saving the configuration. After the reload, the
  startup configuration will be parsed correctly.

  For a failover pair if you have any add-on entitlements, follow
  the upgrade procedure in the FXOS release notes, but reset failover after you
  reload each unit (failover reset  or
  **Monitoring > Properties > Failover > Status**,
  **Monitoring > Failover > System**, or
  **Monitoring > Failover > Failover Group**, and then
  click
  Reset Failover).

  For a cluster, follow the upgrade procedure in the FXOS release
  notes; no additional action is required.

##### 9.5 Guidelines and Migration

* 9.5(2) New Carrier License—The new Carrier license replaces the existing GTP/GPRS license, and also includes support for SCTP
  and Diameter inspection. For the Firepower 9300 ASA security module, the feature mobile-sp  command will automatically migrate to the feature carrier  command.
* 9.5(2) E-mail proxy commands deprecated—In ASA Version 9.5(2), the e-mail proxy commands (imap4s , pop3s , smtps ) and subcommands are no longer supported.
* 9.5(2) CSD commands deprecated or migrated—In ASA Version 9.5(2), the CSD commands (csd image , show webvpn csd image , show webvpn csd , show webvpn csd hostscan , show webvpn csd hostscan image ) are no longer supported.

  The following CSD commands will migrate: csd enable  migrates to hostscan enable ; csd hostscan image  migrates to hostscan image .
* 9.5(2) Select AAA commands deprecated—In ASA Version 9.5(2), these AAA commands and subcommands (override-account-disable , authentication crack ) are no longer supported.
* 9.5(1) We deprecated the following command: timeout gsn
* ASA 5508-X and 5516-X upgrade issue when upgrading to 9.5(x) or later—Before you upgrade to ASA Version 9.5(x) or later, if
  you never enabled jumbo frame reservation then you must check the maximum memory footprint. Due to a manufacturing defect,
  an incorrect software memory limit might have been applied. If you upgrade to 9.5(x) or later before performing the below
  fix, then your device will crash on bootup; in this case, you must downgrade to 9.4 using ROMMON ([Load an Image for the ASA 5500-X Series Using ROMMON](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/asa95/configuration/general/asa-95-general-config/admin-swconfig.html#ID-2152-000008e5)), perform the below procedure, and then upgrade again.

  1. Enter the following command to check for the failure condition:

     ```

     ciscoasa# show memory detail | include Max memory footprint
     Max memory footprint        =    456384512
     Max memory footprint        =            0
     Max memory footprint        =    456384512

     ```

     If a value less than **456,384,512** is returned for “Max memory footprint,” then the failure condition is present, and you must complete the remaining steps
     before you upgrade. If the memory shown is 456,384,512 or greater, then you can skip the rest of this procedure and upgrade
     as normal.
  2. Enter global configuration mode:

     ```

     ciscoasa# configure terminal
     ciscoasa(config)#

     ```
  3. Temporarily enable jumbo frame reservation:

     ```

     ciscoasa(config)# jumbo-frame reservation
     WARNING: This command will take effect after the running-config
     is saved and the system has been rebooted. Command accepted.
     INFO: Interface MTU should be increased to avoid fragmenting
     jumbo frames during transmit

     ```

     | **Note** | ---   Do not reload the ASA.   --- |
     | --- | --- |
  4. Save the configuration:

     ```

     ciscoasa(config)# write memory
     Building configuration...
     Cryptochecksum: b511ec95 6c90cadb aaf6b306 41579572
     14437 bytes copied in 1.320 secs (14437 bytes/sec)
     [OK]

     ```
  5. Disable jumbo frame reservation:

     ```

     ciscoasa(config)# no jumbo-frame reservation
     WARNING: This command will take effect after the running-config is saved and
     the system has been rebooted. Command accepted.
     ```

     | **Note** | ---   Do not reload the ASA.   --- |
     | --- | --- |
  6. Save the configuration again:

     ```

     ciscoasa(config)# write memory
     Building configuration...
     Cryptochecksum: b511ec95 6c90cadb aaf6b306 41579572
     14437 bytes copied in 1.320 secs (14437 bytes/sec)
     [OK]

     ```
  7. You can now upgrade to Version 9.5(x) or later.

##### 9.4 Guidelines and Migration

* 9.4(1) Unified
  Communications Phone Proxy and Intercompany Media Engine Proxy are
  deprecated—In ASA Version 9.4, the Phone Proxy and IME Proxy are no longer
  supported.

##### 9.3 Guidelines and Migration

* 9.3(2) Transport Layer Security (TLS) version 1.2 support—We now support TLS version 1.2 for secure message transmission for
  ASDM, Clientless SSVPN, and AnyConnect VPN. We introduced or modified the following commands: ssl client-version, ssl server-version,
  ssl cipher, ssl trust-point, ssl dh-group. We deprecated the following command: ssl encryption
* 9.3(1) Removal of AAA Windows NT domain authentication—We removed NTLM support for remote access VPN users. We deprecated
  the following command: aaa-server protocol nt

##### 9.2 Guidelines and Migration

###### Auto Update Server certificate verification

9.2(1) Auto Update Server certificate verification enabled by default. The Auto Update Server certificate verification is
now enabled by default; for new configurations, you must explicitly disable certificate verification. If you are upgrading
from an earlier release, and you did not enable certificate verification, then certificate verification is not enabled, and
you see the following warning:

`WARNING: The certificate provided by the auto-update servers will not be verified. In order to verify this certificate please
use the verify-certificate option.`

The configuration will be migrated to explicitly configure no verification:

auto-update server no-verification

###### Upgrade impact for ASDM login

Upgrade impact for ASDM login when upgrading from a pre-9.2(2.4) release to 9.2(2.4) or later. If you upgrade from a pre-9.2(2.4)
release to ASA Version 9.2(2.4) or later and you use command authorization and ASDM-defined user roles, users with Read Only
access will not be able to log in to ASDM. You must change the more  command either before or after you upgrade to be at privilege level 5; only Admin level users can make this change. Note
that ASDM version 7.3(2) and later includes the more  command at level 5 for defined user roles, but preexisting configurations need to be fixed manually.

**ASDM:**

1. Choose Configuration > Device Management > Users/AAA > AAA Access > Authorization, and click Configure Command Privileges.
2. Select more, and click Edit.

   ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/410001-420000/413001-414000/413949.jpg)
3. Change the Privilege Level to 5, and click OK.
4. Click OK, and then Apply.

**CLI:**

`ciscoasa(config)# privilege cmd level 5 mode exec command more`

##### 9.1 Guidelines and Migration

* Maximum MTU Is Now 9198 Bytes—If your MTU was set to a value higher than 9198, then the MTU is automatically lowered when
  you upgrade. In some cases, this MTU change can cause an MTU mismatch; be sure to set any connecting equipment to use the
  new MTU value. The maximum MTU that the ASA can use is 9198 bytes (check for your model’s exact limit at the CLI help). This
  value does not include the Layer 2 header. Formerly, the ASA let you specify the maximum MTU as 65535 bytes, which was inaccurate
  and could cause problems.

##### 9.0 Guidelines and Migration

* **IPv6 ACL Migration**—IPv6 ACLs (ipv6 access-list ) will be migrated to extended ACLs (access-list extended ); IPv6 ACLs are no longer supported.

  If IPv4 and IPv6 ACLs are applied on the same direction of an interface (access-group  command), then the ACLs are merged:

  + If both IPv4 and IPv6 ACLs are not used anywhere other than the access-group, then the name of the IPv4 ACL is used for the
    merged ACL; the IPv6 access-list is removed.
  + If at least one of the ACLs is used in another feature, then a new ACL is created with the name *IPv4-ACL-name\_IPv6-ACL-name*; the in-use ACL(s) continue to be used for other features. ACLs not in use are removed. If the IPv6 ACL is in use for another
    feature, it is migrated to an extended ACL of the same name.
* **ACL Any Keyword Migration**—Now that ACLs support both IPv4 and IPv6, the any  keyword now represents “all IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.” Any existing ACLs that use the any  keyword will be changed to use the any4  keyword, which denotes “all IPv4 traffic.”

  In addition, a separate keyword was introduced to designate “all IPv6 traffic”: any6 .

  The any4  and any6  keywords are not available for all commands that use the any  keyword. For example, the NAT feature uses only the any  keyword; any represents IPv4 traffic or IPv6 traffic depending on the context within the specific NAT command.
* **Static NAT-with-port-translation Requirement Before Upgrading**—In Version 9.0 and later, static NAT-with-port-translation rules limit access to the destination IP address for the specified
  port only. If you try to access the destination IP address on a different port not covered by a NAT rule, then the connection
  is blocked. This behavior is also true for Twice NAT. Moreover, traffic that does not match the source IP address of the Twice
  NAT rule will be dropped if it matches the destination IP address, regardless of the destination port. Therefore, before you
  upgrade, you must add additional rules for all other traffic allowed to the destination IP address.

  For example, you have the following Object NAT rule to translate HTTP traffic to the inside server between port 80 and port
  8080:

  ```

  object network my-http-server
    host 10.10.10.1
    nat (inside,outside) static 192.168.1.1 80 8080

  ```

  If you want any other services to reach the server, such as FTP, then you must explicitly allow them:

  ```

  object network my-ftp-server
    host 10.10.10.1
    nat (inside,outside) static 192.168.1.1 ftp ftp

  ```

  Or, to allow traffic to other ports of the server, you can add a general static NAT rule that will match all other ports:

  ```

  object network my-server-1
    host 10.10.10.1
    nat (inside,outside) static 192.168.1.1

  ```

  For Twice NAT, you have the following rule to allow HTTP traffic from 192.168.1.0/24 to the inside server and translate between
  port 80 and port 8080:

  ```

  object network my-real-server
    host 10.10.10.1
  object network my-mapped-server
    host 192.168.1.1
  object network outside-real-hosts
    subnet 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0
  object network outside-mapped-hosts
    subnet 10.10.11.0 255.255.255.0
  object service http-real
    service tcp destination eq 80
  object service http-mapped
    service tcp destination eq 8080
  object service ftp-real
    service tcp destination eq 21
  nat (outside,inside) source static outside-real-hosts outside-mapped-hosts destination static my-mapped-server my-real-server service http-mapped http-real

  ```

  If you want the outside hosts to reach another service on the inside server, add another NAT rule for the service, for example
  FTP:

  ```

  nat (outside,inside) source static outside-real-hosts outside-mapped-hosts destination static my-mapped-server my-real-server ftp-real ftp-real

  ```

  If you want other source addresses to reach the inside server on any other ports, you can add another NAT rule for that specific
  IP address or for any source IP address. Make sure the general rule is ordered after the specific rule.

  ```

  nat (outside,inside) source static any any destination static my-mapped-server my-real-server

  ```

##### 8.4 Guidelines and Migration

* Configuration Migration for Transparent Mode—In 8.4, all transparent mode interfaces now belong to a bridge group. When you
  upgrade to 8.4, the existing two interfaces are placed in bridge group 1, and the management IP address is assigned to the
  Bridge Group Virtual Interface (BVI). The functionality remains the same when using one bridge group. You can now take advantage
  of the bridge group feature to configure up to four interfaces per bridge group and to create up to eight bridge groups in
  single mode or per context.

  | **Note** | ---   Note In 8.3 and earlier, as an unsupported configuration, you could configure a management interface without an IP address, and you could access the interface using the device management address. In 8.4, the device management address is assigned to the BVI, and the management interface is no longer accessible using that IP address; the management interface requires its own IP address.   --- |
  | --- | --- |
* When upgrading to 8.4(2) from 8.3(1), 8.3(2), and 8.4(1), all identity NAT configurations will now include the no-proxy-arp  and route-lookup  keywords, to maintain existing functionality. The unidirectional  keyword is removed.

##### 8.3 Guidelines and Migration

See the following guide that describes the configuration migration process when you upgrade from a pre-8.3 version of the
Cisco ASA 5500 operating system (OS) to Version 8.3:

[Cisco ASA 5500 Migration to Version 8.3](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/asa83/upgrading/migrating.html)

#### Clustering Guidelines

There are no special requirements for Zero Downtime Upgrades for ASA clustering with the following exceptions.

| **Note** | ---   Zero Downtime *Downgrades* are not officially supported with clustering.   --- |
| --- | --- |

* Firepower 4100/9300 Failover and
  Clustering hitless upgrade requirements for flow offload—Due to bug fixes in the flow
  offload feature, some combinations of FXOS and ASA do not support flow offload (see the
  [compatibility
  table](#id_59069)). Flow offload is disabled by default for ASA. To
  perform a Failover or Clustering hitless upgrade when using flow offload, you need to
  follow the below upgrade paths to ensure that you are always running a compatible
  combination when upgrading to FXOS 2.3.1.130 or later:

  1. Upgrade ASA to 9.8(3) or later
  2. Upgrade FXOS to 2.3.1.130 or later
  3. Upgrade ASA to your final version

  For example, you are on FXOS 2.2.2.26/ASA 9.8(1), and you want to upgrade to FXOS 2.6.1/ASA 9.12(1), then you can:

  1. Upgrade ASA to 9.8(4)
  2. Upgrade FXOS to 2.6.1
  3. Upgrade ASA to 9.12(1)
* Firepower 4100/9300 Cluster Upgrade
  to FXOS 2.3/ASA 9.9(2)—Data units on ASA 9.8 and
  earlier cannot rejoin a cluster where the control
  unit is on FXOS 2.3/9.9(2) or later; they will
  join after you upgrade the ASA version to 9.9(2)+
  [[CSCvi54844](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvi54844)].
* Distributed Site-to-Site VPN—Distributed Site-to-Site VPN sessions on a failed unit require up to 30 minutes to stabilize
  on other units. During this time, additional unit failures might result in lost sessions. Therefore, during a cluster upgrade,
  to avoid traffic loss, follow these steps. Refer to the FXOS/ASA cluster upgrade procedure so you can integrate these steps
  into your upgrade task.

  | **Note** | ---   Zero Downtime Upgrade is not supported with Distributed Site-to-Site VPN when upgrading from 9.9(1) to 9.9(2) or later. In 9.9(2), due to Active Session Redistribution enhancements, you cannot run some units on 9.9(2) and other units on 9.9(1).   --- |
  | --- | --- |

  1. On the
     chassis *without* the control unit, disable
     clustering on one module using the ASA
     console.

     cluster group
     name

     no enable

     If you are upgrading FXOS on the chassis as well as ASA, save the configuration so clustering will be disabled after the chassis
     reboots:

     write memory
  2. Wait for the cluster to stabilize; verify all backup sessions have been created.

     show cluster vpn-sessiondb summary
  3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for each module on this chassis.
  4. Upgrade FXOS on the chassis using the FXOS CLI or Firepower Chassis Manager.
  5. After the chassis comes online, update the ASA image on each module using the FXOS CLI or Firepower Chassis Manager.
  6. After the modules come online, re-enable clustering on each module at the ASA console.

     cluster group
     name

     enable

     write memory
  7. Repeat steps
     1 through 6 on the second chassis, being sure to
     disable clustering on the data units first, and
     then finally the control unit.

     A new control
     unit will be chosen from the upgraded chassis.
  8. After the
     cluster has stabilized, redistribute active
     sessions among all modules in the cluster using
     the ASA console on the control unit.

     cluster redistribute vpn-sessiondb
* Upgrade issue for 9.9(1) and later with clustering—9.9(1) and later includes an improvement in the backup distribution. You
  should perform your upgrade to 9.9(1) or later as follows to take advantage of the new backup distribution method; otherwise
  upgraded units will continue to use the old method.

  1. Remove all secondary units from the cluster (so the cluster consists only of the primary unit).
  2. Upgrade 1 secondary unit, and rejoin the cluster.
  3. Disable clustering on the primary unit; upgrade it, and rejoin the cluster.
  4. Upgrade the remaining secondary units, and join them back to the cluster, one at a time.
* Firepower 4100/9300 Cluster Upgrade
  to ASA 9.8(1) and earlier—When you disable
  clustering on a data unit (no
  enable ), which is part of the
  upgrade process, traffic directed to that unit can
  drop for up to three seconds before traffic is
  redirected to a new owner [[CSCvc85008](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvc85008)].
* Zero Downtime Upgrade may not be supported when upgrading to the following releases with the fix for [CSCvb24585](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvb24585). This fix moved 3DES from the default (medium) SSL ciphers to the low cipher set. If you set a custom cipher that only includes
  3DES, then you may have a mismatch if the other side of the connection uses the default (medium) ciphers that no longer include
  3DES.

  + 9.1(7.12)
  + 9.2(4.18)
  + 9.4(3.12)
  + 9.4(4)
  + 9.5(3.2)
  + 9.6(2.4)
  + 9.6(3)
  + 9.7(1)
  + 9.8(1)
* Upgrade issues for fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) ACLs—Due to [CSCuv92371](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuv92371), ACLs containing FQDNs might result in incomplete ACL replication to secondary units in a cluster or failover pair. This
  bug is present in 9.1(7), 9.5(2), 9.6(1), and some interim releases. We suggest that you upgrade to a version that includes
  the fix for CSCuy34265: 9.1(7.6) or later, 9.5(3) or later, 9.6(2) or later. However, due to the nature of configuration replication,
  zero downtime upgrade is not available. See [CSCuy34265](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuy34265) for more information about different methods of upgrading.
* Firepower Threat Defense Version 6.1.0 clusters do not support inter-site clustering (you can configure inter-site features
  using FlexConfig starting in 6.2.0). If you deployed or re-deployed a 6.1.0 cluster in FXOS 2.1.1, and you entered a value
  for the (unsupported) site ID, then you must remove the site ID (set it to **0**) on each unit in FXOS before you upgrade to 6.2.3. Otherwise, the units will not be able to rejoin the cluster after the
  upgrade. If you already upgraded, change the site ID to **0** on each unit to resolve the issue. See the FXOS configuration guide to view or change the site ID
* Upgrade to 9.5(2) or later
  (CSCuv82933)—Before you upgrade the control unit,
  if you enter show cluster
  info , the upgraded data units show
  as “DEPUTY\_BULK\_SYNC”; other mismatched states are
  also shown. You can ignore this display; the
  status will show correctly when you upgrade all
  units.
* Upgrade from 9.0(1) or 9.1(1) (CSCue72961)—Zero Downtime Upgrade is not supported.

#### Failover Guidelines

There are no special requirements for Zero Downtime Upgrades for failover with the following exceptions:

* For the Firepower 1010, invalid VLAN IDs can cause problems—Before you upgrade to
  9.15(1), make sure you are not using a VLAN for switch ports in the range 3968 to 4047.
  These IDs are for internal use only, and 9.15(1) includes a check to make sure you are
  not using these IDs. For example, if these IDs are in use after upgrading a failover
  pair, the failover pair will go into a suspended state. See [CSCvw33057](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvw33057) for more information.
* Firepower 4100/9300 Failover and
  Clustering hitless upgrade requirements for flow offload—Due to bug fixes in the flow
  offload feature, some combinations of FXOS and ASA do not support flow offload (see the
  [compatibility
  table](#id_59069)). Flow offload is disabled by default for ASA. To
  perform a Failover or Clustering hitless upgrade when using flow offload, you need to
  follow the below upgrade paths to ensure that you are always running a compatible
  combination when upgrading to FXOS 2.3.1.130 or later:

  1. Upgrade ASA to 9.8(3) or later
  2. Upgrade FXOS to 2.3.1.130 or later
  3. Upgrade ASA to your final version

  For example, you are on FXOS 2.2.2.26/ASA 9.8(1), and you want to upgrade to FXOS 2.6.1/ASA 9.12(1), then you can:

  1. Upgrade ASA to 9.8(4)
  2. Upgrade FXOS to 2.6.1
  3. Upgrade ASA to 9.12(1)
* Upgrade issues with 8.4(6), 9.0(2) , and 9.1(2)—Due to CSCug88962, you cannot perform a Zero Downtime Upgrade to 8.4(6), 9.0(2),
  or 9.1(3). You should instead upgrade to 8.4(5) or 9.0(3). To upgrade 9.1(1), you cannot upgrade directly to the 9.1(3) release
  due to CSCuh25271, so there is no workaround for a Zero Downtime Upgrade; you must upgrade to 9.1(2) before you upgrade to
  9.1(3) or later.
* Upgrade issues for fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) ACLs—Due to [CSCuv92371](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuv92371), ACLs containing FQDNs might result in incomplete ACL replication to secondary units in a cluster or failover pair. This
  bug is present in 9.1(7), 9.5(2), 9.6(1), and some interim releases. We suggest that you upgrade to a version that includes
  the fix for CSCuy34265: 9.1(7.6) or later, 9.5(3) or later, 9.6(2) or later. However, due to the nature of configuration replication,
  zero downtime upgrade is not available. See [CSCuy34265](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuy34265) for more information about different methods of upgrading.
* Upgrade issue with 9.7(1) to 9.7(1.x) and later for VTI and VXLAN VNI—If you configure
  both Virtual Tunnel Interfaces (VTIs) and VXLAN Virtual Network Identifier (VNI)
  interfaces, then you cannot perform a zero downtime upgrade for failover; connections on
  these interface types will not replicate to the standby unit until both units are on the
  same version. (CSCvc83062)
* Before upgrading to 9.8(2) or later, FIPS mode
  requires the failover key to be at least 14
  characters—Before you upgrade to to 9.8(2) or
  later in FIPS mode, you must change the
  failover key  or
  failover ipsec
  pre-shared-key  to be at least 14
  characters long. If your failover key is too
  short, when you upgrade the first unit, the
  failover key will be rejected, and both units will
  become active until you set the failover key to a
  valid value.
* Upgrade issue with GTP inspection—There could be some downtime during the upgrade, because the GTP data structures are not
  replicated to the new node.

#### Additional Guidelines

* Cisco ASA Clientless SSL VPN Portal Customization Integrity
  Vulnerability—Multiple vulnerabilities have been fixed for clientless SSL VPN
  in ASA software, so you should upgrade your software to a fixed version. See
  <http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20141008-asa>
  for details about the vulnerability and a list of fixed ASA versions. Also, if
  you ever ran an earlier ASA version that had a vulnerable configuration, then
  regardless of the version you are currently running, you should verify that the
  portal customization was not compromised. If an attacker compromised a
  customization object in the past, then the compromised object stays persistent
  after you upgrade the ASA to a fixed version. Upgrading the ASA prevents this
  vulnerability from being exploited further, but it will not modify any
  customization objects that were already compromised and are still present on
  the system.

### FXOS Upgrade Guidelines

Before you upgrade, read the release notes for each FXOS version in your chosen upgrade path. Release notes contain important
information about each FXOS release, including new features and changed functionality.

Upgrading may require configuration changes that you must address. For example, new hardware supported in an FXOS release
might also require that you update the FXOS firmware.

FXOS release notes are available here: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/security/firepower-9000-series/products-release-notes-list.html>.

#### ASA 9.20 and 9.19

Releases in **bold** are the recommended versions.

| **Note** | ---  * ASA 9.20(x) was the final version for the Firepower 2100 series. * ASA 9.18(x) was the final version for the Firepower 4110, 4120, 4140, 4150, and   Security Modules SM-24, SM-36, and SM-44 for the Firepower 9300. * ASDM versions are backwards compatible with all previous ASA versions, unless   otherwise stated. For example, ASDM 7.19(1) can manage an ASA 5516-X on ASA   9.10(1). * New ASA versions require the coordinating ASDM version or a later version; you cannot   use an old version of ASDM with a new version of ASA. For example, you cannot use ASDM   7.18 with ASA 9.19. For ASA maintenance releases and interims, you can continue to use   the current ASDM version, unless otherwise stated. For example, you can use ASA   9.20(1.5) with ASDM 7.20(1). If an ASA maintenance release has significant new   features, then usually there will be a new ASDM version required.  --- |

#### ASA 9.18 to 9.17

Releases in **bold** are the recommended versions.

| **Note** | ---  * ASA 9.16(x) was the final version for the ASA 5506-X, 5506H-X, 5506W-X, 5508-X, and   5516-X. * ASDM versions are backwards compatible with all previous ASA versions, unless   otherwise stated. For example, ASDM 7.17(1) can manage an ASA 5516-X on ASA   9.10(1). * New ASA versions require the coordinating ASDM version or a later version; you cannot   use an old version of ASDM with a new version of ASA. For example, you cannot use ASDM   7.17 with ASA 9.18. For ASA maintenance releases and interims, you can continue to use   the current ASDM version, unless otherwise stated. For example, you can use ASA   9.17(1.2) with ASDM 7.17(1). If an ASA maintenance release has significant new   features, then usually there will be a new ASDM version required. * ASA 9.17(1.13) and 9.18(2) and later requires ASDM 7.18(1.152) or later. The ASA now   validates whether the ASDM image is a Cisco digitally signed image. If you try to run   an older ASDM image than 7.18(1.152) with an ASA version with this fix, ASDM will be   blocked and the message “%ERROR: Signature not valid for file disk0:/<filename>”   will be displayed at the ASA CLI. ([CSCwb05291](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwb05291),   [CSCwb05264](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwb05264))  --- |

For example, ASDM 7.15(1) can manage an ASA 5516-X on ASA   9.10(1). * New ASA versions require the coordinating ASDM version or a later version; you cannot   use an old version of ASDM with a new version of ASA. For example, you cannot use ASDM   7.15 with ASA 9.16. For ASA maintenance releases and interims, you can continue to use   the current ASDM version, unless otherwise stated. For example, you can use ASA   9.16(1.15) with ASDM 7.16(1). If an ASA maintenance release has significant new   features, then usually there will be a new ASDM version required. * ASA 9.16(3.19) and later requires ASDM 7.18(1.152) or later. The ASA now validates   whether the ASDM image is a Cisco digitally signed image. If you try to run an older   ASDM image than 7.18(1.152) with an ASA version with this fix, ASDM will be blocked   and the message “%ERROR: Signature not valid for file disk0:/<filename>” will be   displayed at the ASA CLI.

#### ASA 9.14 to 9.13

Releases in **bold** are the recommended versions.

| **Note** | ---  * ASA 9.14(x) was the final version for the ASA 5525-X, 5545-X, and 5555-X. * ASA 9.12(x) was the final version for the ASA 5512-X, 5515-X, 5585-X, and ASASM. * ASDM versions are backwards compatible with all previous ASA versions, unless   otherwise stated. For example, ASDM 7.13(1) can manage an ASA 5516-X on ASA 9.10(1).   ASDM 7.13(1) and ASDM 7.14(1) did not support ASA 5512-X, 5515-X, 5585-X, and ASASM;   you must upgrade to ASDM 7.13(1.101) or 7.14(1.48) to restore ASDM support. * New ASA versions require the coordinating ASDM version or a later version; you cannot   use an old version of ASDM with a new version of ASA. For example, you cannot use ASDM   7.13 with ASA 9.14. For ASA maintenance releases and interims, you can continue to use   the current ASDM version, unless otherwise stated. For example, you can use ASA   9.14(1.2) with ASDM 7.14(1). If an ASA maintenance release has significant new   features, then usually there will be a new ASDM version required. * ASA 9.14(4.14) and later requires ASDM 7.18(1.152) or later. The ASA now validates   whether the ASDM image is a Cisco digitally signed image. If you try to run an older   ASDM image than 7.18(1.152) with an ASA version with this fix, ASDM will be blocked   and the message “%ERROR: Signature not valid for file disk0:/<filename>” will be   displayed at the ASA CLI.

### Firepower 4100/9300 Compatibility with ASA and Threat Defense

The following table lists compatibility between the ASA and threat
defense applications with the Firepower 4100/9300.

The **bold** versions listed below are specially-qualified companion releases. You
should use these software combinations whenever possible because Cisco performs enhanced
testing for these combinations.

For upgrading, see the following guidelines:

* FXOS—For 2.2.2 and later, you can upgrade directly to a higher
  version. When upgrading from versions earlier than 2.2.2, you need to upgrade to each
  intermediate version. Note that you cannot upgrade FXOS to a version that does not
  support your current logical device version. You will need to upgrade in steps:
  upgrade FXOS to the highest version that supports your current logical device; then
  upgrade your logical device to the highest version supported with that FXOS version.
  For example, if you want to upgrade from FXOS 2.2/ASA 9.8 to FXOS 2.13/ASA 9.19, you
  would have to perform the following upgrades:

  1. FXOS 2.2→FXOS 2.11 (the highest version that supports 9.8)
  2. ASA 9.8→ASA 9.17 (the highest version supported by 2.11)
  3. FXOS 2.11→FXOS 2.13
  4. ASA 9.17→ASA 9.19
* ASA—ASA lets you upgrade directly from your current version to any higher version,
  noting the FXOS requirements above.

| **Note** | ---   This section applies only to the Firepower 4100/9300. Other models utilize FXOS only as an underlying operating system that is included in the ASA and threat defense unified image bundles. For the Secure Firewall 3100 in multi-instance mode, see the Threat Defense compatibility guide.   --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---   FXOS 2.8(1.125)+ and later versions do not support ASA 9.14(1) or 9.14(1.10) for ASA SNMP polls and traps; you must use 9.14(1.15)+. Other releases, such as 9.13 or 9.12, are not affected.   --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---   FXOS 2.12/ASA 9.18/Threat Defense 7.2 was the final version for the Firepower 4110, 4120, 4140, 4150, and Security Modules SM-24, SM-36, and SM-44 for the Firepower 9300.   --- |

### Upgrade Path: ASA Logical Devices for the Firepower 4100/9300

To view your current version and model, use one of the following methods:

* Firepower Chassis Manager: Choose Overview, and look
  at the Model and Version
  fields at the top.
* CLI: For the version, use the show version  command,
  and look at the Package-Vers: field. For the model, enter scope
  chassis 1 , and then show
  inventory .

For upgrading, see the following guidelines:

* FXOS—For 2.2.2 and later, you can upgrade directly to a higher
  version. When upgrading from versions earlier than 2.2.2, you need to upgrade to each
  intermediate version. Note that you cannot upgrade FXOS to a version that does not
  support your current logical device version. You will need to upgrade in steps:
  upgrade FXOS to the highest version that supports your current logical device; then
  upgrade your logical device to the highest version supported with that FXOS version.
  For example, if you want to upgrade from FXOS 2.2/ASA 9.8 to FXOS 2.13/ASA 9.19, you
  would have to perform the following upgrades:

  1. FXOS 2.2→FXOS 2.11 (the highest version that supports 9.8)
  2. ASA 9.8→ASA 9.17 (the highest version supported by 2.11)
  3. FXOS 2.11→FXOS 2.13
  4. ASA 9.17→ASA 9.19
* ASA—ASA lets you upgrade directly from your current version to any higher version,
  noting the FXOS requirements above.

#### Note on Downgrades

Downgrade of FXOS images is not
officially supported. The only Cisco-supported method of
downgrading an image version of FXOS is to perform a
complete re-image of the device.

## Download the Software from Cisco.com

Download all software packages from Cisco.com before you start your upgrade. Depending on the operating system and whether
you are using CLI or GUI, you should place the images on a server or on your management computer. See each installation procedure
for details on supported file locations.

| **Note** | ---   A Cisco.com login and Cisco service contract are required.   --- |
| --- | --- |

* [Download ASA Software](#ID-2152-0000008d)
* [Download FXOS for the Firepower 4100/9300](#ID-2152-0000008d)

### Download ASA Software

If you are using the ASDM Upgrade Wizard, you do not have to
pre-download the software. If you are manually upgrading, for example for a
failover upgrade, download the images to your local computer.

For a CLI upgrade, you can put the software on many server types, including TFTP, HTTP, and FTP. See the copy  command in the [ASA command reference](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/asa-command-reference/A-H/cmdref1/c4.html#pgfId-2171368).

ASA software can be downloaded from Cisco.com. These tables include naming conventions and
information about ASA packages.

Table 11. Current Platforms

| --- | --- | --- |
| ASA virtual | <http://www.cisco.com/go/asav-software> |  |
| **ASA Software (Upgrade)**  Choose Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software > *version*. | The ASA virtual upgrade file has a filename like asa962-**smp-k8.bin**; use this upgrade file for all hypervisors. **Note:** The .zip (VMware), .vhdx (Hyper-V), and .qcow2 (KVM) files are only for initial deployment.   | **Note** | To upgrade the ASA virtual for public cloud services such as Amazon Web Services, you can download the above image from Cisco.com (which requires a Cisco.com login and Cisco service contract) and perform the upgrade as described in this guide. There is no way to obtain an *upgrade* image from the public cloud service. | | --- | --- | |
| **ASDM Software (Upgrade)**  Choose Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Device Manager > *version*. | The ASDM software file has a filename like asdm-762**.bin**. |
| **REST API Software**  Choose Adaptive Security Appliance REST API Plugin > *version*. | The API software file has a filename like asa-restapi-132-**lfbff-k8.SPA**. To install the REST API, see the [API quick start guide](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/api/qsg-asa-api.html). |
| **ASA Device Package for Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC)**  Choose ASA for Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) Device Packages > *version*. | For APIC 1.2(7) and later, choose either the Policy Orchestration with Fabric Insertion, or the Fabric Insertion-only package. The device package software file has a filename like asa-device-pkg-1.2.7.10**.zip**. To install the ASA device package, see the “Importing a Device Package” chapter of the [Cisco APIC Layer 4 to Layer 7 Services Deployment Guide](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/cloud-systems-management/application-policy-infrastructure-controller-apic/tsd-products-support-series-home.html). |

| **ASDM Software (Upgrade)**  Choose your *model* > Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Device Manager > *version*. | Use this image to upgrade to a later version of ASDM using your current ASDM or the ASA CLI. The ASDM software file has a filename like asdm-7131**.bin**.   | **Note** | When you upgrade the ASA bundle, the ASDM image in the bundle replaces the previous ASDM bundle image on the ASA because they have the same name (**asdm.bin**). But if you manually chose a different ASDM image that you uploaded (for example, **asdm-7131.bin**), then you continue to use that image even after a bundle upgrade. To make sure that you are running a compatible version of ASDM, you should either upgrade ASDM before you upgrade the bundle, or you should reconfigure the ASA to use the bundled ASDM image (**asdm.bin**) just before upgrading the ASA bundle. | | --- | --- | |

Bias-Free Language

### Bias-Free Language

The documentation set for this product strives to use bias-free language. For the purposes of this documentation set, bias-free is defined as language that does not imply discrimination based on age, disability, gender, racial identity, ethnic identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and intersectionality. Exceptions may be present in the documentation due to language that is hardcoded in the user interfaces of the product software, language used based on RFP documentation, or language that is used by a referenced third-party product.

# Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense Compatibility Guide

This guide provides software and hardware compatibility for Cisco Secure
Firewall Threat Defense. For related compatibility guides, see the following table.

| **Note** | ---   Not all software versions, especially patches, apply to all platforms. A quick way to tell if a version is supported is that its upgrade/installation packages are posted on the Cisco Support & Download site. If the site is "missing" an upgrade or installation package, that version is not supported. You can also check the release notes and [End-of-Life Announcements](#id_85448). If you feel a version is missing in error, contact Cisco TAC.   --- |

## Suggested Release: Version 7.4.2

To take advantage of new features and resolved issues, we recommend you upgrade all
eligible appliances to at least the suggested release, including the latest patch.
On the Cisco Support & Download
site, the suggested release is marked with a gold star. In Version 7.2.6+/7.4.1+, the
management center notifies you when a new suggested release is available, and
indicates suggested releases on its product upgrades page.

### Suggested Releases for Older Appliances

If an appliance is too old to run the suggested release and you do not plan to
refresh the hardware right now, choose a major version then patch as far as
possible. Some major versions are designated *long-term* or *extra
long-term*, so consider one of those. For an explanation of these terms, see
[Cisco NGFW Product Line Software
Release and Sustaining Bulletin](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/security/firewalls/bulletin-c25-743178.html).

If you are interested in a hardware refresh, contact your Cisco representative or
partner contact.

## Threat Defense Hardware

### Firepower 1000/2100 Series

Firepower 1000/2100 series devices use the FXOS operating
system. Upgrading threat defense automatically upgrades FXOS. For information on bundled
FXOS versions, see [Bundled Components](#id_67425). These devices can also run ASA instead of threat defense; see [Cisco Secure Firewall ASA
Compatibility](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/compatibility/asamatrx.html).

### Secure Firewall 1200 Series

Secure Firewall 1200 series devices use the FXOS operating system. Upgrading threat
defense automatically upgrades FXOS. For information on bundled FXOS versions, see
[Bundled Components](#id_67425). These devices can also run ASA instead of threat defense; see
[Cisco Secure Firewall ASA
Compatibility](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/compatibility/asamatrx.html).

Table 5. Secure Firewall 1200 Series Compatibility

| **Threat Defense** | **Secure Firewall 1210**  **Secure Firewall 1220** |
| --- | --- |
| 7.6 | **YES** |

### Secure Firewall 3100/4200 Series

Secure Firewall 3100/4200 series devices use the FXOS operating system. How FXOS is upgraded depends on
whether the device is in application mode or multi-instance mode. These devices can
also run ASA instead of threat defense; see [Cisco Secure Firewall ASA
Compatibility](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/compatibility/asamatrx.html).

#### Application Mode

In application mode, upgrading threat
defense automatically upgrades FXOS. For information on bundled FXOS versions, see [Bundled Components](#id_67425).

Table 6. Secure Firewall 3100/4200 Series Application Mode Compatibility

| **Threat Defense** | **Secure Firewall 4215**  **Secure Firewall 4225**  **Secure Firewall 4245** | **Secure Firewall 3105** | **Secure Firewall 3110**  **Secure Firewall 3120**  **Secure Firewall 3130**  **Secure Firewall 3140** |

| 7.3 | — | **YES** | **YES** |
| 7.2 | — | — | **YES** |
| 7.1 | — | — | **YES** |

#### Multi-Instance Mode

In multi-instance mode, you upgrade the chassis (FXOS and firmware) and threat
defense separately. However, one package contains both components. It is possible to
have a chassis-only upgrade or a threat defense-only upgrade. For information on
bundled FXOS versions, see [Bundled Components](#id_67425).

Although you can run older threat defense instances on a newer
FXOS, new features and resolved issues
often require a full upgrade.

| **Threat Defense** | **Secure Firewall 4215**  **Secure Firewall 4225**  **Secure Firewall 4245** | **Secure Firewall 3110**  **Secure Firewall 3120**  **Secure Firewall 3130**  **Secure Firewall 3140** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 7.6 | **YES** | **YES** |
| 7.4.1–7.4.x | — | **YES** |

### Firepower 4100/9300

For the Firepower 4100/9300, major threat
defense versions have a specially qualified and recommended companion FXOS version,
listed below in **bold**. Use these combinations whenever possible, because we
perform enhanced testing for them. Note that the table lists the minimum build for
each FXOS version, but in most cases we recommend the latest. For more information,
see the [Cisco Firepower 4100/9300 FXOS Release
Notes](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/security/firepower-9000-series/products-release-notes-list.html).

| **Note** | ---   Although we document that FXOS 2.14.1.163+ is required for threat defense 7.4.x, this is for reimaging to 7.4.2+. If you are already running an earlier FXOS 2.14.1 build, you can successfully upgrade to 7.4.2+ without upgrading FXOS ([CSCwf64429](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwf64429)).   --- |
| --- | --- |

These devices can also run ASA instead of threat
defense. With ASA 9.12+ and threat
defense 6.4.0+, you can run both ASA and threat
defense on separate modules in the same Firepower 9300 chassis. For more information, see
[Cisco Firepower 4100/9300 FXOS
Compatibility](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/fxos/compatibility/fxos-compatibility.html).

## Threat Defense High Availability and Clustering

These tables list threat defense support for high availability and clustering. For
threat defense hardware, support differs depending on whether you are using
standalone devices (also called native instances or application mode) or container
instances (also called multi-instance mode). Threat defense virtual does not support
container instances.

### Standalone Devices

This table lists threat defense hardware support for high availability and clustering
with standalone devices. In management center deployments, all threat defense
hardware supports high availability. For device manager, high availability support
begins in Version 6.3 and clustering is not supported.

Threat Defense Management

## On-Prem Management Center

All devices support remote management with a customer-deployed (*on-prem*)
management center.

Versions are major (A.x), maintenance (A.x.y), or patch (A.x.y.z). The management
center should run the same or newer version as its devices. New features and
resolved issues often require the latest version on both the management center and its devices, including patches. Upgrade the management center first—you will still be able to manage older devices, usually a few major
versions
back

| **Note** | ---   You cannot upgrade a device past the management center to a newer major or maintenance version. Although a patched device (fourth-digit) can be managed with an unpatched management center, fully patched deployments undergo enhanced testing.   --- |
| --- | --- |

Note
that in most cases you can upgrade an older device directly to the management center's major or maintenance version. However, sometimes you can manage an older
device that you cannot directly upgrade, even though the target version is
supported on the device. And rarely, there are issues with specific management center-device combinations. For release-specific requirements, see the release
notes.

## Cloud-delivered Firewall Management Center

The cloud-delivered Firewall Management Center can manage threat
defense devices running **Version 7.0.3 to 7.6.0 (except Version 7.1)**.

You can co-manage a cloud-managed device with a Version 7.2+ on-prem management center for event logging and analytics purposes only. Or, you can send security events
to the Cisco cloud with Security
Analytics and Logging (SaaS).

### Co-managing Devices with an Analytics Management Center

The cloud-delivered Firewall
Management Center supports a wider range of managed device versions than on-prem management
centers. This can cause issues if you use an on-prem management center for
analytics because devices can be "too old" or "too new" to co-manage.

You can be prevented from:

* Registering newer devices to the analytics management center because
  older devices are blocking the required management center upgrade.
* Upgrading co-managed devices to the latest release, because the analytics
  management center is "stuck" at an older release.
* Reverting device upgrade, if revert would take the device out of
  compatibility with the analytics management center.

For example, consider a scenario where you want to add co-managed Version 7.6.0
devices to a deployment that currently includes co-managed Version 7.0.x
devices. The cloud-delivered Firewall
Management Center can manage this full range of devices, but the on-prem analytics management
center cannot.

In order of preference, you can:

* Upgrade the Version 7.0.x devices to at least Version 7.2.0, upgrade the
  analytics management center to Version 7.6.0, then add the Version 7.6.0
  devices to both management centers.
* Remove the Version 7.0.x devices from the analytics management center,
  upgrade the analytics management center to Version 7.6.0, then add the
  Version 7.6.0 devices to both management centers.
* Leave the analytics management center as it is and do not add your
  Version 7.6.0 devices.

That is, your choices are:

* To get events from all devices, upgrade (or replace) the analytics
  management center and your older devices.
* To forgo events from older devices, upgrade (or replace) the analytics
  management center only.
* To forgo events from newer devices, leave the analytics management center
  at an older release.

## Device Manager

You can use device
manager to locally manage a single threat
defense device. Most models suppport local management.

Optionally, add Cisco Security Cloud Control to remotely manage multiple threat
defense devices, as an alternative to the management center. Although some configurations still require device
manager, Security Cloud Control allows you to establish and maintain consistent security policies across your threat
defense deployment.

## Bundled Components

These tables list the versions of various
components bundled with threat
defense. Use this information to identify open or resolved bugs in bundled components
that may affect your deployment.

Note that sometimes we release updated builds for select releases. If bundled
components change from build to build, we list the components in the *latest*
build. (In most cases, only the latest build is available for
download.)
For details on new builds and the issues they resolve, see the release notes for
your version.

### Operating Systems

ASA 5500-X series and ISA 3000 devices use the ASA operating system. Firepower
1000/2100, Secure Firewall 1200, and Secure Firewall 3100/4200 series devices use
the FXOS operating system. For the Firepower 4100/9300, see [Firepower 4100/9300](#reference_6DF211D8F60F423387D0316000333539).

### System Databases

The vulnerability database (VDB) is a database of known vulnerabilities to which
hosts may be susceptible, as well as fingerprints for operating systems, clients,
and applications. The system uses the VDB to help determine whether a particular
host increases your risk of compromise.

The geolocation database (GeoDB) is a database that you can leverage to view and
filter traffic based on geographical location.

Table 18.

## Browser Requirements

### Browsers

We test with the latest versions of these popular browsers, running on currently
supported versions of macOS and Microsoft Windows:

Table 24. Browsers

| Browser | Device Manager Version |
| --- | --- |
| Google Chrome | Any |
| Mozilla Firefox | Any |
| Microsoft Edge (Windows only) | Version 6.7+ |
| Apple Safari | Not extensively tested. Feedback welcome. |

If you encounter issues with any other browser, or are running an operating system
that has reached end of life, we ask that you switch or upgrade. If you continue to
encounter issues or have feedback, contact Cisco TAC.

### Browser Settings and Extensions

Regardless of browser, keep JavaScript and
cookies enabled.
If you are using Microsoft Edge, do *not* enable IE mode.

Note that some browser extensions can prevent you from saving values in fields like
the certificate and key in PKI objects. These extensions include, but are not
limited to, Grammarly and Whatfix Editor. This happens because these extensions
insert characters (such as HTML) in the fields, which causes the system to see them
invalid. We recommend you disable these extensions while you’re logged into our
products.

### Screen Resolution

Table 25. Screen Resolution

| **Interface** | **Minimum Resolution** |
| --- | --- |
| Device manager | 1024 x 768 |
| Chassis manager for the Firepower 4100/9300 | 1024 x 768 |

### Securing Communications

When you first log in, the system uses a self-signed digital certificate to secure
web communications. Your browser should display an untrusted authority warning, but
also should allow you to add the certificate to the trust store. Although this will
allow you to continue, we do recommend that you replace the self-signed certificate
with a certificate signed by a globally known or internally trusted certificate
authority (CA).

To begin replacing the self-signed certificate on device manager, click
Device, then the System Settings > Management Access link, then the Management Web Server tab.
For detailed procedures, see the online help or the [Cisco
Secure Firewall Device Manager Configuration
Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/security/firepower-ngfw/products-installation-and-configuration-guides-list.html).

| **Note** | ---   If you do not replace the self-signed certificate:   * Google Chrome does not cache static content, such as images, CSS, or   JavaScript. Especially in low bandwidth environments, this can extend   page load times. * Mozilla Firefox can stop trusting the self-signed certificate when the   browser updates. If this happens, you can refresh Firefox, keeping in   mind that you will lose some settings; see Mozilla's *[Refresh Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/refresh-firefox-reset-add-ons-and-settings)* support   page.  --- |
| --- | --- |

### Browsing from a Monitored Network

Many browsers use Transport Layer Security (TLS) v1.3 by default. If you are using an
SSL policy to handle encrypted traffic, and people in your monitored network use
browsers with TLS v1.3 enabled, websites that support TLS v1.3 may fail to load.

| **Note** | ---   In Version 6.2.3 and earlier, websites that support TLS v1.3 always fail to load. As a workaround, you can configure managed devices to remove extension 43 (TLS 1.3) from ClientHello negotiation; see the software advisory titled: [*Failures loading websites using TLS 1.3 with SSL inspection enabled*](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/SA/SW_Advisory_CSCvh22181.html). In Version 6.2.3.7+, you can specify when to downgrade; see the system support  commands in the [Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense Command Reference](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/command_ref/b_Command_Reference_for_Firepower_Threat_Defense.html) after consulting with Cisco TAC.   --- |
| --- | --- |

## End-of-Life Announcements

The following tables provide end-of-life details. Dates that have passed
are in **bold**.

### Snort

If you are still using the Snort 2 inspection engine with threat defense, switch to Snort 3
now for improved detection and performance. It is available starting in threat defense
Version 6.7+ (with device manager) and Version 7.0+ (with management center). Snort 2 will
be deprecated in a future release. You will eventually be unable to upgrade
Snort 2 devices.

In management center deployments, upgrading to threat defense Version
7.2+ also upgrades eligible Snort 2 devices to Snort

These software versions on still-supported branches have been removed
from the Cisco Support & Download
site.

| **Note** | ---   In Version 6.2.3+, uninstalling a patch (fourth-digit release) results in an appliance running the version you upgraded from. This means that you can end up running a deprecated version simply by uninstalling a later patch. Unless otherwise stated, do *not* remain at a deprecated version. Instead, we recommend you upgrade. If upgrade is impossible, uninstall the deprecated patch.   --- |

# Common Vulnerability Scoring System

| Choose the version of CVSS calculator:   Version 1  Version 2  Version 3  Version 3.1 |
| --- |
| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.1 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: Low C: High C: None  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: Low A: High A: None  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 4.0 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Unproven   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Not Defined  RC: Confirmed   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 4.0 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High  CR: Not Defined   Select Confidentiality Requirement Parameters  Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Select Integrity Requirement Parameters  Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High  AR: Not Defined   Select Availability Requirement Parameters  Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Vector Parameters  Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Complexity Parameters  Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Select Modified Privileges Required Parameters  Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Select Modified User Interaction Parameters  Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Select Modified Scope Parameters  Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Select Modified Confidentiality Parameters  Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Select Modified Integrity Parameters  Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined   Select Modified Availability Parameters    Environmental Score: 4.0 |

## Introduction

This document describes steps to confirm the active snort version a Cisco FTD runs when it is managed by the Cisco FDM , the Cisco FMC, or the CDO.

## Prerequisites

### Requirements

Cisco recommends that you have knowledge of these topics:

* Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC)
* Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD)
* Cisco Firepower Device Manager (FDM)
* Cisco Defense Orchestrator (CDO)

### Components Used

The information in this document is based on these software and hardware versions:

* Cisco Firepower Threat Defense v6.7.0 and 7.0.0
* Cisco Firepower Management Center v6.7.0 and 7.0.0
* Cisco Defense Orchestrator

The information in this document was created from the devices in a specific lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If your network is live, ensure that you understand the potential impact of any command.

## Background Information

SNORT® Intrusion Prevention System has officially launched Snort 3, a sweeping upgrade that features improvements and new features that enhance the performance, faster processing, improved scalability for your network, and a range of 200+ plugins so you can create a custom set-up for your network.

Advantages of Snort 3 include, but are not limited to:

* Improved performance
* Improved SMBv2 inspection
* New script detection capabilities
* HTTP/2 inspection
* Custom rule groups
* Syntax that makes custom intrusion rules easier to write.
* Reasons for why it would have dropped inline results in intrusion events.
* No Snort restarts when changes are deployed to the VDB, SSL policies, custom application detectors, captive portal identity sources, and TLS server identity discovery.
* Improved serviceability, due to Snort 3-specific telemetry data sent to Cisco Success Network, and to better troubleshooting logs.

The support for Snort 3.0 was introduced for the 6.7.0 Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), just when the FTD is managed through the Cisco Firepower Device Manager (FDM).

**Note**: For new 6.7.0 FTD deployments managed by FDM, Snort 3.0 is the default inspection engine. If you upgrade the FTD to 6.7 from an older release, then Snort 2.0 remains the active inspection engine, but you can switch to Snort 3.0.

**Note**: For this release, Snort 3.0 does not support virtual routers, time-based access control rules, or the decryption of TLS 1.1 or lower connections. Enable Snort 3.0 only if you do not need these features.

Then, Firepower version 7.0 introduced the Snort 3.0 support for the Firepower Threat Defense devices managed by both; the Cisco FDM and by the Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC).

**Note**: For new 7.0 FTD deployments, Snort 3 is now the default inspection engine. Upgraded deployments continue to use Snort 2, but you can switch at any time.

**Caution**: You can freely switch back and forth between Snort 2.0 and 3.0, so you can revert your change if needed. Traffic is interrupted whenever you switch versions.

**Caution**: Before you switch to Snort 3, is strongly recommend you read and understand the [Firepower Management Center Snort 3 Configuration Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/70/snort3/config-guide/snort3-configuration-guide-v70.html). Pay special attention to feature limitations and migration instructions. Although the upgrade to Snort 3 is designed for minimal impact, features do not map exactly. The plan and preparation before the upgrade can help you make sure that traffic is handled as expected.

## Determine the Active Snort Version that Runs on FTD

### **FTD Command Line Interface (CLI)**

In order to determine the active snort version that runs on an FTD, log in to the FTD CLI and run the **show snort3 status** command:

Example 1: When there is no output displayed, then the FTD runs Snort 2.

> ```
> >show snort3 status
> >
> ```

Example 2: When the output shows, Currently running Snort 2, then the FTD runs Snort 2.

> ```
> >show snort3 status
> Currently running Snort 2
> ```

Example 3: When the output shows, Currently running Snort 3, then the FTD runs Snort 3.

> ```
> >show snort3 status
> Currently running Snort 3
> ```

### **FTD Managed by the Cisco FDM**

In order to determine the active snort version that runs on an FTD that is managed by the Cisco FDM, proceed with the next steps:

1. Log in to the Cisco FTD through the FDM web interface.
2. From the main menu, select **Policies**.
3. Then, select the **Intrusion** tab.
4. Look for the **Snort Version** or the **Inspection Engine** section to confirm the Snort version that is active in the FTD.

Example 1: The FTD runs snort version 2.

![FTD Runs Snort Version 2 FDM](/c/dam/en/us/support/docs/security/secure-firewall-threat-defense/220415-determine-the-active-snort-version-that-00.png)

Example 2: The FTD runs snort version 3.

![FTD Runs Snort Version 3 FDM](/c/dam/en/us/support/docs/security/secure-firewall-threat-defense/220415-determine-the-active-snort-version-that-01.png)

### **FTD Managed by the** **Cisco FMC**

In order to determine the active snort version that runs on an FTD that is managed by the Cisco FMC, proceed with the next steps:

1. Log in to the Cisco FMC web interface.
2. From the **Devices** menu, select **Device Management**.
3. Then, select the appropriate FTD device.
4. Click the **Edit** pencil icon.
5. Select the **Device** tab and look for the **Inspection Engine** section to confirm the snort version that is active in the FTD:

Example 1: The FTD runs snort version 2.

![FTD Runs Snort Version 2 FMC](/c/dam/en/us/support/docs/security/secure-firewall-threat-defense/220415-determine-the-active-snort-version-that-02.png)

Example 2: The FTD runs snort version 3.

![FTD Runs Snort Version 3 FMC](/c/dam/en/us/support/docs/security/secure-firewall-threat-defense/220415-determine-the-active-snort-version-that-03.png)

### **FTD Managed by the** **Cisco CDO**

In order to determine the active snort version that runs on an FTD that is managed by the Cisco Defense Orchestrator, proceed with the next steps:

1. Log in to the Cisco Defense Orchestrator web interface.
2. From the **Inventory** menu, select the appropriate FTD device.
3. In the **Device Details** section, look for **Snort Version**:

Example 1: The FTD runs snort version 2.

![FTD Runs Snort Version 2 CDO](/c/dam/en/us/support/docs/security/secure-firewall-threat-defense/220415-determine-the-active-snort-version-that-04.png)

Example 2: The FTD runs snort version 3.

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |
| **Hours** | 24 hours a day, 7 days a week |

## Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco

There are several ways to stay connected and receive the latest security vulnerability information from Cisco. Customers should review the following table, and subsequent summaries, to determine the appropriate option for them:

| **Cisco.com** | <https://www.cisco.com/security/> |

| **Email** | cust-security-announce@cisco.com |
| **RSS** | <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44> |
| **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API** | [https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT/](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) |
| **My Notifications** | <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html> |

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

### **RSS Feeds**

Cisco security vulnerability information is also available via RSS feeds from Cisco.com. These feeds are free and do not require an active Cisco.com registration. For information on how to subscribe to the RSS feeds, visit the [Cisco Security RSS Feeds page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44).

### **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API**

The Cisco PSIRT openVuln application programming interface (API) is a RESTful API that conforms to the [representational state transfer](https://restfulapi.net/) (REST) software architectural style and allows customers to obtain Cisco security vulnerability information in different machine-consumable formats. To learn about accessing and using the API, visit the [PSIRT page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) on the Cisco DevNet website.

### **My Notifications**

The [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) allows registered Cisco.com users to subscribe to and receive important Cisco product and technology information, including Cisco Security Advisories. This service provides an improved unified subscription experience, allowing users to choose the timing of notifications as well as the notification delivery method (email or RSS feed). The level of access will be determined by the subscriber's relationship with Cisco.

### Creating a Notification

To create a notification, use the following steps:

1. Log in to the [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) on Cisco.com using a registered Cisco.com account name and password.

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

# **Cisco Secure Firewall ASA Compatibility**

This document lists the Secure Firewall ASA software and
hardware compatibility and requirements.

## ASA and ASDM Compatibility Per Model

This section lists ASA and ASDM compatibility per model.

| **Note** | ---   For guidance on security issues on the ASA, and which releases contain fixes for each issue, see the [ASA Security Advisories](https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x).   --- |
| --- | --- |

### ASA 9.22

Releases in **bold** are the recommended versions.

| **Note** | ---  * ASA 9.20(x) was the final version for the Firepower 2100 series. * ASDM versions are backwards compatible with all previous ASA versions, unless   otherwise stated. For example, ASDM 7.22(1) can manage an ASA 5516-X on ASA   9.10(1). * New ASA versions require the coordinating ASDM version or a later version; you cannot   use an old version of ASDM with a new version of ASA. For example, you cannot use ASDM   7.20 with ASA 9.22. For ASA maintenance releases and interims, you can continue to use   the current ASDM version, unless otherwise stated. For example, you can use ASA   9.22(1.2) with ASDM 7.22(1). If an ASA maintenance release has significant new   features, then usually there will be a new ASDM version required.  --- |
| --- | --- |

### ASA 9.20 and 9.19

Releases in **bold** are the recommended versions.

| **Note** | ---  * ASA 9.20(x) was the final version for the Firepower 2100 series. * ASA 9.18(x) was the final version for the Firepower 4110, 4120, 4140, 4150, and   Security Modules SM-24, SM-36, and SM-44 for the Firepower 9300. * ASDM versions are backwards compatible with all previous ASA versions, unless   otherwise stated. For example, ASDM 7.19(1) can manage an ASA 5516-X on ASA   9.10(1). See the following   exceptions:    + For the Firepower 1010E, ASDM 7.19(1) is not supported. You must use 7.19(1.90)+     or 7.18(2.1). * New ASA versions require the coordinating ASDM version or a later version; you cannot   use an old version of ASDM with a new version of ASA. For example, you cannot use ASDM   7.18 with ASA 9.19. For ASA maintenance releases and interims, you can continue to use   the current ASDM version, unless otherwise stated. For example, you can use ASA   9.20(1.5) with ASDM 7.20(1). If an ASA maintenance release has significant new   features, then usually there will be a new ASDM version required.  --- |

### ASA 9.18 to 9.17

Releases in **bold** are the recommended versions.

| **Note** | ---  * ASA 9.16(x) was the final version for the ASA 5506-X, 5506H-X, 5506W-X, 5508-X, and   5516-X. * ASDM versions are backwards compatible with all previous ASA versions, unless   otherwise stated. For example, ASDM 7.17(1) can manage an ASA 5516-X on ASA   9.10(1). See the following   exceptions:    + For the Firepower 1010E, ASDM 7.19(1) is not supported. You must use 7.19(1.90)+     or 7.18(2.1). * New ASA versions require the coordinating ASDM version or a later version; you cannot   use an old version of ASDM with a new version of ASA. For example, you cannot use ASDM   7.17 with ASA 9.18. For ASA maintenance releases and interims, you can continue to use   the current ASDM version, unless otherwise stated. For example, you can use ASA   9.17(1.2) with ASDM 7.17(1). If an ASA maintenance release has significant new   features, then usually there will be a new ASDM version required. * ASA 9.17(1.13) and 9.18(2) and later requires ASDM 7.18(1.152) or later. The ASA now   validates whether the ASDM image is a Cisco digitally signed image. If you try to run   an older ASDM image than 7.18(1.152) with an ASA version with this fix, ASDM will be   blocked and the message “%ERROR: Signature not valid for file disk0:/<filename>”   will be displayed at the ASA CLI. ([CSCwb05291](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwb05291),   [CSCwb05264](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwb05264))  --- |

### ASA 9.16 to 9.15

Releases in **bold** are the recommended versions.

| **Note** | ---  * ASA 9.16(x) was the final version for the ASA 5506-X, 5506H-X, 5506W-X, 5508-X, and   5516-X. * ASA 9.14(x) was the final version for the ASA 5525-X, 5545-X, and 5555-X. * ASDM versions are backwards compatible with all previous ASA versions, unless   otherwise stated. For example, ASDM 7.15(1) can manage an ASA 5516-X on ASA   9.10(1). * New ASA versions require the coordinating ASDM version or a later version; you cannot   use an old version of ASDM with a new version of ASA. For example, you cannot use ASDM   7.15 with ASA 9.16. For ASA maintenance releases and interims, you can continue to use   the current ASDM version, unless otherwise stated. For example, you can use ASA   9.16(1.15) with ASDM 7.16(1). If an ASA maintenance release has significant new   features, then usually there will be a new ASDM version required. * ASA 9.16(3.19) and later requires ASDM 7.18(1.152) or later. The ASA now validates   whether the ASDM image is a Cisco digitally signed image. If you try to run an older   ASDM image than 7.18(1.152) with an ASA version with this fix, ASDM will be blocked   and the message “%ERROR: Signature not valid for file disk0:/<filename>” will be   displayed at the ASA CLI.

### ASA 9.14 to 9.13

Releases in **bold** are the recommended versions.

| **Note** | ---  * ASA 9.14(x) was the final version for the ASA 5525-X, 5545-X, and 5555-X. * ASA 9.12(x) was the final version for the ASA 5512-X, 5515-X, 5585-X, and ASASM. * ASDM versions are backwards compatible with all previous ASA versions, unless   otherwise stated. For example, ASDM 7.13(1) can manage an ASA 5516-X on ASA 9.10(1).   ASDM 7.13(1) and ASDM 7.14(1) did not support ASA 5512-X, 5515-X, 5585-X, and ASASM;   you must upgrade to ASDM 7.13(1.101) or 7.14(1.48) to restore ASDM support. * New ASA versions require the coordinating ASDM version or a later version; you cannot   use an old version of ASDM with a new version of ASA. For example, you cannot use ASDM   7.13 with ASA 9.14. For ASA maintenance releases and interims, you can continue to use   the current ASDM version, unless otherwise stated. For example, you can use ASA   9.14(1.2) with ASDM 7.14(1). If an ASA maintenance release has significant new   features, then usually there will be a new ASDM version required. * ASA 9.14(4.14) and later requires ASDM 7.18(1.152) or later. The ASA now validates   whether the ASDM image is a Cisco digitally signed image. If you try to run an older   ASDM image than 7.18(1.152) with an ASA version with this fix, ASDM will be blocked   and the message “%ERROR: Signature not valid for file disk0:/<filename>” will be   displayed at the ASA CLI.

### ASA 9.12 to 9.5

Releases in **bold** are the recommended versions.

| **Note** | ---  * ASA 9.12(x) was the final version for the ASA   5512-X, 5515-X, 5585-X, and ASASM. * ASDM versions are backwards compatible with all   previous ASA versions, unless otherwise stated.   For example, ASDM 7.12(1) can manage an ASA 5515-X   on ASA 9.10(1). * New ASA versions require the coordinating ASDM   version or a later version; you cannot use an old   version of ASDM with a new version of ASA. For   example, you cannot use ASDM 7.10 with ASA 9.12.   For ASA maintenance releases and interims, you can   continue to use the current ASDM version, unless   otherwise stated. For example, you can use ASA   9.12(1.15) with ASDM 7.12(1). If an ASA   maintenance release has significant new features,   then usually there will be a new ASDM version   required. * ASA 9.8(4.45) and 9.12(4.50) and later require   ASDM 7.18(1.152) or later. The ASA now validates   whether the ASDM image is a Cisco digitally signed   image. If you try to run an older ASDM image than   7.18(1.152) with an ASA version with this fix,   ASDM will be blocked and the message “%ERROR:   Signature not valid for file disk0:/<filename>”   will be displayed at the ASA CLI.

## **ASA and VPN Compatibility**

For ASA and VPN compatibility, see [Supported VPN Platforms, Cisco ASA 5500 Series](https://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/security/asa/compatibility/asa-vpn-compatibility.html).

## Firepower 4100/9300 Compatibility with ASA and Threat Defense

For the Firepower 4100/9300, you must maintain compatibility between FXOS and all ASA and
threat
defense logical devices. Upgrade FXOS before you upgrade the sofware. The **bold** versions
the the following table are specially-qualified (enhanced testing) companion releases. Use
these combinations whenever
possible.

Note that for other device models, the FXOS compatibility work is done for you. In most
cases, upgrading the software automatically upgrades
FXOS.
For the Secure Firewall 3100/4200 in multi-instance mode, the management center guides you through upgrading FXOS and then threat
defense.

To upgrade:

* FXOS: From FXOS 2.2.2 and later, you can upgrade directly to
  any higher version. When upgrading from versions earlier than 2.2.2, you need to
  upgrade to each intermediate version. Note that you cannot upgrade FXOS to a version
  that does not support your current logical device version. You will need to upgrade in
  steps: upgrade FXOS to the highest version that supports your current logical device;
  then upgrade your logical device to the highest version supported with that FXOS
  version. For example, if you want to upgrade from FXOS 2.2/ASA 9.8 to FXOS 2.13/ASA
  9.19, you would have to perform the following upgrades:

  1. FXOS 2.2→FXOS 2.11 (the highest version that supports 9.8)
  2. ASA 9.8→ASA 9.17 (the highest version supported by 2.11)
  3. FXOS 2.11→FXOS 2.13
  4. ASA 9.17→ASA 9.19
* Threat Defense: Interim upgrades may be required for threat
  defense, in addition to the FXOS requirements above. For the exact upgrade path, refer to the
  [management center upgrade guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/security/defense-center/products-installation-guides-list.html) for your version.
* ASA: ASA lets you upgrade directly from your current version to any higher version,
  noting the FXOS requirements above.

| **Note** | ---   FXOS 2.8(1.125)+ and later versions do not support ASA 9.14(1) or 9.14(1.10) for ASA SNMP polls and traps; you must use 9.14(1.15)+. Other releases, such as 9.13 or 9.12, are not affected.   --- |

## Cisco Defense Orchestrator (CDO) Compatibility with the ASA

CDO can manage all platforms running ASA 8.4 and later (see [ASA and ASDM Compatibility Per Model](#id_65776)), except for the ASA Services Module (ASASM), which is not
supported by CDO.

CDO can onboard an ASA running ASA 8.3 but cannot deploy changes to it or manage it
in any other way. Support is "read-only."

CDO does not support management of the ASA FirePOWER module, which runs a different
operating system from ASA. You can still use the ASA FirePOWER module in your
system, but you need to manage it separately with Firepower Management Center or
ASDM.

There may be a CDO feature that does not support all versions of ASA, such as ASA
upgrades from pre-9.12 versions. In those cases, the CDO documentation will list any
version exceptions with the prerequisites for that feature.

## ASA REST API Compatibility

This section lists ASA REST API and ASA compatibility.

| **Note** | ---   The REST API is not supported on newer hardware models and is no longer being developed. We recommend that you instead use the ASA HTTP interface for automation. See [Cisco Secure Firewall ASA HTTP Interface for Automation](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/misc/http-interface/asa-http-interface.html).   --- |
| --- | --- |

The ASA REST API is supported only on the following models starting with 9.3(2) and
ending with 9.16:

* ASA
  Virtual
* Firepower 9300
* ISA 3000
* Firepower 4110, 4120, 4140, 4150
* ASA 5585-X
* ASA 5525-X, 5545-X, 5555-X
* ASA 5512-X, 5515-X
* ASA 5506-X, 5506H-X, 5506W-X, 5508-X, 5516-X

  | **Note** | ---   The ASA 5506-X series does not support the REST API if you are running the FirePOWER module Version 6.0 or later. Disable the ASA REST API using the **no rest-api agent** command.   --- |
  | --- | --- |

## Firepower 2100 Network Module Compatibility

| **Note** | ---   If a network module is listed for multiple Firepower models, and the part number only differs in the model number (FPR*X*K-NM-*module*), then that module is compatible with the other Firepower models. For example, the FPR9K-NM-6X10SR-F module is compatible on the Firepower 2100 (FPR2K-NM-6X10SR-F) and Firepower 4100 (FPR4K-NM-6X10SR-F). See the [FXOS compatibility guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/fxos/compatibility/fxos-compatibility.html) for information about Firepower 4100 and 9300 network modules.   --- |

## ASA and Threat Defense Clustering External Hardware Support

Clustering will work with both Cisco and non-Cisco switches from other major
switching vendors with no known interoperability issues if they comply with the
following requirements and recommendations. Clustering is compatible with
technologies such as vPC (Nexus), VSS (Catalyst), and StackWise & StackWise
Virtual (Catalyst).

### Switch Requirements

* All third party switches must be compliant to the IEEE standard (802.3ad) Link Aggregation Control Protocol.
* EtherChannel bundling must be completed within 45 seconds when connected to Firepower devices and 33 seconds when connected
  to ASA devices.
* On the cluster control link, the switch must provide fully unimpeded unicast and broadcast connectivity at Layer 2 between
  all cluster members.
* On the cluster control link, the switch must not impose any limitations on IP addressing or the packet format above Layer
  2 headers.
* On the cluster control link, the switch interfaces must support jumbo frames and be configurable for an MTU above 1600.

### Switch Recommendations

* The switch should provide uniform traffic distribution over the EtherChannel's individual links.
* The switch should have an EtherChannel load-balancing algorithm that provides traffic symmetry.
* The EtherChannel load balance hash algorithm should be configurable using the 5-tuple, 4-tuple, or 2-tuple to calculate the
  hash.

| **Note** | ---   For the Firepower 9300 cluster, intra-chassis clustering can operate with any switch because Firepower 9300-to-switch connections use standard interface types.   --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---   Some switches, such as the Nexus series, do not support LACP rate fast when performing in-service software upgrades (ISSUs), so we do not recommend using ISSUs with clustering.   --- |
| --- | --- |

## **ASA and Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) Compatibility**

The platforms supported include:

* ASA 5525-X, 5545-X, and 5555-X (8.6(x)—9.14(x))
* ASA 5512-X, 5515-X (8.6(x)—9.12(x))
* ASA 5585-X (8.4(x)—9.12(x))

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |
| **Hours** | 24 hours a day, 7 days a week |

## Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco

There are several ways to stay connected and receive the latest security vulnerability information from Cisco. Customers should review the following table, and subsequent summaries, to determine the appropriate option for them:

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

### **RSS Feeds**

Cisco security vulnerability information is also available via RSS feeds from Cisco.com. These feeds are free and do not require an active Cisco.com registration. For information on how to subscribe to the RSS feeds, visit the [Cisco Security RSS Feeds page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44).

### **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API**

The Cisco PSIRT openVuln application programming interface (API) is a RESTful API that conforms to the [representational state transfer](https://restfulapi.net/) (REST) software architectural style and allows customers to obtain Cisco security vulnerability information in different machine-consumable formats. To learn about accessing and using the API, visit the [PSIRT page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) on the Cisco DevNet website.

### **My Notifications**

The [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) allows registered Cisco.com users to subscribe to and receive important Cisco product and technology information, including Cisco Security Advisories.

| **Additional Public Relations** | media\_pr@cisco.com |

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

## Document Purpose

This document provides standardized content that enumerates commonly observed indicators of compromise (IOCs) to help customers determine whether their device has been impacted by a disclosed vulnerability by comparing security advisory Impact Metrics to the Impact Metric Categories outlined below.

## Document Scope

Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability align with the impact metrics defined in the Base Metric Group of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)](https://www.first.org/cvss/). CVSS provides a way to capture the principal characteristics of a vulnerability and to produce a numerical score reflecting its severity. Cisco uses CVSS as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities in Cisco products. Cisco provides an evaluation of the CVSS Base vulnerability score in disclosed security advisories as documented in [Ciscos Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)

### Confidentiality IOCs

* **Changes in network traffic telemetry (known bad IPs/domains)**  Changes in egress or ingress traffic patterns, in addition to changes to traffic sent or received from known malicious domains, may indicate attempted exfiltration of organizational data.
* **Unknown traffic originating from or terminating on the device (SSH, Telnet, HTTP/HTTPS, etc.)**  Unusual traffic directed to or originating from host devices (e.g. telnet to a mail server on port 25) may indicate attempts to compromise the target platform.
* **Anomalous file transfers initiated from or received by the device (TFTP, FTP, SNMP, etc.)**  Unusual file transfers sent to or received from hosts not normally associated with this type of activity (e.g. FTP to a SQL server) may indicate the exfiltration of organizational data.
* **Geographic-based anomalies (traffic/login activity, etc.)**  Network traffic to or from countries that an organization doesnt normally conduct business with should be investigated, in addition to attempted or successful login activity from unexpected geographic regions.
* **File system permissions changed**  Changes in file system authorizations (e.g. changing a folders permissions from Administrator to Everyone) can be an indication of a malicious actor attempting to establish a foothold in the corporate computing environment.
* **Configuration changes**  In routes, routing protocols, NAT, ACLs, SNMP, logging, syslog, VPNs, GRE tunneling, etc. may indicate attempts to exfiltrate data out of the corporate environment or to establish a permanent foothold in the corporate network.
* **Device account/password additions/deletions/changes**  Can be an indicator of malicious attempts to establish and maintain persistent access to corporate computing assets.
* **Unexplained/unexpected changes initiated from privileged accounts**  Unusual activity from privileged accounts, such as time of activity, systems accessed, data accessed or modified, or the amount of data accessed may be indicators of suspicious activity.

### Integrity IOCs

* **Generation of core dumps and/or tracebacks**  Frequent software crashes during normal device operation could indicate that system software has been replaced or tampered with.
* **Odd device/platform behavior**  Behavior that deviates from expected normal operation, and that cannot be explained by software or hardware defects or by misconfiguration, might indicate that the device has been tampered with.
* **Anomalies in operating system or package hash values**  Inconsistent hash values that deviate from expected values may indicate that system software has been tampered with or replaced to include malicious functionality.
* **Anomalies in operating system or package certificate signing characteristics**  May indicate attempts to bypass code signing checks by installing additional certificates signed by unknown certificate authorities.
* **Unknown binaries installed**  Binary files and any associated configuration files that are not components of the operating system may indicate that malware has been implanted on the device.
* **Unknown processes running**  Processes running in memory, particularly those with unusual process attributes or with arbitrary process names, may indicate that malware has been implanted on the device.
* **Unexpected OS or ROMMON release versions installed**  The presence of unexpected system software or bootstrap software versions could indicate that the images have been tampered with or replaced with malicious versions.
* **File system permissions changed**  Changes in file system authorizations (e.g. changing a folders permissions from Administrator to Everyone) can be an indication of a malicious actor attempting to establish a foothold in the corporate computing environment.
* **Unexpected changes in boot sequence or boot variables**  Alteration of system startup files could indicate an attempt to load software that has been tampered with or altered to include malicious functionality.
* **Configuration changes**  In routes, routing protocols, NAT, ACLs, SNMP, logging, syslog, VPNs, GRE tunneling, etc. may indicate attempts to exfiltrate data out of the corporate environment or establish a permanent foothold in the corporate network.
* **Device account/password additions/deletions/changes**  Can be an indicator of malicious attempts to establish and maintain persistent access to corporate computing assets.
* **Unexplained/unexpected changes initiated from privileged accounts**  Unusual activity from privileged accounts, such as time of activity, systems accessed, data accessed or modified, or the amount of data accessed may be indicators of suspicious activity.

### Availability IOCs

* **Frequent core dump and/or traceback generation**  Frequent software crashes during normal device operation could indicate that system software has been replaced or tampered with and may affect the overall availability of the platform.
* **High CPU usage**  Abnormally high CPU usage caused by a malicious actor may adversely affect normal device operation by causing CPU resource exhaustion.
* **Frequent rebooting**  Altered device software or platform resource exhaustion may cause the device to reload frequently and thereby create a denial of service condition that prohibits normal device operation.
* **Saturated interface input/output buffers**  High traffic volumes initiated by a malicious actor can negatively impact normal platform operation and may delay or prohibit authorized traffic from transiting the device.
* **Abnormally high malformed packet counts**  High numbers of malformed packets destined to a device may indicate reconnaissance activity or an attempt to disrupt the normal operation of the platform.
* **Configuration changes**  In routes, routing protocols, NAT, ACLs, SNMP, logging, syslog, VPNs, GRE tunneling, etc. may indicate attempts to exfiltrate data out of the corporate environment or to establish a permanent foothold in the corporate network and could affect device availability.
* **Unexplained/unexpected changes initiated from privileged accounts**  Unusual activity from privileged accounts, such as time of activity, systems accessed, data accessed or modified, or the amount of data accessed, may be indicators of suspicious activity and could affect device availability.

## Upgrade Feature History

Table 6. Version 7.0.0 Features

| **Feature** | **Details** |
| --- | --- |
| **Threat Defense Upgrade** | |
| Improved FTD upgrade performance and status reporting. | FTD upgrades are now easier faster, more reliable, and take up less disk space. A new Upgrades tab in the Message Center provides further enhancements to upgrade status and error reporting. |
| Easy-to-follow upgrade workflow for FTD devices. | A new device upgrade page (Devices > Device Upgrade) on the FMC provides an easy-to-follow wizard for upgrading Version 6.4+ FTD devices. It walks you through important pre-upgrade stages, including selecting devices to upgrade, copying the upgrade package to the devices, and compatibility and readiness checks.  To begin, use the new Upgrade Firepower Software action on the Device Management page (Devices > Device Management > Select Action).  As you proceed, the system displays basic information about your selected devices, as well as the current upgrade-related status. This includes any reasons why you cannot upgrade. If a device does not "pass" a stage in the wizard, it does not appear in the next stage.  If you navigate away from wizard, your progress is preserved, although other users with Administrator access can reset, modify, or continue the wizard.   | **Note** | You must still use System(system gear icon) > Updates to upload or specify the location of FTD upgrade packages. You must also use the System Updates page to upgrade the FMC itself, as well as all non-FTD managed devices. | | --- | --- |  | **Note** | In Version 7.0, the wizard does not correctly display devices in clusters or high availability pairs. Even though you must select and upgrade these devices as a unit, the wizard displays them as standalone devices. Device status and upgrade readiness are evaluated and reported on an individual basis. This means it is possible for one unit to appear to "pass" to the next stage while the other unit or units do not. However, these devices are still grouped. Running a readiness check on one, runs it on all. Starting the upgrade on one, starts it on all.  To avoid possible time-consuming upgrade failures, *manually* ensure all group members are ready to move on to the next step of the wizard before you click Next. | | --- | --- | |
| Upgrade more FTD devices at once. | The number of devices you can upgrade at once is now limited by your management network bandwidth—not the system's ability to manage simultaneous upgrades. Previously, we recommended against upgrading more than five devices at a time.   | **Important** | Only upgrades to FTD Version 6.7+ using the FTD upgrade wizard see this improvement. If you are upgrading devices to an older FTD release—even if you are using the new upgrade wizard—we still recommend you limit to five devices at a time. | | --- | --- | |
| Upgrade different device models together. | You can now use the FTD upgrade wizard to queue and invoke upgrades for all FTD models at the same time, as long as the system has access to the appropriate upgrade packages.  Previously, you would choose an upgrade package, then choose the devices to upgrade using that package. That meant that you could upgrade multiple devices at the same time *only* if they shared an upgrade package. For example, you could upgrade two Firepower 2100 series devices at the same time, but not a Firepower 2100 series and a Firepower 1000 series. |

Table 7. Version 6.7.0 Features

| **Feature** | **Details** |
| --- | --- |
| **Threat Defense Upgrade** | |
| Upgrades remove PCAP files to save disk space. | Upgrades now remove locally stored PCAP files. To upgrade, you must have enough free disk space or the upgrade fails. |
| Improved FTD upgrade status reporting and cancel/retry options. | You can now view the status of FTD device upgrades and readiness checks in progress on the Device Management page, as well as a 7-day history of upgrade success/failures. The Message Center also provides enhanced status and error messages.  A new Upgrade Status pop-up, accessible from both Device Management and the Message Center with a single click, shows detailed upgrade information, including percentage/time remaining, specific upgrade stage, success/failure data, upgrade logs, and so on.  Also on this pop-up, you can manually cancel failed or in-progress upgrades (Cancel Upgrade), or retry failed upgrades (Retry Upgrade). Canceling an upgrade reverts the device to its pre-upgrade state.   | **Note** | To be able to manually cancel or retry a failed upgrade, you must disable the new auto-cancel option, which appears when you use the FMC to upgrade an FTD device: Automatically cancel on upgrade failure and roll back to the previous version. With the option enabled, the device automatically reverts to its pre-upgrade state upon upgrade failure.  Auto-cancel is not supported for patches. In an HA or clustered deployment, auto-cancel applies to each device individually. That is, if the upgrade fails on one device, only that device is reverted. | | --- | --- |   New/modified screens:   * System(system gear icon) > Updates > Product Updates > Available Updates > Install icon for the FTD upgrade package * Devices > Device Management > Upgrade * Message Center > Tasks   New/modified CLI commands: show upgrade status detail , show upgrade status continuous , show upgrade status , upgrade cancel , upgrade retry |
| **Content Updates** | |
| Custom intrusion rule import warns when rules collide. | The FMC now warns you of rule collisions when you import custom (local) intrusion rules. Previously, the system would silently skip the rules that cause collisions—with the exception of Version 6.6.0.1, where a rule import with collisions would fail entirely.  On the Rule Updates page, if a rule import had collisions, a warning icon is displayed in the Status column. For more information, hover your pointer over the warning icon and read the tooltip.  Note that a collision occurs when you try to import an intrusion rule that has the same SID/revision number as an existing rule. You should always make sure that updated versions of custom rules have new revision numbers.  New/modified screens: We added a warning icon to System(system gear icon) > Updates > Rule Updates. |

Table 8. Version 6.6.0 Features

| **Feature** | **Details** |
| --- | --- |
| **Threat Defense Upgrade** | |
| Get FTD upgrade packages from an internal web server. | FTD devices can now get upgrade packages from your own internal web server, rather than from the FMC. This is especially useful if you have limited bandwidth between the FMC and its devices. It also saves space on the FMC.   | **Note** | This feature is supported only for FTD devices running Version 6.6+. It is not supported for upgrades *to* Version 6.6, nor is it supported for the FMC or Classic devices. | | --- | --- |   New/modified screens: We added a Specify software update source option to the page where you upload upgrade packages. |
| **Content Updates** | |
| Automatic VDB update during initial setup. | When you set up a new or reimaged FMC, the system automatically attempts to update the vulnerability database (VDB).  This is a one-time operation. If the FMC has internet access, we recommend you schedule tasks to perform automatic recurring VDB update downloads and installations. |

Table 9. Version 6.5.0 Features

| **Feature** | **Details** |
| --- | --- |
| **Content Updates** | |
| Automatic software downloads and GeoDB updates. | When you set up a new or reimaged FMC, the system automatically schedules:   * A weekly task to download software updates for the FMC   and its managed devices. * Weekly updates for the GeoDB.   The tasks are scheduled in UTC, which means that when they occur locally depends on the date and your specific location. Also, because tasks are scheduled in UTC, they do not adjust for Daylight Saving Time, summer time, or any such seasonal adjustments that you may observe in your location. If you are affected, scheduled tasks occur one hour “later” in the summer than in the winter, according to local time. We recommend you review the auto-scheduled configurations and adjust them if necessary. |

Table 10. Version 6.4.0 Features

| **Feature** | **Details** |
| --- | --- |
| **Management Center Upgrade** | |
| Upgrades postpone scheduled tasks. | The FMC upgrade process now postpones scheduled tasks. Any task scheduled to begin during the upgrade will begin five minutes after the post-upgrade reboot.   | **Note** | Before you begin any upgrade, you must still make sure running tasks are complete. Tasks running when the upgrade begins are stopped, become failed tasks, and cannot be resumed. | | --- | --- |   Note that this feature is supported for all upgrades *from* a supported version. This includes Version 6.4.0.10 and later patches, Version 6.6.3 and later maintenance releases, and Version 6.7.0+. This feature is not supported for upgrades *to* a supported version from an unsupported version. |
| **Content Updates** | |
| Signed SRU, VDB, and GeoDB updates. | So the system can verify that you are using the correct update files, Version 6.4+ uses *signed* updates for intrusion rules (SRU), the vulnerability database (VDB), and the geolocation database (GeoDB). Earlier versions continue to use unsigned updates.  Unless you manually download updates from the Cisco Support & Download site—for example, in an air-gapped deployment—you should not notice any difference in functionality. If, however, you do manually download and install SRU, VDB, and GeoDB updates, make sure you download the correct package for your current version.  Signed update files begin with 'Cisco' instead of 'Sourcefire,' and terminate in .sh.REL.tar instead of .sh, as follows:   * SRU:   Cisco\_Firepower\_SRU-*date*-*build*-vrt.sh.REL.tar * VDB:   Cisco\_VDB\_Fingerprint\_Database-4.5.0-*version*.sh.REL.tar * GeoDB:   Cisco\_GEODB\_Update-*date*-*build*.sh.REL.tar   We will provide both signed and unsigned updates until the end-of-support for versions that require unsigned updates. Do not untar signed (.tar) packages. If you accidentally upload a signed update to an older FMC or ASA FirePOWER device, you must manually delete it. Leaving the package takes up disk space, and also may cause issues with future upgrades. |

Table 11. Version 6.2.3 Features

| **Feature** | **Details** |
| --- | --- |
| **Device Upgrade** | |
| Copy upgrade packages to managed devices before the upgrade. | You can now copy (or push) an upgrade package from the FMC to a managed device before you run the actual upgrade. This is useful because you can push during times of low bandwidth use, outside of the upgrade maintenance window.  When you push to high availability, clustered, or stacked devices, the system sends the upgrade package to the active/control/primary first, then to the standby/data/secondary.  New/modified screens: System(system gear icon) > Updates |
| **Content Updates** | |
| FMC warns of Snort restart before VDB updates. | The FMC now warns you that Vulnerability Database (VDB) updates restart the Snort process. This interrupts traffic inspection and, depending on how the managed device handles traffic, possibly interrupts traffic flow. You can cancel the install until a more convenient time, such as during a maintenance window.  These warnings can appear:   * After you download and manually install a VDB. * When you create a scheduled task to install the VDB. * When the VDB installs in the background, such as during a   previously scheduled task or as part of a software   upgrade. |
| Deprecated: Geolocation details | In May 2022 we split the GeoDB into two packages: a country code package mapping IP addresses to countries/continents, and an IP package containing additional contextual data associated with routable IP addresses. In January 2024, we stopped providing the IP package. This saves disk space and does not affect geolocation rules or traffic handling in any way. Any contextual data is now stale, and upgrading to most later versions deletes the IP package. Options to view contextual data have no effect, and are removed in later versions. |

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |
| **Hours** | 24 hours a day, 7 days a week |

## Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco

There are several ways to stay connected and receive the latest security vulnerability information from Cisco. Customers should review the following table, and subsequent summaries, to determine the appropriate option for them:

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

### **RSS Feeds**

Cisco security vulnerability information is also available via RSS feeds from Cisco.com. These feeds are free and do not require an active Cisco.com registration. For information on how to subscribe to the RSS feeds, visit the [Cisco Security RSS Feeds page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44).

### **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API**

The Cisco PSIRT openVuln application programming interface (API) is a RESTful API that conforms to the [representational state transfer](https://restfulapi.net/) (REST) software architectural style and allows customers to obtain Cisco security vulnerability information in different machine-consumable formats. To learn about accessing and using the API, visit the [PSIRT page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) on the Cisco DevNet website.

### **My Notifications**

The [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) allows registered Cisco.com users to subscribe to and receive important Cisco product and technology information, including Cisco Security Advisories. This service provides an improved unified subscription experience, allowing users to choose the timing of notifications as well as the notification delivery method (email or RSS feed). The level of access will be determined by the subscriber's relationship with Cisco.

### Creating a Notification

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

This vulnerability exists because the configuration for IP geolocation rules is not parsed properly. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by spoofing an IP address until they bypass the restriction. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass location-based IP address restrictions.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ftdsnort3sip-bypass-LMz2ThKn>  This advisory is part of the November 2023 release of the Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Security Advisory Bundled publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see [Cisco Event Response: November 2023 Semiannual Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-74985).  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected Cisco FTD Software if it was running a vulnerable release and had the Snort 3 detection engine configured with a geolocation inspection policy.  For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. Determine Cisco FTD Software Snort Configuration To determine if Snort 3 is running on Cisco FTD Software, see [Determine the Active Snort Version that Runs on Firepower Threat Defense (FTD)](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/secure-firewall-threat-defense/220415-determine-the-active-snort-version-that.html). Snort 3 has to be active for this vulnerability to be exploited. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following products:    + Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software   + Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software   + Open Source Snort 2   + Open Source Snort 3  Details  * Exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to bypass protections that are provided by an ACL that is applied on an affected device. The overall impact of exploitation is organization specific because it depends on the importance of the assets that the ACL was supposed to protect. Customers should evaluate how exploitation of this vulnerability would impact their network and proceed according to their own vulnerability-handling and remediation processes.  Indicators of Compromise  * The [Cisco Security Indicators of Compromise Reference Guide](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/iocs.html "Cisco Security Indicators of Compromise Reference Guide") lists commonly observed IoCs, which can help identify devices that may have been impacted by the vulnerability disclosed in this Cisco security advisory.  Workarounds  * There is a workaround that addresses this vulnerability.  In the geolocation configuration file, configure a non-critical IP exclusion range as the last entry. This entry will be ignored.  While this workaround has been deployed and was proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment.  Fixed Software  * When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software To help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software, Cisco provides the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x). This tool identifies any Cisco security advisories that impact a specific software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities that are described in each advisory (“First Fixed”). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities that are described in all the advisories that the Software Checker identifies (“Combined First Fixed”).  To use the tool, go to the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) page and follow the instructions. Alternatively, use the following form to search for vulnerabilities that affect a specific software release. To use the form, follow these steps:    1. Choose which advisories the tool will search-all advisories, only advisories with a Critical or High [Security Impact Rating (SIR)](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#asr), or only this advisory.   2. Choose the appropriate software.   3. Choose the appropriate platform.   4. Enter a release number-for example, **9.16.2.11** for Cisco ASA Software or **6.6.7** for Cisco FTD Software.   5.

"text": "When considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security\_vulnerability\_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\nCisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software\r\nTo help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software, Cisco provides the Cisco Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"]. This tool identifies any Cisco security advisories that impact a specific software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities that are described in each advisory (“First Fixed”). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities that are described in all the advisories that the Software Checker identifies (“Combined First Fixed”).\r\n\r\nTo use the tool, go to the Cisco Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"] page and follow the instructions. Alternatively, use the following form to search for vulnerabilities that affect a specific software release. To use the form, follow these steps:\r\n\r\nChoose which advisories the tool will search—all advisories, only advisories with a Critical or High Security Impact Rating (SIR) [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security\_vulnerability\_policy.html#asr\"], or only this advisory.\r\nChoose the appropriate software.\r\nChoose the appropriate platform.\r\nEnter a release number—for example, 9.16.2.11 for Cisco ASA Software or 6.6.7 for Cisco FTD Software.\r\nClick Check.\r\n Only this advisoryAll Critical and High advisoriesAll advisoriesCisco ASA SoftwareCisco FMC SoftwareCisco FTD SoftwareAny Platform3000 Series Industrial Security Appliances (ISA)ASA 5500-X Series FirewallsASA Service ModuleAdaptive Security Virtual Appliance (ASAv)Firepower 1000 SeriesFirepower 2100 SeriesFirepower 4100 SeriesFirepower 9000 SeriesFirepower NGFW VirtualSecure Firewall 3100 SeriesFirepower Management Center Appliances\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor instructions on upgrading your FTD device, see Cisco Firepower Management Center Upgrade Guide [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/upgrade/fpmc-upgrade-guide/getting\_started.html\"].\r\n\r\n Additional Resources\r\nFor help determining the best Cisco ASA, FTD, or FMC Software release, see the following Recommended Releases documents.
