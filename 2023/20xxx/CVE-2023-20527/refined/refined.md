**Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper syscall input validation in the AMD Secure Processor (ASP) Bootloader.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Insufficient validation of syscall inputs. Specifically, the vulnerability is related to the bootloader of the ASP.

**Impact of exploitation:** A privileged attacker can read memory out-of-bounds leading to a potential denial-of-service.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a privileged attacker making use of a vulnerability in the bootloader of the ASP.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a privileged position to exploit this vulnerability. This implies the attacker would either need some level of system access or a malicious BIOS.
