Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-20251:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Memory leaks occur when multiple wireless clients attempt to connect to an access point (AP) under specific conditions, specifically when Random MAC Filtering is enabled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability lies in the memory buffer of Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) AireOS Software.
- Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered by the interaction of multiple client connection attempts and the Random MAC Filtering feature.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can cause memory leaks, eventually leading to a device reboot.
- This results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, disrupting the availability of the wireless network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is adjacent, meaning the attacker needs to be within the wireless range of the affected device.
- The attacker causes multiple wireless clients to attempt to connect to an AP on the vulnerable device, triggering memory leaks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be in an adjacent position, within wireless range, to the targeted Cisco WLC device.
- The attacker does not need authentication to trigger the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to have the capability to generate multiple wireless client connection requests.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability affects Cisco devices running vulnerable releases of Cisco WLC AireOS Software with Random MAC Filtering enabled, specifically Mobility Express and Virtual Wireless LAN Controller (vWLC).
- A workaround is available, which involves disabling the Random MAC Filtering feature using the CLI command "no local-admin-mac deny".
- Fixed software is available for vulnerable versions. Specifically, releases 8.10.150 to 8.10.185 are vulnerable, and the fix is included in 8.10.190.0.
- The vulnerability was discovered during the resolution of a Cisco TAC support case.
- The advisory includes a CVSS v3.1 base score of 6.1 (MEDIUM) with the vector string CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H.
