#### Issue/Introduction

To remediate VMSA-2023-0009, VMSA-2023-0020, VMSA-2024-0004 on VMware Cloud Foundation 4.x or 5.x environment follow the steps listed in the Workaround Section.

#### Environment

VMware Cloud Foundation 4.x

#### Resolution

To resolve the issue, please refer to the VMSA for specific versions of VMware Aria Operations in which the related issues have been resolved.

Workaround:
To workaround the issue, please follow the below mentioned steps:

Starting with VCF version 4.4, the SDDC Manager no longer manages the upgrades of VMware Aria Operations (even if it was originally deployed via SDDC Manager). Refer to [VMware Cloud Foundation 4.4 Release Notes](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Foundation/4.4/rn/vmware-cloud-foundation-44-release-notes/index.html) for more details. Interoperability between VMware Aria products and SDDC Manager is located at [Interoperability Matrix](https://interopmatrix.vmware.com/Interoperability?col=851,&row=0).

Use the VMware Aria Suite Lifecycle Manager to upgrade VMware Aria Operations to the fixed version mentioned in the VMSA depending upon the VMware Aria Operations version currently installed.

vRealize Operations 8.10 Hot Fix 4 can be applied to any 8.10 environment.
**Note**: Upgrading from older versions directly to this Hot Fix is not supported.  You must upgrade to 8.10 before applying this Hot Fix.

**Important**: Take snapshots of each of the vRealize Operations nodes before applying the Hot Fix by following [How to take a Snapshot of vRealize Operations](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2149269).

1. Download the [vRealize Operations 8.10 Hot Fix 4 PAK](https://support.broadcom.com/web/ecx/solutiondetails?patchId=184) file .

**Note**: Select **vRealize Operations Manager** as the **Product** and select **8.10** as the **version** and click **Search**.
Select the option below.

| Release Name | Release Date | Build Number | UI Build Number | File Name |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| vROps-8.10-HF4 | 5/11/2023 | 21553501 | 21553056 | vRealize\_Operations\_Manager\_With\_CP-8.x-to-8.10.2.21553501.pak |

2. Log in to the primary node vRealize Operations Manager Administrator interface of your cluster at https://master-node-FQDN-or-IP-address/admin.
3. Click **Software Update** in the left panel.
4. Click **Install a Software Update** in the main panel.
5. Follow the steps in the wizard to locate and install your PAK file.
6. Install the product update PAK file.
   Wait for the software update to complete. When it does, the Administrator interface logs you out.
7. Log back into the primary node Administrator interface.
   The main Cluster Status page appears and cluster goes online automatically. The status page also displays the Bring Online button, but do not click it.
8. Clear the browser caches and if the browser page does not refresh automatically, refresh the page.
   The cluster status changes to Going Online. When the cluster status changes to Online, the upgrade is complete.

   **Note**: If a cluster fails and the status changes to offline during the installation process of a PAK file update then some nodes become unavailable. To fix this, you can access the Administrator interface and manually take the cluster offline and click Finish Installation to continue the installation process.
9. Click **Software Update** to check that the update is done.
   A message indicating that the update completed successfully appears in the main pane.

Once the update is complete delete the snapshots you made before the software update.
