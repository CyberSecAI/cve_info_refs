## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |
| **Hours** | 24 hours a day, 7 days a week |

## Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco

There are several ways to stay connected and receive the latest security vulnerability information from Cisco. Customers should review the following table, and subsequent summaries, to determine the appropriate option for them:

| **Cisco.com** | <https://www.cisco.com/security/> |

| **My Notifications** | <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html> |

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

### **RSS Feeds**

Cisco security vulnerability information is also available via RSS feeds from Cisco.com. These feeds are free and do not require an active Cisco.com registration. For information on how to subscribe to the RSS feeds, visit the [Cisco Security RSS Feeds page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44).

### **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API**

The Cisco PSIRT openVuln application programming interface (API) is a RESTful API that conforms to the [representational state transfer](https://restfulapi.net/) (REST) software architectural style and allows customers to obtain Cisco security vulnerability information in different machine-consumable formats. To learn about accessing and using the API, visit the [PSIRT page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) on the Cisco DevNet website.

### **My Notifications**

The [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) allows registered Cisco.com users to subscribe to and receive important Cisco product and technology information, including Cisco Security Advisories. This service provides an improved unified subscription experience, allowing users to choose the timing of notifications as well as the notification delivery method (email or RSS feed). The level of access will be determined by the subscriber's relationship with Cisco.

### Creating a Notification

To create a notification, use the following steps:

1. Log in to the [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) on Cisco.com using a registered Cisco.com account name and password.

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

"text": "A vulnerability in the Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System (IS-IS) protocol of Cisco NX-OS Software for the Cisco Nexus 3000 Series Switches and Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause the IS-IS process to unexpectedly restart, which could cause an affected device to reload.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation when parsing an ingress IS-IS packet. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IS-IS packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition due to the unexpected restart of the IS-IS process, which could cause the affected device to reload.\r\n\r\nNote: The IS-IS protocol is a routing protocol. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be Layer 2 adjacent to the affected device.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis advisory is part of the August 2023 Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see Cisco Event Response: August 2023 Semiannual Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-75058\"]."

"text": "Cisco has released free software updates [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security\_vulnerability\_policy.html#ssu\"] that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.\r\n\r\nCustomers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nThe Cisco Support and Downloads page [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html\"] on Cisco.com provides information about licensing and downloads. This page can also display customer device support coverage for customers who use the My Devices tool.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security\_vulnerability\_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n Cisco NX-OS Software\r\nTo help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco NX-OS Software, Cisco provides the Cisco Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"]. This tool identifies any Cisco security advisories that impact a specific software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities that are described in each advisory (“First Fixed”). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities described in all the advisories that the Software Checker identifies (“Combined First Fixed”).\r\n\r\nTo use the tool, go to the Cisco Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"] page and follow the instructions. Alternatively, use the following form to search for vulnerabilities that affect a specific software release. To use the form, follow these steps:\r\n\r\nChoose which advisories the tool will search—only this advisory, only advisories with a Critical or High Security Impact Rating (SIR) [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security\_vulnerability\_policy.html#asr\"], or all advisories.\r\nChoose the appropriate software.\r\nChoose the appropriate platform.\r\nEnter a release number—for example, 7.0(3)I7(5) for Cisco Nexus 3000 Series Switches or 14.0(1h) for Cisco NX-OS Software in ACI mode.\r\nClick Check.\r\n\r\n Only this advisory All Critical and High advisories All advisories Cisco NX-OS Software Cisco NX-OS Software in ACI Mode Any Platform MDS 9000 Series Multilayer Switches Nexus 1000V Series Switches Nexus 3000 Series Switches Nexus 5000 Series Switches Nexus 6000 Series Switches Nexus 7000 Series Switches Nexus 9000 Series Switches\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Additional Resources\r\nFor help determining the best Cisco NX-OS Software release for a Cisco Nexus Switch, see the following Recommended Releases documents.

Bias-Free Language

### Bias-Free Language

The documentation set for this product strives to use bias-free language. For the purposes of this documentation set, bias-free is defined as language that does not imply discrimination based on age, disability, gender, racial identity, ethnic identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and intersectionality. Exceptions may be present in the documentation due to language that is hardcoded in the user interfaces of the product software, language used based on RFP documentation, or language that is used by a referenced third-party product.

## About IS-IS

IS-IS is an Interior
Gateway Protocol (IGP) based on Standardization (ISO)/International Engineering
Consortium (IEC) 10589.
Cisco NX-OS
supports Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) and IPv6. IS-IS is a dynamic
link-state routing protocol that can detect changes in the network topology and
calculate loop-free routes to other nodes in the network. Each router maintains
a link-state database that describes the state of the network and sends packets
on every configured link to discover neighbors. IS-IS floods the link-state
information across the network to each neighbor. The router also sends
advertisements and updates on the link-state database through all the existing
neighbors.

### IS-IS Overview

IS-IS sends a hello packet out every configured interface to discover
IS-IS neighbor routers. The hello packet contains information, such as the
authentication, area, and supported protocols, which the receiving interface
uses to determine compatibility with the originating interface. The hello
packets are also padded to ensure that IS-IS establishes adjacencies only with
interfaces that have matching maximum transmission unit (MTU) settings.
Compatible interfaces form adjacencies, which update routing information in the
link-state database through link-state update messages (LSPs). By default, the
router sends a periodic LSP refresh every 10 minutes and the LSPs remain in the
link-state database for 20 minutes (the LSP lifetime). If the router does not
receive an LSP refresh before the end of the LSP lifetime, the router deletes
the LSP from the database.

The LSP interval must be less than the LSP lifetime or the LSPs time out
before they are refreshed.

IS-IS sends periodic hello packets to adjacent routers. If you configure transient mode for hello packets, these hello packets
do not include the excess padding used before IS-IS establishes adjacencies. If the MTU value on adjacent routers changes,
IS-IS can detect this change and send padded hello packets for a period of time. IS-IS uses this feature to detect mismatched
MTU values on adjacent routers. For more information, see the [Configuring the Transient Mode for Hello Padding](#task_6A6AA2B1F3DC42BD977E0A24584837CE) section.

### IS-IS Areas

You can design IS-IS
networks as a single area that includes all routers in the network or as
multiple areas that connect into a backbone or Level 2 area. Routers in a
nonbackbone area are Level 1 routers that establish adjacencies within a local
area (intra-area routing). Level 2 area routers establish adjacencies to other
Level 2 routers and perform routing between Level 1 areas (inter-area routing).
A router can have both Level 1 and Level 2 areas configured. These Level
1/Level 2 routers act as area border routers that route information from the
local area to the Level 2 backbone area (see the figure below).

Within a Level 1 area,
routers know how to reach all other routers in that area. The Level 2 routers
know how to reach other area border routers and other Level 2 routers. Level
1/Level 2 routers straddle the boundary between two areas, routing traffic to
and from the Level 2 backbone area. Level1/Level2 routers use the attached
(ATT) bit signal Level 1 routers to set a default route to this Level1/Level2
router to connect to the Level 2 area.

In some instances, such as when you have two or more Level1/Level 2 routers in an area, you may want to control which Level1/Level2
router that the Level 1 routers use as the default route to the Level 2 area. You can configure which Level1/Level2 router
sets the attached bit. For more information, see the [Verifying the IS-IS Configuration](#task_6A6AA2B1F3DC42BD977E0A24584837CE) section.

Each IS-IS instance in
Cisco NX-OS
supports either a single Level 1 or Level 2 area, or one of each. By default,
all IS-IS instances automatically support Level 1 and Level 2 routing.

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/100001-200000/180001-190000/185001-186000/185054.eps/_jcr_content/renditions/185054.jpg)

An autonomous system
boundary router (ASBR) advertises external destinations throughout the IS-IS
autonomous system. External routes are the routes redistributed into IS-IS from
any other protocol.

### NET and System ID

Each IS-IS instance
has an associated network entity title (NET). The NET is comprised of the IS-IS
system ID, which uniquely identifies this IS-IS instance in the area and the
area ID. For example, if the NET is 47.0004.004d.0001.0001.0c11.1111.00, the
system ID is 0000.0c11.1111.00 and the area is ID 47.0004.004d.0001.

### Designated Intermediate System

IS-IS uses a
designated intermediate system (DIS) in broadcast networks to prevent each
router from forming unnecessary links with every other router on the broadcast
network. IS-IS routers send LSPs to the DIS, which manages all the link-state
information for the broadcast network. You can configure the IS-IS priority
that IS-IS uses to select the DIS in an area.

| **Note** | ---   No DIS is required on a point-to-point network.   --- |
| --- | --- |

## IS-IS Authentication

You can configure
authentication to control adjacencies and the exchange of LSPs. Routers that
want to become neighbors must exchange the same password for their configured
level of authentication. IS-IS blocks a router that does not have the correct
password. You can configure IS-IS authentication globally or for an individual
interface for Level 1, Level 2, or both Level 1/Level 2 routing.

IS-IS supports the
following authentication methods:

* Clear text—All
  packets exchanged carry a cleartext 128-bit password.
* MD5 digest—All
  packets exchanged carry a message digest that is based on a 128-bit key.

To provide protection
against passive attacks, IS-IS never sends the MD5 secret key as cleartext
through the network. In addition, IS-IS includes a sequence number in each
packet to protect against replay attacks.

You can use also keychains for hello and LSP authentication. See the [Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Security Configuration Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus9000/sw/7-x/security/configuration/guide/b_Cisco_Nexus_9000_Series_NX-OS_Security_Configuration_Guide_7x.html) for information on keychain management.

## Mesh Groups

A mesh group is a set
of interfaces in which all routers reachable over the interfaces have at least
one link to every other router. Many links can fail without isolating one or
more routers from the network.

In normal flooding, an
interface receives a new LSP and floods the LSP out over all other interfaces
on the router. With mesh groups, when an interface that is part of a mesh group
receives a new LSP, the interface does not flood the new LSP over the other
interfaces that are part of that mesh group.

| **Note** | ---   You may want to limit LSPs in certain mesh network topologies to improve network scalability. Limiting LSP floods might also reduce the reliability of the network (in case of failures). For this reason, we recommend that you use mesh groups only if specifically required, and then only after you make a careful network design.   --- |
| --- | --- |

You can also configure
mesh groups in block mode for parallel links between routers. In this mode, all
LSPs are blocked on that interface in a mesh group after the routers initially
exchange their link-state information.

## Overload Bit

IS-IS uses the
overload bit to tell other routers not to use the local router to forward
traffic but to continue routing traffic destined for that local router.

You may want to use
the overload bit in these situations:

* The router is in a
  critical condition.
* Graceful
  introduction and removal of the router to/from the network.
* Other
  (administrative or traffic engineering) reasons such as waiting for BGP
  convergence.

## Route Summarization

You can configure a
summary aggregate address. Route summarization simplifies route tables by
replacing a number of more-specific addresses with an address that represents
all the specific addresses. For example, you can replace 10.1.1.0/24,
10.1.2.0/24, and 10.1.3.0/24 with one summary address, 10.1.0.0/16.

If more specific
routes are in the routing table, IS-IS advertises the summary address with a
metric equal to the minimum metric of the more specific routes.

| **Note** | ---   Cisco NX-OS does not support automatic route summarization.   --- |
| --- | --- |

## Route Redistribution

You can use IS-IS to redistribute static routes, routes learned by other IS-IS autonomous systems, or routes from other protocols.
You must configure a route map with the redistribution to control which routes are passed into IS-IS. A route map allows you
to filter routes based on attributes such as the destination, origination protocol, route type, route tag, and so on. For
more information, see [Configuring Route Policy Manager](m_configuring_route_policy_manager.html#topic_BC12066193F94420A40BF34D8D86A81D).

Whenever you redistribute routes into an IS-IS routing domain, Cisco NX-OS does not, by default, redistribute the default route into the IS-IS routing domain. You can generate a default route into
IS-IS, which can be controlled by a route policy.

You also configure the default metric that is used for all imported routes into IS-IS.

## Link Prefix Suppression

By default, IS-IS advertises the addresses of connected interfaces in the system LSP. By
suppressing the advertisement of unwanted interface addresses, you can reduce the size
of LSPs and reduce the number of routes that IS-IS maintains, improving convergence
times.

Two prefix suppression methods are provided for reducing the number of routes in the
LSP:

* At the global level, you can choose to advertise only those prefixes that belong to passive
  interfaces, excluding other connected prefixes. See [Advertising Only Passive Interface Prefixes](#Cisco_Task.dita_678a87c7-fc00-4303-9dd2-d981a36bd7d3).
* At the interface level, you can disable the advertisement of connected prefixes. See [Suppressing Prefixes on an Interface](#Cisco_Task.dita_55e79d50-6731-4668-8f60-86503f32b838).

## Load Balancing

You can use load
balancing to allow a router to distribute traffic over all the router network
ports that are the same distance from the destination address. Load balancing
increases the utilization of network segments and increases the effective
network bandwidth.

Cisco NX-OS
supports the Equal Cost Multiple Paths (ECMP) feature with up to 16 equal-cost
paths in the IS-IS route table and the unicast RIB. You can configure IS-IS to
load balance traffic across some or all of those paths.

## BFD

This feature supports bidirectional forwarding detection (BFD) for IPv4 and IPv6. BFD is a detection protocol designed to
provide fast forwarding-path failure detection times. BFD provides subsecond failure detection between two adjacent devices
and can be less CPU-intensive than protocol hello messages because some of the BFD load can be distributed onto the data plane
on supported modules. See the [Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Interfaces Configuration Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus9000/sw/7-x/interfaces/configuration/guide/b_Cisco_Nexus_9000_Series_NX-OS_Interfaces_Configuration_Guide_7x.html) for more information.

## Virtualization Support

Cisco NX-OS supports multiple process instances for IS-IS. Each IS-IS instance can support multiple virtual routing and forwarding (VRF)
instances, up to the system limit. For the number of supported IS-IS instances, see the [Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Verified Scalability Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus9000/sw/7-x/scalability/guide_703I21/b_Cisco_Nexus_9000_Series_NX-OS_Verified_Scalability_Guide_703I21.html).

## High Availability and Graceful Restart

Cisco NX-OS
provides a multilevel high-availability architecture. IS-IS supports stateful
restart, which is also referred to as non-stop routing (NSR). If IS-IS
experiences problems, it attempts to restart from its previous run-time state.
The neighbors would not register any neighbor event in this case. If the first
restart is not successful and another problem occurs, IS-IS attempts a graceful
restart as per RFC 3847. A graceful restart, or non-stop forwarding (NSF),
allows IS-IS to remain in the data forwarding path through a process restart.
When the restarting IS-IS interface is operational again, it rediscovers its
neighbors, establishes adjacency, and starts sending its updates again. At this
point, the NSF helpers recognize that the graceful restart has finished.

A stateful restart is
used in the following scenarios:

* First recovery
  attempt after process experiences problems
* User-initiated
  switchover using the
  system
  switchover  command

A graceful restart is
used in the following scenarios:

* Second recovery
  attempt after the process experiences problems within a 4-minute interval
* Manual restart of
  the process using the
  restart
  isis  command
* Active supervisor
  removal
* Active supervisor
  reload using the
  reload module
  active-sup
  command

| **Note** | ---   Graceful restart is on by default, and we strongly recommend that you do not disable it.   --- |
| --- | --- |

## Multiple IS-IS Instances

Cisco NX-OS supports multiple instances of the IS-IS protocol that run on the same node. You cannot configure multiple instances over
the same interface. Every instance uses the same system router ID. For the number of supported IS-IS instances, see the [Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Verified Scalability Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus9000/sw/7-x/scalability/guide_703I21/b_Cisco_Nexus_9000_Series_NX-OS_Verified_Scalability_Guide_703I21.html).

## Prerequisites for IS-IS

IS-IS has the
following prerequisites:

* You must enable IS-IS (see the [Enabling the IS-IS Feature](#task_E08F39DFFA124E5587374E0796AD04FB) section).

## Guidelines and Limitations for IS-IS

IS-IS has the following configuration guidelines and limitations:

* IS-IS Level-1 routes do not populate on the connecting Level-2-only switch if an explicit configuration is not added to the
  Level-1/Level-2 Cisco Nexus switch.
* Because the default reference bandwidth is different for Cisco NX-OS and Cisco IOS, the advertised tunnel IS-IS metric is
  different for these two operating systems.
* You can configure IS-IS over segment routing for all Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches and the Cisco Nexus 3164Q and 31128PQ
  switches. For information, see the [Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Label Switching Configuration Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus9000/sw/7-x/label-switching/configuration/guide/b_Cisco_Nexus_9000_Series_NX-OS_Label_Switching_Configuration_Guide_7x.html).

### Configuring a Mesh Group

You can add an
interface to a mesh group to limit the amount of LSP flooding for interfaces in
that mesh group. You can optionally block all LSP flooding on an interface in a
mesh group.

To add an interface
to a mesh group, use the following command in interface configuration mode:

### SUMMARY STEPS

1. isis
   mesh-group {blocked |
   mesh-id}

### DETAILED STEPS

| Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| isis mesh-group {blocked | mesh-id}  Example: ``` switch(config-if)# isis mesh-group 1 ``` | Adds this interface to a mesh group. The range is from 1 to 4294967295. |

### Configuring a Designated Intermediate System

You can configure a
router to become the designated intermediate system (DIS) for a multiaccess
network by setting the interface priority.

To configure the
DIS, use the following command in interface configuration mode:

### SUMMARY STEPS

1. isis priority
   number
   {level-1 |
   level-2}

### DETAILED STEPS

| Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| isis priority number {level-1 | level-2}  Example: ``` switch(config-if)# isis priority 100 level-1 ``` | Sets the priority for DIS selection. The range is from 0 to 127. The default is 64. |

### Configuring Dynamic Host Exchange

You can configure
IS-IS to map between the system ID and the hostname for a router using dynamic
host exchange.

To configure dynamic
host exchange, use the following command in router configuration mode:

### SUMMARY STEPS

1. hostname
   dynamic

### DETAILED STEPS

| Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| hostname dynamic  Example: ``` switch(config-router)# hostname dynamic ``` | Enables dynamic host exchange. |

### Setting the Overload Bit

You can configure
the router to signal other routers not to use this router as an intermediate
hop in their shortest path first (SPF) calculations. You can optionally
configure the overload bit temporarily on startup, until BGP converges.

In addition to
setting the overload bit, you might also want to suppress certain types of IP
prefix advertisements from LSPs for Level 1 or Level 2 traffic.

To set the overload
bit, use the following command in router configuration mode:

### SUMMARY STEPS

1. set-overload-bit {always |
   on-startup {seconds |
   wait-for
   bgp
   as-number}} [suppress [interlevel |
   external]]

### DETAILED STEPS

| Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| set-overload-bit {always | on-startup {seconds | wait-for bgp as-number}} [suppress [interlevel | external]]  Example: ``` switch(config-router)# set-overload-bit on-startup 30 ``` | Sets the overload bit for IS-IS. The seconds range is from 5 to 86400. |

### Configuring the Attached Bit

You can configure
the attached bit to control which Level 1/Level 2 router that the Level 1
routers use as the default route to the Level 2 area. If you disable setting
the attached bit, the Level 1 routers do not use this Level 1/Level 2 router to
reach the Level 2 area.

To configure the
attached bit for a Level 1/Level 2 router, use the following command in router
configuration mode:

### SUMMARY STEPS

1. [no]
   set-attached-bit

### DETAILED STEPS

| Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [no] set-attached-bit  Example: ``` switch(config-router)# no attached-bit ``` | Configures the Level 1/Level 2 router to set the attached bit. This feature is enabled by default. |

### Configuring the Transient Mode for Hello Padding

You can configure
the transient mode for hello padding to pad hello packets when IS-IS
establishes adjacency and remove that padding after IS-IS establishes
adjacency.

To configure the
mode for hello padding, use the following command in interface configuration
mode:

### SUMMARY STEPS

1. [no]
   isis
   hello-padding

### DETAILED STEPS

| Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [no] isis hello-padding  Example: ``` switch(config-if)# no isis hello-padding ``` | Pads the hello packet to the full maximum transmission unit (MTU). The default is enabled. Use the no  form of this command to configure the transient mode of hello padding. |

### Configuring a Summary Address

You can create
aggregate addresses that are represented in the routing table by a summary
address. One summary address can include multiple groups of addresses for a
given level.
Cisco NX-OS

switch(config-router-af)# copy running-config startup-config

```

### Limiting the Number of Redistributed Routes

Route redistribution
can add many routes to the IS-IS route table. You can configure a maximum limit
to the number of routes accepted from external protocols. IS-IS provides the
following options to configure redistributed route limits:

* Fixed limit—Logs
  a message when IS-IS reaches the configured maximum. IS-IS does not accept any
  more redistributed routes. You can optionally configure a threshold percentage
  of the maximum where IS-IS logs a warning when that threshold is passed.
* Warning
  only—Logs a warning only when IS-IS reaches the maximum. IS-IS continues to
  accept redistributed routes.
* Withdraw—Starts
  the timeout period when IS-IS reaches the maximum. After the timeout period,
  IS-IS requests all redistributed routes if the current number of redistributed
  routes is less than the maximum limit. If the current number of redistributed
  routes is at the maximum limit, IS-IS withdraws all redistributed routes. You
  must clear this condition before IS-IS accepts more redistributed routes. You
  can optionally configure the timeout period.

#### Before you begin

You must enable
IS-IS.

| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCisco Nexus 3000 and 9000 Series Switches IS-IS Protocol Denial of Service Vulnerability High   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-nxos-n3\_9k-isis-dos-FTCXB4Vb  First Published: 2023 August 23 16:00 GMT  Version 1.0:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  No workarounds available  Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCwe11136](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwe11136)     CVE-2023-20169     CWE-788       CVSS Score: [Base 7.4](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=3.1&vector=CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X       CVE-2023-20169     CWE-788       [Download CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-nxos-n3_9k-isis-dos-FTCXB4Vb/csaf/cisco-sa-nxos-n3_9k-isis-dos-FTCXB4Vb.json)   Email      Summary  * A vulnerability in the Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System (IS-IS) protocol of Cisco NX-OS Software for the Cisco Nexus 3000 Series Switches and Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause the IS-IS process to unexpectedly restart, which could cause an affected device to reload.  This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation when parsing an ingress IS-IS packet. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IS-IS packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition due to the unexpected restart of the IS-IS process, which could cause the affected device to reload.  **Note:** The IS-IS protocol is a routing protocol. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be Layer 2 adjacent to the affected device.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-nxos-n3_9k-isis-dos-FTCXB4Vb>  This advisory is part of the August 2023 Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see [Cisco Event Response: August 2023 Semiannual Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-75058).  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products if they are running Cisco NX-OS Software Release 10.3(2) and the IS-IS protocol is enabled on the software:    + Nexus 3000 Series Switches   + Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. Determine Whether IS-IS Protocol is Enabled To determine the IS-IS protocol configuration of Cisco Nexus 3000 Series Switches and 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode, use the **show running-config | include isis** CLI command. If the configuration commands **feature isis, router isis** *name*and at least one instance of **ip router isis** *name*are present, the IS-IS protocol is enabled on at least one interface, as shown in the following example:  ```   # show running-config | include isisfeature isis...ip router isis namerouter isis name   ```    Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:    + Firepower 1000 Series   + Firepower 2100 Series   + Firepower 4100 Series   + Firepower 9300 Security Appliances   + MDS 9000 Series Multilayer Switches   + Nexus 1000 Virtual Edge for VMware vSphere   + Nexus 1000V Switch for Microsoft Hyper-V   + Nexus 1000V Switch for VMware vSphere   + Nexus 5500 Platform Switches   + Nexus 5600 Platform Switches   + Nexus 6000 Series Switches   + Nexus 7000 Series Switches   + Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches in ACI mode   + Secure Firewall 3100 Series   + UCS 6200 Series Fabric Interconnects   + UCS 6300 Series Fabric Interconnects   + UCS 6400 Series Fabric Interconnects   + UCS 6500 Series Fabric Interconnects  Details  * A device that is configured for IS-IS authentication can still be affected by this vulnerability.

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |
| **Hours** | 24 hours a day, 7 days a week |

They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

Bias-Free Language

### Bias-Free Language

The documentation set for this product strives to use bias-free language. For the purposes of this documentation set, bias-free is defined as language that does not imply discrimination based on age, disability, gender, racial identity, ethnic identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and intersectionality. Exceptions may be present in the documentation due to language that is hardcoded in the user interfaces of the product software, language used based on RFP documentation, or language that is used by a referenced third-party product.

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |
| **Hours** | 24 hours a day, 7 days a week |

## Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco

There are several ways to stay connected and receive the latest security vulnerability information from Cisco. Customers should review the following table, and subsequent summaries, to determine the appropriate option for them:

| **Cisco.com** | <https://www.cisco.com/security/> |

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

### **RSS Feeds**

Cisco security vulnerability information is also available via RSS feeds from Cisco.com. These feeds are free and do not require an active Cisco.com registration. For information on how to subscribe to the RSS feeds, visit the [Cisco Security RSS Feeds page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44).

### **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API**

The Cisco PSIRT openVuln application programming interface (API) is a RESTful API that conforms to the [representational state transfer](https://restfulapi.net/) (REST) software architectural style and allows customers to obtain Cisco security vulnerability information in different machine-consumable formats. To learn about accessing and using the API, visit the [PSIRT page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) on the Cisco DevNet website.

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |
| **Hours** | 24 hours a day, 7 days a week |

## Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco

There are several ways to stay connected and receive the latest security vulnerability information from Cisco. Customers should review the following table, and subsequent summaries, to determine the appropriate option for them:

| **Cisco.com** | <https://www.cisco.com/security/> |

| **My Notifications** | <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html> |

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

### **RSS Feeds**

Cisco security vulnerability information is also available via RSS feeds from Cisco.com. These feeds are free and do not require an active Cisco.com registration. For information on how to subscribe to the RSS feeds, visit the [Cisco Security RSS Feeds page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44).

### **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API**

The Cisco PSIRT openVuln application programming interface (API) is a RESTful API that conforms to the [representational state transfer](https://restfulapi.net/) (REST) software architectural style and allows customers to obtain Cisco security vulnerability information in different machine-consumable formats. To learn about accessing and using the API, visit the [PSIRT page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) on the Cisco DevNet website.

### **My Notifications**

The [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) allows registered Cisco.com users to subscribe to and receive important Cisco product and technology information, including Cisco Security Advisories. This service provides an improved unified subscription experience, allowing users to choose the timing of notifications as well as the notification delivery method (email or RSS feed). The level of access will be determined by the subscriber's relationship with Cisco.

### Creating a Notification

To create a notification, use the following steps:

1. Log in to the [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) on Cisco.com using a registered Cisco.com account name and password.

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

## Minimum Recommended Cisco NX-OS Releases for Cisco Nexus 5600 Series Switches ---

 **Date: February 13, 2023**

This document lists the minimum recommended Cisco NX-OS software release for use with Cisco Nexus 5600 Series switches for both new deployments and existing deployments. Since these are minimum release recommendations, more recent software releases can be used to take advantage of newer hardware and software capabilities. These recommendations are general and should not replace environment specific design review efforts.

 **General Recommendation for New Deployments**

Cisco recommends that customers with new Cisco Nexus 5600 Series deployments choose from the following minimum recommended releases:

Table 1 Cisco Nexus 5600 Recommended Releases

| Platform Series/Product Name | Minimum Recommended Release | Recommended Release |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Nexus 5624Q Switch | NX-OS 7.3(8)N1(1) | NX-OS 7.3(13)N1(1) |
| Cisco Nexus 5648Q Switch | NX-OS 7.3(8)N1(1) | NX-OS 7.3(13)N1(1) |
| Cisco Nexus 5696Q Switch | NX-OS 7.3(8)N1(1) | NX-OS 7.3(13)N1(1) |
| Cisco Nexus 56128P Switch | NX-OS 7.3(8)N1(1) | NX-OS 7.3(13)N1(1) |
| Cisco Nexus 5672UP Switch | NX-OS 7.3(8)N1(1) | NX-OS 7.3(13)N1(1) |
| Cisco Nexus 5672-16G Switch | NX-OS 7.3(8)N1(1) | NX-OS 7.3(13)N1(1) |

 **Existing Deployments That Use Software Earlier Than One of the Recommended Releases**

To the extent possible, Cisco recommends upgrading to one of the NX-OS releases listed previously. If that is not possible, Cisco recommends that you review the  [Cisco NX-OS Release Notes](//www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps9670/prod_release_notes_list.html)  for the earlier release and the Bug Tool Kit to determine the impact of any open caveats.

Documentation and Software

| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: Low C: High C: None  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: Low A: High A: None  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 7.4 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Unproven   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Not Defined  RC: Confirmed   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 7.4 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High  CR: Not Defined   Select Confidentiality Requirement Parameters  Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Select Integrity Requirement Parameters  Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High  AR: Not Defined   Select Availability Requirement Parameters  Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Vector Parameters  Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Complexity Parameters  Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Select Modified Privileges Required Parameters  Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Select Modified User Interaction Parameters  Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Select Modified Scope Parameters  Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Select Modified Confidentiality Parameters  Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Select Modified Integrity Parameters  Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined   Select Modified Availability Parameters    Environmental Score: 7.4 |
