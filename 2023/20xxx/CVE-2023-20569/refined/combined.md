CVE ID         : CVE-2022-40982 CVE-2023-20569

CVE-2022-40982

    Daniel Moghimi discovered Gather Data Sampling (GDS), a hardware
    vulnerability for Intel CPUs which allows unprivileged speculative
    access to data which was previously stored in vector registers.

    This mitigation requires updated CPU microcode provided in the
    intel-microcode package.

    For details please refer to <<https://downfall.page/>> and
    <<https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/software-security-guidance/technical-documentation/gather-data-sampling.html>>.

CVE-2023-20569

    Daniel Trujillo, Johannes Wikner and Kaveh Razavi discovered
    INCEPTION, also known as Speculative Return Stack Overflow (SRSO),
    a transient execution attack that leaks arbitrary data on all AMD
    Zen CPUs. An attacker can mis-train the CPU BTB to predict non-
    architectural CALL instructions in kernel space and use this to
    control the speculative target of a subsequent kernel RET,
    potentially leading to information disclosure via a speculative
    side-channel.

    For details please refer to
    <<https://comsec.ethz.ch/research/microarch/inception/>> and
    <<https://www.amd.com/en/corporate/product-security/bulletin/amd-sb-7005>>.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
5.10.179-5~deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-5.10 packages.

For the detailed security status of linux-5.10 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux-5.10>

# Inception: how a simple XOR can cause a Microarchitectural Stack Overflow

Over the past one and a half years, we have studied two phenomena that enable an unprivileged attacker to leak arbitrary information on all modern AMD CPUs:

* **Phantom speculation:** We can trigger misprediction without any branch at the source of the misprediction.
* **Training in Transient Execution:** We can manipulate future mispredictions through a previous misprediction that we trigger.

Putting the two together gives rise to a new type of attack called **Inception**: we can inject future mispredictions through a previous misprediction that we trigger — in the absence of branches. You can see a demo of Inception and find more information about the issues below:

---

## Inception

Inception ([CVE-2023-20569](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-20569)) is a novel transient execution attack that leaks arbitrary data on all AMD Zen CPUs in the presence of all previously deployed software- and hardware mitigations. As in the movie of the same name, Inception plants an “idea” in the CPU while it is in a sense “dreaming”, to make it take wrong actions based on supposedly self conceived experiences. Using this approach, Inception hijacks the transient control-flow of return instructions on all AMD Zen CPUs.

## Training in Transient Execution (TTE)

Inception is an instance of a new class of transient execution attacks that do their Training in Transient Execution (TTE). Instead of attempting to leak data in a transient window, TTE attacks abuse the transient window to insert new predictions into the branch predictor instead. These newly inserted predictions trigger future transient windows which can be more powerful than the initial one. TTE attacks thus turn supposedly harmless transient windows into dangerous ones, by abusing the victim as a confused deputy that trains itself in a transient window.

## Phantom speculation

Although TTE attacks are interesting, they are not necessarily trivial to pull off, due to the need for specific gadgets in the victim code. Instead of these hard-to-find gadgets, what if there was an easier way to achieve a transient window for training? This is where **Phantom speculation** comes in. Phantom ([CVE-2022-23825](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-23825)) enables an attacker to create a transient window at *arbitrary instructions*. Suddenly, a seemingly harmless XOR instruction can behave like a call instruction, and allow the attacker to create a transient window.

## Inception: A Combination of TTE and Phantom

During our research, we found that merely a prediction for a specific instruction already manipulates the branch predictor. This enables us to insert new predictions in the branch predictor using only predictions of branches, even if they do not match reality, i.e. using a non-existing Phantom control flow. With Phantom, we can thus enable TTE by turning the CPU into a confused deputy that trains itself while running the victim.  The result of this insight is Inception, an attack that leaks arbitrary data from an unprivileged process on all AMD Zen CPUs. Inception makes the CPU believe that a XOR instruction is a recursive call instruction which overflows the return stack buffer with an attacker-controlled target.

## Mitigations

To fully mitigate Inception, the branch predictor state has to be fully flushed while switching between distrusting contexts. We found that on Zen 1(+) and Zen 2, this comes with a hefty overhead between 93.1% and 216.9%, depending on the specific microarchitecture. On Zen 3 and Zen 4, we did not find proper hardware support to flush the entire branch predictor state. AMD have released microcode to enable this feature.

Instead of flushing the entire branch predictor state, AMD proposed a different mitigation for the Linux kernel. By reducing all returns in the kernel to a single one, it becomes possible to ensure a safe (but still incorrect) branch predictor state each time this return is executed. Keeping [previous mitigations](https://support.google.com/faqs/answer/7625886) in mind, this effectively means that AMD opted to have all indirect branches forcibly mispredict to a benign location, preventing Inception attacks.

## Resources

A [paper](/wp-content/files/inception_sec23.pdf) about Inception is going to be presented at [USENIX Security 2023](/wp-content/files/inception_sec22.pdf) and a [paper](/wp-content/files/phantom_micro23.pdf) about Phantom speculation is going to be presented at [MICRO 2023](https://microarch.org/micro56/). You can find the source code of Inception on our [Github](https://github.com/comsec-group/inception). We will publish the source code of Phantom at a later date.

## FAQ

* ****Is my machine affected?****

  If it embodies an AMD CPU, your machine is vulnerable to Inception and Phantom.
* **What is the difference between Inception and Phantom?**

  Inception leverages Training in Transient Execution (TTE) to add malicious branch prediction targets to the branch predictor. Phantom allows for triggering transient windows from arbitrary instructions, facilitating TTE and enabling Inception attacks.
* **Does Inception affect CPUs other than AMD?**

  No, but our analysis shows that Intel CPUs are vulnerable to certain TTE variants. While this certainly increases the known attack surface of transient execution attacks, it remains to be seen whether practical exploitation is possible on Intel CPUs.
* **Does Phantom affect CPUs other than AMD?**

  Yes, our analysis shows that Phantom also affects CPUs from Intel. However, the eIBRS mitigation makes Phantom exploitation non-trivial on these CPUs.
* **Are only Linux systems affected?**

  Although our proof-of-concept attacks require the system to be running Linux, Inception and Phantom fundamentally exploit vulnerabilities in the hardware. Therefore, any system with an affected CPU can potentially be the target of a Phantom or Inception attack, regardless of the running software.
* **What should I do?**

  Install the latest operating system updates.

# Return Address Security Bulletin

**Bulletin ID:â¯**AMD-SB-7005

**Potential Impact:**Â Data Confidentiality

**Severity:** Medium

## Summary

AMD has received an external report titled âINCEPTIONâ, describing a new speculative side channel attack. The attack can result in speculative execution at an attacker-controlled address, potentially leading to information disclosure. This attack is similar to previous branch prediction-based attacks like Spectrev2 and Branch Type Confusion (BTC)/RetBleed. As with similar attacks, speculation is constrained within the current address space and to exploit, an attacker must have knowledge of the address space and control of sufficient registers at the time of RET (return from procedure) speculation. Hence, AMD believes this vulnerability is only potentially exploitable locally, such as via downloaded malware, and recommends customers employ security best practices, including running up-to-date software and malware detection tools.

AMD is not aware of any exploit of âInceptionâ outside the research environment at this time.

[Refer to Glossary for explanation of terms](/content/dam/amd/en/documents/resources/glossary-of-terms.pdf)

## CVE Details

CVE-2023-20569

A side channel vulnerability in some of the AMD CPUs may allow an attacker to influence the return address prediction. This may result in speculative execution at an attacker-controlledÂ instruction pointer register, potentially leading to information disclosure.

## Mitigation

AMD recommends customers apply either the standalone Âµcode patch or a BIOS update that incorporates the Âµcode patch, as applicable, for products based on âZen 3â and âZen 4â CPU architectures. AMD plans to release updated AGESAâ¢ versions to Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM), Original Design Manufacturers (ODM) and motherboard manufacturers (MB) on the target dates listed below. Please refer to your OEM, ODM, or MB for a BIOS update specific to your product, which will follow after the dates listed below, as applicable. No Âµcode patch or BIOS update, which includes the Âµcode patch, is necessary for products based on âZenâ or âZen 2â CPU architectures because these architectures are already designed to flush branch type predictions from the branch predictor.

Operating system (OS) configuration options may also be available to help mitigate certain aspects of this vulnerability.Â AMD recommends users evaluate their risk environment (including the risk of running untrusted local code) when deciding on OS mitigation options and refer to OS-specific documentation for guidance. âZen 3â and âZen 4â based systems will require the Âµcode patch, which is incorporated in the BIOS update, prior to enabling OS configuration options.

#### Datacenter

Apply either Âµcode patch or AGESA firmware. When released, the AGESAâ¢ firmware will include the Âµcode patches.

Package        : linux
CVE ID         : CVE-2022-40982 CVE-2023-20569

CVE-2022-40982

    Daniel Moghimi discovered Gather Data Sampling (GDS), a hardware
    vulnerability for Intel CPUs which allows unprivileged speculative
    access to data which was previously stored in vector registers.

    This mitigation requires updated CPU microcode provided in the
    intel-microcode package.

    For details please refer to
    <<https://downfall.page/>> and
    <<https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/software-security-guidance/technical-documentation/gather-data-sampling.html>>.

CVE-2023-20569

    Daniel Trujillo, Johannes Wikner and Kaveh Razavi discovered
    INCEPTION, also known as Speculative Return Stack Overflow (SRSO),
    a transient execution attack that leaks arbitrary data on all AMD
    Zen CPUs. An attacker can mis-train the CPU BTB to predict non-
    architectural CALL instructions in kernel space and use this to
    control the speculative target of a subsequent kernel RET,
    potentially leading to information disclosure via a speculative
    side-channel.

    For details please refer to
    <<https://comsec.ethz.ch/research/microarch/inception/>> and
    <<https://www.amd.com/en/corporate/product-security/bulletin/amd-sb-7005>>.

For the oldstable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed
in version 5.10.179-5.

For the stable distribution (bookworm), these problems have been fixed in
version 6.1.38-4.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

# Return Address Security Bulletin

**Bulletin ID:â¯**AMD-SB-7005

**Potential Impact:**Â Data Confidentiality

**Severity:** Medium

## Summary

AMD has received an external report titled âINCEPTIONâ, describing a new speculative side channel attack. The attack can result in speculative execution at an attacker-controlled address, potentially leading to information disclosure. This attack is similar to previous branch prediction-based attacks like Spectrev2 and Branch Type Confusion (BTC)/RetBleed. As with similar attacks, speculation is constrained within the current address space and to exploit, an attacker must have knowledge of the address space and control of sufficient registers at the time of RET (return from procedure) speculation. Hence, AMD believes this vulnerability is only potentially exploitable locally, such as via downloaded malware, and recommends customers employ security best practices, including running up-to-date software and malware detection tools.

AMD is not aware of any exploit of âInceptionâ outside the research environment at this time.

[Refer to Glossary for explanation of terms](/content/dam/amd/en/documents/resources/glossary-of-terms.pdf)

## CVE Details

CVE-2023-20569

A side channel vulnerability in some of the AMD CPUs may allow an attacker to influence the return address prediction. This may result in speculative execution at an attacker-controlledÂ instruction pointer register, potentially leading to information disclosure.

## Mitigation

AMD recommends customers apply either the standalone Âµcode patch or a BIOS update that incorporates the Âµcode patch, as applicable, for products based on âZen 3â and âZen 4â CPU architectures. AMD plans to release updated AGESAâ¢ versions to Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM), Original Design Manufacturers (ODM) and motherboard manufacturers (MB) on the target dates listed below. Please refer to your OEM, ODM, or MB for a BIOS update specific to your product, which will follow after the dates listed below, as applicable. No Âµcode patch or BIOS update, which includes the Âµcode patch, is necessary for products based on âZenâ or âZen 2â CPU architectures because these architectures are already designed to flush branch type predictions from the branch predictor.

Operating system (OS) configuration options may also be available to help mitigate certain aspects of this vulnerability.Â AMD recommends users evaluate their risk environment (including the risk of running untrusted local code) when deciding on OS mitigation options and refer to OS-specific documentation for guidance. âZen 3â and âZen 4â based systems will require the Âµcode patch, which is incorporated in the BIOS update, prior to enabling OS configuration options.

#### Datacenter

Apply either Âµcode patch or AGESA firmware. When released, the AGESAâ¢ firmware will include the Âµcode patches.

            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2023-20569 / XSA-434

               x86/AMD: Speculative Return Stack Overflow

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

Researchers from ETH Zurich have extended their prior research (XSA-422,
Branch Type Confusion, a.k.a Retbleed) and have discovered INCEPTION,
also know as RAS (Return Address Stack) Poisoning, and Speculative
Return Stack Overflow.

The RAS is updated when a CALL instruction is predicted, rather than at
a later point in the pipeline.  However, the RAS is still fundamentally
a circular stack.

It is possible to poison the branch type and target predictions such
that, at a point of the attackers choosing, the branch predictor
predicts enough CALLs back-to-back to wrap around the entire RAS and
overwrite a correct return prediction with one of the attackers
choosing.

This allows the attacker to control RET speculation in a victim context,
and leak arbitrary data as a result.

For more details, see:
  <https://comsec.ethz.ch/inception>
  <https://www.amd.com/en/corporate/product-security/bulletin/amd-sb-7005>

IMPACT
======

An attacker might be able to infer the contents of memory belonging to
other guests.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Only CPUs from AMD are believed to be potentially vulnerable.  CPUs from
other manufacturers are not believed to be impacted.

At the time of writing, all in-support AMD CPUs (that is, Zen1 thru Zen4
microarchitectures) are believed to be potentially vulnerable.  Older
CPUs have not been analysed.

By default following XSA-422, Xen mitigates BTC on AMD Zen2 and older
CPUs by issuing an IBPB on entry to Xen.  On Zen2 and older CPUs, this
is believed to be sufficient to protect against SRSO too.

AMD Zen3 and Zen4 CPUs are susceptible to SRSO too.  All versions of Xen
are vulnerable on these CPUs.

MITIGATION
==========

On Zen3 and Zen4, there is no mitigation.

RESOLUTION
==========

AMD are producing microcode updates for Zen3 and Zen4.  Consult your
dom0 OS vendor.

With the microcode update applied, booting Xen with
`spec-ctrl=ibpb-entry` is sufficient to protect against SRSO.

The appropriate set of patches will default to using IBPB-on-entry on
Zen3 and Zen4 CPUs, as well as synthesise new CPUID bits for guests to
use in order to determine their susceptibility in a migration-safe way.

The patches for this issue interact texturally but not logically with
the fixes for XSA-435, which itself has complexities.  See XSA-435 for
details of how to obtain the fixes.

The RAS is updated when a CALL instruction is predicted, rather than at
a later point in the pipeline.  However, the RAS is still fundamentally
a circular stack.

It is possible to poison the branch type and target predictions such
that, at a point of the attackers choosing, the branch predictor
predicts enough CALLs back-to-back to wrap around the entire RAS and
overwrite a correct return prediction with one of the attackers
choosing.

This allows the attacker to control RET speculation in a victim context,
and leak arbitrary data as a result.

IMPACT
======

An attacker might be able to infer the contents of memory belonging to
other guests.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Only CPUs from AMD are believed to be potentially vulnerable.  CPUs from
other manufacturers are not believed to be impacted.

At the time of writing, all in-support AMD CPUs (that is, Zen1 thru Zen4
microarchitectures) are believed to be potentially vulnerable.  Older
CPUs have not been analysed.

By default following XSA-422, Xen mitigates BTC on AMD Zen2 and older
CPUs by issuing an IBPB on entry to Xen.  On Zen2 and older CPUs, this
is believed to be sufficient to protect against SRSO too.

AMD Zen3 and Zen4 CPUs are susceptible to SRSO too.  All versions of Xen
are vulnerable on these CPUs.

MITIGATION
==========

On Zen3 and Zen4, there is no mitigation.

RESOLUTION
==========

AMD are producing microcode updates for Zen3 and Zen4.  Consult your
dom0 OS vendor.

With the microcode update applied, booting Xen with
`spec-ctrl=ibpb-entry` is sufficient to protect against SRSO.

The appropriate set of patches will default to using IBPB-on-entry on
Zen3 and Zen4 CPUs, as well as synthesise new CPUID bits for guests to
use in order to determine their susceptibility in a migration-safe way.

The patches for this issue interact texturally but not logically with
the fixes for XSA-435, which itself has complexities.  See XSA-435 for
details of how to obtain the fixes.
