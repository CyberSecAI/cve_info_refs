  "CVE-2023-20569": {
    "description": "A side channel vulnerability in some of the AMD CPUs may allow an attacker to influence the return address prediction. This may result in speculative execution at an attacker-controlled instruction pointer register, potentially leading to information disclosure.",
    "affected_components": [
      "AMD Zen CPUs",
      "Debian Linux Kernel",
        "NetApp Products incorporating Debian"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The Return Address Stack (RAS) is updated when a CALL instruction is predicted, which can be manipulated by an attacker to overwrite correct return predictions by mis-training the CPU BTB. This is known as Inception or Speculative Return Stack Overflow (SRSO)",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Speculative execution",
      "Side-channel attack",
      "Branch prediction manipulation",
      "Transient execution attack"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can cause speculative execution at an attacker-controlled address, potentially leading to information disclosure, including leaking arbitrary data in memory.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access",
      "Malware/untrusted code execution"
    ],
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to mis-train the CPU branch target buffer (BTB) to predict non-architectural CALL instructions in kernel space, and use this to control the speculative target of a subsequent kernel RET. Requires knowledge of the address space and control of registers at the time of RET speculation."
,
    "additional_information": [
      "Affects all AMD Zen CPUs (Zen 1 to Zen 4 microarchitectures).",
      "Intel CPUs are not believed to be impacted.",
      "Mitigation involves microcode updates and OS configuration changes.",
        "NetApp products incorporate Debian and thus certain products may be vulnerable to this issue.",
        "Xen hypervisor is vulnerable on Zen 3 and Zen 4 CPUs, with no mitigation without microcode updates. Xen mitigates BTC on AMD Zen2 and older CPUs via IBPB on entry which is also believed to protect against SRSO on these CPUs"
    ],
      "remediation": "Apply either a standalone microcode patch or a BIOS update that incorporates the microcode patch. Also, Operating system (OS) configuration options may also be available. Some systems require the microcode patch, which is incorporated in the BIOS update, prior to enabling OS configuration options."
