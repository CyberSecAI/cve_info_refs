Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2023-20623:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition within the `ion` component.
- It is caused by improper locking mechanisms.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **TOCTOU Race Condition:** The core issue is a race condition where a check on a resource or state is made, and then the resource/state is used, but in between these two operations, the resource/state can be changed, leading to unexpected or insecure behavior.
- **Improper Locking:** The vulnerability is directly related to the incorrect implementation or absence of proper locking mechanisms in `ion` component.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to escalate their privileges.
- The attacker can gain elevated privileges without needing additional execution privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local:** The attack vector is local to the device.
- **No User Interaction:** User interaction is not required for the exploitation of the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- A local attacker on the affected device with the ability to trigger the race condition is needed.
- No additional execution privileges are needed by the attacker.

**Affected Chipsets:**
- A wide range of MediaTek chipsets are affected, including: MT6580, MT6735, MT6737, MT6739, MT6753, MT6757, MT6757C, MT6757CD, MT6757CH, MT6761, MT6762, MT6763, MT6765, MT6768, MT6769, MT6771, MT6779, MT6781, MT6785, MT6833, MT6853, MT6853T, MT6873, MT6875, MT6877, MT6883, MT6885, MT6889, MT6891, MT6893, MT8173, MT8532, MT8666, MT8667, MT8788

**Affected Software Versions:**
- Android 10.0, 11.0, 12.0 or Yocto 3.1, 3.3, 4.0
