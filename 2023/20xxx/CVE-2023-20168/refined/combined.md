Bias-Free Language

### Bias-Free Language

The documentation set for this product strives to use bias-free language. For the purposes of this documentation set, bias-free is defined as language that does not imply discrimination based on age, disability, gender, racial identity, ethnic identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and intersectionality. Exceptions may be present in the documentation due to language that is hardcoded in the user interfaces of the product software, language used based on RFP documentation, or language that is used by a referenced third-party product.

# Performing Software Maintenance Upgrades (SMUs)

This chapter describes how to perform software maintenance upgrades (SMUs) on Cisco Nexus 3000 Series switches.

This chapter includes the following sections:

* [About SMUs](#concept_C596AB5F37B14E7E900421ECC65A10FE)
* [Prerequisites for SMUs](#concept_1C9A592AC8804A83BDFBA9AD01A9B996)
* [Guidelines and Limitations for SMUs](#id_76237)
* [Performing a Software Maintenance Upgrade for Cisco NX-OS](#concept_01FCFCB13E3444D4BD5FF8D0BBA2FC5A)

## About SMUs

A software maintenance upgrade (SMU) is a package file that contains
fixes for a specific defect. SMUs are created to respond to immediate issues
and do not include new features. Typically, SMUs do not have a large impact on
device operations. SMU versions are synchronized to the package major, minor,
and maintenance versions they upgrade.

The effect of an SMU depends on its type:

* Process restart SMU-Causes a process or group of processes to
  restart on activation.
* Reload SMU-Causes a parallel reload of supervisors and line cards.

SMUs are not an alternative to maintenance releases. They provide a
quick resolution of immediate issues. All defects fixed by SMUs are integrated
into the maintenance releases.

For information on upgrading your device to a new feature or maintenance
release, see the
Cisco Nexus 3000 Series NX-OS Software Upgrade and Downgrade
Guide.

| **Note** | ---  Activating an SMU does not cause any earlier SMUs, or the package to which the SMU applies, to be automatically deactivated.  --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---   Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 7.0(3)I2(1), SMU package files have an .rpm extension. Earlier files have a .bin extension.   --- |
| --- | --- |

* [Package Management](#concept_8535F7376D0F43F9A8B2C5B2E154E406)

### Package Management

The general procedure
for adding and activating SMU packages on the device is as follows:

1. Copy the package file or files to a local storage device or file server.
2. Add the package or packages on the device using the install add command.
3. Activate the package or packages on the device using the install activate command.
4. Commit the current set of packages using the install commit command.
5. (Optional) Deactivate and remove the package.

The following figure
illustrates the key steps in the package management process.

Figure 1. Process to Add,
Activate, and Commit SMU Packages

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/500001-600000/500001-510000/503001-504000/503009.jpg)

## Prerequisites for SMUs

These prerequisites must be met for a package to be activated or
deactivated:

* You must be in a user group associated with a task group that
  includes the proper task IDs. If you suspect a user group assignment is
  preventing you from using a command, contact your AAA administrator for
  assistance.
* Verify that all line cards are installed and operating properly. For
  example, do not activate or deactivate packages while line cards are booting,
  while line cards are being upgraded or replaced, or when you anticipate an
  automatic switchover activity.

## Guidelines and Limitations for SMUs

SMUs have the following guidelines and limitations:

* Some packages require the activation or deactivation of other packages. If the SMUs have dependencies on each other, you cannot
  activate them without first activating the previous ones.
* The package being activated must be compatible with the current active software set.
* You cannot activate multiple SMUs in one command.
* Activation is performed only after the package compatibility checks have been passed. If a conflict is found, an error message
  displays.
* While a software package is being activated, other requests are not allowed to run on any of the impacted nodes. Package activation
  is completed when a message similar to this one appears:

  ```
  Install operation 1 completed successfully at Thu Jan 9 01:19:24 2014
  ```
* Each CLI install request is assigned a request ID, which can be used later to review the events.
* If you perform a software maintenance upgrade and later upgrade your device to a new Cisco Nexus 3000 software release, the
  new image will overwrite both the previous Cisco Nexus 3000 release and the SMU package file.

* [Displaying Installation Log Information](#concept_7B5162EADBCB45AC8EEA26852E40FAEB)

### Preparing for Package Installation

You should use several
show commands to gather information in preparation
for the SMU package installation.

#### Before you begin

Determine if a software change is required.

Verify that the new package is supported on your system. Some software
packages require that other packages or package versions be activated, and some
packages support only specific line cards.

Review the release notes for important information related to that
release and to help determine the package compatibility with your device
configuration.

Verify that the system is stable and prepared for the software
changes.

#### Procedure

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | show install active  Example: ``` switch# show install active ``` | Displays the active software on the device. Use this command to determine what software should be added on the device and to compare to the active software report after installation operations are complete. |
| **Step 2** | show module  Example: ``` switch# show module ``` | Confirms that all modules are in the stable state. |
| **Step 3** | show clock  Example: ``` switch# show clock ``` | Verifies that the system clock is correct. Software operations use certificates based on device clock times. |

#### Example

This example shows how to display the active packages for the entire
system. Use this information to determine if a software change is required.

```
switch# show install active
Active Packages:
Active Packages on Module #3:

Active Packages on Module #6:

Active Packages on Module #7:
Active Packages on Module #22:

Active Packages on Module #30:

```

This example shows how to display the current system clock setting:

```
switch# show clock
02:14:51.474 PST Wed Jan 04 2014

```

### Copying the Package File to a Local Storage Device or Network Server

You must copy the SMU package file to a local storage device or a
network file server to which the device has access. After this task is done,
the package can be added and activated on the device.

If you need to store package files on the device, we recommend that you
store the files on the hard disk. The boot device is the local disk from which
the package is added and activated. The default boot device is bootflash:.

| **Tip** | ---  Before you copy package files to a local storage device, use the dir command to determine if the required package files are already on the device.  --- |
| --- | --- |

If the SMU package files are located on a remote TFTP, FTP, or SFTP
server, you can copy the files to a local storage device. After the files are
located on the local storage device, the package can be added and activated on
the device from that storage device. The following server protocols are
supported:

* Trivial File Transfer Protocol—TFTP allows files to be transferred
  from one computer to another over a network, usually without the use of client
  authentication (for example, username and password). It is a simplified version
  of FTP.

  | **Note** | ---  Some package files might be larger than 32 MB, and the TFTP services provided by some vendors might not support a file this large. If you do not have access to a TFTP server that supports files larger than 32 MB, download the file using FTP.  --- |
  | --- | --- |
* File Transfer Protocol—FTP is part of the TCP/IP protocol stack and
  requires a username and password.
* SSH File Transfer Protocol—SFTP is part of the SSHv2 feature in the
  security package and provides for secure file transfers.

After the SMU package file has been transferred to a network file server
or the local storage device, you are ready to add and activate the file.

### Adding and Activating Packages

You can add SMU package files that are stored on a local storage
device or on a remote TFTP, FTP, or SFTP server to your device.

| **Note** | ---  The SMU package being activated must be compatible with the currently active software to operate. When an activation is attempted, the system runs an automatic compatibility check to ensure that the package is compatible with the other active software on the device. If a conflict is found, an error message displays. The activation is performed only after all compatibility checks have been passed.  --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---   This procedure uses Cisco NX-OS CLI commands to add and activate RPM package files. If you would prefer to use YUM commands, follow the instructions in the "Installing RPMs from Bash" section of the [Cisco Nexus 3000 Series NX-OS Programmability Guide](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus3000/sw/programmability/7_x/b_Cisco_Nexus_3000_Series_NX-OS_Programmability_Guide_7x/Bash.html).   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Procedure

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | install add filename [activate]  Example: ``` switch# install add bootflash: nxos.CSCab00001_TOR-1.0.0-7.0.3.I2.2a.lib32_n9000.rpm  ``` | Unpacks the package software files from the local storage device or network server and adds them to the bootflash: and all active and standby supervisors installed on the device.  The filename argument can take any of these formats:   * bootflash:filename * tftp://hostname-or-ipaddress/directory-path/filename * ftp://username:password@    hostname-or-ipaddress/directory-path/filename * sftp://hostname-or-ipaddress/directory-path/filename |
| **Step 2** | (Optional) show install inactive  Example: ``` switch# show install inactive  ``` | (Optional)  Displays the inactive packages on the device. Verify that the package added in the previous step appears in the display. |
| **Step 3** | install activate filename [test]  Example: ``` switch# install activate nxos.CSCab00001_TOR-1.0.0-7.0.3.I2.2a.lib32_n9000.rpm  ```  Example: ``` switch# install activate nxos.CSCab00001_TOR-1.0.0-7.0.3.I2.2a.lib32_n9000.rpm Install operation 1 completed successfully at Wed Mar 16 00:42:12 2016  ```  Example: ``` switch# install activate nxos.CSCab00001_TOR-1.0.0-7.0.3.I2.2a.lib32_n9000.rpm Install operation 2 !!WARNING!! This patch will get activated only after a reload of the switch. at Wed Mar 16 00:42:12 2016  ``` | Activates a package that was added to the device. SMU packages remain inactive until activated. (Skip this step if the package was activated earlier with the install add activate command.)   | **Note** | Press **?** after a partial package name to display all possible matches available for activation. If there is only one match, press the **Tab** key to fill in the rest of the package name. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 4** | Repeat Step 3 until all packages are activated. | Activates additional packages as required. |
| **Step 5** | (Optional) show install active  Example: ``` switch# show install active  ``` | (Optional)  Displays all active packages. Use this command to determine if the correct packages are active. |

### Committing the Active Package Set

When an SMU package is activated on the device, it becomes part of the
current running configuration. To make the package activation persistent across
system-wide reloads, you must commit the package on the device.

#### Procedure

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | install commit filename  Example: ``` switch# install commit nxos.CSCab00001_TOR-1.0.0-7.0.3.I2.2a.lib32_n9000.rpm ``` | Commits the current set of packages so that these packages are used if the device is restarted. |
| **Step 2** | (Optional) show install committed  Example: ``` switch# show install committed  ``` | (Optional)  Displays which packages are committed. |

### Deactivating and Removing Packages

When a package is deactivated, it is no longer active on the device,
but the package files remain on the boot disk. The package files can be
reactivated later, or they can be removed from the disk.

| **Note** | ---   This procedure uses Cisco NX-OS CLI commands to deactivate and remove RPM package files. If you would prefer to use YUM commands, follow the instructions in the "Erasing an RPM" section of the [Cisco Nexus 3000 Series NX-OS Programmability Guide](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus3000/sw/programmability/7_x/b_Cisco_Nexus_3000_Series_NX-OS_Programmability_Guide_7x/Bash.html).   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Procedure

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | install deactivate filename  Example: ``` switch# install deactivate nxos.CSCab00001_TOR-1.0.0-7.0.3.I2.2a.lib32_n9000.rpm ``` | Deactivates a package that was added to the device and turns off the package features for the line card.   | **Note** | Press **?** after a partial package name to display all possible matches available for deactivation. If there is only one match, press the **Tab** key to fill in the rest of the package name. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 2** | (Optional) show install inactive  Example: ``` switch# show install inactive  ``` | (Optional)  Displays the inactive packages on the device. |
| **Step 3** | (Optional) install commit  Example: ``` switch# install commit  ``` | (Optional)  Commits the current set of packages so that these packages are used if the device is restarted.   | **Note** | Packages can be removed only if the deactivation operation is committed. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 4** | (Optional) install remove {filename | inactive}  Example: ``` switch# install remove nxos.CSCab00001_TOR-1.0.0-7.0.3.I2.2a.lib32_n9000.rpm Proceed with removing nxos.CSCab00001_TOR-1.0.0-7.0.3.I2.2a.lib32_n9000.rpm? (y/n)? [n] y  ```  Example: ``` switch# install remove inactive Proceed with removing? (y/n)? [n] y  ``` | (Optional)  Removes the inactive package.   * Only inactive packages   can be removed. * Packages can be   removed only if they are deactivated from all line cards in the device. * The package   deactivation must be committed. * To remove a specific   inactive package from a storage device, use the   install remove command with the   filename argument. * To remove all inactive   packages from all nodes in the system, use the   install remove command with the   inactive keyword. |

### Downgrading Feature RPMs

Follow this procedure to downgrade an installed feature RPM to the base feature RPM.

| **Note** | ---   This procedure uses Cisco NX-OS CLI commands to downgrade feature RPMs. If you would prefer to use YUM commands, follow the instructions in the "Downgrading an RPM" section of the [Cisco Nexus 3000 Series NX-OS Programmability Guide](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus3000/sw/programmability/7_x/b_Cisco_Nexus_3000_Series_NX-OS_Programmability_Guide_7x/Bash.html).   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Procedure

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | (Optional) show install packages  Example: ``` switch# show install packages ntp.lib32_n9000     1.0.1-7.0.3.I2.2e      installed    ``` | (Optional)  Displays the feature RPM packages on the device. |
| **Step 2** | run bash  Example: ``` switch# run bash bash-4.2$ ``` | Loads Bash. |
| **Step 3** | ls \*feature\*  Example: ``` bash-4.2$ ls *ntp* ntp-1.0.0-7.0.3.I2.2e.lib32_n9000.rpm ``` | Lists the RPM for the specified feature. |
| **Step 4** | cp filename /bootflash  Example: ``` bash-4.2$ cp ntp-1.0.0-7.0.3.I2.2e.lib32_n9000.rpm /bootflash ``` | Copies the base feature RPM to the bootflash. |
| **Step 5** | exit  Example: ``` bash-4.2$ exit ``` | Exits Bash. |
| **Step 6** | install add bootflash:filename activate downgrade  Example: ``` switch# install add bootflash:ntp-1.0.0-7.0.3.I2.2e.lib32_n9000.rpm activate downgrade Adding the patch (/ntp-1.0.0-7.0.3.I2.2e.lib32_n9000.rpm) [#############       ]  60% Adding the patch (/ntp-1.0.0-7.0.3.I2.2e.lib32_n9000.rpm) [####################] 100% Install operation 11 completed successfully at Thu Sep  8 15:35:35 2015  Activating the patch (/ntp-1.0.0-7.0.3.I2.2e.lib32_n9000.rpm) This install operation requires system reload. Do you wish to continue (y/n)?: [n] y [  217.975959] [1473348971]  writing reset reason 132, System reset due to reload patch(es) activation [  217.991166] [1473348971]\ufffd\ufffd CISCO SWITCH Ver7.51 Device detected on 0:6:0 after 0 msecs  Device detected on 0:1:1 after 0 msecs  Device detected on 0:1:0 after 0 msecs  MCFrequency 1333Mhz Relocated to memory  ``` | Downgrades the feature RPM.   | **Note** | If you are prompted to reload the device, enter `Y`. A reload is required only when downgrading the NTP and SNMP feature RPMs. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 7** | (Optional) show install packages | i feature  Example: ``` switch# show install packages | i ntp ntp.lib32_n9000    1.0.0-7.0.3.I2.2e   installed     ``` | (Optional)  Displays the base feature RPM on the device. |

### Displaying Installation Log Information

The installation log provides information on the history of the
installation operations. Each time an installation operation is run, a number
is assigned to that operation.

* Use the
  show install log command to display information
  about both successful and failed installation operations.
* Use the
  show install log command with no arguments to
  display a summary of all installation operations. Specify the
  request-id argument to display information
  specific to an operation. Use the
  detail keyword to display details for a specific
  operation, including file changes, nodes that could not be reloaded, and any
  impact to processes.

This example shows how to display information for all installation
requests:

```
switch# show install log

| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: Low C: High C: None  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: Low A: High A: None  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 7.1 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Unproven   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Not Defined  RC: Confirmed   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 7.1 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High  CR: Not Defined   Select Confidentiality Requirement Parameters  Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Select Integrity Requirement Parameters  Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High  AR: Not Defined   Select Availability Requirement Parameters  Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Vector Parameters  Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Complexity Parameters  Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Select Modified Privileges Required Parameters  Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Select Modified User Interaction Parameters  Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Select Modified Scope Parameters  Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Select Modified Confidentiality Parameters  Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Select Modified Integrity Parameters  Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined   Select Modified Availability Parameters    Environmental Score: 7.1 |

## Minimum Recommended Cisco NX-OS Releases for Cisco Nexus 5600 Series Switches ---

 **Date: February 13, 2023**

This document lists the minimum recommended Cisco NX-OS software release for use with Cisco Nexus 5600 Series switches for both new deployments and existing deployments. Since these are minimum release recommendations, more recent software releases can be used to take advantage of newer hardware and software capabilities. These recommendations are general and should not replace environment specific design review efforts.

 **General Recommendation for New Deployments**

Cisco recommends that customers with new Cisco Nexus 5600 Series deployments choose from the following minimum recommended releases:

Table 1 Cisco Nexus 5600 Recommended Releases

| Platform Series/Product Name | Minimum Recommended Release | Recommended Release |

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |
| **Hours** | 24 hours a day, 7 days a week |

## Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco

There are several ways to stay connected and receive the latest security vulnerability information from Cisco. Customers should review the following table, and subsequent summaries, to determine the appropriate option for them:

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

### **RSS Feeds**

Cisco security vulnerability information is also available via RSS feeds from Cisco.com. These feeds are free and do not require an active Cisco.com registration. For information on how to subscribe to the RSS feeds, visit the [Cisco Security RSS Feeds page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44).

### **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API**

The Cisco PSIRT openVuln application programming interface (API) is a RESTful API that conforms to the [representational state transfer](https://restfulapi.net/) (REST) software architectural style and allows customers to obtain Cisco security vulnerability information in different machine-consumable formats. To learn about accessing and using the API, visit the [PSIRT page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) on the Cisco DevNet website.

### **My Notifications**

The [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) allows registered Cisco.com users to subscribe to and receive important Cisco product and technology information, including Cisco Security Advisories. This service provides an improved unified subscription experience, allowing users to choose the timing of notifications as well as the notification delivery method (email or RSS feed). The level of access will be determined by the subscriber's relationship with Cisco.

### Creating a Notification

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |
| **Hours** | 24 hours a day, 7 days a week |

## Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco

There are several ways to stay connected and receive the latest security vulnerability information from Cisco. Customers should review the following table, and subsequent summaries, to determine the appropriate option for them:

| **Cisco.com** | <https://www.cisco.com/security/> |

| **Email** | cust-security-announce@cisco.com |
| **RSS** | <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44> |
| **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API** | [https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT/](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) |
| **My Notifications** | <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html> |

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

### **RSS Feeds**

Cisco security vulnerability information is also available via RSS feeds from Cisco.com. These feeds are free and do not require an active Cisco.com registration. For information on how to subscribe to the RSS feeds, visit the [Cisco Security RSS Feeds page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44).

### **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API**

The Cisco PSIRT openVuln application programming interface (API) is a RESTful API that conforms to the [representational state transfer](https://restfulapi.net/) (REST) software architectural style and allows customers to obtain Cisco security vulnerability information in different machine-consumable formats. To learn about accessing and using the API, visit the [PSIRT page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) on the Cisco DevNet website.

### **My Notifications**

The [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) allows registered Cisco.com users to subscribe to and receive important Cisco product and technology information, including Cisco Security Advisories. This service provides an improved unified subscription experience, allowing users to choose the timing of notifications as well as the notification delivery method (email or RSS feed). The level of access will be determined by the subscriber's relationship with Cisco.

### Creating a Notification

To create a notification, use the following steps:

1. Log in to the [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) on Cisco.com using a registered Cisco.com account name and password.

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

device. TACACS+ services are maintained in a database on a TACACS+ daemon
running, typically, on a UNIX or Windows NT workstation. You must have access
to and must configure a TACACS+ server before the configured TACACS+ features
on your
Cisco NX-OS
device are available.

TACACS+ provides for
separate authentication, authorization, and accounting facilities. TACACS+
allows for a single access control server (the TACACS+ daemon) to provide each
service—authentication, authorization, and accounting—independently. Each
service can be tied into its own database to take advantage of other services
available on that server or on the network, depending on the capabilities of
the daemon.

The TACACS+
client/server protocol uses TCP (TCP port 49) for transport requirements.
Cisco NX-OS
devices provide centralized authentication using the TACACS+ protocol.

### TACACS+ Advantages

TACACS+ has the
following advantages over RADIUS authentication:

* Provides
  independent AAA facilities. For example, the
  Cisco NX-OS
  device can authorize access without authenticating.
* Uses the TCP
  transport protocol to send data between the AAA client and server, making
  reliable transfers with a connection-oriented protocol.
* Obfuscates the entire protocol payload between the switch and the AAA server to ensure higher data confidentiality. The RADIUS
  protocol only obfuscates passwords.

### TACACS+ Operation for User Login

When a user attempts
a Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) login to a
Cisco NX-OS
device using TACACS+, the following actions occur:

| **Note** | ---   TACACS+ allows an arbitrary conversation between the daemon and the user until the daemon receives enough information to authenticate the user. This action is usually done by prompting for a username and password combination, but may include prompts for other items, such as your mother’s maiden name.   --- |
| --- | --- |

1. When the
   Cisco NX-OS
   device establishes a connection, it contacts the TACACS+ daemon to obtain the
   username and password.
2. The
   Cisco NX-OS
   device will eventually receive one of the following responses from the TACACS+
   daemon:

   ACCEPT

   User
   authentication succeeds and service begins. If the
   Cisco NX-OS
   device requires user authorization, authorization begins.

   REJECT

   User
   authentication failed. The TACACS+ daemon either denies further access to the
   user or prompts the user to retry the login sequence.

   ERROR

   An error
   occurred at some time during authentication either at the daemon or in the
   network connection between the daemon and the
   Cisco NX-OS
   device. If the
   Cisco NX-OS
   device receives an ERROR response, the
   Cisco NX-OS
   device tries to use an alternative method for authenticating the user.

   After
   authentication, the user also undergoes an additional authorization phase if
   authorization has been enabled on the
   Cisco NX-OS
   device. Users must first successfully complete TACACS+ authentication before
   proceeding to TACACS+ authorization.
3. If TACACS+
   authorization is required, the
   Cisco NX-OS
   device again contacts the TACACS+ daemon and it returns an ACCEPT or REJECT
   authorization response. An ACCEPT response contains attributes that are used to
   direct the EXEC or NETWORK session for that user and determines the services
   that the user can access.

   Services include
   the following:

   * Telnet,
     rlogin, Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP), Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP),
     or EXEC services
   * Connection
     parameters, including the host or client IP address (IPv4 or IPv6), access
     list, and user timeouts

### Default TACACS+ Server Obfuscation Type and Secret Key

You must configure
the TACACS+ secret key to authenticate the switch to the TACACS+ server. A
secret key is a secret text string shared between the
Cisco NX-OS
device and the TACACS+ server host. The length of the key is restricted to 63
characters and can include any printable ASCII characters (white spaces are not
allowed). You can configure a global secret key for all TACACS+ server
configurations on the
Cisco NX-OS
device to use.

You can override
the global secret key assignment by explicitly using the
key  option when
configuring an individual TACACS+ server.

### Command Authorization Support for TACACS+ Servers

By default, command
authorization is done against a local database in the
Cisco NX-OS
software when an authenticated user enters a command at the command-line
interface (CLI). You can also verify authorized commands for authenticated
users using TACACS+.

### TACACS+ Server Monitoring

An unresponsive
TACACS+ server can delay the processing of AAA requests. A
Cisco NX-OS
device can periodically monitor a TACACS+ server to check whether it is
responding (or alive) to save time in processing AAA requests. The
Cisco NX-OS
device marks unresponsive TACACS+ servers as dead and does not send AAA
requests to any dead TACACS+ servers. A
Cisco NX-OS
device periodically monitors dead TACACS+ servers and brings them to the alive
state once they are responding. This process verifies that a TACACS+ server is
in a working state before real AAA requests are sent its way. Whenever a
TACACS+ server changes to the dead or alive state, a Simple Network Management
Protocol (SNMP) trap is generated and the
Cisco NX-OS
device displays an error message that a failure is taking place before it can
impact performance.

Figure 1.  TACACS+
Server States. This figure
shows the server states for TACACS+ server monitoring.

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/100001-200000/150001-160000/154001-155000/154534.ps/_jcr_content/renditions/154534.jpg)

| **Note** | ---   The monitoring interval for alive servers and dead servers are different and can be configured by the user. The TACACS+ server monitoring is performed by sending a test authentication request to the TACACS+ server.   --- |
| --- | --- |

### Vendor-Specific Attributes for TACACS+

The Internet
Engineering Task Force (IETF) draft standard specifies a method for
communicating vendor-specific attributes (VSAs) between the network access
server and the TACACS+ server. The IETF uses attribute 26. VSAs allow vendors
to support their own extended attributes that are not suitable for general use.

* [Cisco VSA Format for TACACS+](#con_1473445)

#### Cisco VSA Format for TACACS+

The Cisco TACACS+
implementation supports one vendor-specific option using the format recommended
in the IETF specification. The Cisco vendor ID is 9, and the supported option
is vendor type 1, which is named cisco-av-pair. The value is a string with the
following format:

```
protocol : attribute separator value *

```

The protocol is a
Cisco attribute for a particular type of authorization, the separator is =
(equal sign) for mandatory attributes, and \* (asterisk) indicates optional
attributes.

When you use TACACS+
servers for authentication on a
Cisco NX-OS
device, the TACACS+ protocol directs the TACACS+ server to return user
attributes, such as authorization information, along with authentication
results. This authorization information is specified through VSAs.

The following VSA
protocol options are supported by the
Cisco NX-OS
software:

Shell

Protocol used
in access-accept packets to provide user profile information.

Accounting

Protocol used
in accounting-request packets. If a value contains any white spaces, you should
enclose the value within double quotation marks.

The
Cisco NX-OS
software supports the following attributes:

roles

Lists all the
roles to which the user belongs. The value field is a string that lists the
role names delimited by white space. For example, if the user belongs to roles
network-operator and network-admin, the value field would be network-operator
network-admin. This subattribute, which the TACACS+ server sends in the VSA
portion of the Access-Accept frames, can only be used with the shell protocol
value. The following examples show the roles attribute as supported by Cisco
ACS:

```
shell:roles=network-operator network-admin

shell:roles*network-operator network-admin

```

| **Note** | ---   When you specify a VSA as shell:roles\*"network-operator network-admin", this VSA is flagged as an optional attribute and other Cisco devices ignore this attribute.   --- |
| --- | --- |

accountinginfo

Stores
accounting information in addition to the attributes covered by a standard
TACACS+ accounting protocol. This attribute is sent only in the VSA portion of
the Account-Request frames from the TACACS+ client on the switch. It can be
used only with the accounting protocol data units (PDUs).

## Prerequisites for TACACS+

TACACS+ has the
following prerequisites:

* Obtain the IPv4
  or IPv6 addresses or hostnames for the TACACS+ servers.
* Obtain the
  secret keys from the TACACS+ servers, if any.
* Ensure that the
  Cisco NX-OS
  device is configured as a TACACS+ client of the AAA servers.

## Guidelines and Limitations for TACACS+

TACACS+ has the following guidelines and limitations:

* You can configure a maximum of 64 TACACS+ servers on the Cisco NX-OS device.
* If you have a user account configured on the local Cisco NX-OS device that has the same name as a remote user account on an AAA server, the Cisco NX-OS software applies the user roles for the local user account to the remote user, not the user roles configured on the AAA server.
* Cisco recommends that you configure the dead-time interval if more than six servers are configured in a group. If you must
  configure more than six servers, make sure to set the dead-time interval to a value greater than 0 and enable dead server
  monitoring by configuring the test username and test password.
* Command authorization on TACACS+ servers is available for console sessions.
* For N9K-X9636C-R and N9K-X9636Q-R line cards and the N9K-C9508-FM-R fabric module, TACACS+ authentication fails for usernames
  with special characters.
* The Cisco NX-OS switches do not support custom username/password prompts. If custom prompts are provided to the switch, they
  will be ignored.

## Default Settings for TACACS+

This table lists
the default settings for TACACS+ parameters.

Table 1.  Default TACACS+
Parameters Settings

| Parameters | Default |
| --- | --- |
| TACACS+ | Disabled |
| Dead timer interval | 0 minutes |
| Timeout interval | 5 seconds |
| Idle timer interval | 0 minutes |
| Periodic server monitoring username | test |
| Periodic server monitoring password | test |
| Privilege level support for TACACS+ authorization | Disabled |

## One-Time Password Support

A one-time password (OTP) is a password that is valid for a single login session or a transaction. OTPs avoid multiple disadvantages
that are associated with the static passwords. OTPs are not at risk to replay attacks. If an intruder manages to record an
OTP that was already used to log into a service or to conduct an operation, it cannot be misused because it is no longer valid.

OTPs are applicable only to the RADIUS and TACACS+ protocol daemons. For a RADIUS protocol daemon, you must ensure that you
disable the ASCII authentication mode. For a TACACS+ protocol daemon, you must enable the ASCII authentication mode. To enable
the ASCII authentication mode, use the aaa authentication login ascii-authentication command.

### Configuring TACACS+ Server Groups

You can specify one
or more remote AAA servers to authenticate users using server groups. All
members of a group must belong to the TACACS+ protocol. The servers are tried
in the same order in which you configure them.

You can configure
these server groups at any time but they only take effect when you apply them
to an AAA service.

#### Before you begin

Enable TACACS+.

### Allowing Users to Specify a TACACS+ Server at Login

You can configure
the switch to allow the user to specify which TACACS+ server to send the
authentication request by enabling the directed-request option. By default, a
Cisco NX-OS
device forwards an authentication request based on the default AAA
authentication method. If you enable this option, the user can log in as
username@vrfname:hostname , where
vrfname  is the
VRF to use and
hostname  is the
name of a configured TACACS+ server.

| **Note** | ---   If you enable the directed-request option, the Cisco NX-OS device uses only the TACACS+ method for authentication and not the default local method.   --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---   User-specified logins are supported only for Telnet sessions.   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Before you begin

Enable TACACS+.

### Configuring the Timeout Interval for a TACACS+ Server

You can set a
timeout interval that the
Cisco NX-OS
device waits for responses from a TACACS+ server before declaring a timeout
failure. The timeout interval determines how long the
Cisco NX-OS
device waits for responses from a TACACS+ server before declaring a timeout
failure.

#### Before you begin

### Configuring Global Periodic TACACS+ Server Monitoring

You can monitor the
availability of all TACACS+ servers without having to configure the test
parameters for each server individually. Any servers for which test parameters
are not configured are monitored using the global level parameters.

| **Note** | ---   Test parameters that are configured for individual servers take precedence over global test parameters.   --- |
| --- | --- |

The global
configuration parameters include the username and password to use for the
servers and an idle timer. The idle timer specifies the interval in which a
TACACS+ server receives no requests before the
Cisco NX-OS
device sends out a test packet. You can configure this option to test servers
periodically, or you can run a one-time only test.

| **Note** | ---   The test parameters are distributed across switches. If even one switch in the fabric is running an older release, the test parameters are not distributed to any switch in the fabric.   --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---   To protect network security, we recommend that you use a username that is not the same as an existing username in the TACACS+ database.   --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---   The default idle timer value is 0 minutes. When the idle time interval is 0 minutes, periodic TACACS+ server monitoring is not performed.   --- |
| --- | --- |

The default username is test, and the default password is test. The default value for the idle timer is 0 minutes, and the valid range is from 0 to 1440 minutes.   | **Note** | For periodic TACACS+ server monitoring, the idle timer value must be greater than 0. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 3** | tacacs-server dead-time minutes  Example: ``` switch(config)# tacacs-server dead-time 5 ``` | Specifies the number of minutes before the Cisco NX-OS device checks a TACACS+ server that was previously unresponsive. The default value is 0 minutes, and the valid range is from 0 to 1440 minutes. |
| **Step 4** | exit  Example: ``` switch(config)# exit switch# ``` | Exits configuration mode. |
| **Step 5** | (Optional) show tacacs-server  Example: ``` switch# show tacacs-server ``` | (Optional)  Displays the TACACS+ server configuration. |

### Configuring the TACACS+ Dead-Time Interval

You can configure
the dead-time interval for all TACACS+ servers. The dead-time interval
specifies the time that the
Cisco NX-OS
device waits, after declaring a TACACS+ server is dead, before sending out a
test packet to determine if the server is now alive.

| **Note** | ---   When the dead-timer interval is 0 minutes, TACACS+ servers are not marked as dead even if they are not responding. You can configure the dead-timer per group.   --- |
| --- | --- |

### Configuring Command Authorization on TACACS+ Servers

You can configure authorization for commands on TACACS+ servers.

| **Caution** | ---   Command authorization disables user role-based authorization control (RBAC), including the default roles.   --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---  If you use a console to login to the server, command authorization is disabled. Authorization is available for both non-console and console sessions. By default, command authorization is disabled for console sessions even if it is configured for default (non-console) sessions. You must explicitly configure a AAA group for the console to enable command authorization for console sessions.  --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---   By default, context sensitive help and command tab completion show only the commands supported for a user as defined by the assigned roles. When you enable command authorization, the Cisco NX-OS software displays all commands in the context sensitive help and in tab completion, regardless of the role assigned to the user.   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Before you begin

Enable TACACS+.

#### Procedure

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | configure terminal  Example: ``` switch# configure terminal switch(config)# ``` | Enters global configuration mode. |
| **Step 2** | aaa authorization {commands | config-commands} {console | default} {group group-list [local] | local}  Example: ``` switch(config)# aaa authorization commands  default group TacGroup Per command authorization will disable RBAC for all  users. Proceed (y/n)?  ``` | Configures the command authorization method for specific roles on a TACACS+ server.  The commands  keyword configures authorization sources for all EXEC commands, and the config-commands  keyword configures authorization sources for all configuration commands.  The console  keyword configures command authorization for a console session, and the default  keyword configures command authorization for a non-console session.  The group-list argument consists of a space-delimited list of TACACS+ server group names. Servers belonging to this group are contacted for command authorization. The local method uses the local role-based database for authorization.  The local  method is used only if all the configured server groups fail to respond and you have configured local  as the fallback method. The default method is local .  If you have not configured a fallback method after the TACACS+ server group method, authorization fails if all server groups fail to respond.  If you press Enter at the confirmation prompt, the default action is `n`. |
| **Step 3** | (Optional) show tacacs+ {pending | pending-diff}  Example: ``` switch(config)# show tacacs+ pending ``` | (Optional)  Displays the pending TACACS+ configuration. |
| **Step 4** | (Optional) tacacs+ commit  Example: ``` switch(config)# tacacs+ commit ``` | (Optional)  Applies the TACACS+ configuration changes in the temporary database to the running configuration. |
| **Step 5** | exit  Example: ``` switch(config)# exit switch# ``` | Exits global configuration mode. |
| **Step 6** | (Optional) show aaa authorization [all]  Example: ``` switch(config)# show aaa authorization ``` | (Optional)  Displays the AAA authorization configuration. The all  keyword displays the default values. |

### Enabling and Disabling Command Authorization Verification

You can enable and disable command authorization verification on the command-line interface (CLI) for the default user session
or for another username.

| **Note** | ---   The commands do no execute when you enable authorization verification.   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Procedure

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | terminal verify-only [username username]  Example: ``` switch# terminal verify-only ``` | Enables command authorization verification. After you enter this command, the Cisco NX-OS software indicates whether the commands you enter are authorized or not. |
| **Step 2** | terminal no verify-only [username username]  Example: ``` switch# terminal no verify-only ``` | Disables command authorization verification. |

### Permitting or Denying Commands for Users of Privilege Roles

As a network
administrator, you can modify the privilege roles to permit users to execute
specific commands or to prevent users from running those commands.

 You must follow
these guidelines when changing the rules of privilege roles:

* You cannot
  modify the priv-14 and priv-15 roles.
* You can add deny
  rules only to the priv-0 role.
* These commands
  are always permitted for the priv-0 role:
  configure,
  copy,
  dir,
  enable,
  ping,
  show,
  ssh,
  telnet,
  terminal,
  traceroute,
  end, and
  exit.

#### Procedure

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | configure terminal  Example: ``` switch# configure terminal switch(config)# ``` | Enters global configuration mode. |
| **Step 2** | [no] role name priv-n  Example: ``` switch(config)# role name priv-5 switch(config-role)#  ``` | Enables or disables a privilege role and enters role configuration mode. The n argument specifies the privilege level and is a number between 0 and 13. |
| **Step 3** | rule number {deny | permit} command command-string  Example: ``` switch(config-role)# rule 2 permit command pwd ``` | Configures a command rule for users of privilege roles. These rules permit or deny users to execute specific commands. You can configure up to 256 rules for each role. The rule number determines the order in which the rules are applied. Rules are applied in descending order. For example, if a role has three rules, rule 3 is applied before rule 2, which is applied before rule 1.  The command-string argument can contain spaces.   | **Note** | Repeat this command for as many rules as needed. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 4** | exit  Example: ``` switch(config-role)# exit switch(config)# ``` | Exits role configuration mode. |
| **Step 5** | (Optional) copy running-config startup-config  Example: ``` switch(config)# copy running-config  startup-config ``` | (Optional)  Copies the running configuration to the startup configuration. |

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| show tacacs+ { status | pending | pending-diff} | Displays the TACACS+ Cisco Fabric Services distribution status and other details. |
| show running-config tacacs [all] | Displays the TACACS+ configuration in the running configuration. |
| show startup-config tacacs | Displays the TACACS+ configuration in the startup configuration. |
| show tacacs-server [host-name | ipv4-address | ipv6-address] [directed-request | groups | sorted | statistics] | Displays all configured TACACS+ server parameters. |

## Configuration Examples for TACACS+

The following
example shows how to configure a TACACS+ server host and server group:

```

feature tacacs+
tacacs-server key 7 "ToIkLhPpG"
tacacs-server host 10.10.2.2 key 7 "ShMoMhTl"
aaa group server tacacs+ TacServer
    server 10.10.2.2

```

The following
example shows how to configure and use command authorization verification:

```

switch# terminal verify-only
switch# show interface ethernet 7/2 brief
%Success
switch# terminal no verify-only
switch# show interface ethernet 7/2 brief

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ethernet      VLAN   Type Mode   Status  Reason                   Speed     Port
Interface                                                                   Ch #
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eth7/2        1      eth  access down    SFP not inserted           auto(D) --

```

The following
example shows how to permit all users with roles priv-5 and above to execute
the
pwd  command:

```

switch# configure terminal
switch(config)# role name priv-5
switch(config-role)# rule 1 permit command pwd

```

The following
example shows how to deny the
show
running-config  command to all users with roles below priv-5.
First, you must remove the permission to execute this command from the priv-0
role; then you must permit the command at role priv-5 so that users with roles
priv-5 and above have permission to run the command.

```

switch# configure terminal
switch(config)# role name priv-0
switch(config-role)# rule 2 deny command show running-config
switch(config-role)# exit
switch(config)# role name priv-5
switch(config-role)# rule 3 permit command show running-config
switch(config-role)# exit

```

## Where to Go Next

You can now configure AAA authentication methods to include the server groups.

"text": "Cisco has released free software updates [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security\_vulnerability\_policy.html#ssu\"] that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.\r\n\r\nCustomers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nThe Cisco Support and Downloads page [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html\"] on Cisco.com provides information about licensing and downloads. This page can also display customer device support coverage for customers who use the My Devices tool.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security\_vulnerability\_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n Cisco NX-OS Software\r\nTo help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco NX-OS Software, Cisco provides the Cisco Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"]. This tool identifies any Cisco security advisories that impact a specific software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities that are described in each advisory (“First Fixed”). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities described in all the advisories that the Software Checker identifies (“Combined First Fixed”).\r\n\r\nTo use the tool, go to the Cisco Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"] page and follow the instructions. Alternatively, use the following form to search for vulnerabilities that affect a specific software release. To use the form, follow these steps:\r\n\r\nChoose which advisories the tool will search—only this advisory, only advisories with a Critical or High Security Impact Rating (SIR) [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security\_vulnerability\_policy.html#asr\"], or all advisories.\r\nChoose the appropriate software.\r\nChoose the appropriate platform.\r\nEnter a release number—for example, 7.0(3)I7(5) for Cisco Nexus 3000 Series Switches or 14.0(1h) for Cisco NX-OS Software in ACI mode.\r\nClick Check.\r\n\r\n Only this advisory All Critical and High advisories All advisories Cisco NX-OS Software Cisco NX-OS Software in ACI Mode Any Platform MDS 9000 Series Multilayer Switches Nexus 1000V Series Switches Nexus 3000 Series Switches Nexus 5000 Series Switches Nexus 6000 Series Switches Nexus 7000 Series Switches Nexus 9000 Series Switches\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Cisco Nexus 3000 and 9000 Series Switches SMUs\r\nCisco has released the following SMUs to address this vulnerability.

Bias-Free Language

### Bias-Free Language

The documentation set for this product strives to use bias-free language. For the purposes of this documentation set, bias-free is defined as language that does not imply discrimination based on age, disability, gender, racial identity, ethnic identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and intersectionality. Exceptions may be present in the documentation due to language that is hardcoded in the user interfaces of the product software, language used based on RFP documentation, or language that is used by a referenced third-party product.

This vulnerability is due to incorrect input validation when processing an authentication attempt if the directed request option is enabled for TACACS+ or RADIUS. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by entering a crafted string at the login prompt of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to unexpectedly reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-nxos-remoteauth-dos-XB6pv74m>  This advisory is part of the August 2023 Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see [Cisco Event Response: August 2023 Semiannual Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-75058).  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco NX-OS Software with the directed request option enabled for TACACS+, RADIUS, or both:    + MDS 9000 Series Multilayer Switches ([CSCwe72670](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwe72670))   + Nexus 1000 Virtual Edge for VMware vSphere ([CSCwe72673](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwe72673))   + Nexus 1000V Switch for Microsoft Hyper-V ([CSCwe72673](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwe72673))   + Nexus 1000V Switch for VMware vSphere ([CSCwe72673](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwe72673))   + Nexus 3000 Series Switches ([CSCwe72648](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwe72648))   + Nexus 5500 Platform Switches ([CSCwe72674](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwe72674))   + Nexus 5600 Platform Switches ([CSCwe72674](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwe72674))   + Nexus 6000 Series Switches ([CSCwe72674](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwe72674))   + Nexus 7000 Series Switches ([CSCwe72368](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwe72368))   + Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode ([CSCwe72648](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwe72648)) **Note:** This vulnerability can only be exploited over Telnet, which is disabled by default, or over the console management connection. This vulnerability cannot be exploited over SSH connections to the device.  For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. Determine the Vulnerable Configuration To determine if the directed request option is configured for TACACS+ or RADIUS, use the **show running-config | include directed-request** command. If the command returns **tacacs-server directed-request** or **radius-server directed-request**, the device may be affected by this vulnerability. The following example shows the output of the **show running-config | include directed-request** command on a device that has the directed request option configured for TACACS+:  ```   nxos# show running-config | include directed-requesttacacs-server directed-request    ```  For additional information on the directed request option, see the appropriate guide:  [Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Security Configuration Guide: Configuring TACACS+](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/dcn/nx-os/nexus9000/101x/configuration/security/cisco-nexus-9000-nx-os-security-configuration-guide-101x/m-configuring-tacacs.html)[Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Security Configuration Guide: Configuring RADIUS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/dcn/nx-os/nexus9000/101x/configuration/security/cisco-nexus-9000-nx-os-security-configuration-guide-101x/m-configuring-radius.html) Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:    + Firepower 1000 Series   + Firepower 2100 Series   + Firepower 4100 Series   + Firepower 9300 Security Appliances   + Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches in ACI mode   + Secure Firewall 3100 Series   + UCS 6200 Series Fabric Interconnects   + UCS 6300 Series Fabric Interconnects   + UCS 6400 Series Fabric Interconnects   + UCS 6500 Series Fabric Interconnects  Details  * If the affected device reloads, the Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) portion of the configuration may be deleted, which would prevent valid users from authenticating. The AAA configuration would need to be manually reconfigured.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  If directed request support for TACACS+ or RADIUS is not required, the CLI commands **tacacs-server directed-request** and **radius-server directed-request** can be removed from the configuration. If the commands are not present in the configuration, the device is not vulnerable.  For additional information on the directed request option, see the appropriate guide:  [Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Security Configuration Guide: Configuring TACACS+](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/dcn/nx-os/nexus9000/101x/configuration/security/cisco-nexus-9000-nx-os-security-configuration-guide-101x/m-configuring-tacacs.html)[Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Security Configuration Guide: Configuring RADIUS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/dcn/nx-os/nexus9000/101x/configuration/security/cisco-nexus-9000-nx-os-security-configuration-guide-101x/m-configuring-radius.html)  While this mitigation has been deployed and was proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released [free software updates](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#ssu) that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.  Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:<https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  The [Cisco Support and Downloads page](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html) on Cisco.com provides information about licensing and downloads. This page can also display customer device support coverage for customers who use the My Devices tool.  When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade. Cisco NX-OS Software To help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco NX-OS Software, Cisco provides the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x). This tool identifies any Cisco security advisories that impact a specific software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities that are described in each advisory (“First Fixed”). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities described in all the advisories that the Software Checker identifies (“Combined First Fixed”).

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |
| **Hours** | 24 hours a day, 7 days a week |

## Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco

There are several ways to stay connected and receive the latest security vulnerability information from Cisco. Customers should review the following table, and subsequent summaries, to determine the appropriate option for them:

| **Cisco.com** | <https://www.cisco.com/security/> |

| **My Notifications** | <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html> |

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

### **RSS Feeds**

Cisco security vulnerability information is also available via RSS feeds from Cisco.com. These feeds are free and do not require an active Cisco.com registration. For information on how to subscribe to the RSS feeds, visit the [Cisco Security RSS Feeds page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44).

### **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API**

The Cisco PSIRT openVuln application programming interface (API) is a RESTful API that conforms to the [representational state transfer](https://restfulapi.net/) (REST) software architectural style and allows customers to obtain Cisco security vulnerability information in different machine-consumable formats. To learn about accessing and using the API, visit the [PSIRT page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) on the Cisco DevNet website.

### **My Notifications**

The [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) allows registered Cisco.com users to subscribe to and receive important Cisco product and technology information, including Cisco Security Advisories. This service provides an improved unified subscription experience, allowing users to choose the timing of notifications as well as the notification delivery method (email or RSS feed). The level of access will be determined by the subscriber's relationship with Cisco.

### Creating a Notification

To create a notification, use the following steps:

1. Log in to the [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) on Cisco.com using a registered Cisco.com account name and password.

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

## About RADIUS

The RADIUS
distributed client/server system allows you to secure networks against
unauthorized access. In the Cisco implementation, RADIUS clients run on
Cisco NX-OS
devices and send authentication and accounting requests to a central RADIUS
server that contains all user authentication and network service access
information.

* [RADIUS Network Environments](#con_1441613)
* [RADIUS Operation](#con_1441622)
* [RADIUS Server Monitoring](#con_1441635)
* [Vendor-Specific Attributes](#con_1446686)

### RADIUS Network Environments

RADIUS can be
implemented in a variety of network environments that require high levels of
security while maintaining network access for remote users.

You can use RADIUS
in the following network environments that require access security:

* Networks with
  multiple-vendor network devices, each supporting RADIUS. For example, network
  devices from several vendors can use a single RADIUS server-based security
  database.
* Networks already
  using RADIUS. You can add a
  Cisco NX-OS
  device with RADIUS to the network. This action might be the first step when you
  make a transition to a AAA server.
* Networks that
  require resource accounting. You can use RADIUS accounting independent of
  RADIUS authentication or authorization. The RADIUS accounting functions allow
  data to be sent at the start and end of services, indicating the amount of
  resources (such as time, packets, bytes, and so on) used during the session. An
  Internet service provider (ISP) might use a freeware-based version of the
  RADIUS access control and accounting software to meet special security and
  billing needs.
* Networks that
  support authentication profiles. Using the RADIUS server in your network, you
  can configure AAA authentication and set up per-user profiles. Per-user
  profiles enable the
  Cisco NX-OS
  device to better manage ports using their existing RADIUS solutions and to
  efficiently manage shared resources to offer different service-level
  agreements.

### RADIUS Operation

When a user attempts
to log in and authenticate to a
Cisco NX-OS
device using RADIUS, the following process occurs:

* The user is
  prompted for and enters a username and password.
* The username and
  encrypted password are sent over the network to the RADIUS server.
* The user
  receives one of the following responses from the RADIUS server:

  ACCEPT

  The user is
  authenticated.

  REJECT

  The user is
  not authenticated and is prompted to reenter the username and password, or
  access is denied.

  CHALLENGE

  A challenge
  is issued by the RADIUS server. The challenge collects additional data from the
  user.

  CHANGE
  PASSWORD

  A request
  is issued by the RADIUS server, asking the user to select a new password.

The ACCEPT or REJECT
response is bundled with additional data that is used for EXEC or network
authorization. You must first complete RADIUS authentication before using
RADIUS authorization. The additional data included with the ACCEPT or REJECT
packets consists of the following:

* Services that
  the user can access, including Telnet, rlogin, or local-area transport (LAT)
  connections, and Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP), Serial Line Internet Protocol
  (SLIP), or EXEC services.
* Connection
  parameters, including the host or client IPv4 or IPv6 address, access list, and
  user timeouts.

### RADIUS Server Monitoring

An unresponsive
RADIUS server can cause a delay in processing AAA requests. You can configure
the
Cisco NX-OS
device to periodically monitor a RADIUS server to check whether it is
responding (or alive) to save time in processing AAA requests. The
Cisco NX-OS
device marks unresponsive RADIUS servers as dead and does not send AAA requests
to any dead RADIUS servers. The
Cisco NX-OS
device periodically monitors the dead RADIUS servers and brings them to the
alive state once they respond. This monitoring process verifies that a RADIUS
server is in a working state before real AAA requests are sent its way.
Whenever a RADIUS server changes to the dead or alive state, a Simple Network
Management Protocol (SNMP) trap is generated and the
Cisco NX-OS
device displays an error message that a failure is taking place.

Figure 1.  RADIUS Server
States. This figure
shows the states for RADIUS server monitoring.

| **Note** | ---   The monitoring interval for alive servers and dead servers are different and can be configured by the user. The RADIUS server monitoring is performed by sending a test authentication request to the RADIUS server.   --- |

### Vendor-Specific Attributes

The Internet
Engineering Task Force (IETF) draft standard specifies a method for
communicating VSAs between the network access server and the RADIUS server. The
IETF uses attribute 26. VSAs allow vendors to support their own extended
attributes that are not suitable for general use. The Cisco RADIUS
implementation supports one vendor-specific option using the format recommended
in the specification. The Cisco vendor ID is 9, and the supported option is
vendor type 1, which is named cisco-av-pair. The value is a string with the
following format:

```
protocol : attribute separator value *

```

The protocol is a
Cisco attribute for a particular type of authorization, the separator is =
(equal sign) for mandatory attributes, and \* (asterisk) indicates optional
attributes.

When you use RADIUS
servers for authentication on a
Cisco NX-OS
device, the RADIUS protocol directs the RADIUS server to return user
attributes, such as authorization information, with authentication results.
This authorization information is specified through VSAs.

The following VSA
protocol options are supported by the
Cisco NX-OS
software:

Shell

Protocol used
in access-accept packets to provide user profile information.

Accounting

Protocol used
in accounting-request packets. If a value contains any white spaces, you should
enclose the value within double quotation marks.

The
Cisco NX-OS
software supports the following attributes:

roles

Lists all the
roles to which the user belongs. The value field is a string that lists the
role names delimited by white space. For example, if the user belongs to roles
network-operator and network-admin, the value field would be network-operator
network-admin. This subattribute, which the RADIUS server sends in the VSA
portion of the Access-Accept frames, can only be used with the shell protocol
value. The following examples show the roles attribute that is supported by the
Cisco Access Control Server (ACS):
```

shell:roles=network-operator network-admin

shell:roles*“network-operator network-admin

```

The following
examples show the roles attribute that is supported by FreeRADIUS:

```

Cisco-AVPair = shell:roles=\network-operator network-admin\

Cisco-AVPair = shell:roles*\network-operator network-admin\

```

| **Note** | ---   When you specify a VSA as shell:roles\*"network-operator network-admin" or "shell:roles\*\"network-operator network-admin\"", this VSA is flagged as an optional attribute and other Cisco devices ignore this attribute.   --- |
| --- | --- |

accountinginfo

Stores
accounting information in addition to the attributes covered by a standard
RADIUS accounting protocol. This attribute is sent only in the VSA portion of
the Account-Request frames from the RADIUS client on the switch. It can be used
only with the accounting protocol data units (PDUs).

## About RADIUS Change of Authorization

A standard RADIUS interface is typically used in a pulled model, in which the request originates from a device attached to
a network and the response is sent from the queried servers. Cisco NX-OS sofware supports the RADIUS Change of Authorization
(CoA) request defined in RFC 5176 that is used in a pushed model, in which the request originates from the external server
to the device attached to the network, and enables the dynamic reconfiguring of sessions from external authentication, authorization,
and accounting (AAA) or policy servers.

When Dot1x is enabled, the network device acts as the authenticator and is responsible for processing dynamic COA per session.

The following requests are supported:

* Session reauthentication
* Session termination

* [Session Reauthentication](#id_93191)
* [Session Termination](#id_93192)

### Session Reauthentication

To initiate session reauthentication, the authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) server sends a standard CoA-Request
message that contains a Cisco VSA and one or more session identification attributes. The Cisco VSA is in the form of Cisco:Avpair=“subscriber:command=reauthenticate”.

The current session state determines the response of the device to the message in the following scenarios:

* If the session is currently authenticated by IEEE 802.1x, the device responds by sending an Extensible Authentication Protocol
  over LAN (EAPOL)-RequestId message to the server.
* If the session is currently authenticated by MAC authentication bypass (MAB), the device sends an access request to the server,
  passing the same identity attributes used for the initial successful authentication.
* If session authentication is in progress when the device receives the command, the device terminates the process and restarts
  the authentication sequence, starting with the method configured to be attempted first.

### Session Termination

A CoA Disconnect-Request terminates the session without disabling the host port. CoA Disconnect-Request termination causes
reinitialization of the authenticator state machine for the specified host, but does not restrict the host’s access to the
network.

If the session cannot be located, the device returns a Disconnect-NAK message with the “Session Context Not Found” error-code
attribute.

If the session is located, but the NAS was unable to remove the session due to some internal error, the device returns a Disconnect-NAK
message with the “Session Context Not Removable” error-code attribute.

If the session is located, the device terminates the session. After the session has been completely removed, the device returns
a Disconnect-ACK message.

## Prerequisites for RADIUS

RADIUS has the
following prerequisites:

* Obtain IPv4 or
  IPv6 addresses or hostnames for the RADIUS servers.
* Obtain keys from
  the RADIUS servers.
* Ensure that the
  Cisco NX-OS
  device is configured as a RADIUS client of the AAA servers.

## Guidelines and Limitations for RADIUS

RADIUS has the following guidelines and limitations:

* You can configure a maximum of 64 RADIUS servers on the Cisco NX-OS device.
* If you have a user account configured on the local Cisco NX-OS device that has the same name as a remote user account on an AAA server, the Cisco NX-OS software applies the user roles for the local user account to the remote user, not the user roles configured on the AAA server.
* Only the RADIUS protocol supports one-time passwords.
* For N9K-X9636C-R and N9K-X9636Q-R line cards and the N9K-C9508-FM-R fabric module, RADIUS authentication fails for usernames
  with special characters.
* Cisco Nexus 9K Series switches support the CLI command, aaa authentication login ascii-authentication, only for TACAAS+, but not for RADIUS. Ensure that you have disabled aaa authentication login ascii-authentication switch so that the default authentication, PAP, is enabled. Otherwise, you will see syslog errors.

## Guidelines and Limitations for RADIUS Change of Authorization

RADIUS Change of Authorization has the following guidelines and limitations:

* RADIUS Change of Authorization is supported on FEX.
* RADIUS change of Authorization is supported for VXLAN EVPN.

## Default Settings for RADIUS

### Configuring RADIUS Server Groups

You can specify one
or more remote AAA servers for authentication using server groups. All members
of a group must belong to the RADIUS protocol. The servers are tried in the
same order in which you configure them.

You can configure
these server groups at any time but they only take effect when you apply them
to an AAA service.

#### Before you begin

Ensure that all
servers in the group are RADIUS servers.

#### Procedure

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | configure terminal  Example: ``` switch# configure terminal switch(config)# ``` | Enters global configuration mode. |
| **Step 2** | aaa group server radius group-name  Example: ``` switch(config)# aaa group server radius RadServer switch(config-radius)# ``` | Creates a RADIUS server group and enters the RADIUS server group configuration submode for that group. The group-name argument is a case-sensitive alphanumeric string with a maximum length of 127 characters.  To delete a RADIUS server group, use the **no** form of this command.   | **Note** | You are not allowed to delete the default system generated default group (RADIUS). | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 3** | server {ipv4-address | ipv6-address | hostname}  Example: ``` switch(config-radius)# server 10.10.1.1 ``` | Configures the RADIUS server as a member of the RADIUS server group.  If the specified RADIUS server is not found, configure it using the radius-server host  command and retry this command. |
| **Step 4** | (Optional) deadtime minutes  Example: ``` switch(config-radius)# deadtime 30 ``` | (Optional)  Configures the monitoring dead time. The default is 0 minutes. The range is from 1 through 1440.   | **Note** | If the dead-time interval for a RADIUS server group is greater than zero (0), that value takes precedence over the global dead-time value. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 5** | (Optional)  server {ipv4-address | ipv6-address | hostname}  Example: ``` switch(config-radius)# server 10.10.1.1 ``` | (Optional)  Configures the RADIUS server as a member of the RADIUS server group.   | **Tip** | If the specified RADIUS server is not found, configure it using the radius-server host command and retry this command. | | --- | --- | |

[Configuring the RADIUS Dead-Time Interval](#task_1442992)

### Configuring the Global Source Interface for RADIUS Server Groups

You can configure a
global source interface for RADIUS server groups to use when accessing RADIUS
servers. You can also configure a different source interface for a specific
RADIUS server group. By default, the
Cisco NX-OS
software uses any available interface.

#### Procedure

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | configure terminal  Example: ``` switch# configure terminal switch(config) ``` | Enters global configuration mode. |
| **Step 2** | ip radius source-interface interface  Example: ``` switch(config)# ip radius source-interface mgmt 0 ``` | Configures the global source interface for all RADIUS server groups configured on the device. |

| **Step 5** | (Optional) copy running-config startup config  Example: ``` switch# copy running-config startup-config ``` | (Optional)  Copies the running configuration to the startup configuration. |

**Related Tasks**
[Configuring RADIUS Server Groups](#task_1452929)

### Allowing Users to Specify a RADIUS Server at Login

By default, the
Cisco NX-OS
device forwards an authentication request based on the default AAA
authentication method. You can configure the
Cisco NX-OS
device to allow the user to specify a VRF and RADIUS server to send the
authentication request by enabling the directed-request option. If you enable
this option, the user can log in as
username@vrfname:hostname , where
vrfname is the VRF to use and
hostname is the name of a configured RADIUS server.

| **Note** | ---   If you enable the directed-request option, the Cisco NX-OS device uses only the RADIUS method for authentication and not the default local method.   --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---   User-specified logins are supported only for Telnet sessions.   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Procedure

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | configure terminal  Example: ``` switch# configure terminal switch(config)# ``` | Enters global configuration mode. |
| **Step 2** | radius-server directed-request  Example: ``` switch(config)# radius-server directed-request ``` | Allows users to specify a RADIUS server to send the authentication request when logging in. The default is disabled. |
| **Step 3** | exit  Example: ``` switch(config)# exit switch# ``` | Exits configuration mode. |
| **Step 4** | (Optional) show radius-server directed-request  Example: ``` switch# show radius-server directed-request ``` | (Optional)  Displays the directed request configuration. |
| **Step 5** | (Optional) copy running-config startup-config  Example: ``` switch# copy running-config startup-config ``` | (Optional)  Copies the running configuration to the startup configuration. |

### Configuring the Global RADIUS Transmission Retry Count and Timeout Interval

You can configure a
global retransmission retry count and timeout interval for all RADIUS servers.
By default, a
Cisco NX-OS
device retries transmission to a RADIUS server only once before reverting to
local authentication. You can increase this number up to a maximum of five
retries per server. The timeout interval determines how long the
Cisco NX-OS
device waits for responses from RADIUS servers before declaring a timeout
failure.

#### Procedure

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | configure terminal  Example: ``` switch# configure terminal switch(config)# ``` | Enters global configuration mode. |
| **Step 2** | radius-server retransmit count  Example: ``` switch(config)# radius-server retransmit 3 ``` | Specifies the retransmission count for all RADIUS servers. The default retransmission count is 1 and the range is from 0 to 5. |
| **Step 3** | radius-server timeout seconds  Example: ``` switch(config)# radius-server timeout 10 ``` | Specifies the transmission timeout interval for RADIUS servers. The default timeout interval is 5 seconds and the range is from 1 to 60 seconds. |
| **Step 4** | exit  Example: ``` switch(config)# exit switch# ``` | Exits configuration mode. |
| **Step 5** | (Optional) show radius-server  Example: ``` switch# show radius-server ``` | (Optional)  Displays the RADIUS server configuration. |
| **Step 6** | (Optional) copy running-config startup-config  Example: ``` switch# copy running-config startup-config ``` | (Optional)  Copies the running configuration to the startup configuration. |

### Configuring Accounting and Authentication Attributes for RADIUS Servers

You can specify that
a RADIUS server is to be used only for accounting purposes or only for
authentication purposes. By default, RADIUS servers are used for both
accounting and authentication. You can also specify the destination UDP port
numbers where RADIUS accounting and authentication messages should be sent if
there is a conflict with the default port.

#### Before you begin

Configure one or
more RADIUS server hosts.

### Configuring Global Periodic RADIUS Server Monitoring

You can monitor the
availability of all RADIUS servers without having to configure the test
parameters for each server individually. Any servers for which test parameters
are not configured are monitored using the global level parameters.

| **Note** | ---   Test parameters that are configured for individual servers take precedence over global test parameters.   --- |
| --- | --- |

The global
configuration parameters include the username and password to use for the
servers and an idle timer. The idle timer specifies the interval in which a
RADIUS server receives no requests before the
Cisco NX-OS
device sends out a test packet. You can configure this option to test servers
periodically, or you can run a one-time only test.

| **Note** | ---   To protect network security, we recommend that you use a username that is not the same as an existing username in the RADIUS database.   --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---   The default idle timer value is 0 minutes. When the idle time interval is 0 minutes, periodic RADIUS server monitoring is not performed.   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Before you begin

Enable RADIUS.

#### Procedure

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | configure terminal  Example: ``` switch# configure terminal switch(config)# ``` | Enters global configuration mode. |

The default username is test, and the default password is test. The default value for the idle timer is 0 minutes, and the valid range is from 0 to 1440 minutes.   | **Note** | For periodic RADIUS server monitoring, the idle timer value must be greater than 0. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 3** | radius-server deadtime minutes  Example: ``` switch(config)# radius-server deadtime 5 ``` | Specifies the number of minutes before the Cisco NX-OS device checks a RADIUS server that was previously unresponsive. The default value is 0 minutes, and the valid range is from 0 to 1440 minutes. |
| **Step 4** | exit  Example: ``` switch(config)# exit switch# ``` | Exits configuration mode. |
| **Step 5** | (Optional) show radius-server  Example: ``` switch# show radius-server ``` | (Optional)  Displays the RADIUS server configuration. |
| **Step 6** | (Optional) copy running-config startup-config  Example: ``` switch# copy running-config startup-config ``` | (Optional)  Copies the running configuration to the startup configuration. |

### Configuring Periodic RADIUS Server Monitoring on Individual Servers

You can monitor the
availability of individual RADIUS servers. The configuration parameters include
the username and password to use for the server and an idle timer. The idle
timer specifies the interval during which a RADIUS server receives no requests
before the
Cisco NX-OS
device sends out a test packet. You can configure this option to test servers
periodically, or you can run a one-time only test.

| **Note** | ---   Test parameters that are configured for individual servers take precedence over global test parameters.   --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---   For security reasons, we recommend that you do not configure a test username that is the same as an existing user in the RADIUS database.   --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---   The default idle timer value is 0 minutes. When the idle time interval is 0 minutes, the Cisco NX-OS device does not perform periodic RADIUS server monitoring.   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Before you begin

Enable RADIUS.

Add one or more
RADIUS server hosts.

#### Procedure

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |

### Configuring the RADIUS Dead-Time Interval

You can configure
the dead-time interval for all RADIUS servers. The dead-time interval specifies
the time that the
Cisco NX-OS
device waits after declaring a RADIUS server is dead, before sending out a test
packet to determine if the server is now alive. The default value is 0 minutes.

| **Note** | ---   When the dead-time interval is 0 minutes, RADIUS servers are not marked as dead even if they are not responding. You can configure the dead-time interval for a RADIUS server group.   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Procedure

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | configure terminal  Example: ``` switch# configure terminal switch(config)# ``` | Enters global configuration mode. |
| **Step 2** | radius-server deadtime  minutes  Example: ``` switch(config)# radius-server deadtime 5 ``` | Configures the dead-time interval. The default value is 0 minutes. The range is from 1 to 1440 minutes. |
| **Step 3** | exit  Example: ``` switch(config)# exit switch# ``` | Exits configuration mode. |
| **Step 4** | (Optional) show radius-server  Example: ``` switch# show radius-server ``` | (Optional)  Displays the RADIUS server configuration. |
| **Step 5** | (Optional) copy running-config startup-config  Example: ``` switch# copy running-config startup-config ``` | (Optional)  Copies the running configuration to the startup configuration. |

### Configuring One-Time Passwords

One-time password (OTP) support is available for Cisco NX-OS devices through the use of RSA SecurID token servers. With this feature, users
authenticate to a Cisco NX-OS device by entering both a personal identification number (or one-time password)
and the token code being displayed at that moment on their RSA SecurID token.

| **Note** | ---   The token code used for logging into the Cisco NX-OS device changes every 60 seconds. To prevent problems with device discovery, we recommend using different usernames that are present on the Cisco Secure ACS internal database.   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Before you begin

On the Cisco NX-OS device, configure a RADIUS server host and remote default login authentication.

Ensure that the following are installed:

* Cisco Secure Access Control Server (ACS) version 4.2
* RSA Authentication Manager version 7.1 (the RSA SecurID token server)
* RSA ACE Agent/Client

No configuration (other than a RADIUS server host and remote authentication) is
required on the Cisco NX-OS device to support one-time passwords. However, you must configure the Cisco
Secure ACS as follows:

1. Enable RSA SecurID token server authentication.
2. Add the RSA SecurID token server to the Unknown User Policy database.

### Manually Monitoring RADIUS Servers or Groups

You can manually
issue a test message to a RADIUS server or to a server group.

#### Procedure

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | test aaa server radius {ipv4-address | ipv6-address | hostname} [vrf  vrf-name] username password  Example: ``` switch# test aaa server radius 10.10.1.1 user1 Ur2Gd2BH ``` | Sends a test message to a RADIUS server to confirm availability. |
| **Step 2** | test aaa group group-name username password  Example: ``` switch# test aaa group RadGroup user2 As3He3CI ``` | Sends a test message to a RADIUS server group to confirm availability. |

## Enabling or Disabling Dynamic Author Server

### Procedure

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | configure terminal  Example: ``` switch# configure terminal switch(config)# ``` | Enters global configuration mode. |
| **Step 2** | aaa server radius dynamic-author  Example: ``` switch(config)# aaa server radius dynamic-author  ``` | Enables the RADIUS dynamic author server. You can disable the RADIUS dynamic author server using the no form of this command. |

## Configuring RADIUS Change of Authorization

### Procedure

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | configure terminal  Example: ``` switch# configure terminal switch(config)# ``` | Enters global configuration mode. |
| **Step 2** | [no] aaa server radius dynamic-author  Example: ``` switch(config)# aaa server radius dynamic-author  ``` | Configures the switch as an AAA server to facilitate interaction with an external policy server. You can disable the RADIUS dynamic author and the associated clients using the no form of this command. |
| **Step 3** | [no] client {ip-address | hostname } [server-key [0 | 7 ] string ]  Example: ``` switch(config-locsvr-da-radius)# client 192.168.0.5 server-key cisco1 ``` | Configures the IP address or the hostname of the AAA server client. Use the optional server-key keyword and string argument to configure the server key at the client level. You can remove the client server using the no form of this command.   | **Note** | Configuring the server key at the client level overrides the server key that is configured at the global level. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 4** | [no] port port-number  Example: ``` switch(config-locsvr-da-radius)# port 3799 ``` | Specifies the port on which a device listens to the RADIUS requests from the configured RADIUS clients. The port range is 1 - 65535. You can revert to the default port using the no form of this command.   | **Note** | The default port for a packet of disconnect is 1700. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 5** | [no] server-key [0 | 7 ] string | Configures the global RADIUS key to be shared between a device and the RADIUS clients. You can remove the server-key using the no form of this command. |

## About SMUs

A software maintenance
upgrade (SMU) is a package file that contains fixes for a specific defect. SMUs
are created to respond to immediate issues and do not include new features.
Typically, SMUs do not have a large impact on device operations. SMU versions
are synchronized to the package major, minor, and maintenance versions they
upgrade.

The effect of an SMU
depends on its type:

* Process restart
  SMU-Causes a process or group of processes to restart on activation.
* Reload SMU-Causes
  a parallel reload of supervisors and line cards.

SMUs are not an alternative to maintenance releases. They provide a quick resolution of critical issues. All defects fixed
by SMUs are integrated into the next maintenance releases of upcoming software trains, as applicable. SMUs also have the following
considerations:

* SMUs are created for the following:

  + Critical SIR PSIRTs without a workaround or fix
  + Severity1 and Severity2 issues without a workaround or fix
* If a fix is already available in a maintenance release of the same software train or already released on a later long-lived
  release, no SMU is provided. You are encouraged to acquire the fix from the maintenance release.

  | **Note** | ---   Depending on the fix, in some cases it may not be possible to provide an SMU. In such cases, the only option is to upgrade to the next maintenance release when available.   --- |
  | --- | --- |

For information on
upgrading your device to a new feature or maintenance release, see the
[Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Software Upgrade
and Downgrade Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus9000/sw/7-x/upgrade/guide/b_Cisco_Nexus_9000_Series_NX-OS_Software_Upgrade_and_Downgrade_Guide_Release_7x.html).

For information on Cisco NX-OS optionality feature, see the [Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Software Upgrade and Downgrade Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/switches/nexus-9000-series-switches/products-installation-and-configuration-guides-list.html).

| **Note** | ---  Activating an SMU does not cause any earlier SMUs, or the package to which the SMU applies, to be automatically deactivated.  --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---   Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 7.0(3)I2(1), SMU package files have an .rpm extension. Earlier files have a .bin extension.   --- |

* [Impact of Package Activation and Deactivation](#concept_BF7F175B8B08473CA378A12F1D05BE41)

### Package Management

The general procedure
for adding and activating SMU packages on the device is as follows:

1. Copy the package file or files to a local storage device or file server.
2. Add the package or packages on the device using the install add command.
3. Activate the package or packages on the device using the install activate command.
4. Commit the current set of packages using the install commit command.
5. (Optional) Deactivate and remove the package.

The following figure
illustrates the key steps in the package management process.

Figure 1. Process to Add,
Activate, and Commit SMU Packages

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/500001-600000/500001-510000/503001-504000/503009.jpg)

### Impact of Package Activation and Deactivation

The activation or
deactivation of an SMU package can have an immediate impact on the system. The
system can be affected in the following ways:

* New processes
  might be started.
* Running processes
  might be stopped or restarted.
* All processes in
  the line cards might be restarted. Restarting processes in the line cards is
  equivalent to a soft reset.
* The line cards
  might reload.
* No processes in
  the line cards might be affected.

| **Note** | ---  You must address any issues that result from the revised configuration and reapply the configuration, if necessary.  --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Tip** | ---  After the activation process completes, enter the show install log command to display the process results.  --- |
| --- | --- |

## Prerequisites for SMUs

These prerequisites
must be met for a package to be activated or deactivated:

* You must be in a
  user group associated with a task group that includes the proper task IDs. If
  you suspect a user group assignment is preventing you from using a command,
  contact your AAA administrator for assistance.
* Verify that all
  line cards are installed and operating properly. For example, do not activate
  or deactivate packages while line cards are booting, while line cards are being
  upgraded or replaced, or when you anticipate an automatic switchover activity.

## Guidelines and Limitations for SMUs

SMUs have the following guidelines and limitations:

* Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 9.3(9), you can apply a reload SMU along with (ND) ISSU to the same image version (currently
  running an image on the switch) without a disruptive reload of the switch. You can apply a reload SMU by upgrading to the
  same image version using ND-ISSU along with the reload SMU using the install all nxos
  <same image>
  package
  <smu>
  non-disruptive  command.
* No-reload options are supported in Cisco NX-OS Release 9.3(9) for the SMU installation. The no-immediate-reload  option is used for activating or deactivating the SMU feature.
* Some packages require the activation or deactivation of other packages. If the SMUs have dependencies on each other, you cannot
  activate them without first activating the previous ones.
* SMU packages being activated must be compatible with the image version running in the switch.
* Activation is performed only after the package compatibility checks have been passed. If a conflict is found, an error message
  is displayed.
* You can install multiple SMU packages by creating a tar bundle. See the [Advanced SMU Installation Methods](#advanced-smu-installation-methods) section for more details.
* While a software package is being activated, other requests are not allowed to run on any of the impacted nodes. Package activation
  is completed when a message similar to this one appears:

  ```
  Install operation 1 completed successfully at Thu Jan 9 01:19:24 2014
  ```
* Each CLI install request is assigned a request ID, which can be used later to review the events.

### Preparing for Package Installation

You should use
several
show commands to gather information in preparation for
the SMU package installation.

#### Before you begin

Determine if a
software change is required.

Verify that the new
package is supported on your system. Some software packages require that other
packages or package versions be activated, and some packages support only
specific line cards.

Review the release
notes for important information related to that release and to help determine
the package compatibility with your device configuration.

Verify that the system is up, stable, and prepared for the software changes.

#### Procedure

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | show logging logfile | grep -i "System ready"  Example: ``` switch# show logging logfile | grep -i "System ready" ``` | Displays if your system is up. Use this command to verify that the system is ready for SMU package installation. Configuring install commands before the system is ready, may result with an "Install operation 11 failed because cannot lock config" error message. |
| **Step 2** | show install active  Example: ``` switch# show install active ``` | Displays the active software on the device. Use this command to determine what software should be added on the device and to compare to the active software report after installation operations are complete. |
| **Step 3** | show module  Example: ``` switch# show module ``` | Confirms that all modules are in the stable state. |
| **Step 4** | show clock  Example: ``` switch# show clock ``` | Verifies that the system clock is correct. Software operations use certificates based on device clock times. |

#### Example

This example shows how to verify that the system is up. A "System ready" response indicates that the system is ready for SMU
package installation.
```
switch# show logging logfile | grep -i "System ready"
2018 Feb 19 11:13:04 switch %ASCII-CFG-2-CONF_CONTROL: System ready

```

This example shows
how to display the active packages for the entire system. Use this information
to determine if a software change is required.

```
switch# show install active
Boot Image:
        NXOS Image: bootflash:///nxos.7.0.3.I7.3.1.bin

Active Packages:

switch#

```

This example shows
how to display the current system clock setting:

```
switch# show clock
02:14:51.474 PST Wed Jan 04 2014

```

### Downloading the SMU Package File from Cisco.com

Follow these steps
to download the SMU package file:

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Log in to Cisco.com. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Go to the Download Software page at this URL: <http://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.html> |
| **Step 3** | In the Select a Product list, choose **Switches** > **Data Center Switches** > **Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Switches** > model. |
| **Step 4** | Choose the appropriate SMU file for your device and click **Download**. |

---

### Copying the Package File to a Local Storage Device or Network Server

You must copy the
SMU package file to a local storage device or a network file server to which
the device has access. After this task is done, the package can be added and
activated on the device.

If you need to store
package files on the device, we recommend that you store the files on the hard
disk. The boot device is the local disk from which the package is added and
activated. The default boot device is bootflash:.

| **Tip** | ---  Before you copy package files to a local storage device, use the dir command to determine if the required package files are already on the device.  --- |
| --- | --- |

If the SMU package
files are located on a remote TFTP, FTP, or SFTP server, you can copy the files
to a local storage device. After the files are located on the local storage
device, the package can be added and activated on the device from that storage
device. The following server protocols are supported:

* Trivial File
  Transfer Protocol—TFTP allows files to be transferred from one computer to
  another over a network, usually without the use of client authentication (for
  example, username and password). It is a simplified version of FTP.

  | **Note** | ---  Some package files might be larger than 32 MB, and the TFTP services provided by some vendors might not support a file this large. If you do not have access to a TFTP server that supports files larger than 32 MB, download the file using FTP.  --- |
  | --- | --- |
* File Transfer
  Protocol—FTP is part of the TCP/IP protocol stack and requires a username and
  password.
* SSH File
  Transfer Protocol—SFTP is part of the SSHv2 feature in the security package and
  provides for secure file transfers. For more information, see the
  [Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Security
  Configuration Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus9000/sw/7-x/security/configuration/guide/b_Cisco_Nexus_9000_Series_NX-OS_Security_Configuration_Guide_7x.html).

| **Note** | ---  Consult your system administrator for the location and availability of your network server.  --- |
| --- | --- |

Use the commands in
the following table to copy the SMU package file from the server to your device
using the file transfer protocols.

Table 1. Commands for
Copying SMU Package Files to the Device

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| copy tftp://hostname-or-ipaddress/directory-path/filename bootflash:  ``` switch# copy tftp://10.1.1.1/images/ nxos.CSCab00001-n9k_ALL-1.0.0-7.0.3.I5.1.lib32_n9000.rpm bootflash:  ``` | Copies the package file from the TFTP server to the bootflash:.   * hostname-or-ipaddress—The hostname or IP address of   the network file server. * directory-path—The   network file server path that leads to the package file to be added. * filename—The name   of the package file that you want to add. |
| copy ftp://username:password@hostname-or-ipaddress/directory-path/filename bootflash:  ``` switch# copy ftp://john:secret@10.1.1.1/images/ nxos.CSCab00001-n9k_ALL-1.0.0-7.0.3.I5.1.lib32_n9000.rpm bootflash:  ``` | Copies the package file from the FTP server to the bootflash:.   * username—The   username of the user who has access privileges to the directory in which the   package file is stored. * password—The   password associated with the username of the user who has access privileges to   the directory in which the package file is stored. If a password is not   provided, the networking device accepts anonymous FTP. * hostname-or-ipaddress—The hostname or IP address of   the network file server. * directory-path—The   network file server path that leads to the package file to be added. The   specified directory should be a directory under the home directory of the user.   In this example, the file being downloaded is in a subdirectory called "images"   in the home directory of the user "john."      | **Note** | For FTP services, directory-path is the directory relative to the username home directory. If you want to specify an absolute path for the directory, you must add a “/” following the server address. |   | --- | --- | * filename—The name   of the package file that you want to add. |
| copy sftp://hostname-or-ipaddress/directory-path/filename bootflash:  ``` switch# copy sftp://10.1.1.1/images/nxos.CSCab00001-n9k_ALL- 1.0.0-7.0.3.I5.1.lib32_n9000.rpm bootflash: ``` | Copies the package file from the SFTP server to the bootflash:.   * hostname-or-ipaddress—The hostname or IP address of   the network file server. * directory-path—The network file server path that leads   to the package file to be added. * filename—The name of the package file that you want to   add. |

After the SMU
package file has been transferred to a network file server or the local storage
device, you are ready to add and activate the file.

### Adding and Activating Packages

You can add SMU package files that are stored on a local storage device or on a remote TFTP, FTP, or SFTP server to your device.

| **Note** | ---   This procedure uses Cisco NX-OS CLI commands to add and activate RPM package files. If you would prefer to use YUM commands, follow the instructions in the "Installing RPMs from Bash" section of the [Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Programmability Guide](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus9000/sw/7-x/programmability/guide/b_Cisco_Nexus_9000_Series_NX-OS_Programmability_Guide_7x/Bash.html).   --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---  The SMU package being activated must be compatible with the currently active software to operate. When an activation is attempted, the system runs an automatic compatibility check to ensure that the package is compatible with the other active software on the device. If a conflict is found, an error message displays. The activation is performed only after all compatibility checks have been passed.  --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---  Activating an SMU does not cause any earlier SMUs or the package to which the SMU applies to be automatically deactivated.  --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Before you begin

Make sure that all
packages to be added are present on a local storage device or a network file
server.

Make sure that you
meet all of the prerequisites for the activation of packages.

Complete the
procedure described in
[Copying the Package File to a Local Storage Device or Network Server](#task_B304847A8D5845F39DC283F481E64A02).

#### Procedure

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | Connect to the console port and log in. | Establishes a CLI management session to the console port. |
| **Step 2** | (Optional) dir bootflash: | (Optional)  Displays the package files that are available to be added.   | **Note** | Only SMU package files can be added and activated using this procedure. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 3** | install add filename [activate]  Example: ``` switch# install add bootflash: nxos.CSCab00001-n9k_ALL-1.0.0-7.0.3.I5.1. lib32_n9000.rpm  ``` | Unpacks the package software files from the local storage device or network server and adds them to the bootflash: and all active and standby supervisors installed on the device.  The filename argument can take any of these formats:   * bootflash:filename * tftp://hostname-or-ipaddress/directory-path/filename * ftp://username:password@    hostname-or-ipaddress/directory-path/filename * usb1:filename * usb2:filename   For all SMU packages except the CSCur02700 SMU package, you can use the optional activate  keyword to automatically activate the package after it is added successfully.   | **Note** | For the CSCur02700 SMU package, use the install activate command in Step 5 to activate the package. Do not use the optional activate keyword with the install add command as the package might fail and require a reboot. | | --- | --- |   Multiple versions of an SMU package can be added to the storage device without impacting the running configuration, but only one version of a package can be activated for a line card.   | **Note** | Press **?** after a partial package name to display all possible matches available for activation. If there is only one match, press the **Tab** key to fill in the rest of the package name. | | --- | --- |   You can use the install add command with a tarball SMU to install multiple SMUs at the same time. |
| **Step 4** | (Optional) show install inactive  Example: ``` switch# show install inactive  ``` | (Optional)  Displays the inactive packages on the device. Verify that the package added in the previous step appears in the display. |
| **Step 5** | install activate filename  Example: ``` switch# install activate nxos.CSCab00001-n9k_ALL-1.0.0-7.0.3.I5.1. lib32_n9000.rpm  ```  Example: ``` switch# install activate nxos.CSCab00001-n9k_ALL-1.0.0-7.0.3.I5.1. lib32_n9000.rpm Install operation 18 !!WARNING!! This patch will get activated only after a reload of the switch. at Wed Jun 22 00:42:12 2016  ``` | Activates a package that was added to the device. SMU packages remain inactive until activated. (Skip this step if the package was activated earlier with the install add activate command.)   | **Tip** | After the activation process finishes, enter the show install log command to display the process results. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 6** | Repeat Step 5 until all packages are activated. | Activates additional packages as required. |
| **Step 7** | (Optional) show install active  Example: ``` switch# show install active  ``` | (Optional)  Displays all active packages. Use this command to determine if the correct packages are active. |

#### Example

This example shows how to add multiple SMU package files with a tarball and then verify the added package files.
```
switch# install add bootflash:nxos.CSC123456-n9k_ALL-1.0.0-7.0.3.I7.3.
lib32_n9000.tar
[####################] 100%
Install operation 882 completed successfully at Tue Mar  6 17:30:31 2018

switch#
switch# show install inactive
Boot Image:
        NXOS Image: bootflash:////nxos.7.0.3.I7.3.bin-219-CCO

Inactive Packages:
        nxos.CSC123456_core-n9k_ALL-1.0.0-7.0.3.I7.3.lib32_n9000
        nxos.CSC123456_eth-n9k_ALL-1.0.0-7.0.3.I7.3.lib32_n9000

Inactive Base Packages:

switch#

```

### Committing the Active Package Set

When an SMU package
is activated on the device, it becomes part of the current running
configuration. To make the package activation persistent across system-wide
reloads, you must commit the package on the device.

| **Note** | ---   On startup, the device loads the committed package set. If the system is reloaded before the current active package is committed, the previously committed package set is used.   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Before you begin

Before you commit a
package set, verify that the device is operating correctly and is forwarding
packets as expected.

Complete the
procedure described in
[Adding and Activating Packages](#task_77A6AAE7FD0F4B69896D8FDEDF65D633).

#### Procedure

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | install commit filename  Example: ``` switch# install commit nxos.CSCab00001-n9k_ALL-1.0.0-7.0.3.I5.1.lib32_n9000.rpm  ``` | Commits the current set of packages so that these packages are used if the device is restarted. |
| **Step 2** | (Optional) show install committed  Example: ``` switch# show install committed  ``` | (Optional)  Displays which packages are committed. |

#### Example

This example shows
how to commit active SMU packages on the device and then verify the committed
packages:

```
switch# install commit nxos.CSCab00001-n9k_ALL-1.0.0-7.0.3.I5.1.lib32_n9000.rpm
Install operation 2 completed successfully at Wed Jun 22 01:20:46 2016

switch# show install committed
Committed Packages:
nxos.CSCab00001-n9k_ALL-1.0.0-7.0.3.I5.1.lib32_n9000.rpm
```

### Deactivating and Removing Packages

When a package is
deactivated, it is no longer active on the device, but the package files remain
on the boot disk. The package files can be reactivated later, or they can be
removed from the disk.

The Cisco NX-OS
software also provides the flexibility to roll back the selected package set to
a previously saved package set. If you find that you prefer a previous package
set over the currently active package set, you can use the
install
deactivate and
install
commit commands to make a previously active package set active again.

| **Note** | ---   This procedure uses Cisco NX-OS CLI commands to deactivate and remove RPM package files. If you would prefer to use YUM commands, follow the instructions in the "Erasing an RPM" section of the [Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Programmability Guide](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus9000/sw/7-x/programmability/guide/b_Cisco_Nexus_9000_Series_NX-OS_Programmability_Guide_7x/Bash.html).   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Before you begin

You cannot
deactivate a package if it is required by another active package. When you
attempt to deactivate a package, the system runs an automatic check to ensure
that the package is not required by other active packages. The deactivation is
performed only after all compatibility checks have been passed.

You cannot delete a
package if it is part of the running or committed software of the device.

#### Procedure

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | Connect to the console port and log in. | Establishes a CLI management session to the console port. |
| **Step 2** | install deactivate filename  Example: ``` switch# install deactivate nxos.CSCab00001-n9k_ALL-1.0.0-7.0.3.I5.1.lib32_n9000.rpm  ``` | Deactivates a package that was added to the device and turns off the package features for the line card.   | **Note** | You must run install commit after install deactivate to deactivate the package completely, otherwise the package gets activated again after reload. For reload SMU, run install commit after the device reloads. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 3** | (Optional) show install inactive  Example: ``` switch# show install inactive  ``` | (Optional)  Displays the inactive packages on the device. |
| **Step 4** | (Optional) install commit  Example: ``` switch# install commit  ``` | (Optional)  Commits the current set of packages so that these packages are used if the device is restarted.   | **Note** | Packages can be removed only if the deactivation operation is committed. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 5** | (Optional) install remove {filename | inactive}  Example: ``` switch# install remove nxos.CSCab00001-n9k_ALL-1.0.0-7.0.3.I5.1.lib32_n9000.rpm Proceed with removing nxos.CSCab00001-n9k_ALL-1.0.0-7.0.3.I5.1.lib32_n9000.rpm? (y/n)? [n] y  ```  Example: ``` switch# install remove inactive Proceed with removing? (y/n)? [n] y  ``` | (Optional)  Removes the inactive package.   * Only inactive packages can be   removed. * Packages can be removed only   if they are deactivated from all line cards in the device. * The package deactivation must   be committed. * To remove a specific inactive   package from a storage device, use the   install remove command with the   filename argument. * To remove all inactive   packages from all nodes in the system, use the   install remove command with the   inactive keyword. |

#### Example

This example shows how to deactivate a package, commit the changes, and remove the inactive package from the device:

```
switch# install deactivate nxos.CSCab00001-n9k_ALL-1.0.0-7.0.3.I5.1.lib32_n9000.rpm
Install operation 3 completed successfully at Wed Jun 22 01:20:36 2016

switch# show install inactive
Inactive Packages:
nxos.CSCab00001-n9k_ALL-1.0.0-7.0.3.I5.1.lib32_n9000.rpm

switch# install commit
Install operation 4 completed successfully at Wed Jun 22 01:20:46 2016

switch# install remove nxos.CSCab00001-n9k_ALL-1.0.0-7.0.3.I5.1.lib32_n9000.rpm
Proceed with removing nxos.CSCab00001-n9k_ALL-1.0.0-7.0.3.I5.1.lib32_n9000.rpm? (y/n)? [n] y
Install operation 5 completed successfully at Wed Jun 22 01:20:57 2016

```

This example shows how to deactivate multiple packages with one command, remove the inactive packages from the device, and
verify the package removal:

```
switch# install deactivate nxos.CSC123456_core-n9k_ALL-1.0.0-7.0.3.I7.3.

### Advanced SMU Installation Methods

* [Installing Multiple SMU Packages Using a Single TAR File](#installing-multiple-smu-packages-using-one-single-tar-file)
* [Installing SMU Packages as Part of the New NX-OS Software Image Installation](#installing-smu-packages-as-part-of-the-new-nx-os-software-image-installation)

#### Installing Multiple SMU Packages Using a Single TAR File

If you want to install multiple SMU packages, you can create a single TAR bundle file and use it across the switches in the
Data Center.

Follow these steps to generate a TAR file from a given list of SMU packages downloaded from a software download center.

| **Note** | ---   The file name mentioned in the following examples is for illustration purposes only, and the actual file name will depend on the appropriate release.   --- |
| --- | --- |

##### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Create a new folder in the user computer or virtual machine.  ``` bash# mkdir nx931 ``` |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Download the required SMU packages from the Cisco Software Download Center portal and copy the SMU packages to the new folder.  ``` bash# cp nxos32-cs.CSCxy11111-1.0.0-9.3.1.lib32_32_n9000.rpm  nx931/ bash# cp nxos32-cs.CSCxy22222-1.0.0-9.3.1.lib32_32_n9000.rpm  nx931/  ``` |
| **Step 3** | Create a tar bundle file.  ``` bash# cd nx931 bash# tar cf nxos32-cs.9.3.1.smu.bundle.tar *.rpm  ``` |
| **Step 4** | Use the existing install add filename activate  command to install the SMU packages from the TAR bundle.  ``` switch# install add nxos32-cs.9.3.1.smu.bundle.tar activate ``` |

#### Installing SMU Packages as Part of the New NX-OS Software Image Installation

On Cisco Nexus switches, the NX-OS software image can be upgraded to a newer version using the install all  command. This command has been enhanced to include SMU packages apart from the NX-OS switch software image, which benefits
the software maintenance operations by reducing the number of reload required during the installation process for both the
software image and SMU packages.

The install all  command can be initiated with a single .tar bundle file containing either:

* One NX-OS software image and a single SMU .rpm file
* One NX-OS software image and a tar bundle of multiple SMU .rpm files

| **Note** | ---   The child tar bundle must not contain a mix of SMU .rpm files and another tar bundle of SMU .rpm files.   --- |
| --- | --- |

When the install all  command is initiated with one or more SMU .rpm files, the switch will automatically commit the SMU files after the upgrade.

If the switch is reloaded during bootup, the SMUs will not be applied and will remain in an inactive state. The SMUs can be
installed using the install all  or install activate  commands.

The following section describes all the supported scenarios when SMU packages are included in the install all  command.

| **Note** | ---   The filename mentioned in the following examples is for illustration purposes only, and the actual filename will depend on the appropriate release.   --- |
| --- | --- |

**Example-1**: In this scenario, a new software image and a single SMU package is used.
```
switch# install all nxos nxos32-cs.9.3.1.M.bin package nxos32-cs.CSCxy11111-1.0.0-9.3.1.lib32_32_n9000.rpm
```

**Example-2**: In this scenario, a set of SMU packages are created as a TAR bundle following the TAR file method mentioned above and installed
along with the NX-OS software image.
```
switch# install all nxos nxos32-cs.9.3.1.M.bin package nxos32-cs.9.3.1.smu.bundle.tar
```

**Example-3**: In this scenario, a single SMU package and the NX-OS software image can be bundled into one single tar file and installed
using the install all  command.

```
switch# install all nxos nxos32-cs.9.3.1.M.SMU.plus.IMAGE.tar
```

1. Download the SMU package from the Cisco Download center. For example: nxos32-cs.CSCxy11111-1.0.0-9.3.1.lib32\_32\_n9000.rpm
2. Download nxos32-cs.9.3.1.M.bin and place it in the same folder.
3. Create a tar bundle nxos32-cs.9.3.1.M.SMU.plus.IMAGE.tar consisting of the NX-OS image and SMU package.
   ```
   bash# tar cf nxos32-cs.9.3.1.M.SMU.plus.IMAGE.tar  nxos64-cs.9.3.1.M.bin nxos64-cs.CSCxy11111-1.0.0-9.3.1.lib32_32_n9000.rpm
   ```

**Example-4**: When there are multiple SMU packages must be installed along with the NX-OS image, the SMU packages must be built into a
SMU tar bundle file first as explained in the [Installing Multiple SMU Packages Using a Single TAR File](#installing-multiple-smu-packages-using-one-single-tar-file) section. Subsequently, this SMU tar bundle can be further bundled together with the NX-OS image and a single tar file could
be used in the install all  command.
```
switch# install all nxos nxos32-cs.9.3.1.M.SMU.BUNDLE.plus.IMAGE.tar
```

1. Create a SMU tar bundle image with the list of SMU packages as explained in the [Installing Multiple SMU Packages Using a Single TAR File](#installing-multiple-smu-packages-using-one-single-tar-file) section.
   ```
   bash# mkdir nx931
   bash# cp nxos32-cs.CSCxy11111-1.0.0-9.3.1.lib32_32_n9000.rpm  nx931/
   bash# cp nxos32-cs.CSCxy22222-1.0.0-9.3.1.lib32_32_n9000.rpm  nx931/
   bash# cd nx931
   bash# tar cf nxos32-cs.9.3.1.smu.bundle.tar *.rpm
   ```
2. Download nxos32-cs.9.3.1.M.bin and place it in the same folder.
3. Create another tar bundle nxos64-cs.10.4.3.M.SMU.BUNDLE.plus.IMAGE.tar.
   ```
   bash# tar cf nxos32-cs.9.3.1.M.SMU.BUNDLE.plus.IMAGE.tar  nxos64-cs.9.3.1.M.bin nxos64-cs.9.3.1.smu.bundle.tar
   ```

### Downgrading Feature RPMs

Follow this procedure to downgrade an installed feature RPM to the base feature RPM.

| **Note** | ---   This procedure uses Cisco NX-OS CLI commands to downgrade feature RPMs. If you would prefer to use YUM commands, follow the instructions in the "Downgrading an RPM" section of the [Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Programmability Guide](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus9000/sw/7-x/programmability/guide/b_Cisco_Nexus_9000_Series_NX-OS_Programmability_Guide_7x/Bash.html).   --- |

### Displaying Installation Log Information

The installation log
provides information on the history of the installation operations. Each time
an installation operation is run, a number is assigned to that operation.

* Use the
  show
  install log command to display information about both successful and
  failed installation operations.
* Use the
  show
  install log command with no arguments to display a summary of all
  installation operations. Specify the
  request-id argument to display information specific to
  an operation. Use the
  detail keyword to display details for a specific
  operation, including file changes, nodes that could not be reloaded, and any
  impact to processes.

This example shows how
to display information for all installation requests:

### Procedure

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | Download the SMU package file for Guest Shell Bash from Cisco.com. | Obtains the package file from Cisco.com. For instructions, see [Downloading the SMU Package File from Cisco.com](#task_5AB2793ED8F742AFA53CC493CE12AB77). |
| **Step 2** | Copy the SMU package file to the bootflash: of the switch. | Copies the package file to the device. For instructions, see [Copying the Package File to a Local Storage Device or Network Server](#task_B304847A8D5845F39DC283F481E64A02). |
| **Step 3** | guestshell  Example: ``` switch# guestshell guestshell:~$  ``` | Accesses the Guest Shell. |
| **Step 4** | sudo rpm -Uvh /bootflash/filename  Example: ``` guestshell:~$ sudo rpm -Uvh /bootflash/bash-4.2-r8.x86_64.rpm Preparing...                ########################################### [100%]    1:bash                   ########################################### [100%] update-alternatives: Linking //bin/sh to /bin/bash  ``` | Upgrades the existing Bash file in the Guest Shell. |
| **Step 5** | rpm -qa | grep bash  Example: ``` guestshell:~$ rpm -qa | grep bash bash-4.2-r8.x86_64  ``` | Verifies that the new version of the Bash file was installed successfully. |
| **Step 6** | guestshell sync  Example: ``` switch# guestshell sync Access to the guest shell will be temporarily disabled while it synchronizes contents to standby. Are you sure you want to continue? (y/n) [n] y dt-n9k3-1# 2014 Oct  7 05:00:01 dt-n9k3-1 %$ VDC-1 %$ %VMAN-2-INSTALL_STATE: Deactivating virtual service 'guestshell+' dt-n9k3-1# 2014 Oct  7 05:00:06 dt-n9k3-1 %$ VDC-1 %$ %VMAN-2-ACTIVATION_STATE: Successfully deactivated virtual service 'guestshell+'  2014 Oct  7 05:00:12 dt-n9k3-1 %$ VDC-1 %$ %VMAN-2-ACTIVATION_STATE: Successfully deactivated virtual service 'guestshell+' ; Starting sync to standby sup 2014 Oct  7 05:00:32 dt-n9k3-1 %$ VDC-1 %$ %VMAN-2-MOVE_STATE: Successfully synced virtual service 'guestshell+' ; Activating 2014 Oct  7 05:00:32 dt-n9k3-1 %$ VDC-1 %$ %VMAN-2-ACTIVATION_STATE: Activating virtual service 'guestshell+'  2014 Oct  7 05:00:56 dt-n9k3-1 %$ VDC-1 %$ %VMAN-2-ACTIVATION_STATE: Successfully activated virtual service 'guestshell+'  ``` | On a dual-supervisor system, synchronizes the rootfs with the Bash SMU version to the standby supervisor before doing a switchover. If you do not run this command, you will need to repeat this procedure after a supervisor switchover.   | **Note** | The new Bash file is preserved after a Guest Shell reboot or Guest Shell disable+enable. However, you need to reinstall the Guest Shell Bash SMU package file after a Guest Shell destroy+enable. | | --- | --- | |

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |
| **Hours** | 24 hours a day, 7 days a week |

## Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco

There are several ways to stay connected and receive the latest security vulnerability information from Cisco. Customers should review the following table, and subsequent summaries, to determine the appropriate option for them:

| **Cisco.com** | <https://www.cisco.com/security/> |
| --- | --- |
| **Email** | cust-security-announce@cisco.com |
| **RSS** | <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44> |
| **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API** | [https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT/](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) |
| **My Notifications** | <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html> |

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.
