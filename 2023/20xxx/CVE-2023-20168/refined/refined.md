This confirms the relevance of this content to the specified CVE.
*   The content from  `sec.cloudapps.cisco.com_342d220c_20250115_114538.html` directly refers to `cisco-sa-nxos-remoteauth-dos-XB6pv74m` which is the Cisco Security Advisory for this vulnerability which states `CVE-2023-20168`
*   The content from  `sec.cloudapps.cisco.com_f5202aad_20250115_114531.html` contains a CVSS score for `CVE-2023-20168` that is consistent with other sources, it also is the Cisco official CVSS calculator page.
*   The content from `www.cisco.com_7541c34e_20250115_114541.html` provides configuration guide for TACACS+ in Cisco NX-OS, which is a affected area according to the Security Advisory.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause:** Incorrect input validation when processing an authentication attempt with the directed request option enabled for TACACS+ or RADIUS. A crafted string at the login prompt can cause a device reload.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Improper input validation in the handling of directed requests during remote authentication (TACACS+/RADIUS).
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Unexpected device reload, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
    *   Potential loss of the AAA configuration after reload, further impeding recovery.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   An unauthenticated, local attacker can trigger the vulnerability.
    *   The vulnerability can be exploited via Telnet or the console management connection.
    *   The vulnerability cannot be exploited via SSH.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Local access to the device's login prompt (Telnet or console).
    *   Ability to enter a crafted string at the login prompt.

**3. Technical Details and Descriptions:**

*   The vulnerability arises when the  `directed-request`  option is enabled for TACACS+ or RADIUS. This allows users to specify the server for authentication using the syntax `username@vrfname:hostname`. However, the device does not properly validate the input string, leading to a crash.
*   The device checks for a keyword `directed-request` in the configuration ( `show running-config | include directed-request` ) to determine vulnerability.
*   Affected devices: Cisco MDS 9000 Multilayer Switches, Nexus 1000V Series Switches, Nexus 3000/5000/5600/6000/7000/9000 Series Switches (standalone NX-OS mode).
*   The vulnerability is exploited via a crafted string at the login prompt. The specific nature of the string is not disclosed to prevent creation of an exploit.
*   The SMU has the following names depending on which version: `nxos.CSCwe72648-n9k_ALL-1.0.0-9.3.11.lib32_n9000.rpm` or `nxos64-cs.CSCwe72648-1.0.0-10.2.5.lib32_64_n9000.rpm` , `nxos64-msll.CSCwe72648-1.0.0-10.2.5.lib32_64_n9000.rpm`

**4. Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability has a high Security Impact Rating (SIR) and a CVSS base score of 7.1.
*   There are no known workarounds other than disabling the  `directed-request`  option, which can be done using the  `no tacacs-server directed-request`  or `no radius-server directed-request` command.
*   Cisco released software updates and SMUs to address the issue, which can be downloaded via the Cisco Software Checker.
*   The Cisco PSIRT is unaware of any public announcements or malicious use of this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was found during the resolution of a Cisco TAC support case.

**5. Cisco NX-OS relevant content**
*   The configuration guide for Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Security contains configuration details for TACACS+ and RADIUS, indicating where this vulnerability may be found.
*   The config guide also mentions how to configure global periodic RADIUS server monitoring, which is related to this vulnerability.
*   The Cisco NX-OS System Management Configuration guide contains instructions on how to manage and install SMUs.
*   The Cisco Software Checker page has a detailed view on which versions are affected, and which are not affected, as well as providing links for downloading the relevant SMUs.
*   The Cisco Support and Downloads has information on how to obtain software to fix this issue.

In conclusion, the provided content confirms the presence of a high-severity DoS vulnerability (CVE-2023-20168) affecting several Cisco NX-OS devices. The vulnerability stems from an input validation flaw in the handling of directed remote authentication requests and can be exploited by unauthenticated local attackers through crafted login attempts.
