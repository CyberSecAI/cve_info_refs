Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-20905:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the ability to inject an arbitrary Intent through the Selector within the two-pane deep link Intent handling in the NFC component. This means an attacker could potentially manipulate the Intent being used, leading to unexpected or malicious behavior.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core weakness lies in insufficient validation and sanitization of Intents when handling deep links, specifically when a selector is involved. The code was vulnerable to arbitrary Intent injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could lead to an Elevation of Privilege (EoP) . The attacker could potentially execute actions with elevated permissions by injecting a malicious intent.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through the use of a deep link with a manipulated selector in the NFC component. A malicious application or web page could craft a specific URL to trigger the vulnerable code path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker would need the ability to trigger a deep link with a crafted selector intent. This could be achieved by an attacker having access to the ability to provide a malicious URL (e.g. through a malicious app or phishing link).

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in Android 10 based on the provided source code.
- The fix was implemented by removing the Intent selector from the 2-pane deep link intent handling logic.
- The provided information gives more detail regarding the vulnerable code (Intent selector handling) than the CVE description itself, which is a placeholder.
