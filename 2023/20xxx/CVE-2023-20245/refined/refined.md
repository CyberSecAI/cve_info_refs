Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-20245:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

*   The provided content directly references `CVE-2023-20245` within a Cisco Security Advisory titled "Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software and Firepower Threat Defense Software AnyConnect Access Control List Bypass Vulnerabilities."
*   The advisory's description aligns with the CVE ID, indicating a vulnerability that allows bypassing access control lists (ACLs).
*   Therefore, the content is relevant to CVE-2023-20245.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerabilities are caused by a logic error in how Cisco ASA and FTD software construct and apply per-user-override rules within ACLs.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   Incorrect construction and application of per-user-override ACL rules when VPN connections are active.
    *   Bypassing of interface ACLs due to this logic error when `sysopt connection permit-vpn` is disabled.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An unauthenticated, remote attacker can bypass configured ACLs and allow traffic that should be denied to flow through an affected device. This could result in an attacker gaining access to protected resources.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Remote, over a network connection.
    *   Specifically, by connecting through an affected device utilizing a remote access or site-to-site VPN tunnel.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Unauthenticated and remote attacker.
    *   The attacker needs a VPN connection to be active in the target device, and this VPN connection needs to be associated with a tunnel-group that has a configured vpn-filter.

**3. Technical Details:**

*   The advisory specifies that the `sysopt connection permit-vpn` command needs to be disabled for the vulnerability to be exploitable. If this command is enabled, then all traffic from a VPN tunnel bypasses interface ACLs by design, making the vulnerability irrelevant.
*   The vulnerability requires the `per-user-override` feature to be enabled on at least one interface ACL.
*   A vulnerable configuration requires at least one remote access or site-to-site VPN connection profile (`tunnel-group`) associated with a group policy (`group-policy`) which specifies a filter ACL (`vpn-filter`).
*   The document notes that on FTD the `per-user-override` feature can only be enabled through FlexConfig.
*  The advisory confirms the existence of two distinct vulnerabilities that have been assigned `CVE-2023-20245` and `CVE-2023-20256`
*   The document provides the CVSS v3.1 base score for the first vulnerability (`CVE-2023-20245`) as 5.8 (Medium) and base vector CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N
*   The document provides the CVSS v3.1 base score for the second vulnerability (`CVE-2023-20256`) as 5.0 (Medium) and base vector CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N

**4. Additional Information:**

*   There are no workarounds available for this vulnerability.
*   Cisco has released software updates to address the vulnerabilities. Customers are advised to use the Cisco Software Checker to identify the relevant software fixes for their specific devices.
*   The PSIRT is not aware of any public announcement or active exploitation.
*  The advisory provides the relevant Cisco bug IDs `CSCwd30856` and `CSCwe45093`
