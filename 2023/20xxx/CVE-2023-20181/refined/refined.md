*   **HTML Injection:** A related vulnerability allows for HTML injection, enabling an attacker to modify the content of a web page to redirect users to malicious sites or perform other client-side attacks.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **XSS:**
    *   Execution of arbitrary script code in the user's browser session.
    *   Access to sensitive browser-based information (e.g., cookies, session tokens).
*   **HTML Injection:**
    *   Altering the contents of a web page to redirect users to malicious websites.
    *   Potential for further client-side attacks.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote, unauthenticated attacks:** The vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely without the need for prior authentication.
*   **User Interaction:** Attackers need to persuade a user to click on a crafted link to initiate the exploit.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the web-based management interface of the affected IP phones.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to lure the victim into clicking a malicious link.
*   **No privileges needed:** The attacker doesn't require any privileges on the device or network.

**Additional Notes:**

*   **No Fix Available:**  Cisco has stated that they will not release software updates to fix this vulnerability because the affected devices have reached their end-of-life. They advise customers to migrate to newer devices.
*   **CVSS Score:** The advisory provides a CVSS v3.1 base score of 6.1 (Medium severity) for the XSS vulnerability and 5.8 (Medium severity) for the HTML injection vulnerability.
