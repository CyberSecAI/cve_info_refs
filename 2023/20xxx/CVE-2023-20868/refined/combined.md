### Applying individual product updates to VMware Cloud Foundation environments using Async Patch Tool (AP Tool)

#### Issue/Introduction

This article lists individual product updates, also known as async patches, that can be applied to VCF environments with the help of [Async Patch Tool](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Foundation/services/ap-tool/GUID-49818DF1-94EA-4C85-8CB6-6EFFCE5F8060.html). Async Patch Tool is a CLI utility which helps automate patch steps and enables users to apply these patches using SDDC Manager's in-product LCM automation, without impacting future upgrades.

This article outlines two key details

1. VCF releases versions can support a given async patch
2. VCF releases that patched environments can upgrade the full SDDC stack to, without the risk of downgrading critical fixes applied via async patches or propagating stale configurations

Refer to the [Async Patch Tool documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Foundation/services/ap-tool/GUID-49818DF1-94EA-4C85-8CB6-6EFFCE5F8060.html) for detailed instructions on how to:

* Download Async Patch Tool.
* Apply an async patch.
* Upgrade an async patched version of VMware Cloud Foundation.

For more information about known issues, see the [Async Patch Tool Release Notes](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Foundation/services/rn/async-patch-tool-release-notes/index.html).

Symptoms:

* A VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) environment needs a critical security patch or bug fix, but you are not ready to upgrade the full SDDC stack to a new VCF version which includes this fix.
* After applying individual product patch(es) to VCF environment in the past, now you want to upgrade to new VCF version.
* **VMSA-2023-0023 Online AP Tool Remediation Steps:**[KB-95284](https://knowledge.broadcom.com/external/article?articleNumber=327206)
* **VMSA-2023-0023 Offline AP Tool Remediation Steps:**  [KB-95287](https://knowledge.broadcom.com/external/article?articleNumber=327210)

**NOTE: Prior to applying any patches, please review** [KB 95536](https://knowledge.broadcom.com/external/article?articleNumber=314663) **and implement the corrective action.**
**NOTE: For VCF on VxRail environments, prior to applying any patches complete the pre-requisites as per** [KB-91830](https://knowledge.broadcom.com/external/article?articleNumber=324139)

#### Environment

VMware Cloud Foundation 4.2.1

VMware Cloud Foundation 4.3.x

VMware Cloud Foundation 4.4.x

VMware Cloud Foundation 4.5.x

VMware Cloud Foundation 5.0.x

VMware Cloud Foundation 5.1.x

#### Cause

<https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX/4.1.2.5/rn/vmware-nsx-4125-release-notes/index.html>

#### Resolution

#### **Terminology**

l **Product Version**
The product patch you wish to apply on a VCF instance.

l **Patch Identifier**
<*Product Type*>:<*Product Version*>
Patch details to be passed as an argument to AP Tool --patch or --download options, used to uniquely identify the correct bundle artifacts to download and/or apply.

l **Patch Bundle Name**
The name identifier of the bundle, as seen on the VMware Depot.

**l Install Bundle Name**
Will be required only when SDDC Manager is on 5.2 version.

The install bundles for the versions of NSX Manager and vCenter Server that are running in the management domain must be available in SDDC Manager 5.2 before you can create a VI workload domain. For example, if you have patched the versions of NSX Manager and/or vCenter Server in the management domain to a version higher than what is listed in the BOM, you must download the new install bundles. See [Downloading Install Bundles for VMware Cloud Foundation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Foundation/5.2/vcf-admin/GUID-7F2C072D-D220-4C85-970D-FC6F62E37895.html).

l **Supported VCF SKU**
The type of VCF environment that the patch can be applied to. Below are 2 types of supported VCF SKUs:
1. VCF
2. VCF on VxRail

l **Prerequisites**
Any prerequisite steps that are required to be performed on the system prior to enabling the specified patch.

l **Minimum Target VCF Release**
The minimum recommended VCF release to upgrade to after applying a patch.
Example: If the minimum target VCF release is 4.5.x, then you must use a target VCF release of 4.5.0.0 or newer when enabling the future upgrade path.
**Note:** \* If you have applied multiple async patches to your VCF environment, look up the target VCF release recommended for each one and choose the highest of those. This is the target VCF release you should upgrade to, at minimum.

Applying an async patch to update a BOM component does not guarantee support for features introduced in the new version of the component. SDDC Manager supports the same features with the new version of the BOM component as it supported with the older version of the BOM component.

If you are looking for an individual product patch that is not listed or is not compatible with your environment, please contact VMware Support. Additionally, if you have applied a patch to your environment and would like to upgrade to a target VCF release that is not listed as being compatible, please contact VMware support.

#### Additional Information

Please refer to the [Async Patch Tool](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Foundation/services/ap-tool/GUID-49818DF1-94EA-4C85-8CB6-6EFFCE5F8060.html) for detailed instructions on utilizing the CLI tool to enable patches and enable forward upgrades in your VCF environment.
