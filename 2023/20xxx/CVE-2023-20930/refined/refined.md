{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by an excessive number of shortcuts that an app can retain, leading to system instability.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The system allows an application to create and retain a large number of shortcuts. When the limit of shortcuts per app is reached, previous attempts to fix the issue caused application crashes. This CL introduces a global maximum of shortcuts that can be retained for an app to mitigate potential system health issues.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An excessive number of shortcuts could cause apps to crash or lead to other system health issues.",
  "Attack vectors": "An app can publish a large number of shortcuts leading to the described issue.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to install and run an application capable of creating a large number of shortcuts."
