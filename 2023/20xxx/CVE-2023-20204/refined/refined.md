**4. OWASP XSS Overview**
The OWASP document provides general information about XSS vulnerabilities. It explains different XSS types (reflected, stored, DOM-based), consequences (session hijacking, data theft, content modification), and methods for prevention. It provides a good background understanding of the technical aspects of XSS, but no product specific information.

**5. Additional Context from Policy Documents**
The "Security Vulnerability Policy" document explains how Cisco handles security vulnerabilities, provides contact methods to report vulnerabilities, and describes various channels to receive security information (advisories, RSS feeds, API). It also defines processes for incident response, disclosure, and the use of CVSS and SIR in vulnerability assessments.

In summary, CVE-2023-20204 is a medium severity XSS vulnerability due to improper input validation in the web management interface of Cisco BroadWorks CommPilot Application Software. Exploitation requires an authenticated user to click a malicious link, and can lead to arbitrary script execution in the userâ€™s browser and access to sensitive information. Cisco has provided software updates to fix this vulnerability.
