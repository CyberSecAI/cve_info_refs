Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-20947:

**CVE-2023-20947**

*   **Root Cause:** An issue exists where an app can obtain a permission permanently if the user has granted another permission in the same group on a one-time basis. The app can then use this permanent grant to obtain the first permission permanently without user interaction.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Improper permission handling when one-time permissions are grouped.
    *   Elevation of Privilege (EoP) due to incorrect permission granting.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An app can obtain permissions without explicit user consent, escalating its privileges.
    *   The app can bypass the one-time permission limitation to gain permanent access.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Malicious app installed on the device.
    *   The app exploits the way Android handles one-time permissions and permission groups.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have an app installed on the device.
    *   The user must grant a one-time permission to the app that belongs to a permission group where another permission is also requested.

**Additional Details:**

* The fix for this vulnerability involves marking the second permission (permission-B) as one-time if the first permission (permission-A) in the group is currently granted as one-time. This prevents permission-B from being granted permanently just because permission-A was granted on a one-time basis.
* The vulnerability exists due to a logic error in how Android handles permission grouping and one-time permission grants.
* The issue was addressed by commit `d72688263a1924f859689b789732b608ef1d35f8` in the AOSP repository.
