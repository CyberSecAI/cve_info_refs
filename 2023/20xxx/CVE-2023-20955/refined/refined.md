{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Settings app's 'Uninstall for all users' function bypasses the DISALLOW_APPS_CONTROL restriction, which violates user isolation guidelines.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper restriction of operations within the Settings app allows bypassing the DISALLOW_APPS_CONTROL user restriction.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious app could potentially uninstall other apps for all users on the device, leading to a denial of service or other unintended consequences.",
  "Attack vectors": "A malicious app can leverage the Settings app's interface to uninstall apps for all users, bypassing the intended restriction.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to have a malicious app installed on the device and be able to initiate the uninstall process through the Settings app."
