The provided content is related to CVE-2023-20214.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient request validation in the REST API of Cisco SD-WAN vManage software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insufficient request authentication validation for the REST API.
- Lack of proper input validation when using the REST API feature.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated, remote attacker can gain read permissions to the configuration of the affected Cisco SD-WAN vManage instance.
- An attacker can gain limited write permissions to the configuration of the affected Cisco SD-WAN vManage instance.
- Attackers can retrieve information from and send information to the configuration of the affected Cisco vManage instance.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted API request to an affected vManage instance.
- The attack vector is network-based, as the attacker sends a request over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to reach the affected vManage instance over the network.
- No authentication is required, the attacker can be unauthenticated.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability only affects the REST API and not the web-based management interface or the CLI.
- Customers may be able to detect attempts to access the REST API by examining the log file located at `/var/log/nms/vmanage-server.log`.
- Cisco recommends using API keys for API access.
- There are no workarounds that fully address this vulnerability, but access control lists (ACLs) can limit access to the vManage instance as a mitigation.
- Fixed software releases are available for vulnerable versions.
- The vulnerability was reported by Nicholas Buckingham of Verizon.
- The CVSS base score is 9.1, indicating a critical severity.
