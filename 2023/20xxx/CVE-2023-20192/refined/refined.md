Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2023-20192:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from an "incorrect implementation of user role permissions" within the privilege management functionality of Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence VCS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Improper Privilege Management:** The system fails to correctly enforce user role permissions, allowing a read-only administrator to execute commands beyond their intended access level.
- **Inadequate Access Control:**  The vulnerability allows a read-only CLI administrator to perform actions that should be restricted to read-write administrators.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker with read-only CLI administrator privileges can elevate their privileges to that of a read-write administrator.
- **System Compromise:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute commands outside their intended scope, including modifying system configuration parameters. This can lead to a full compromise of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the affected system.
- **CLI Access:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability through the command-line interface (CLI).
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have valid read-only CLI administrator credentials on the affected system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local Access to System:** The attacker must have local access to the device.
- **Valid Credentials:** The attacker must possess valid read-only administrator credentials on the affected system's CLI.

**Additional Notes:**

- This vulnerability is independent of CVE-2023-20105, which affects the web interface password change functionality.
- A workaround is available which involves disabling CLI access for read-only users.
- The vulnerability is present if the system is running a vulnerable software version and has granted CLI access to a read-only administrator.
- Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.
