**Note**: Above patches are cumulative of any previous patches for the same version.

**Before you download and apply the security patch (s) for your Aria Operations for Network deployment, it is advised to perform clean up using steps mentioned in Broadcom article : <https://knowledge.broadcom.com/external/article?legacyId=88977>** **to avoid issues with patch upgrade failing with Insufficient disk space toast message.**

**Procedure to apply** **Aria Operations for Networks** **patch bundle:**

1. Download the update patch file and save the file on your local system.
2. Log into the GUI as an Administrator user.

         **Note**: The default admin@local account can be used.

       3. Navigate to **Settings** > **Install and Support** > **Overview and Updates**, then under Product, select **Click here**.
       4. Click **Browse** to select the locally downloaded patch file and click **Upload**.

        **Notes**:

* When the upload is complete, Aria Operations for Networks shows the Bundle Upload Complete message notification within 2-3 minutes and the bundle processing happens in the background.
* Until the upload of the package happens, ensure that the session is not closed. If the session ends, you have to restart the upload process.
* Do not refresh the page after bundle upload, until you see the Update Available message notification.

        5. In the Bundle Available message notification, click **View details**.
Aria Operations for Networks Update screen appears.

6. Read the **Before you proceed** instruction and click **Continue**.
7. Wait for the pre-checks to complete, which verifies:

* the disk space, including the space required for migration
* the version
* the NTP sync status
* the bundle checksum

8. Click **Install Now**.

 You can see the approximate time required to complete the update process on your setup.

9. Once the update process begins, the Aria Operations for Networks Update screen provides the status of the update process.

 **Notes**:

* If a node becomes inactive, the update process does not continue. The update will not resume until the node becomes active again.
* Once the platforms are updated, you can resume your normal Aria Operations for Networks operations even though the collector update happens in parallel. Until the update process is completely over, the Node Version Mismatch detected the message is shown in the **Install and Support** page.

10. Upon the completion of the update process, you see the below confirmation message.

           All platform and the collector nodes are updated.
