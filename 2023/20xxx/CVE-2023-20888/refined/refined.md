Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of CVE-2023-20888:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to an authenticated deserialization flaw within VMware Aria Operations for Networks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Authenticated Deserialization:** The application processes serialized data without proper validation, potentially allowing an attacker to inject malicious code through crafted serialized objects.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows a malicious actor to execute arbitrary code on the target system. This can lead to complete system compromise, data breaches, and disruption of services.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the VMware Aria Operations for Networks instance.
- **Valid 'member' Role Credentials:**  The attacker must possess valid credentials for a user with the "member" role within the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-  The attacker needs network connectivity to the target system and must have valid "member" role credentials.
