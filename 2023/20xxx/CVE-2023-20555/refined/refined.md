{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insufficient input validation in `CpmDisplayFeatureSmm`.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SMM memory corruption vulnerability.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution in SMM.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can corrupt SMM memory by overwriting an arbitrary bit in an attacker-controlled pointer.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to influence input to the `CpmDisplayFeatureSmm` function."
