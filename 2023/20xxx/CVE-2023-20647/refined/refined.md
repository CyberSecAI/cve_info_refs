- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper input validation in the `ril` (Radio Interface Layer) component.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds read due to a missing bounds check.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Local information disclosure. An attacker can potentially read sensitive information from memory.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited locally.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** System execution privileges are required. No user interaction is needed for exploitation.
