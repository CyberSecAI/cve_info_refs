- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing bounds check in `keyinstall` leading to an out-of-bounds read.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper input validation (CWE-20), Out-of-bounds read (CWE-125).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Local information disclosure. An attacker with system privileges can potentially read sensitive information from memory.
- **Attack vectors:** Local exploitation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs system execution privileges to trigger this vulnerability. No user interaction is required for exploitation.
