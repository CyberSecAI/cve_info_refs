  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2023-20895",
    "description": "The vCenter Server contains a memory corruption vulnerability in the implementation of the DCERPC protocol. A malicious actor with network access to vCenter Server may trigger a memory corruption vulnerability which may bypass authentication.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `save_sec_fragment` function of the DCERPC protocol implementation within VMware vCenter Server. This function calculates the memory location of the authentication trailer (`auth_tlr`) using client-supplied values for fragment length (`frag_len`) and authentication length (`auth_len`). Due to the lack of proper bounds checking of `frag_len` and `auth_len`, an attacker can manipulate these values to cause the `auth_tlr` pointer to point outside the intended memory region, leading to an out-of-bounds read during a subsequent memory copy operation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-823 - Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset"
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit could lead to a memory corruption vulnerability which may bypass authentication and potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vector": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted network packet to the vCenter Server's DCERPC service. The attacker needs network access to the vCenter Server.",
      "required_capabilities": "An attacker requires network access to vCenter Server and the ability to send specifically crafted packets. No authentication is needed to trigger the vulnerability but an attacker with control over the source pointer of memcpy() has the potential to bypass authentication.",
