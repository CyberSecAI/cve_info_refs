Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2023-20735:

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause of this vulnerability is a missing bounds check in the vcu (Video Codec Unit).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **CWE-20 Improper Input Validation:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of input data within the vcu. This allows the possibility of writing data outside of the intended memory bounds.
- **Out-of-bounds write**:  Specifically, the missing bounds check leads to an out-of-bounds write.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Local Escalation of Privilege:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to a local escalation of privilege. This means an attacker could gain higher-level access on the affected system than they initially possessed.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to be running code on the vulnerable device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **System Execution Privileges:** The attacker needs to have System execution privileges to trigger the vulnerable code.
- **No User Interaction:** User interaction is not required for the exploit to be successful.
