Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from improper role-based access control (RBAC) within the integration of the Cisco DNA Center's Network Plug-and-Play (PnP) agent.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper RBAC with PnP integration.
- Failure to restrict access to sensitive information through the PnP API.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can view sensitive information in clear text, including potentially configuration files.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote exploitation through the network.
- Exploitation by sending a query to an internal API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated access to Cisco DNA Center.
- Valid low-privileged user credentials.

**Summary:** A vulnerability exists in the Cisco DNA Center's PnP agent due to flawed role-based access control. An authenticated remote attacker with low-privileged credentials can exploit this by sending specific queries to an internal API. This allows them to view sensitive information in clear text, including configuration files.
