  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "When a self-managed phone account is updated to a call provider phone account, the enable state is directly copied to the updated one. This allows a malicious app to perform call spoofing attacks without any permission requirements.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper state management during phone account updates",
      "Insufficient permission checks"
    ],
    "impact": "Malicious applications can perform call spoofing attacks without requiring permissions.",
    "attack_vectors": "A malicious application that can register a self-managed phone account can then update it to a call provider phone account, taking advantage of the flawed state transfer to make calls without proper permissions.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to register a self-managed phone account."
