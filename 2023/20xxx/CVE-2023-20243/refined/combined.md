| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.1 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: Low C: High C: None  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: Low A: High A: None  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 8.6 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Unproven   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Not Defined  RC: Confirmed   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 8.6 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High  CR: Not Defined   Select Confidentiality Requirement Parameters  Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Select Integrity Requirement Parameters  Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High  AR: Not Defined   Select Availability Requirement Parameters  Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Vector Parameters  Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Complexity Parameters  Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Select Modified Privileges Required Parameters  Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Select Modified User Interaction Parameters  Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Select Modified Scope Parameters  Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Select Modified Confidentiality Parameters  Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Select Modified Integrity Parameters  Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined   Select Modified Availability Parameters    Environmental Score: 8.6 |

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |
| **Hours** | 24 hours a day, 7 days a week |

## Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco

There are several ways to stay connected and receive the latest security vulnerability information from Cisco. Customers should review the following table, and subsequent summaries, to determine the appropriate option for them:

| **Cisco.com** | <https://www.cisco.com/security/> |
| --- | --- |
| **Email** | cust-security-announce@cisco.com |
| **RSS** | <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44> |
| **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API** | [https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT/](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) |
| **My Notifications** | <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html> |

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

### **RSS Feeds**

Cisco security vulnerability information is also available via RSS feeds from Cisco.com. These feeds are free and do not require an active Cisco.com registration. For information on how to subscribe to the RSS feeds, visit the [Cisco Security RSS Feeds page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44).

### **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API**

The Cisco PSIRT openVuln application programming interface (API) is a RESTful API that conforms to the [representational state transfer](https://restfulapi.net/) (REST) software architectural style and allows customers to obtain Cisco security vulnerability information in different machine-consumable formats. To learn about accessing and using the API, visit the [PSIRT page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) on the Cisco DevNet website.

### **My Notifications**

The [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) allows registered Cisco.com users to subscribe to and receive important Cisco product and technology information, including Cisco Security Advisories. This service provides an improved unified subscription experience, allowing users to choose the timing of notifications as well as the notification delivery method (email or RSS feed). The level of access will be determined by the subscriber's relationship with Cisco.

### Creating a Notification

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

## Understanding the HA Options Available

There are many different items to note when it comes to high availability (HA) within a Secure Access deployment. There are the concerns of communication between the PANs and the other ISE nodes for database replications and synchronization, and communication between the PSNs and Monitoring nodes for logging. There is also the issue of authentication sessions from the network access devices (NAD) reaching the PSNs in the event of a WAN outage, as well as a NAD recognizing that a PSN may no longer be active, and sending authentication requests to the active PSN instead.

### Primary and Secondary Nodes

PANs and Monitoring & Troubleshooting (MnT) nodes both employ the concept of primary and secondary nodes, but they operate very differently. Let’s start with the easiest one first, the MnT node.

#### Monitoring & Troubleshooting Nodes

As you know, the MnT node is responsible for the logging and reporting functions of ISE. All PSNs will send their logging data to the MnT node as syslog messages (UDP port 20514).

When there are two monitoring nodes in an ISE deployment, all ISE nodes send their audit data to both monitoring nodes at the same time. Figure 18-9 displays this logging flow.

![Figure 18-9](/content/images/chap18_9781587144738/elementLinks/18fig09.jpg)

**Figure 18-9** *Logging Flows*

The active/active nature of the MnT nodes can be viewed easily in the administrative console, as the two MnTs get defined as LogCollector and LogCollector2. Figures 18-10 and 18-11 display the log collector definitions and the logging categories, respectively.

![Figure 18-10](/content/images/chap18_9781587144738/elementLinks/18fig10.jpg)

**Figure 18-10** *Logging Targets*

![Figure 18-11](/content/images/chap18_9781587144738/elementLinks/18fig11.jpg)

**Figure 18-11** *Logging Categories*

Upon an MnT failure, all nodes continue to send logs to the remaining MnT node. Therefore, no logs are lost. The PAN retrieves all log and report data from the secondary MnT node, so there is no administrative function loss, either. However, the log database is not synchronized between the primary and secondary MnT nodes. Therefore, when the MnT node returns to service, a backup and restore of the monitoring node is required to keep the two MnT nodes in complete sync.

NOTE

The best practice for logging is to also send logging data to a security information and event manager (SIEM) tool, for long-term data archiving and reporting.

#### Policy Administration Nodes

The PAN is responsible for providing not only an administrative GUI for ISE but also the critical function of database synchronization of all ISE nodes. All ISE nodes maintain a full copy of the database, with the master database existing on the primary PAN.

A PSN may receive data about a guest user, and when that occurs it must sync that data to the primary PAN. The primary PAN then synchronizes that data out to all the ISE nodes in the deployment.

Because the functionality is so arduous, and having only a single source of truth for the data in the database is so critical, failing over to the secondary PAN is usually a manual process. In the event of the primary PAN going offline, no synchronizations occur until the secondary PAN is promoted to primary. Once it becomes the primary, it takes over all synchronization responsibility. This is sometimes referred to as a “warm spare” type of HA.

##### Promote the Secondary PAN to Primary

To promote the secondary PAN to primary, connect to the GUI on the secondary PAN and perform the following steps:

* **Step 1.** Choose **Administration > System > Deployment**.
* **Step 2.** Click **Promote to Primary**. Figure 18-12 illustrates the Promote to Primary option available on the secondary node.

![Figure 18-12](/content/images/chap18_9781587144738/elementLinks/18fig12.jpg)

**Figure 18-12** *Promoting a Secondary PAN to Primary*

##### Auto PAN Failover

An automated promotion function was added to ISE beginning with version 1.4. It requires there to be two admin nodes (obviously) and at least one other non-admin node in the deployment.

The non-admin node will act as a health check function for the admin node(s), probing the primary admin node at specified intervals. The Health Check Node will promote the secondary admin node when the primary fails a configurable number of probes. Once the original secondary node is promoted, it is probed. Figure 18-13 illustrates the process.

![Figure 18-13](/content/images/chap18_9781587144738/elementLinks/18fig13.jpg)

**Figure 18-13** *Promoting a Secondary PAN to Primary with Automated Promotion*

As of ISE version 2.1, there is no ability to automatically sync the original primary PAN back into the ISE cube. That is still a manual process.

##### Configure Automatic Failover for the Primary PAN

For the configuration to be available, there must be two PANs and at least one non-PAN in the deployment.

From the ISE GUI, perform the following steps:

* **Step 1.** Navigate to **Administration > System > Deployment**.
* **Step 2.** Click **PAN Failover** in the left pane, as shown in Figure 18-14.

![Figure 18-14](/content/images/chap18_9781587144738/elementLinks/18fig14.jpg)

**Figure 18-14** *PAN Failover*

* **Step 3.** Check the **Enable PAN Auto Failover** check box.
* **Step 4.** Select the **Health Check Nodes** from the drop-down lists. Notice the primary PAN and secondary are listed to the right of the selected Health Check Nodes, as shown in Figure 18-14.
* **Step 5.** In the Polling Interval field, set the polling interval. The interval is in seconds and can be set between **30** and **300** (5 minutes).
* **Step 6.** In the Number of Failure Polls Before Failover field, enter the number of failed probes that have to occur before failover is initiated. Valid range is anywhere from **2–60** consecutive failed probes.
* **Step 7.** Click **Save**.

### Policy Service Nodes and Node Groups

PSNs do not necessarily need to have an HA type of configuration. Every ISE node maintains a full copy of the database, and the NADs have their own detection of a “dead” RADIUS server, which triggers the NAD to send AAA communication to the next RADIUS server in the list.

However, ISE has the concept of a *node group*. Node groups are made up of PSNs, where the PSNs maintain a heartbeat with each other. Beginning with ISE 1.3, the PSNs can be in different subnets or can be Layer 2 adjacent. In older ISE versions, the PSNs required the use of multicast, but starting in version 1.3 they use direct encrypted TCP-based communication instead:

* **TCP/7800:** Used for peer communication
* **TCP/7802:** Used for failure detection

If a PSN goes down and orphans a URL-redirected session, one of the other PSNs in the node group sends a Change of Authorization (CoA) to the NAD so that the endpoint can restart the session establishment with a new PSN.

Node groups do have another function, which is entirely related to data replication. ISE used a serial replication model in ISE 1.0, 1.1, and 1.1.x, meaning that all data had to go through the primary PAN and it sent the data objects to every other node, waiting for an acknowledgement for each piece of data before sending the next one in line.

Beginning with ISE 1.2 and moving forward, ISE begins to use a common replication framework known as JGroups (<http://bfy.tw/5vYC>). One of the benefits of JGroups is the way it handles replications in a group or segmented fashion. JGroups enables replications with local peers directly without having to go back through a centralized master, and node groups are used to define those segments or groups of peers.

So, when a member of a node group learns endpoint attributes (profiling), it is able to send the information directly to the other members of the node group directly. However, when that data needs to be replicated globally (to all PSNs), then the JGroups communication must still go through the primary PAN, which in turn replicates it to all the other PSNs.

Node groups are most commonly used when deploying the PSNs behind a load balancer; however, there is no reason node groups could not be used with regionally located PSNs. You would not want to use a node group with PSNs that are geographically and logically separate.

#### Create a Node Group

To create a node group, from the ISE GUI, perform the following steps:

* **Step 1.** Choose **Administration > System > Deployment**.
* **Step 2.** In the Deployment pane on the left side of the screen, click the cog icon and choose **Create Node Group**, as shown in Figure 18-15.

![Figure 18-15](/content/images/chap18_9781587144738/elementLinks/18fig15.jpg)

**Figure 18-15** *Choosing to Create a Node Group*

* **Step 3.** On the Create Node Group screen, shown in Figure 18-16, enter in the Node Group Name field a name for the node group. Use a name that also helps describe the location of the group. In this example, SJCO was used to represent San Jose, Building O.

![Figure 18-16](/content/images/chap18_9781587144738/elementLinks/18fig16.jpg)

**Figure 18-16** *Node Group Creation*

* **Step 4.** (Optional) In the Description field, enter a more detailed description that helps to identify exactly where the node group is (for example, PSNs in Building O). Click **Submit**.
* **Step 5.** Click **OK** in the success popup window, as shown in Figure 18-17. Also notice the appearance of the node group in the left pane.

![Figure 18-17](/content/images/chap18_9781587144738/elementLinks/18fig17.jpg)

**Figure 18-17** *Success Popup*

#### Add the Policy Service Nodes to the Node Group

To add the PSNs to the node group, from the ISE GUI, perform the following steps:

* **Step 1.** Choose **Administration > System > Deployment**.
* **Step 2.** Select one of the PSNs to add to the node group.
* **Step 3.** Click the **Include Node in Node Group** drop-down arrow and select the newly created group, as shown in Figure 18-18.

![Figure 18-18](/content/images/chap18_9781587144738/elementLinks/18fig18.jpg)

**Figure 18-18** *Assigning a Node Group*

* **Step 4.** Click **Save**.
* **Step 5.** Repeat the preceding steps for each PSN that should be part of the node group.

Figure 18-19 shows the reorganization of the PSNs within the node group in the Deployment navigation pane on the left side.

### Using Load Balancers

One high-availability option that is growing in popularity for Cisco ISE deployments is the use of load balancers. Load balancer adoption with ISE deployments has skyrocketed over the years because it can significantly simplify administration and designs in larger deployments. As Figure 18-20 illustrates, with load balancing, the NADs have to be configured with only one IP address per set of ISE PSNs, removing a lot of the complexity in the NAD configuration. The load balancer itself takes care of monitoring the ISE PSNs and removing them from service if they are down and allows you to scale more nodes behind the virtual IP (VIP) without ever touching the network device configuration again.

![Figure 18-20](/content/images/chap18_9781587144738/elementLinks/18fig20.jpg)

**Figure 18-20** *Load-Balanced PSN Clusters*

Craig Hyps, a Principal Technical Marketing Engineer for ISE at Cisco, has written what is considered to be the definitive guide on load balancing with ISE, “How To: Cisco & F5 Deployment Guide: ISE Load Balancing Using BIG-IP.” Craig wrote the guide based on using F5 load balancers, but the principles are identical regardless of which load balancer you choose to implement. You can find his guide here: <https://communities.cisco.com/docs/DOC-68198>.

Instead of replicating that entire large and detailed guide in this chapter, this section simply focuses on the basic principles that must be followed when using ISE with load balancers.

#### General Guidelines

When using a load balancer, you must ensure the following:

* Each PSN must be reachable by the PAN/MnT directly, without having to go through Network Address Translation (NAT). This sometimes is referred to as routed mode or pass-through mode.
* Each PSN must also be reachable directly from the endpoint.
* When the PSN sends a URL-Redirection to the NAD, it uses the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) from the configuration, not the virtual IP (VIP) address.
* You might want to use Subject Alternative Names (SAN) in the certificate to include the FQDN of the load-balancer VIP.
* The same PSN is used for the entire session. User persistence, sometimes called needs to be based on Calling-Station-ID.
* The VIP gets listed as the RADIUS server of each NAD for all 802.1X-related AAA.
* Includes both authentication and accounting packets.
* Some load balancers use a separate VIP for each protocol type.
* The list of RADIUS servers allowed to perform dynamic-authorizations (also known as Change of Authorization [CoA]) on the NAD should use the real IP addresses of the PSNs, not the VIP.
* The VIP could be used for the CoAs, if the load balancer is performing source NAT (SNAT) for the CoAs sent from the PSNs.

NOTE

ISE uses the device’s Layer 3 address to identity the NAD, not the NAS-IP-Address in the RADIUS packet. This is another reason to avoid SNAT for the incoming RADIUS requests.

* Load balancers should be configured to use test probes to ensure the PSNs are still “alive and well.”
* A probe should be configured to ensure RADIUS is responding.
* HTTPS should also be checked.
* If either probe fails, the PSN should be taken out of service.
* A PSN must be marked dead and taken out of service in the load balancer before the NAD’s built-in failover occurs.
* Since the load balancer(s) should be configured to perform health checks of the RADIUS service on the PSN(s), the load balancer(s) must be configured as NADs in ISE so their test authentications may be answered correctly.

#### Failure Scenarios

If a single PSN fails, the load balancer takes that PSN out of service and spreads the load over the remaining PSNs. When the failed PSN is returned to service, the load balancer adds it back into the rotation. By using node groups along with a load balancer, another of the node group members issues a CoA-reauth for any sessions that were establishing. This CoA causes the session to begin again. At this point, the load balancer directs the new authentication to a different PSN.

NADs have some built-in capabilities to detect when the configured RADIUS server is “dead” and automatically fail over to the next RADIUS server configured. When using a load balancer, the RADIUS server IP address is actually the VIP address. So, if the entire VIP is unreachable (for example, the load balancer has died), the NAD should quickly fail over to the next RADIUS server in the list. That RADIUS server could be another VIP in a second data center or another backup RADIUS server.

### Anycast HA for ISE PSNs

This section exists thanks to a friend of the author who is also one of the most talented and gifted technologists roaming the earth today. E. Pete Karelis, CCIE No. 8068, designed this high-availability solution for a small ISE deployment that had two data centers. Figure 18-21 illustrates the network architecture.

![Figure 18-21](/content/images/chap18_9781587144738/elementLinks/18fig21.jpg)

**Figure 18-21** *Network Drawing and IPSLA*

Anycast is a networking technique where the same IP address exists in multiple places within the network. In this case, the same IP address (2.2.2.2) is assigned to the Gig1 interfaces on all the PSNs, which is connected to an isolated VLAN (or port group in VMware), so that the PSN sees the interface as “up” and connected with the assigned IP address (2.2.2.2). Each default gateway (router) in each data center is configured with a static route to 2.2.2.2/32 with the Gig0 IP address of the PSN as the next hop. Those static routes are redistributed into the routing protocol; in this case EIGRP is used. Anycast relies on the routing protocols to ensure that traffic destined to the Anycast address (2.2.2.2) is sent to the closest instance of that IP address.

After setting up Anycast to route 2.2.2.2 to the ISE PSN, Pete used EIGRP metrics to ensure that all routes preferred the primary data center, with the secondary data center route listed as the feasible successor (FS). With EIGRP, there is less than a 1-second delay when a route (the successor) is replaced with the backup route (the feasible successor).

Now, how do we make the successor route drop from the routing table when the ISE node goes down? Pete configured an IP service-level agreement (IPSLA) on the router that checked the status of the HTTP service on the ISE PSN in the data center every 5 seconds. If the HTTP service stops responding on the active ISE PSN, then the route is removed and the FS takes over, causing all the traffic for 2.2.2.2 to be sent to the PSN in the secondary data center. Figure 18-22 illustrates the IPSLA function, and when it occurs the only route left in the routing table is to the router at the secondary data center.

![Figure 18-22](/content/images/chap18_9781587144738/elementLinks/18fig22.jpg)

**Figure 18-22** *IPSLA in Action*

All network devices are configured to use the Anycast address (2.2.2.2) as the only RADIUS server in their configuration. The RADIUS requests will always be sent to whichever ISE node is active and closest. Authentications originating within the secondary data center go to the local PSN.

NOTE

The dynamic-authorization configuration of the NAD must still use the Gig0 interface IP addresses, as those will be the source when ISE sends a CoA to the switch.

Example 18-2 shows the interface configuration on the ISE PSN. The Gig0 interface is the actual routable IP address of the PSN, while Gig1 is in a VLAN to nowhere using the Anycast IP address.

#### Example 18-2 ISE Interface Configuration

```
interface gig 0
  !Actual  IP of Node
  ip address 1.1.1.163 255.255.255.0
interface gig 1
  !Anycast VIP assigned to all PSN nodes on G1
  ip address 2.2.2.2 255.255.255.255

ip default-gateway [Real Gateway for Gig0]
!note no static routes needed.
```

Example 18-3 shows the IPSLA configuration on the router, to test port 80 on the PSN every 5 seconds but to timeout after 1000 msec. When that timeout occurs, the IP SLA object will be marked as “down,” which causes changed object tracking to remove the static route from the route table.

#### Example 18-3 IPSLA Configuration

```
ip sla 1
  !Test TCP to port 80 to the actual IP of the node.
  !"control disable" is necessary, since you are connecting to an
  !actual host instead of an SLA responder

  tcp-connect 1.1.1.163 80 control disable
  ! Consider the SLA as down if response takes longer than 1000msec

    threshold 1000
    ! Timeout after 1000 msec.
    timeout 1000
    !Test every 5 Seconds:
    frequency 5

ip sla schedule 1 life forever start-time now
track 1 ip sla 1
ip route 2.2.2.2 255.255.255.255 1.1.1.163 track 1
```

Example 18-4 shows the route redistribution configuration where the EIGRP metrics are applied. Pete was able to use the metrics that he chose specifically because he was very familiar with his network. His warning to others attempting the same thing is to be familiar with your network or to test thoroughly when identifying the metrics that would work for you.

Remember, you must avoid equal-cost, multiple-path routes, as this state could potentially introduce problems if RADIUS requests are not sticking to a single node. Furthermore, this technique is not limited to only two sites; Pete has since added a third location to the configuration and it works perfectly.

NOTE

There is an obvious, albeit rare, flaw in the design. With this design, we are using HTTP to validate the status of the node, rather than validating the state of the RADIUS service itself, since the status of the RADIUS service cannot be queried by IOS Changed Object Tracking. This works very well in most cases, but in the rare event that the HTTP service on a PSN is operational and the RADIUS service is not operational, it could theoretically cause issues.

#### Example 18-4 Route Redistribution

```
router eigrp [Autonomous-System-Number]
  redistribute static route-map STATIC-TO-EIGRP

route-map STATIC-TO-EIGRP permit 20
  match ip address prefix-list ISE_VIP
  !Set metrics correctly
  set metric 1000000 1 255 1 1500

ip prefix-list ISE_VIP seq 5 permit 2.2.2.2/32
```

"title": "Summary",
"text": "A vulnerability in the RADIUS message processing feature of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the affected system to stop processing RADIUS packets.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper handling of certain RADIUS accounting requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted authentication request to a network access device (NAD) that uses Cisco ISE for authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA). This would eventually result in the NAD sending a RADIUS accounting request packet to Cisco ISE. An attacker could also exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted RADIUS accounting request packet to Cisco ISE directly if the RADIUS shared secret is known. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the RADIUS process to unexpectedly restart, resulting in authentication or authorization timeouts and denying legitimate users access to the network or service. Clients already authenticated to the network would not be affected.\r\n\r\nNote: To recover the ability to process RADIUS packets, a manual restart of the affected Policy Service Node (PSN) may be required. For more information, see the Details [\"#details\"] section of this advisory.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n"

"text": "This vulnerability affects Cisco ISE PSNs that are configured with RADIUS. If Cisco ISE is being used for TACACS only, the device is not affected.\r\n\r\nNote: RADIUS is enabled by default and cannot be disabled. The default RADIUS policies may need to be configured to deny access to all users and devices if Cisco ISE is being used for TACACS only.\r\n\r\nNote: For the exploit to be successful, attackers must have one of the following:\r\n\r\nValid user credentials\r\nA NAD shared secret that can be used to connect to Cisco ISE\r\nAccess to a NAD that connects to a Cisco ISE deployment and that is configured with MAC Authentication Bypass (MAB) so that the authentication policy succeeds even if a user is not found\r\n\r\nDetermine PSN Configuration\r\n\r\nTo determine whether a node in the Cisco ISE deployment is a PSN, use the following steps:\r\n\r\nLog in to the Cisco ISE web-based management interface.\r\nClick the menu icon.\r\nChoose Administration > System > Deployment.\r\nLook at the Personas column in the table for the nodes in the deployment. If a node has Policy Service listed, the node is affected by this vulnerability. If Policy Service is not listed, the node is not affected by this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nDetermine the RADIUS Policy\r\n\r\nIf a deployment is being used for TACACS only and the RADIUS policy is set to DenyAccess, the deployment is not affected by this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nTo determine whether a deployment has a DenyAccess RADIUS policy in effect, use the following steps:\r\n\r\nLog in to the Cisco ISE web-based management interface.\r\nClick the menu icon.\r\nChoose Policy > Policy Sets. If RADIUS has never been deployed, only the Default policy should be listed. If more than one policy is listed, this deployment might be serving as a RADIUS server.\r\nClick the arrow to check the Default policy.\r\nIn the Authentication Policy section, verify the following:\r\nAll rules are disabled except the Default rule.\r\nUnder Default > Options, all options are REJECT or DROP.\r\n\r\nIn the Authorization Policy - Local Exceptions section, verify that all rules are disabled.\r\nIn the Authorization Policy - Global Exceptions section, verify that all rules are disabled.\r\nIn the Authorization Policy section, verify the following:\r\nAll rules are disabled except the Default rule.\r\nThe Default rule's profile is DenyAccess."

"text": "The affected Cisco ISE PSN should restart automatically. If the restart fails, a manual restart should be performed. The recommendations for a manual restart are as follows:\r\n\r\nIn a one-node deployment, the PSN persona will be located on the single node. That node will need to be restarted.\r\nIn a multi-node deployment, only the affected PSN node will need to be restarted.\r\n\r\nFor more information on Cisco ISE personas, see the Cisco ISE Admin Guide [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/ise/3-3/admin\_guide/b\_ise\_admin\_3\_3/b\_ISE\_admin\_33\_deployment.html#typesofpersonas\"].\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n\r\nIf PSNs are behind a load balancer, the exploit traffic can cascade across to other PSNs.\r\nIf PSN node groups are configured, the exploit traffic will not cascade across to other PSNs.\r\n\r\nRestart Cisco ISE\r\n\r\nTo stop and then start a Cisco ISE node from the CLI, use the following steps. For more details on each command, see the Cisco ISE CLI Reference Guide [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/ise/3-3/cli\_guide/b\_ise\_CLI\_Reference\_Guide\_33/b\_ise\_CLIReferenceGuide\_33\_chapter\_01.html\"].\r\n\r\nNote: During the restart period, any devices already authenticated will still be connected to the network. New authentications will not be processed unless PSN failover is configured.\r\n\r\nLog in to the affected PSN through the CLI.\r\nIssue the command application stop ise and wait for the prompt to return output, as shown in the following example:\r\n\r\nise/admin# application stop ise\r\nStopping ISE Monitoring & Troubleshooting Log Processor...

"title": "Workarounds",
"text": "There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability. However, several potential mitigations may help address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, customers can turn off RADIUS accounting on the network access device (NAD) sending the crafted packets to the Cisco ISE PSN. There may be other mitigations for this vulnerability for customers who cannot upgrade to a fixed release. To coordinate implementation of the mitigations, contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/tac/\"].\r\n\r\nWhile these mitigations have been deployed and were proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment."

## Cisco ISE Deployment Terminology

The following terms are
commonly used when discussing Cisco ISE deployment scenarios:

* Service: A service is a specific feature that a persona provides, such as network access, profiler, posture, security group
  access, monitoring and troubleshooting, and so on.
* Node: A node is an individual instance that runs the Cisco ISE software. Cisco ISE is available as an appliance and also as
  a software that can be run on VMware. Each instance (appliance or VMware) that runs the Cisco ISE software is called a node.
* Persona: The persona of a node determines the services provided by the node. A Cisco ISE node can assume any of the following
  personas: Administration, Policy Service, Monitoring, and pxGrid. The menu options that are available through the Admin portal are dependent on the role and personas that a Cisco ISE node
  assumes.
* Deployment Model: Determines if your deployment is distributed, standalone, or high availability in standalone, which is a
  basic two-node deployment.

## Personas in Distributed Cisco ISE Deployments

A Cisco ISE node can assume the Administration, Policy Service, or Monitoring personas.

A Cisco ISE node can provide various services based on the persona that it assumes. Each node in a deployment can assume the
Administration, Policy Service, and Monitoring personas. In a distributed deployment, you can have the following combination
of nodes in your network:

* Primary Policy Administration Node (primary PAN) and secondary Policy Administration Node (secondary PAN) for high availability
* Primary Monitoring Node (primary MnT node) and Secondary Monitoring Node (secondary MnT node) for high availability
* A pair of health check nodes or a single health check node for the primary PAN automatic failover
* One or more Policy Service Nodes (PSNs) for the session failover

## Configure a Cisco ISE Node

After you install a Cisco ISE node, all the default services provided by the Administration, Policy Service, and Monitoring
personas run on it. This node is in a standalone state. You must log in to the Admin portal of the Cisco ISE node to configure
it. You cannot edit the personas or services of a standalone Cisco ISE node. You can, however, edit the personas and services
of the primary and secondary Cisco ISE nodes. You must first configure a primary ISE node and then register secondary ISE
nodes to the primary ISE node.

If you are logging in to the
node for the first time, you must change the default administrator password and
install a valid license.

We recommend that you do not change the host name and the domain name configured on Cisco ISE in production. If required,
reimage the appliance, make changes, and configure the details during the initial deployment.

### Before you begin

You should have a basic understanding of how distributed deployments are set up in Cisco ISE. See [Guidelines for Setting Up a Distributed Deployment](#ID209 "Guidelines for setting up a Distributed deployment").

* [Register a Secondary Cisco ISE Node](#task_197D63FEC8BD473AA23901D25DD9C9F9)

### Configure a Primary Policy Administration Node

To set up a distributed deployment, you must first configure a Cisco ISE node as your primary PAN.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon () and choose Administration  >  System  >  Deployment.  The Register button is disabled initially. To enable this button, configure a Primary PAN. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Check the check box next to the current node, and click Edit. |
| **Step 3** | Click Make Primary to configure your primary PAN. |
| **Step 4** | Click Save to save the node configuration. |

---

#### What to do next

1. Add secondary
   nodes to your deployment.
2. Enable the
   profiler service and configure the probes, if required.

### Register a Secondary Cisco ISE Node

You can register Cisco ISE nodes to the primary PAN to form a multinode deployment. Nodes in a deployment other than the
primary PAN are referred to as secondary nodes. While registering a node, you can select the personas and services that must
be enabled on the node. Registered nodes can be managed from the primary PAN (for example, managing the node personas, services,
certificates, licenses, applying patches, and so on).

When a node is registered, the primary PAN pushes the configuration data to the secondary node, and the application server
on the secondary node restarts. After the complete data replication, further configuration changes done on the primary PAN
are replicated to the secondary node. The time taken for the changes to be replicated on the secondary node depends on various
factors, such as network latency, load on the system, and so on.

#### Before you begin

Ensure that the primary PAN and the node being registered are DNS resolvable to each other. If the node that is being registered
uses an untrusted self-signed certificate, you are prompted with a certificate warning along with details of the certificate.
If you accept the certificate, it is added to the trusted certificate store of the primary PAN to enable TLS communication
with the node.

If the node uses a certificate that is not self-signed (for example, signed by an external CA), you must manually import the
relevant certificate chain of that node to the trusted certificate store of the primary PAN. When you import the secondary
node's certificate to the trusted certificate store, check the Trust for Authentication within ISE check box in the Trusted Certificates window for the PAN to validate the secondary node's certificate.

While registering a node with session services enabled (such as Network Access, Guest, Posture, and so on), you can add it
to a node group. See [Create a Policy Service Node Group](#ID513 "When two or more PSNs are connected to the same LAN, you can place them in the same node group.") for more details.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Log in to the primary PAN. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon () and choose Administration  >  System  >  Deployment. |
| **Step 3** | Click **Register** to initiate registration of a secondary node. |
| **Step 4** | Enter the DNS-resolvable fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the standalone node that you are going to register (in the format hostname.domain-name, for example, abc.xyz.com). The FQDN of the primary PAN and the node being registered must be resolvable from each other. |
| **Step 5** | Enter the GUI-based administrator credentials for the secondary node in the Username and Password fields. |
| **Step 6** | Click **Next**.  The primary PAN tries to establish TLS communication (for the first time) after the node is registered.   * If the node uses a certificate that is trusted, you can proceed to Step 7. * If the node uses a self-signed certificate that is not trusted, a certificate warning message is displayed with details about   the certificate (such as, Issued-to, Issued-by, Serial number, and so on), which can be verified against the actual certificate   on the node. Click the **Import Certificate and Proceed** option to trust this certificate and proceed with registration. Cisco ISE imports the default self-signed certificate of   that node to the trusted certificate store of the primary PAN. If you do not want to use the default self-signed certificate,   click **Cancel Registration** and manually import the relevant certificate chain of that node to the trusted certificate store of the primary PAN. When   you import the secondary node's certificate to the trusted certificate store, check the **Trust for Authentication within ISE** check box adjacent to the corresponding PAN to validate the secondary node's certificate. * If the node uses a CA-signed certificate, an error message is displayed, stating that the registration cannot proceed until   certificate trust is set up. |
| **Step 7** | Check the check boxes to select the personas and services to be enabled on the node, and then click **Save**.  When a node is registered, an alarm (which confirms that a node has been added to the deployment) is generated on the primary PAN. You can view this alarm in the Alarms dashlet in the Cisco ISE GUI Dashboard. After the registered node is synchronized and restarted, you can log in to the secondary node GUI using the same credentials used on the primary PAN. |

---

#### What to do next

* For
  time-sensitive tasks such as guest user access and authorization, logging, and
  so on, ensure that the system time on your nodes is synchronized.
* If you registered a secondary PAN, and are using the internal Cisco ISE CA service, you must back up the Cisco ISE CA certificates
  and keys from the primary PAN and restore them on the secondary PAN.

## Support for Multiple Deployment Scenarios

Cisco ISE can be deployed
across an enterprise infrastructure, supporting 802.1X wired, wireless, and
Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).

The Cisco ISE architecture supports both standalone and distributed (also known as *high availability* or *redundancy*) deployments, where one machine assumes the primary role, and another *backup* machine assumes the secondary role. Cisco ISE features distinct configurable personas, services, and roles, which allow you
to create and apply Cisco ISE services where needed in the network. The result is a comprehensive Cisco ISE deployment that
operates as a fully functional and integrated system.

Cisco ISE nodes can be deployed with one or more of the Administration, Monitoring, and Policy Service personas. Each persona
performs a different, but vital, part in your overall network policy management topology. Installing Cisco ISE with an administration
persona allows you to configure and manage your network from a centralized portal to promote efficiency and ease of use.

## Cisco ISE Distributed Deployment

A deployment that has more than one Cisco ISE node is called a distributed deployment. To support failover and to improve
performance, you can set up your deployment with multiple Cisco ISE nodes in a distributed fashion. In a Cisco ISE distributed
deployment, the administration and monitoring activities are centralized, and processing is distributed across the PSNs. Depending
on your performance needs, you can scale your deployment. Each Cisco ISE node in a deployment can assume any of these personas-Administration,
Policy Service, and Monitoring.

* [Data Replication from Primary to Secondary Cisco ISE Nodes](#ID182)
* [Cisco ISE Node Deregistration](#ID185)
* [Node Status in a Cisco ISE Deployment](#Cisco_Concept.dita_2442ca4d-e572-43ad-8850-36b8dae63082)
* [Guidelines for Setting Up a Distributed Deployment](#ID209)
* [Menu Options Available on Primary and Secondary Nodes](#ID246)

### Cisco ISE Deployment Setup

After you install Cisco ISE on all your nodes, as described in the [Cisco Identity Services Engine Hardware Installation Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/security/identity-services-engine/products-installation-guides-list.html), the nodes come up in a standalone state. You must then define one node as your primary PAN. While defining your primary
PAN, you must enable the administration and monitoring personas on that node. You can optionally enable the policy service
persona on the primary PAN. After you complete the task of defining personas on the primary PAN, you can register other secondary
nodes to the primary PAN and define personas for the secondary nodes.

All Cisco ISE system and functionality-related configurations should be done only on the primary PAN. The configuration changes
that you perform on the primary PAN are replicated to all the secondary nodes in your deployment.

There must be at least one MnT in a distributed deployment. At the time of configuring your primary PAN, you must enable the
Monitoring persona. After you register an MnT node in your deployment, you can edit the primary PAN and disable the Monitoring
persona, if required.

### Data Replication from Primary to Secondary Cisco ISE Nodes

When you register a Cisco ISE node as a secondary node, Cisco ISE immediately creates a data replication channel from the
primary to the secondary node and begins the process of replication. Replication is the process of sharing Cisco ISE configuration
data from the primary to the secondary nodes. Replication ensures consistency among the configuration data available in all
the Cisco ISE nodes that are part of your deployment. From Cisco ISE, Release 3.3, dynamically discovered endpoints are not replicated to all the nodes in the Cisco ISE deployment
automatically. In the Endpoint Replication window (Administration > System > Settings > Endpoint Replication), click the corresponding radio button to enable or disable the replication of the dynamically discovered endpoints across
all the nodes in your Cisco ISE deployment:

* Click Replicate endpoints to all nodes to enable replication of endpoint information to all the nodes in the Cisco ISE deployment.
* Click Disable endpoint replication to all nodes to disable replication of endpoint information to all the nodes in the Cisco ISE deployment. This is selected by default.

Statically configured endpoints, endpoints imported from CSV files, endpoints created using OpenAPI, and guest and posture-enabled
endpoints are automatically replicated across all Cisco ISE nodes.

To enable or disable endpoint replication using OpenAPI, see the *[Cisco ISE API Reference Guide](https://developer.cisco.com/docs/identity-services-engine/v1/)*.

A full replication typically occurs when you first register a Cisco ISE node as a secondary node. Incremental replication
occurs after a full replication and ensures that any new changes, such as additions, modifications, or deletions to the configuration
data in the PAN are reflected in the secondary nodes. The process of replication ensures that all the Cisco ISE nodes in a
deployment are in sync. You can view the status of replication in the Node Status column in the Deployment window of the Cisco ISE Admin portal. When you register a Cisco ISE node as a secondary node or perform a manual synchronization
with the PAN, the node status shows an orange icon, indicating that the requested action is in progress. After the synchronization
is complete, the node status turns green, indicating that the secondary node is synchronized with the PAN.

| **Note** | ---  * "Disable endpoint replication to all nodes" does not lead to data loss, as it only stops replication for Dynamic Endpoints." * In Cisco ISE replication, if the primary node is unable to publish replication events to the secondary nodes and the number   of un-published events exceeds 1.5 million, the system marks all the secondary nodes OUT OF SYNC.  On the other hand, if the delta between the published sequence and the secondary nodes consuming the replication events exceeds   2 million, the system marks those specific PSNs OUT OF SYNC.  --- |
| --- | --- |

### Cisco ISE Node Deregistration

To remove a node from a deployment, you must deregister it. When you deregister a secondary node from the primary PAN, the
status of the deregistered node changes to standalone, and the connection between the primary and the secondary node is lost.
Replication updates are no longer sent to the deregistered standalone node.

When a PSN is deregistered, the endpoint data is lost. If you want the PSN to retain the endpoint data after it becomes a
standalone node, you can do one of the following:

* Obtain a backup from the primary PAN, and when the PSN becomes a standalone node, restore this data backup on it.
* Change the persona of the PSN to administration (secondary PAN), synchronize the data from the Deployment window of the Admin portal, and then deregister the node. This node will now have all the data. You can then add a secondary
  PAN to the existing deployment.

| **Note** | ---   You cannot deregister a primary PAN.   --- |

### Node Status in a Cisco ISE Deployment

Table 1. Cisco ISE Node Status

| Node Status | Description | Guidelines |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Connected | Node is connected and replication works fine. | - |
| Replication Stopped | Node is connected but replication has stopped. The node is reachable on ports 443 and 12001.  This is a temporary status that will change when the underlying replication issue is resolved. | The underlying issue may resolve by itself. If not, log in to the Cisco ISE GUI and perform a manual synchronization from the **Deployment** window. |
| Node Not Reachable | Node is not reachable on port 443 but replication works fine. | The node may come back up by itself when the underlying issue resolves. If not, log in to the Cisco ISE GUI and perform a manual synchronization from the **Deployment** window. |
| Disconnected | Node is not reachable and replication has stopped. | This status is set if the node is down for more than five minutes.  The node may come back up by itself when the underlying issue resolves. If not, log in to the Cisco ISE GUI and perform a manual synchronization from the **Deployment** window. |
| Registration failed | Node registration has failed. | Perform a manual synchronization. Deregister and register the affected Cisco ISE node again. |
| In Progress | Node registration or manual sync is in progress.  Currently, the In Progress status has a timeout value of 300 minutes, after which the status changes to:   * Connected if registration or manual sync is successful. * Registration Failed if node registration fails. * Not in Sync if manual sync fails. | No action is required if the status changes to Connected. If it changes to Registration Failed or Not in Sync, check the respective rows and perfom the necessary actions. |
| Not in Sync | Node is not in sync. | Perform a manual synchronization. Deregister and register the affected Cisco ISE node again. |
| Upgrading | Node upgrade is in progress. | - |

### Guidelines for Setting Up a Distributed Deployment

Read the following statements carefully before you set up Cisco ISE in a distributed environment:

* Choose a node type for the Cisco ISE server. You must choose a Cisco ISE node for administration, policy service, and monitoring
  capabilities.
* Choose the same Network Time Protocol (NTP) server for all the nodes. To avoid timezone issues among the nodes, you must provide
  the same NTP server name when setting up each node. This setting ensures that the reports and logs from the various nodes
  in your deployment are always synchronized with timestamps.
* Configure the Cisco ISE administrator password when you install Cisco ISE. The previous Cisco ISE administrator default login
  credentials (admin/cisco) are no longer valid. Use the username and password that was created during the initial setup, or
  the current password if it was changed later.
* Configure the DNS server. Enter the IP addresses and fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) of all the Cisco ISE nodes that
  are part of your distributed deployment in the DNS server. Otherwise, node registration fails.
* Configure the forward and the reverse DNS lookup for all the Cisco ISE nodes in your distributed deployment in the DNS server.
  Otherwise, you may run into deployment-related issues when registering and restarting Cisco ISE nodes. Performance might be
  degraded if reverse DNS lookup is not configured for all the nodes.
* (Optional) Deregister a secondary Cisco ISE node from the primary PAN to uninstall Cisco ISE from it.
* Back up the primary MnT, and restore the data to the new secondary MnT. This ensures that the history of the primary MnT is
  in sync with the new MnT because the new changes are replicated.
* Ensure that the primary PAN and the standalone node that you are about to register as a secondary node are running the same
  version of Cisco ISE.
* Enable **Internal CA Settings** on your Cisco ISE primary PAN before you add another node to your deployment to ensure that the Cisco ISE certificate services
  function as expected. To enable Internal CA Settings, click the Menu icon (![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/440001-450000/440001-441000/440197.jpg)) and choose Administration > System > Certificates > Certificate Authority > Internal CA Settings.
* While adding a new node to the deployment, make sure that the issuer certificate chain of wildcard certificates is part of
  the trusted certificates of the new node. When the new node is added to the deployment, the wildcard certificates are replicated
  to the new node.
* When configuring your Cisco ISE deployment to support Cisco TrustSec, or when Cisco ISE is integrated with Cisco Catalyst Center, do not configure a PSN as SXP-only. SXP is an interface between Cisco TrustSec and non-Cisco TrustSec devices. SXP does
  not communicate with the Cisco TrustSec-enabled network devices.

### Menu Options Available on Primary and Secondary Nodes

The menu options that are available in Cisco ISE nodes that are a part of a distributed deployment depend on the personas
that are enabled on them. You must perform all administration and monitoring activities through the primary PAN. For other
tasks, you must use the secondary nodes. Therefore, the user interface of the secondary nodes provides limited menu options
based on the persona that is enabled on them.

If a node assumes more than one persona, for example, the Policy Service persona, and a Monitoring persona with a primary
role, the menu options listed for the PSNs and the primary MnT are available on that node.

The following table lists the menu options that are available on the Cisco ISE nodes that assume different personas.

Table 2. Cisco ISE Nodes and Available
Menu Options

| Cisco ISE Node | Available Menu Options |
| --- | --- |
| All Nodes | * View and configure the system time and the NTP server settings. * Install the server certificate and manage certificate signing request. You can perform server certificate operations for all   the nodes in the deployment through the primary PAN that centrally manages all the server certificates.       | **Note** | The private keys are not stored in the local database and are not copied from the relevant node. The private keys are stored in the local file system. |   | --- | --- | |
| Primary Policy Administration node (primary PAN) | All menus and submenus. |
| Primary Monitoring node (primary MnT node) | * Provides access to monitoring data.       | **Note** | The Operations menu can be viewed only from the primary PAN. The Operations menu does not appear in the monitoring nodes. |   | --- | --- | |
| PSNs (Policy Service nodes) | Options to join, leave, and test the Active Directory connection are available. Each PSN must be separately joined to the Active Directory domain. You must first define the domain information and join the PAN to the Active Directory domain. Then, join the other PSNs to the Active Directory domain individually. |
| Secondary Policy Administration node (secondary PAN) | Option to promote the secondary PAN to primary PAN.   | **Note** | After you have registered the secondary nodes to the primary PAN, while logging in to the Admin portal of any of the secondary nodes, you must use the login credentials of the primary PAN. | | --- | --- | |

### General Node Settings

The following table describes the fields on the General Settings window of a Cisco ISE node. In this window, you can assign a persona to a node and configure the services to be run on it.
To view this window, click the Menu icon (![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/440001-450000/440001-441000/440197.jpg)) and choose
Administration > System > Deployment > Deployment Node > Edit > General Settings.

Table 4. General Node Settings

| Field Name | Usage Guidelines |
| --- | --- |
| **Hostname** | Displays the hostname of the Cisco ISE node. |
| **FQDN** | Displays the fully qualified domain name of the Cisco ISE node, for example, ise1.cisco.com. |
| **IP Address** | Displays the IP address of the Cisco ISE node. |
| **Node Type** | Displays the node type. |
| **Personas** | |
| **Administration** | Enable this toggle button if you want a Cisco ISE node to assume the Administration persona. You can enable the Administration persona only on nodes that are licensed to provide the administrative services.  Role: Displays the role that the Administration persona has assumed in the deployment. The persona can take one of these values—Standalone, Primary, or Secondary.  Make Primary: Click this to make this node your primary Cisco ISE node. You can have only one primary Cisco ISE node in a deployment. The other options in this window will become active only after you make this node primary. You can have only two Administration nodes in a deployment. If the node has a  Standalone role, the Make Primary button appears next to it. If the node has a Secondary role, the Promote to Primary button appears next to it. If the node has a Primary role, and there are no other nodes registered with it, the Make Standalone button appears next to it. Click the Make Standalone button to make your primary node a standalone node. |
| **Monitoring** | Click this toggle button if you want a Cisco ISE node to assume the Monitoring persona and function as your log collector. There must be at least one Monitoring node in a distributed deployment. At the time of configuring your primary PAN, you must enable the Monitoring persona. After you register a secondary Monitoring node in your deployment, you can edit the primary PAN and disable the Monitoring persona, if required.  To configure a Cisco ISE node on a VMware platform as your log collector, use the following guidelines to determine the minimum amount of disk space that you need: 180 KB per endpoint in your network per day and 2.5 MB per Cisco ISE node in your network per day.  You can calculate the maximum disk space that you need based on how many months of data you want to have in your Monitoring node. If there is only one Monitoring node in your deployment, it assumes the standalone role. If you have two Monitoring nodes in your deployment, Cisco ISE displays the name of the other Monitoring node too for you to configure the primary-secondary roles. To configure these roles, choose one of the following:   * Primary: For the current node to be the primary Monitoring node. * Secondary: For the current node to be the secondary Monitoring node. * None: If you do not want the Monitoring nodes to assume the primary-secondary roles.   If you configure one of your Monitoring nodes as primary or secondary, the other Monitoring node automatically becomes the secondary or primary node, respectively. Both the primary and secondary Monitoring nodes receive Administration and Policy Service logs. If you change the role for one Monitoring node to None, the role of the other Monitoring node also becomes None, thereby cancelling the high availability pair after you designate a node as a Monitoring node. You will find this node listed as a syslog target in the Remote Logging Targets window. To view this window, click the Menu icon () and choose Administration > System > Logging > Remote Logging Targets. |
| **Policy Service** | Click this toggle button to enable any one or all of the following services:  * Enable Session Services: Check this check box to enable network access, posture, guest, and client-provisioning services. From the Include Node in Node Group drop-down list, choose the group to which this Policy Service node belongs. Note that Certificate Authority (CA) and Enrollment   over Secure Transport (EST) services can only run on a Policy Service node that has session services enabled on it.  For Include Node in Node Group, choose None if you do not want this Policy Service node to be a part of a group.  All the nodes within the same node group should be configured on the network access device (NAD) as RADIUS clients and authorized   for CoA, because any one of them can issue a CoA request for the sessions that are established through any node in the node   group. If you are not using a load balancer, the nodes in a node group should be the same as, or a subset of the RADIUS servers   and clients configured on the NAD. These nodes would also be configured as RADIUS servers.  While a single NAD can be configured with many Cisco ISE nodes as RADIUS servers and dynamic-authorization clients, it is   not necessary for all the nodes to be in the same node group.  The members of a node group should be connected to each other using high-speed LAN connection such as Gigabit Ethernet. The   node group members need not be L2 adjacent, but L2 adjacency is highly recommended to ensure sufficient bandwidth and reachability.   See the [Create a Policy Service Node Group](#ID513 "When two or more PSNs are connected to the same LAN, you can place them in the same node group.") for more details. * Enable Profiling Service: Check this check box to enable the Profiling service. If you enable the Profiling service, you must click the Profiling Configuration tab and enter the details, as required. When you enable or disable any of the services that run on the Policy Service node   or make any changes to this node, you will be restarting the application server processes on which these services run. Expect   a delay while these services restart. You can determine when the application server has restarted on a node by using the **show application status ise** command from the CLI. * Enable Threat-Centric NAC Service: Check this check box to enable the Threat-Centric Network Access Control (TC-NAC) feature. This feature allows you to create   authorization policies based on the threat and vulnerability attributes received from the threat and vulnerability adapters.   Threat severity levels and vulnerability assessment results can be used to dynamically control the access level of an endpoint   or a user. * Enable SXP Service: Check this check box to enable SXP service on the node. You must also specify the interface to be used for SXP service.  If you have configured NIC bonding or teaming, the bonded interfaces are also listed along with the physical interfaces in   the Use Interface drop-down list. * Enable Device Admin Service: Check this check box to create TACACS policy sets, policy results, and so on, to control and audit the configuration of   network devices. * Enable Passive Identity Service: Check this check box to enable the Identity Mapping feature. This feature enables you to monitor users who are authenticated   by a Domain Controller and not by Cisco ISE. In networks where Cisco ISE does not actively authenticate users for network   access, you can use the Identity Mapping feature to collect user authentication information from the Active Directory Domain   Controller. |
| **pxGrid** | Check this check box to enable the pxGrid persona. Cisco pxGrid is used to share the context-sensitive information from the Cisco ISE session directory to other policy network systems such as Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA). The pxGrid framework can also be used to exchange policy and configuration data between nodes, for example, sharing tags and policy objects between Cisco ISE and third-party vendors, and for non-Cisco ISE-related information exchanges such as threat information. |

* [Configure Logging Categories](#ID527)

### Remote Logging Target Settings

The following table describes the fields in the Remote Logging Targets window that you can use to create external locations (syslog servers) to store logging messages. To access this window, Administration > System > Logging > Remote Logging Targets, and  click Add.

Table 6. Remote Logging Target
Settings

| Field Name | Usage Guidelines |
| --- | --- |
| Name | Enter a name for the new syslog target. |
| Target Type | Select the target type from the drop-down list. The default value is UDP Syslog. |
| Description | Enter a brief description of the new target. |
| IP Address | Enter the IP address or hostname of the destination machine that will store the logs. Cisco ISE supports IPv4 and IPv6 formats for logging. |
| Port | Enter the port number of the destination machine. |
| Facility Code | Choose the syslog facility code that must be used for logging, from the drop-down list. Valid options are Local0 through Local7. |
| Maximum Length | Enter the maximum length of the remote log target messages. Valid values are from 200 through 1024 bytes. |
| Include Alarms For this Target | When you check this check box, alarm messages are sent to the remote server as well. |
| Comply to RFC 3164 | When you check this check box, the delimiters (, ; { } \ \) in the syslog messages sent to the remote servers are not escaped even if a backslash (\) is used. |
| Buffer Message When Server Down | This check box is displayed when you choose TCP Syslog or Secure Syslog from the Target Type drop-down list. Check this check box to allow Cisco ISE to buffer the syslog messages when a TCP syslog target or secure syslog target is unavailable. Cisco ISE retries sending messages to the target when the connection to the target resumes. After the connection resumes, messages are sent sequentially, starting with the oldest, and proceeding to the newest. Buffered messages are always sent before new messages. If the buffer is full, old messages are discarded. |
| Buffer Size (MB) | Set the buffer size for each target. By default, it is set to 100 MB. Changing the buffer size clears the buffer, and all the existing buffered messages for the specific target are lost. |
| Reconnect Timeout (Sec) | Enter the time (in seconds) to configure how long the TCP and secure syslogs are stored for before being discarded when the server is down. |
| Select CA Certificate | This drop-down list is displayed when you choose Secure Syslog from the Target Type drop-down list. Choose a client certificate from the drop-down list. |
| Ignore Server Certificate Validation | This check box is displayed when you choose Secure Syslog from the Target Type drop-down list. Check this check box for Cisco ISE to ignore server certificate authentication and accept any syslog server. By default, this option is set to Off unless the system is in FIPS mode when this is disabled. |

#### Configure Client Authentication for Secure Syslog Target Connections

From Cisco ISE Release 3.3, client authentication is mandatory when a client tries to connect to a secure syslog target. For
client authentication, you must import the certificate to be shared with the Cisco ISE server into the Cisco ISE Trusted Certificate
Store. This trusted certificate must contain the client hostname in the common name (CN) or subject alternative name (SAN)
fields.

If you have two standalone Cisco ISE nodes where one is the client and the other is the remote syslog target, carry out the
following steps. In this example, 10.0.0.1 is the client and 10.0.0.2 is the remote syslog target:

1. In 10.0.0.1, in the Remote Logging Targets window, configure a new remote syslog target with the **Host/IP Address** field filled as **10.0.0.2**.
2. In 10.0.0.2, in the Remote Logging Targets window, enable the default SecureSyslogCollector.
3. Upload a trusted certificate for 10.0.0.1 into the Trusted Certificate store of 10.0.0.2.

   * In the remote syslog target configuration in 10.0.0.1, if you choose the self-signed certificate in the Select CA Certificate field, then upload this self-signed certificate as the trusted certificate in 10.0.0.2.
   * In the remote syslog target configuration in 10.0.0.1, if you choose a third-party CA certificate in the Select CA Certificate field upload the chain of root CA certificate and CA-signed certificate as the trusted certificate in 10.0.0.2
4. Upload a trusted certificate for 10.0.0.2 into the Trusted Certificate store of 10.0.0.1.

   * In the remote syslog target configuration in 10.0.0.2, if you choose the self-signed certificate in the Select CA Certificate
     field, upload the self-signed certificate as the trusted certificate in 10.0.0.1.
   * In the remote syslog target configuration in 10.0.0.2, if you choose a third-party CA certificate in the Select CA Certificate
     field upload the chain of root CA certificate and CA-signed certificate as the trusted certificate in 10.0.0.1
5. 10.0.0.2 sends the configured certificate, either self-signed on CA-signed, to 10.0.0.1 for authentication.
6. 10.0.0.1 receives the certificate from 10.0.0.2 and responds with the configured trusted certificate to complete the authentication
   workflow.

## Administration Node

A Cisco ISE node with the Administration persona allows you to perform all administrative operations on Cisco ISE. It handles
all the system-related configurations that are related to functionalities such as authentication, authorization, auditing,
and so on. In a distributed environment, you can have a maximum of two nodes running the Administration persona. The Administration
persona can take on of these following roles—Standalone, Primary, or Secondary.

### High Availability for Administrative Node

In a high-availability configuration, the primary Policy Administration Node (PAN) is in the Active state. The secondary PAN
is in the Standby state, which means it receives all configuration updates from the primary PAN, but is not active in the
Cisco ISE network.

Cisco ISE supports manual and automatic failover. With automatic failover, when the primary PAN goes down, an automatic promotion
of the secondary PAN is initiated. Automatic failover requires a nonadministration secondary node, which is called a health
check node. The health check node checks the health of the primary PAN. If the health check node detects that the primary
PAN is down or unreachable, it initiates the promotion of the secondary PAN to take over the primary role.

To deploy the Automatic Failover feature, you must have at least three nodes, with two of them assuming the Administration
persona, and one acting as the health check node. A health check node is a nonadministration node and can be a PSN, MnT, or
pxGrid node, or a combination of these. If the primary and secondary PANs are in different data centers, you must have a health
check node for each PAN.

The following table lists the features that are affected when the primary PAN goes down and the secondary PAN is yet to take
over.

Table 10. Availability of Features

| Feature Name | Available When Primary PAN is Down? (Yes/No) |
| --- | --- |
| Existing internal user RADIUS authentication | Yes |
| Existing or new AD user RADIUS authentication | Yes |
| Existing endpoint with no profile change | Yes |
| Existing endpoint with profile change | No |
| New endpoint learned through profiling. | No |
| Existing guest: Local Web Authentication (LWA) | Yes |
| Existing guest: Central Web Authentication (CWA) | Yes (apart from flows enabled for device registration, such as Hotspot, BYOD, and CWA with automatic device registration) |
| Guest change password | No |
| Guest: AUP | No |
| Guest: Max Failed Login Enforcement | No |
| New Guest (Sponsored or Self-registered) | No |
| Posture | Yes |
| BYOD with Internal CA | No |
| Existing Registered Devices | Yes |
| MDM on-boarding | No |
| pxGrid Service | No |
| System 360 - Monitoring | No |
| System 360 – Log Analytics | No (When the Primary PAN also has a Secondary MNT persona) |
| Log in to GUI of secondary nodes | Yes (The login process is delayed because a blocking call to the PAN is attempted to update the last login details. Login proceeds after this call times out.) |

| **Note** | ---  * Authentication response time increases when the rate of incoming PSN authentications exceeds 100 per second while the PAN   is down. * Actions must be taken to bring the PAN back into deployment within 12 hours.  --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---   To support certificate provisioning with the internal CA, you must to import the root certificate of the original primary PAN and its key into the new primary node, after promotion. Certificate provisioning does not work after automatic failover for the PSN nodes that are added after the promotion of the secondary node to primary PAN.   --- |
| --- | --- |

### High-Availability Health Check Nodes

The health check node for the Primary PAN is called the active health check node. The health check node for the Secondary
PAN is called the passive health check node. The active health check node is responsible for checking the status of the Primary
PAN, and managing the automatic failover of Administration nodes. We recommend that you use two nonadministrative ISE nodes
as health check nodes, one for the Primary PAN and one for the Secondary PAN. If you use only one health check node, and that
node goes down, automatic failover will not happen.

When both the PANs are in the same data center, you can use a single nonadministrative ISE node as the health check node for
both the Primary PAN and the Secondary PAN. When a single health check node checks the health of both the Primary PAN and
the Secondary PAN, it assumes both the active and passive roles.

A health check node is a nonadministration node, which means it can be a Policy Service, Monitoring, or pxGrid node, or a
combination of these. We recommend that you designate PSN nodes as health check nodes in the same data center as the Administration
nodes. However, in a small or a centralized deployment, where the two Administration nodes are not in the same location (LAN
or data center), any node (PSN, pxGrid, or MnT) not having the Administration persona can be used as the health check node.

| **Note** | ---   If you chose to not enable automatic failover, and rely on manually promoting the secondary node when the primary PAN fails, you do not need any check nodes.   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Health Check Node for the Secondary PAN

The health check node for the Secondary PAN is a passive monitor. It does not take any action until the Secondary PAN has
been promoted as the Primary PAN. When the Secondary PAN takes over the primary role, its associated health check node takes
the active role for managing automatic failover of Administration nodes. The health check node of the previous Primary PAN
becomes the health check node for the Secondary PAN now and monitors it passively.

#### Disabling and Restarting Health Check

When a node is removed from the health check role or auto failover configuration is disabled, the health check service is
stopped on that node. When the auto failover configuration is enabled on the designated high-availability health check node,
the node starts checking the health of Administration nodes again. Designating or removing the high-availability health check
role of a node does not involve any application restart on that node; only the health check activities are started or stopped.

If the high-availability health check node is restarted, it ignores the previous downtimes of the Primary PAN and starts checking
the health status afresh.

### Health Check Nodes

The active health check node checks the health status of the primary PAN at a configured polling interval. It sends a request
to the primary PAN, and if the response that it receives matches the configuration, the health check node considers the primary
PAN to be in good health. If the health of the primary PAN is continuously poor for more than the configured failover period,
the health check node initiates failover to the secondary PAN.

If, at any time during a health check, the health status is found to be good after being reported as poor previously within
the failover period, the health check node marks the primary PAN status as good, and resets the health check cycle.

The response from the health check of the primary PAN is validated against the configuration values available on its health
check node. If the response does not match, it raises an alarm. However, a promotion request is made to the secondary PAN.

#### Changing Health Nodes

You can change the Cisco ISE node that you are using for a health check, but there are some things to consider.

For example, assume that the health check node (H1) goes out-of-sync, and another node (H2) is made the health check node
of the primary PAN. In such a case, after the primary PAN goes down, there is no way for H1 to know that another node (H2)
is checking the same primary PAN. Later, if H2 goes down or goes out of the network, an actual failover is required. The secondary
PAN, however, retains the right to reject the promotion request. So, after the secondary PAN is promoted to the primary role,
a promotion request from H2 is rejected with an error. Even if a health check node for the primary PAN is out of sync, it
continues to check the health of the primary PAN.

### Automatic Failover to the Secondary PAN

You can configure Cisco ISE to automatically promote the Secondary PAN when the Primary PAN becomes unavailable. The configuration
is done on the Primary PAN in the Deployment window. To view this window, click the Menu icon (![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/440001-450000/440001-441000/440197.jpg)) and choose
Administration > System > Deployment. The failover period is defined as the number of times configured in Number of Failure Polls Before Failover times the number of seconds configured in Polling Interval. In the default configuration, that time is 10 minutes. Promotion of the Secondary PAN to Primary PAN takes another 10 minutes.
So, by default, the total time from Primary PAN failure to secondary PAN working is 20 minutes.

When the Secondary PAN receives the failover call, it carries out the following validations before proceeding with the actual
failover:

* The Primary PAN is not available in the network.
* The failover request came from a valid health check node.
* The failover request is for the Secondary PAN.

If all the validations pass, the Secondary PAN promotes itself to the primary role.

The following are some sample (but not limited to) scenarios where automatic failover of the Secondary PAN can be attempted:

* Health of the Primary PAN is consistently not good for the Number of failure polls before failover value during the polling period.
* Cisco ISE services on the Primary PAN are manually stopped, and remain stopped for the failover period.
* The Primary PAN is shut down using soft halt or reboot option, and remains shut down for the configured failover period.
* The Primary PAN goes down abruptly (power down), and remains down for the failover period.
* The network interface of the Primary PAN is down (network port shut or network service down), or it is not reachable by the
  health check node for any other reason, and remains down for the configured failover period.

#### Health Check Node Restarts

Upon restart, the high-availability health check node ignores the previous downtimes of the Primary PAN and checks the health
status afresh.

#### Bring Your Own Device in Case of Automatic Failover to Secondary PAN

When the Primary PAN is down, authentication is not interrupted for the endpoints that already have certificates issued by
the Primary PAN root CA chain. This is because all the nodes in the deployment have the entire certificate chain for trust
and validation purposes.

However, until the Secondary PAN is promoted to Primary, new BYOD devices will not be onboarded. BYOD onboarding requires
an active Primary PAN.

After the original primary PAN is brought back up or the Secondary PAN is promoted, new BYOD endpoints are onboarded without
any issues.

If the Primary PAN that failed can not be rejoined as the Primary PAN, regenerate the root CA certificate on the newly promoted
Primary PAN (the original secondary PAN).

For existing certificate chains, triggering a new root CA certificate results in the automatic generation of the subordinate
CA certificates. Even when new subordinate certificates are generated, endpoint certificates that were generated by the previous
chain continue to be valid.

### Sample Scenarios when Automatic Failover is Avoided

The following are some sample scenarios that depict cases where automatic failover by the health check node might be avoided
or a promotion request to the secondary node rejected:

* The node receiving the promotion request is not the secondary node.
* The promotion request received by the Secondary PAN does not have the correct Primary PAN information.
* The promotion request is received from an incorrect health check node.
* The promotion request is received, but the Primary PAN is up and in good health.
* The node receiving the promotion request goes out-of-sync.

### Functionalities Affected by the PAN Automatic Failover Feature

The following table lists the functionalities that are blocked or require additional configuration changes if the PAN automatic
failover configuration is enabled in your deployment.

| Functionality | Affected Details |
| --- | --- |
| Operations that are Blocked | |
| Upgrade | Upgrade through the CLI is blocked.  By default, this feature is disabled.  To deploy the Automatic Failover feature, you must have at least three nodes, where two of the nodes assume the Administration persona, and one node acts as the health check node. (A health check node is a nonadministration node and can be a PSN, MnT, or pxGrid node, or a combination of these). If the PANs are in different data centers, you must have a health check node for each PAN. |
| Restore of Backup | Restore action through the CLI and user interface is blocked.  If the PAN automatic failover configuration was enabled prior to restore, you must reconfigure it after a successful restore. |

### Configure Primary PAN for Automatic Failover

#### Before you begin

To deploy the Automatic Failover feature, you must have at least three nodes, of which two nodes assume the Administration
persona, and one node acts as the health check node. A health check node is a nonadministration node and can be a PSN, MnT,
or pxGrid node, or a combination of these. If the PANs are in different data centers, you must have a health check node for
each PAN.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Log in to the Primary PAN GUI. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon () and choose Administration > System > Deployment > PAN Failover. |
| **Step 3** | Check the Enable PAN Auto Failover check box to enable automatic failover of the primary PAN.   | **Note** | You can only promote a Secondary PAN to become the Primary PAN. Cisco ISE nodes that assume only the PSN, MnT, or pxGrid node, or a combination of these, cannot be promoted to become the Primary PAN. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 4** | Choose the health check node for the primary PAN from the Primary Health Check Node drop-down list containing all the available secondary nodes.  We recommend that you have this node in the same location or data center as the primary PAN. |
| **Step 5** | Choose the health check node for the secondary PAN, from the Secondary Health Check Node drop-down list containing all the available secondary nodes.  We recommend that you have this node in the same location or data center as the secondary PAN. |
| **Step 6** | Provide the Polling Interval time after which the PAN status is checked. The valid range is 30 to 300 seconds. |
| **Step 7** | Provide the count for Number of Failure Polls before Failover.  Failover occurs if the status of the PAN is not good for the specified number of failure polls. The valid range is 2 to 60 counts. |
| **Step 8** | Click Save. |

---

#### What to do next

After the promotion of the Secondary PAN to the Primary PAN, do the following:

* Manually sync the old Primary PAN to bring it back into the deployment.
* Manually sync any other secondary node that is outof sync, to bring it back into the deployment.

### Manually Promote Secondary PAN to Primary

If the Primary PAN fails and you have not configured PAN automatic failover, you must manually promote the Secondary PAN to become the new Primary PAN.

#### Before you begin

Ensure that you have a second Cisco ISE node configured with the Administration persona to promote as your Primary PAN.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Log in to the Secondary PAN GUI. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon () and choose Administration  >  System  >  Deployment. |
| **Step 3** | In the Edit Node window, click Promote to Primary.   | **Note** | You can only promote a secondary PAN to become the primary PAN. Cisco ISE nodes that assume only the Policy Service or Monitoring persona, or both, cannot be promoted to become the primary PAN. | | --- | --- |    If the node that was originally the Primary PAN, comes back up, it will be demoted automatically and become the Secondary PAN. You must perform a manual synchronization on this node (that was originally the Primary PAN) to bring it back into the deployment.  In the Edit Node window of a secondary node, you cannot modify the personas or services because the options are disabled. You have to log in to the Admin portal to make changes. |
| **Step 4** | Click Save. |

### Reusing a Node of an Existing Cisco ISE Deployment as a Primary PAN for a New Cisco ISE Deployment

If you want to repurpose a node of an existing Cisco ISE deployment to the primary PAN of a new Cisco ISE deployment you must,
perform these steps:

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Run the Cisco ISE Perform System Erase utility, as described in the *Cisco ISE Installation Guide* for your version of Cisco ISE. This document is available at: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/security/identity-services-engine/products-installation-guides-list.html> |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Perform a fresh install of Cisco ISE, as described in the *Cisco ISE Installation Guide*. |
| **Step 3** | Configure the standalone node as a primary Policy Administration node, as described in [Configure a Primary Policy Administration Node](#ID330 "To set up a distributed deployment, you must first configure a Cisco ISE node as your primary PAN."). |

---

### Restoring Service to the Primary PAN

Cisco ISE does not support automatic fallback to the original primary PAN. After the automatic failover to the secondary
PAN is initiated, if you bring the original primary PAN back into the network, you should configure it as the secondary PAN.

## Support for Automatic Failover for the Administration Node

Cisco ISE supports automatic failover for the Administration persona. To enable the Automatic Failover feature, at least
two nodes in your distributed setup should assume the Administration persona and one node should assume the nonadministration
persona. If the Primary PAN goes down, an automatic promotion of the Secondary PAN is initiated. For this, a nonadministration
secondary node is designated as the health check node for each of the PANs. The health check node checks the health of the
primary PAN at configured intervals. If the health check response received for the primary PAN is not good for reasons, such
as the device being down or unreachable, the health check node initiates the promotion of the secondary PAN to take over the
primary role after waiting for the configured threshold value. Some features are unavailable after automatic failover of the
secondary PAN. Cisco ISE does not support fallback to the original primary PAN. See [High Availability for the Administration Nodes](#ID59 "In a high-availability configuration, the primary PAN is in the active state and the secondary PAN is in the standby state.").

## Policy Service Node

A Policy Service node (PSN) is a Cisco ISE node with the Policy Service persona, and provides network access, posture, guest
access, client provisioning, and profiling services.

At least one node in your distributed setup should assume the Policy Service persona. This persona evaluates the policies
and makes all the decisions. Typically, there is more than one PSN in a distributed deployment.

All the PSNs that reside in the same high-speed Local Area Network (LAN) or behind a load balancer can be grouped together
to form a node group. If one of the nodes in a node group fails, the other nodes detect the failure and reset URL-redirected
sessions, if any.

* [High Availability in Policy Service Nodes](#ID67)
* [Load Balancer to Distribute Requests Evenly Among PSNs](#concept_FCF3371A3F2F460DB7B5107F9E0B8F0D)
* [Session Failover in Policy Service Nodes](#concept_6D26AEAD132A45DB91C51ED0B8890746)
* [Number of Nodes in a Policy Service Node Group](#ID84)
* [Light Data Distribution](#Cisco_Concept.dita_986b9117-b102-40d6-954e-6beccfd7bd06)
* [RADIUS Session Directory](#Cisco_Concept.dita_e682e614-daaa-471f-bace-2657df5eeb24)
* [Endpoint Owner Directory](#id_124200)

### High Availability in Policy Service Nodes

To detect node failure and to reset all URL-redirected sessions on the failed node, two or more PSNs can be placed in the
same node group. When a node that belongs to a node group fails, another node in the same node group issues a Change of Authorization
(CoA) for all URL-redirected sessions on the failed node.

All the nodes within the same node group should be configured on the network access device (NAD) as RADIUS clients and authorized
for CoA, because any one of them can issue a CoA request for the sessions that are established through any node in the node
group. If you are not using a load balancer, the nodes in a node group should be the same as, or a subset of, the RADIUS servers
and clients configured on the NAD. These nodes should also be configured as RADIUS servers.

| **Note** | ---   While a single NAD can be configured with many Cisco ISE nodes as RADIUS servers and dynamicauthorization clients, it is not necessary for all the nodes to be in the same node group.   --- |
| --- | --- |

The members of a node group should be connected to each other using high-speed LAN connection such as Gigabit Ethernet. The
node group members need not be L2 adjacent, but L2 adjacency is highly recommended to ensure sufficient bandwidth and reachability.
See [Create a Policy Service Node Group](#ID513 "When two or more PSNs are connected to the same LAN, you can place them in the same node group.") for more details.

### Load Balancer to Distribute Requests Evenly Among PSNs

When you have multiple PSNs in the deployment, you can use a load balancer to distribute the requests evenly. The load balancer
distributes the requests to the functional nodes behind it. See [Cisco and F5 Deployment Guide: ISE Load Balancing using BIG-IP](https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/security/ise/how_to/HowTo-95-Cisco_and_F5_Deployment_Guide-ISE_Load_Balancing_Using_BIG-IP.pdf) for more information, and to know about best practices when deploying PSNs behind a load balancer.

### Session Failover in Policy Service Nodes

PSNs in a node group share session information. The nodes exchange heartbeat messages to detect node failures. If a node fails,
one of its peers from the node group knows which sessions were on the failed PSN, and issues a CoA to disconnect those sessions.
Most clients automatically reconnect, and establish a new session.

Some clients don’t automatically reconnect. For example, if a client connects through a VPN, then that client may not see
the CoA. Clients that are IP phones, multihost 802.1X ports, or virtual machines may also not see or be able to respond to
a CoA. URL-redirected clients (webauth) also can’t connect automatically. Those clients must manually reconnect.

Timing issues can also prevent reconnection, for example, if the posture state is pending at the time of PSN failover.

For more information about PSN session sharing, see [Light Data Distribution](#Cisco_Concept.dita_986b9117-b102-40d6-954e-6beccfd7bd06 "Light Data Distribution eliminates the need to be dependent on the PAN or MnT nodes for user session details.").

### Number of Nodes in a Policy Service Node Group

The number of nodes that you
can have in a node group depends on your deployment requirements. Node groups
ensure that node failures are detected and that a peer issues a CoA for
sessions that are authorized, but not yet postured. The size of the node group
does not have to be very large.

If the size of the node group increases, the number of messages and heartbeats that are exchanged between the nodes increases
significantly. As a result, traffic also increases. Having fewer nodes in a node group helps reduce the traffic and at the
same time provides sufficient redundancy to detect PSN failures.

There is no hard limit on the number of PSNs that you can have in a node group cluster.

### Light Data Distribution

Light Data Distribution is used to store user session information and replicate it across the PSNs in a deployment, thereby
eliminating the need to be dependent on the PAN or MnT nodes for user session details.

Light Data Distribution consists of the following directories:

* [RADIUS Session Directory](#Cisco_Concept.dita_e682e614-daaa-471f-bace-2657df5eeb24 "This directory stores only the session attributes that are required for CoA.")
* [Endpoint Owner Directory](#id_124200 "The endpoint ownership now changes only in case of a successful RADIUS authentication of that endpoint on another PSN.")

In addition, you can configure the following options under **Advanced Settings**:

* **Batch Size**: The session updates can be sent in batches. This value specifies the number of records sent in each batch from a Light Data
  Distribution instance to the other PSNs in the deployment. If this field is set to 1, the session updates are *not* sent in batches. The default value is 10 records.
* **TTL**: This value specifies the maximum time a session will wait for a batch to complete before updating the Light Data Distribution.
  The default value is 1000 milliseconds.

In case of connectivity issues between the PSNs, for example, when a PSN is down, the session details are retrieved from the
MnT session directory and stored for future use.

Large deployments can hold up to 2,000,000 session records. Small deployments can store 1,000,000 session records. When an
accounting stop request is received for a session, the corresponding session data is deleted from all Light Data Distribution
instances. When the number of stored records exceeds the maximum limit, the oldest sessions are deleted based on the timestamp.

| **Note** | ---  * If the IPv6 prefix length of a session is less than 128 bits and the interface ID is not specified, the IPv6 prefix is rejected,   thereby preventing multiple sessions from having the same key. * Light Data Distribution uses Cisco ISE messaging services for inter-node communication. Cisco ISE Release 3.0 and later support Certificate Signing Request generation for Cisco ISE Messaging Service. Thus, Cisco   ISE Release 3.0 and later have both internal and external CA support for ISE Messaging Service. If you face issues with the Cisco ISE messaging service, you have to regenerate Cisco ISE messaging service certificate. * 1. In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon () and choose      Administration > System > Certificates > Certificate Management > Certificate Signing Requests   2. In the Certificate(s) will be used for section, select ISE Messaging service.   3. Click Generate ISE messaging service certificate.  --- |
| --- | --- |

### RADIUS Session Directory

The RADIUS Session Directory is used to store the user session information and replicate it across the PSNs in a deployment. This directory stores only
the session attributes that are required for CoA.

This functionality is enabled by default from Cisco ISE Release 2.7. You can enable or disable this functionality, by checking
or unchecking the RADIUS Session Directory check box in the Light Data Distribution window. To view this window, click the Menu icon (![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/440001-450000/440001-441000/440197.jpg)) and choose
Administration > System > Settings > Light Data Distribution.

### Endpoint Owner Directory

Until Cisco ISE Release 2.6, when an endpoint probe is received on a Policy Service node (PSN) that is different from the
one that originally handled the requests for that specific endpoint, the endpoint owner is changed to the new PSN. This results
in endpoint ownership flapping.

From Cisco ISE Release 2.7, the Endpoint Owner Directory is used to store the PSN FQDN of each MAC address connecting to Cisco ISE and to replicate this data across the PSNs in a
deployment. This avoids endpoint ownership flapping because all the PSNs are now aware of all the endpoint owners. The endpoint
ownership now changes only in case of a successful RADIUS authentication of that endpoint on another PSN.

In addition, the static endpoint assignments are prioritized over the attributes received by an incoming probe for the same
endpoint, avoiding attribute override issues.

This feature is enabled by default from Cisco ISE Release 2.7. If required, you can disable it to fall back to the old mechanism
of not using the endpoint owner directory. The Endpoint Owner Directory is also used in profiling, and disabling this option will use the legacy profiler owner's directory. You can enable or disable
this feature by checking or unchecking the Enable Endpoint Owner Directory check box in the Light Data Distribution window. (To view this window, click the Menu icon (![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/440001-450000/440001-441000/440197.jpg)) and choose
Administration > System > Settings > Light Data Distribution).

## Monitoring Node

A Cisco ISE node with the Monitoring persona functions as the log collector and stores log messages from the PANs and PSNs
in your network. This persona provides advanced monitoring and troubleshooting tools that you can use to effectively manage
your network and resources. A node with this persona aggregates and correlates the data that it collects to provide you with
meaningful information in the form of reports.

Cisco ISE allows you to have a maximum of two nodes with this persona that can take on primary or secondary roles for high
availability. Both the primary and secondary MnT nodes collect log messages. If the primary MnT goes down, the primary PAN
points to the secondary node to gather monitoring data. But the secondary node will not be promoted to primary automatically.
This should be done by following the procedure described in [manually modifying the Monitoring and Troubleshooting (MnT) role](#id_94618 "You can manually modify MnT roles from the primary PAN.").

At least one node in your distributed setup should assume the Monitoring persona. We recommend that you do not have the Monitoring
and Policy Service personas enabled on the same Cisco ISE node, and that the node be dedicated solely to monitoring, for optimum
performance.

You can access the Monitoring
menu from the PAN
in your deployment.

| **Note** | ---   If you have enabled pxGrid, you must create a new certificate for the pxGrid node. Create the certificate template with digital signature usage and generate a new PxGrid certificate.   --- |
| --- | --- |

* [Manually Modify the MnT Role](#id_94618)
* [Syslog over Cisco ISE Messaging Service](#id_100229)
* [Automatic Failover in MnT Nodes](#ID95)

### Manually Modify the MnT Role

You can manually modify MnT roles (both from primary to secondary and from secondary to primary) from the primary PAN.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Log in to the primary PAN GUI. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon () and choose Administration  >  System  >  Deployment. |
| **Step 3** | From the list of nodes, check the check box next to the MnT node for which you want to change the role. |
| **Step 4** | Click Edit. |
| **Step 5** | In the Monitoring section, change the role to Primary or Secondary.  You can enable the Dedicated MnT option if you want to disable all the other personas and services enabled on that node. When this option is enabled, the configuration data replication process is stopped on that node. This helps to improve the performance of the MnT node. When you disable this option, manual synchronization is triggered. |
| **Step 6** | Click Save. |

### Syslog over Cisco ISE Messaging Service

Cisco ISE, Release 2.6, offers MnT WAN survivability for the default, built-in UDP syslog collection targets, LogCollector
and LogCollector2. This survivability can be enabled by the option Use "ISE Messaging Service" for UDP Syslogs delivery to MnT (In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon (![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/440001-450000/440001-441000/440197.jpg)) and choose
System > Logging > Log Settings). After you enable this option, the UDP syslogs are protected by Transport Layer Security (TLS).

The Use "ISE Messaging Service" for UDP Syslogs delivery to MnT option is disabled by default in Cisco ISE, Release 2.6, First Customer Ship (FCS). This option is enabled by default in
Cisco ISE, Release 2.6, Cumulative Patch 2 and later releases.

Using the Cisco ISE messaging service for UDP syslogs retains the operational data for a finite duration even when the MnT
node is unreachable. The MnT WAN survivability period is approximately 2 hours and 30 mins.

This service uses TCP port 8671. Please configure your network accordingly and allow the connections to TCP port 8671 on each
Cisco ISE node from all other Cisco ISE nodes in the deployment.

| **Note** | ---   If your deployment uses TCP or secure syslogs for Cisco ISE deployment, the functionality remains same as the earlier releases.  We recommend defining the UDP syslog target using the IP address. This avoids the latencies encountered while defining UDP syslog targets using the DNS name or DNS server.   --- |
| --- | --- |

**Queue Link Alarm**

The Cisco ISE messaging service uses a different certificate, signed by the internal CA chain. You will get a `queue-link alarm` message in the Alarms dashlet in the Cisco ISE GUI dashboard. Ensure that the following are in place to resolve the alarm:

* All the nodes are connected and synced.
* All the nodes and Cisco ISE messaging services are functional.
* The Cisco ISE messaging services ports are not blocked by external entities such as firewalls.
* The Cisco ISE messaging certificate chain on each node is not broken, and the state of the certificate is good.

To resolve the queue link alarm, regenerate the Cisco ISE root CA chain:

1. In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon (![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/440001-450000/440001-441000/440197.jpg)) and choose
   Administration > System > Certificates > Certificate Management > Certificate Signing Requests.
2. Click  Generate Certificate Signing Request (CSR) and then select the  ISE Root CA in the Certificate(s) will be used for drop-down list.
3. Click Replace ISE root CA Certificate Chain.

A Queue Link Error alarm is generated in the following scenarios:

* Timeout: A Queue Link Error alarm with the cause as Timeout occurs when there is a network issue between two nodes in the Cisco ISE deployment. Check the connectivity on port 8671 to
  troubleshoot this error.
* Unknown CA: A Queue Link Error alarm with the cause as Unknown CA occurs when when there is a broken Cisco ISE Messaging Certificate present in the System Certificates window (To view this window, click the Menu icon (![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/440001-450000/440001-441000/440197.jpg)) and choose
  Administration > System > Certificates > System Certificates.) This issue can be resolved by regenerating the Cisco ISE Messaging Certificate by choosing Administration > System > Certificates > Certificate Management > Certificate Signing Requests and then clicking on Generate Certificate Signing Request (CSR) on the Cisco ISE GUI.

  | **Note** | ---   Regeneration is not required if you have already replaced the Cisco ISE root CA certificate chain.   --- |
  | --- | --- |

When you replace the Cisco ISE Root CA chain, the Cisco ISE Messaging Service certificate is also replaced. This is followed
by the restart of the Cisco ISE Messaging service with a downtime of about two minutes. The syslogs are lost during this downtime.
To avoid losing the syslogs during the downtime, the Cisco ISE Messaging Service can be disabled for a short period.

To enable or disable the Cisco ISE messaging service for UDP syslogs delivery to MnT, perform this procedure:

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon () and choose System > Logging > Log Settings. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Check or uncheck the Use “ISE Messaging Service” for UDP Syslogs delivery to MnT check box to enable or disable the use of the Cisco ISE Messaging Service. |
| **Step 3** | Click Save. |

---

| **[Cisco ISE Community Resource](https://communities.cisco.com/community/technology/security/pa/ise)**  For more information about the Queue Link alarm, see [Queue Link Error](https://community.cisco.com/t5/security-knowledge-base/ise-queue-link-error/ta-p/4625179). |
| --- |

### Automatic Failover in MnT Nodes

MnT nodes do not offer high availablity, but do offer active standby. The PSN copies operational audit data to both the primary
and secondary MnT nodes.

#### Automatic Failover Process

When a primary MnT node goes down, the secondary MnT node takes over all the monitoring and troubleshooting information.

To manually convert the secondary node to a primary node, see  [promote the secondary node to a primary role](#id_94618 "You can manually modify MnT roles from the primary PAN."). If the primary node comes up again after the secondary node is promoted, the primary node takes on the secondary role. If
the secondary node is not promoted, the primary MnT node resumes the primary role after it comes up again.

| **Caution** | ---   When the primary node comes back up after a failover, back up of the secondary and restore the data to update the primary node.   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Guidelines for Setting Up an Active Standby Pair of MnT Nodes

You can specify two MnT nodes on a Cisco ISE network, and configure them to be an active standby pair. We recommend that you
back up the primary MnT node, and restore the data to the new secondary MnT node. This ensures that the history of the primary
MnT node is synchronized with the new secondary node because the primary replicates new data. The following rules apply to
an active standby pair:

* All changes are logged to the primary MnT node. The secondary node is read-only.
* Changes made to the primary node are automatically replicated on the secondary node
* Both the primary and secondary nodes are listed as log collectors, to which all other nodes send logs.
* The Cisco ISE dashboard is the main entry point for monitoring and troubleshooting. Monitoring information is displayed on
  the dashboard from the PAN
  . If the primary node goes down, monitoring information is available on the secondary node.
* Backing up and purging MnT data is not a part of a standard Cisco ISE node backup process. You must configure repositories
  for backup and data purging on both the primary and secondary MnT nodes, and use the same repositories for each.

#### MnT Node Failover Scenarios

The following scenarios apply to the active-standby or single-node configurations corresponding to the MnT nodes:

* In an active-standby configuration of the MnT nodes, the primary PAN always points to the primary MnT node to collect the
  monitoring data. After the primary MnT node fails, the PAN points to the standby MnT node. The failover from the primary node
  to the secondary node takes place after it is down for more than five minutes.

  However, after the primary node fails, the secondary node does not become the primary node. If the primary node comes up,
  the PAN starts collecting the monitoring data again from the resumed primary node.
* If the primary MnT node is down, and you want to promote the standby MnT node to active status, you can do so by following
  the procedure provided in [manually modifying MnT role](#id_94618 "You can manually modify MnT roles from the primary PAN.") or by deregistering the existing primary MnT node. When you deregister the existing primary MnT node, the standby node becomes
  the primary MnT node, and the PAN automatically points to the newly promoted primary node.
* In an active-standby pair, if you deregister the secondary MnT node, or if the secondary MnT node goes down, the existing
  primary MnT node remains the current primary node.
* If there is only one MnT node in the Cisco ISE deployment, then that node acts as the primary MnT node, and provides monitoring
  data to the PAN. However, when you register a new MnT node, and make it the primary node in the deployment, the existing primary
  MnT node automatically becomes the standby node. The PAN points to the newly registered primary MnT node to collect monitoring
  data.

## Monitoring Database

The rate and amount of data that is utilized by the monitoring functions requires a separate database on a dedicated node
that is used for these purposes.

Like PSN, the MnT node has a dedicated database that requires you to perform maintenance tasks, as described in the topics
covered in this section.

* [Back Up and Restore the Monitoring Database](#ID1268)
* [Monitoring Database Purge](#ID1290)
* [Guidelines for Purging the Monitoring Database](#ID1301)
* [Operational Data Purging](#id_39776)
* [Purge Older Operational Data](#id_39640)

### Back Up and Restore the Monitoring Database

The Monitoring database handles large volumes of data. Over time, the performance and efficiency of the MnT node depends on
how well you manage that data. To increase efficiency, we recommend that you back up the data and transfer it to a remote
repository on a regular basis. You can automate this task by scheduling automatic backups.

| **Note** | ---   You should not perform a backup when a purge operation is in progress. If you start a backup during a purge operation, the purge operation stops or fails.   --- |
| --- | --- |

If you register a secondary MnT node, we recommend that you first back up the primary MnT node and then restore the data to
the new secondary MnT node. This ensures that the history of the primary MnT node is in sync with the new secondary node when
the new changes are replicated.

### Monitoring Database Purge

The purging process allows you to manage the size of the Monitoring database by specifying the number of months to retain the data during a purge. The default is three months. This value is
utilized when the disk space usage threshold for purging (80 percentage of the total disk space) is met. For this option,
each month consists of 30 days. A default of three months equals 90 days.

### Guidelines for Purging the Monitoring Database

Follow these guidelines for optimal Monitoring database disk usage:

* If the Monitoring  database disk usage is greater than 80 percent of the threshold setting, that is 60 percent of total disk space, a critical
  alarm is generated, indicating that the database size is about to exceed the maximum amount of allocated disk size. If the
  disk usage is greater than 90 percent of the threshold setting, that is 70 percent of total disk space, another alarm is generated,
  indicating that the database size has exceeded the maximum amount of allocated disk size.

  A purge process runs, creating a status history report that you can view in the Data Purging Audit window. To view this window, click the Menu icon (![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/440001-450000/440001-441000/440197.jpg)) and choose
  Operations > Reports > Reports > Audit > Data Purging Audit. An information (INFO) alarm is generated after the purge is completed.
* Purging is also based on the percentage of consumed disk space for the database. When the consumed disk space for the Monitoring  database is equal to or exceeds the threshold (the default is 80 percentage of the total disk space), the purge process starts.
  This process deletes only the oldest seven days' monitoring data, irrespective of what is configured in the Admin portal.
  It continues this process in a loop until the disk space is below 80 percent. Purging always checks the Monitoring database disk space limit before proceeding.

### Operational Data Purging

Cisco ISE Monitoring Operational database contains information that is generated as Cisco ISE reports. Recent Cisco ISE (Cisco
ISE Release 2.4 and above) releases have options to purge the monitoring operational data and reset the monitoring database
when the application configure ise command is run.

The purge option is used to clean up the data and prompts you to enter the number of days for which to retain the data. The
reset option is used to reset the database to the factory default, so that all the data that is backed up is permanently deleted.
Specify the database if the files are consuming too much file system space.

| **Note** | ---   The reset option causes Cisco ISE services to be temporarily unavailable.   --- |
| --- | --- |

The Operational Data Purging window contains the Database Utilization and Purge Data Now areas. To view this window, click the Menu icon (![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/440001-450000/440001-441000/440197.jpg)) and choose
Administration > System > Maintenance > Operational Data Purging. You can view the total available database space and the RADIUS and TACACS data stored in the Database Utilization area. Hover the mouse over the status bar to display the available disk space and the number of days the existing data is
stored for in the database. Specify the period for which the RADIUS and TACACS data is supposed to be retained in the **Data Retention Period** area. Data is purged at 4 a.m. every day, and you can configure the export of data to a repository before it is purged, by specifying
the number of retention days. Check the Enable Export Repository check box to select and create a repository, and specify an Encryption Key.

 In the Purge Data Now area, you can purge all the RADIUS and TACACS data or specify the number of days beyond which data is supposed to be purged.

| **Note** | ---   You must export RADIUS authentication and accounting, TACACS authorization and accounting, RADIUS errors, and misconfigured supplicants tables to a repository before purging.   --- |

### Purge Older Operational Data

The operational data is collected in the server over a period of time. It can be purged either instantly or periodically.
You can verify the success of the data purge by viewing the Data Purging Audit report.

#### Before you begin

To perform the following task, you must be a Super Admin or System Admin.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon () and choose Administration > System > Maintenance > Operational Data Purging. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Do one of the following:   * In the Data Retention Period area:   1. Specify the time period, in days, for which RADIUS and TACACS data should be retained. All the data prior to the specified      time period is exported to a repository.   2. In the Repository area, check the Enable Export Repository check box to choose the repository to save data.   3. In the Encryption Key field, enter the required password.   4. Click Save.             | **Note** | If the configured retention period is less than the existing retention thresholds corresponding to the diagnostics data, the configured value overrides the existing threshold values. For example, if you configure the retention period as three day,s and this value is less than the existing thresholds in the diagnostics tables (for example, a default of five days), the data is purged according to the value that you configure (three days) in this window. |      | --- | --- | * In the Purge Data Now area:   1. Choose to purge all the data or to purge the data that is older than the specified number of days. Data is not saved in any      repository.   2. Click Purge. |

## Configure MnT Nodes for Automatic Failover

If you have two MnT nodes in a deployment, you can configure a primary-secondary pair for automatic failover to avoid downtime
in the Cisco ISE Monitoring service. A primary-secondary pair ensures that a secondary MnT node automatically provides monitoring
if the primary node fails.

### Before you begin

* Before you configure MnT nodes for automatic failover, they must be registered as Cisco ISE nodes.
* Configure monitoring roles and services on both the nodes and name them for their primary and secondary roles, as appropriate.
* Configure repositories for backup and data purging on both the primary and secondary MnT nodes. For the backup and purging
  features to work properly, use the same repositories for both the nodes. Purging takes place on both the primary and secondary
  nodes of a redundant pair. For example, if the primary MnT node uses two repositories for backup and purging, you must specify
  the same repositories for the secondary node.

  Configure a data repository for a MnT node using the repository  command in the system CLI.

| **Note** | ---   For scheduled backup and purge to work properly on the nodes of a monitoring redundant pair, configure the same repository, or repositories, on both the primary and secondary nodes using the CLI. The repositories are not automatically synced between the two nodes.   --- |
| --- | --- |

From the Cisco ISE dashboard, verify that the MnT nodes are ready. The System Summary dashlet shows the MnT nodes with a green check mark to the left when their services are ready.

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon () and choose Administration  >  System  >  Deployment. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | In the Deployment Nodes window, check the check box next to the MnT node that you want to specify as primary, and click Edit . |
| **Step 3** | Click the General Settings tab and choose Primary from the Role drop-down list.  When you choose an MnT node as primary, the other MnT node automatically becomes secondary. In the case of a standalone deployment, primary and secondary role configuration is disabled. |
| **Step 4** | Click Save . Both the primary and secondary nodes restart. |

## Cisco pxGrid Node

You can use Cisco pxGrid to share the context-sensitive information from Cisco ISE session directory with other network systems
such as Cisco ISE ecosystem, partner systems, and other Cisco platforms. The pxGrid framework can also be used to exchange
policy and configuration data between nodes, such as sharing tags and policy objects between Cisco ISE and third-party vendors,
and for other information exchanges. Cisco pxGrid also allows third-party systems to invoke adaptive network control actions (ANC) to quarantine users or devices or both in response to a network or security event. Cisco TrustSec information, such as tag
definition, value, and description can be passed from Cisco ISE through the Cisco TrustSec topic to other networks. The endpoint
profiles with Fully Qualified Names (FQNs) can be passed from Cisco ISE to other networks through an endpoint profile meta
topic. Cisco pxGrid also supports bulk download of tags and endpoint profiles.

You can publish and subscribe to SXP bindings (IP-SGT mappings) through Cisco pxGrid. For more information about SXP bindings,
see [e](b_ISE_admin_33_segmentation.html#concept_6D1DCD2EA57A42A89BF8791E8C36BB7C "This topic explains the Security Group Tag Exchange Protocol in Cisco ISE.")
.

The following logs are available for the Cisco pxGrid node:

* pxgrid.log: Provides state change notifications.
* pxgrid-cm.log: Displays updates on publisher or subscriber or both and data exchange activity between the client and the server.
* pxgrid-controller.log: Displays the details of client capabilities, groups, and client authorization.
* pxgrid-jabberd.log: Displays all the logs related to system state and authentication.
* pxgrid-pubsub.log: Displays all the information related to publisher and subscriber events.

| **Note** | ---  * You can enable Cisco pxGrid and Cisco pxGrid persona with the Cisco ISE Advantage license. * Cisco pxGrid should be defined in order to work with the Passive ID Work Center. For more information,   see [PassiveID Work Center](b_ISE_admin_33_asset_visibility.html#concept_qfh_cvl_tw "Overview of PassiveID Work Center")  --- |
| --- | --- |

### High Availability for pxGrid 2.0

pxGrid 2.0 nodes operate in an Active/Active configuration. For high availability, there should be at least two pxGrid nodes
in the deployment. Large deployments can have up to four nodes for increased scale and redundancy. We recommend that you configure
IP addresses for all the nodes, so that if one node goes down, that node's clients connect to the working node. When the PAN
goes down, the pxGrid server stops handling the activations. Manually promote the PAN to activate the pxGrid server. For more
information about pxGrid deployments, see [**Performance and Scalability Guide for Cisco Identity Services Engine**](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/ise/performance_and_scalability/b_ise_perf_and_scale.html)

All the pxGrid service provider clients periodically reregister themselves with the pxGrid controller within a span of 7.5
minutes. If the client does not reregister, the PAN node assumes that the client is inactive and deletes the client. If the
PAN node goes down for more than 7.5 minutes, when it comes back up, it deletes all the clients with timestamp values older
than 7.5 minutes. All those clients must then register again with the pxGrid controller.

pxGrid 2.0 clients use WebSocket and REST-based APIs for pub/sub and query. These APIs are served by the ISE application server
on port 8910. The pxGrid processes shown by `show logging application pxgrid` don’t apply to pxGrid 2.0.

| **Note** | ---   All the references to pxGrid 1.0 processes in the GUI and the CLI have been removed.   --- |

### Deploy Cisco pxGrid Node

 You can enable Cisco pxGrid
persona both on a standalone node and distributed deployment node.

#### Before you begin

* You must have a Cisco ISE Advantage license to enable the Cisco pxGrid persona. For licensing requirements, see [ISE Licensing / Ordering](http://cs.co/ise-licensing).
* All nodes use the CA certificate for Cisco pxGrid service usage. If you used the default certificate for Cisco pxGrid service
  before the upgrade, the upgrade replaces that certificate with the internal CA certificate.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon () and choose Administration > System > Deployment. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | In the Deployment Nodes window, check the check box next to the node for which you want to enable the Cisco pxGrid services, and click Edit. |
| **Step 3** | Click the General Settings tab and enable the pxGrid toggle button. |
| **Step 4** | Click Save.   | **Note** | When you upgrade from the previous version, the Save option might be disabled. This happens when the browser cache refers to the old files from the previous version of Cisco ISE. Clear the browser cache to enable the Save option. | | --- | --- | |

---

### Configure Cisco pxGrid Settings

#### Before you begin

To perform the
following task, you must be a Super Admin or System Admin.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon () and choose Administration > pxGrid Services > Settings. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Check one of the following check boxes based on your requirements:   * Automatically approve new certificate-based   accounts: Check this check box to automatically   approve the connection requests from new Cisco pxGrid clients. * Allow password-based account creation: Check   this check box to enable username or password-based authentication   for Cisco pxGrid clients. When this option is enabled, Cisco pxGrid   clients cannot be automatically approved. |
| **Step 3** | Click **Save**.  Use the Test option in the Cisco pxGrid Settings window to run a health check on the Cisco pxGrid node. View the details in the pxgrid or pxgrid-test.log file.  Use the PxGrid Client Auto Approval API to:   * Enable automatic approval of certificate-based connection requests from new pxGrid clients. Enable this option only when you   trust all the clients in your environment. * Enable username or password-based authentication for the pxGrid clients. When this option is enabled, pxGrid clients cannot   be automatically approved. A pxGrid client can register itself with the pxGrid controller by sending the username through   a REST API. The pxGrid controller generates a password for the pxGrid client during client registration. An administrator   can approve or deny the connection request.   For more information about the PxGrid Client Auto Approval API, see the “pxGrid Settings” section in the ERS SDK. You can access the ERS SDK at the following URL:  https://<*ISE-Admin-Node*>:9060/ers/sdk  Only users with ERS Admin role can access the ERS SDK. |

---

### Generate Cisco pxGrid Certificate

#### Before you begin

* You must not use the same certificate for Cisco ISE pxGrid server and pxGrid clients. You must use client certificates for
  the pxGrid clients. To generate client certificates, choose **Administration > System > Certificates**.
* Some versions of Cisco ISE have a certificate for Cisco pxGrid that uses NetscapeCertType. We recommend that you generate
  a new certificate.
* To perform the following task, you must be a Super Admin or System Admin.
* A Cisco pxGrid certificate must be generated from the primary PAN.
* If the Cisco pxGrid certificate uses the subject alternative name (SAN) extension, be sure to include the FQDN of the subject
  identity as a DNS name entry.
* Create a certificate template with digital signature usage and use that to generate a new Cisco pxGrid certificate.

  | **Note** | ---   If FIPS mode is enabled, the pxGrid certificate template’s RSA private key size must be 2048 bits or greater. Else an error is displayed when you try to generate a pxGrid certificate. To change the private key size of the certificate template, see [Change pxGrid Certificate Template Key Size](b_ISE_admin_33_pxgrid.html#Cisco_Task.dita_f2910803-7308-4763-a726-da4d70eabdc8 "This task helps you to change the key size of the pxGrid certificate template.").   --- |
  | --- | --- |

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon () and choose Administration > pxGrid Services > Client Management > Certificates. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | From the I want to drop-down list, choose one of the following options:   * Generate a single certificate (without a certificate signing request): You must enter the Common Name (CN) if you select this option. * Generate a single certificate (with a certificate signing request): You must enter the Certificate Signing Request details if you select this option. |
| **Step 3** | (Optional) Enter a description for this certificate. |
| **Step 4** | Click the pxGrid\_Certificate\_Template link to download and edit the certificate template based on your requirements. |
| **Step 5** | Enter the Subject Alternative Name (SAN). You can add multiple SANs. The following options are available:   * IP address: Enter the IP address of the Cisco pxGrid client to be associated with the certificate. * FQDN: Enter the FQDN of the pxGrid client. |
| **Step 6** | From the Certificate Download Format drop-down list, choose one of the following options:   * Certificate in Private Enhanced Electronic Mail (PEM) format, key in PKCS8 PEM format (including certificate chain): The root certificate, the intermediate CA certificates, and the end entity certificate are represented in the PEM format.   PEM-formatted certificates are BASE64-encoded ASCII files. Each certificate starts with the `"--------BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----"` tag and ends with the `"-------END CERTIFICATE----"` tag. The end entity’s private key is stored using PKCS\* PEM. It starts with the `"-----BEGIN ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY----"` tag and ends with the `"-----END ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY----"` tag. * PKCS12 format (including certificate chain; one file for both the certificate chain and key): A binary format to store the root CA certificate, the intermediate CA certificate, and the end entity's certificate and   private key in one encrypted file. |
| **Step 7** | Enter the password for the certificate. |
| **Step 8** | Click Create.  You can view the certificate that you created in the Issued Certificates window. To view this window, click the Menu icon () and choose Administration > System > Certificates > Certificate Authority > Issued Certificates.   | **Note** | From Cisco ISE 2.4 patch 13 onwards, the certificate requirements have become stricter for the pxGrid service. If you are using the Cisco ISE default self-signed certificate as the pxGrid certificate, Cisco ISE might reject that certificate after applying Cisco ISE 2.4 patch 13 or later. This is because the earlier versions of that certificate have the Netscape Cert Type extension specified as SSL Server, which now fails (a client certificate is also required now). | | --- | --- |   Any client with a noncompliant certificate fails to integrate with Cisco ISE. Use a certificate issued by the internal CA, or generate a new certificate with proper usage extensions:   * The Key Usage extension in the certificate must contain the Digital Signature and Key Encipherment fields. * The Extended Key Usage extension in the certificate must contain the Client Authentication and Server Authentication fields. * The Netscape Certificate Type extension is not required. If you want to include that extension, add both SSL Client and SSL Server in the extension. * If you are using a self-signed certificate, the Basic Constraints CA field must be set to **True**, and the Key Usage extension must contain the Key Cert Sign field. |

### Control Permissions for Cisco pxGrid Clients

You can create Cisco pxGrid authorization rules for controlling the permissions for the Cisco pxGrid clients. Use these rules
to control the services that are provided to the Cisco pxGrid clients.

You can create different types of groups and map the services provided to the Cisco pxGrid clients to these groups. Use the
Groups option in the Client Management window to add new groups. You can view the example authorization rules in the Client Management > Policies window. Note that you can update only the **Custom Operations** field for the predefined rules.

To create an
authorization rule for pxGrid clients:

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon () and choose Administration > pxGrid Services > Client Management > Policy. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | From the Service drop-down list, choose one of the following options:   * **com.cisco.ise.pubsub** * **com.cisco.ise.config.anc** * **com.cisco.ise.config.profiler** * **com.cisco.ise.config.trustsec** * **com.cisco.ise.service** * **com.cisco.ise.system** * **com.cisco.ise.radius** * **com.cisco.ise.sxp** * **com.cisco.ise.trustsec** * **com.cisco.ise.mdm** |
| **Step 3** | From the Operation drop-down list, choose one of the following options:   * **<ANY>** * **publish** * **publish /topic/com.cisco.ise.session** * **publish /topic/com.cisco.ise.session.group** * **publish /topic/com.cisco.ise.anc** * **<CUSTOM>**: You can specify a custom operation if you   select this option.   See [pxGrid Operations and Services Use Cases](#reference_rsm_h5k_2bc "This topic explains the pxGrid operations and services sse cases.") for more information.   | **Note** | The following additional attributes are published to the /topic/com.cisco.ise.session for REST ID store for Cisco ISE 3.0 patch 5 and later releases:   * identityProvider:Azure * oid * tenantID * preferredUsername | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 4** | From the Groups drop-down list, choose the groups that you want to map to this service.  ANC and manually added groups are listed in this drop-down list.   | **Note** | Only the clients that belong to the groups included in the policy can subscribe to the service specified in that policy. For example, if you define a pxGrid policy for com.cisco.ise.pubsub service and assign the ANC group to this policy, only the clients that belong to the ANC group can subscribe to the com.cisco.ise.pubsub service. | | --- | --- | |

---

### pxGrid Operations and Services Use Cases

When creating a new pxGrid policy, note that some pxGrid operations are only applicable to specific services.

You can find the following pxGrid operations in the Cisco ISE GUI.

#### Operation <ANY>

When you use the <ANY> operation with a service and a particular user group, any operation related to that service is only
accessible to the users in the chosen user group.

Consider the following example.

Service: com.cisco.ise.session; Operation: <ANY>; Groups: SessionUsers.

In this example, only pxGrid clients that are part of the ‘SessionUsers’ group will be able to perform any operation related
to session topic (like subscribe/gets operations).

#### Operation publish

All the publish related operations are applicable only when com.cisco.ise.pubsub is chosen as the service. You can use the
publish operation to create a pxGrid policy specifying that only a pxGrid client of a particular user group can publish a
chosen topic or can publish all topics.

#### Operation <Custom>

You can use the <Custom> operation to specify an operation that is not provided in the Operation drop-down list. Currently,
pxGrid supports the following operations but not all of them are listed in the Operation drop-down list:

1. 'sets' (applicable on all services and topics except pubsub) – You can use this to restrict access to REST API calls that
   perform a set operation.
2. 'gets' (applicable on all services and topics except pubsub) – You can use this to restrict access to REST API calls that
   perform a get operation.
3. 'publish' followed by a particular topic name (only applicable on pubsub service) – You can use this to restrict access to
   users who can publish a particular topic.

   For example, Service: com.cisco.ise.pubsub, Operation: publish/topic/com.cisco.ise.session.

   However, some rules with the same operation, service, and topic are incomprehensible and must be avoided. For example, Service:
   com.cisco.ise.session, Operation: publish /topic/com.cisco.ise.session.
4. subscribe' followed by topic name (only applicable on pubsub service) – You can use this to restrict access to users who can
   subscribe to a particular topic.

   For example, Service: com.cisco.ise.pubsub, Operation: publish /topic/com.cisco.ise.session

## View Nodes in a Deployment

In the Deployment Nodes window, you can view all the Cisco ISE nodes, primary and secondary, that are a part of your deployment.

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Log in to the primary Cisco ISE Admin portal. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon () and choose Administration  >  System  >  Deployment. |
| **Step 3** | Click Deployment in the navigation pane on the left.  All the Cisco ISE nodes that are a part of your deployment are listed. |

## Download Endpoint Statistical Data from MnT Nodes

You can download statistical data about the endpoints that connect to your network from the MnT nodes. Key Performance Metrics
(KPM), which include the load, CPU usage, and authentication traffic data are available. You can use this data to monitor
and troubleshoot issues in your network. From the Cisco ISE CLI, run the application configure ise  command and choose Option 12 or Option 13 to download the daily KPM statistics or the KPM statistics for the last eight weeks.

The output of this command provides the following data about
endpoints:

* Total endpoints in your network
* Number of endpoints that established a successful connection
* Number of endpoints that failed authentication
* Total number of new endpoints that have connected each day
* Total number of endpoints onboarded each day

The output also includes time stamp details, the total number of endpoints that connected through each of the Policy Service
nodes (PSNs) in the deployment, total number of endpoints, active endpoints, load, and authentication traffic details.

See the *[Cisco Identity Services Engine CLI Reference Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/ise/3-2/cli_guide/b_ise_CLI_Reference_Guide_32.html)* for more information on this command.

## Database Crash or File Corruption Issues

Cisco ISE may crash if the Oracle database files are corrupted because of a power outage or other reasons, resulting in data
loss. Based on the incident, follow these instructions to recover from data loss:

* In case of PAN corruption in the deployment, you should promote the Secondary PAN to Primary PAN. If the secondary PAN's promotion
  is not possible because the deployment is small or any other reason, restore the most recent available backup as described
  in *[Cisco Identity Services Engine CLI Reference Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/ise/1-0/cli_ref_guide/ise10_cli/ise10_cli_app_a.html#pgfId-1718131)*.
* In case of PSN corruption, follow the steps to deregister, reset config, and register, as described in the *[Cisco Identity Services Engine CLI Reference Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/ise/1-0/cli_ref_guide/ise10_cli/ise10_cli_app_a.html#pgfId-1718131)*.
* In case of a standalone device, restore the most recent backup that is available, as described in the *[Cisco Identity Services Engine CLI Reference Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/ise/1-0/cli_ref_guide/ise10_cli/ise10_cli_app_a.html#pgfId-1718131)*.

  | **Note** | ---   Obtain the backup from the standalone device regularly to avoid loss in the latest configuration changes.   --- |
  | --- | --- |

## Device Configuration for Monitoring

The MnT node receives and uses data from the devices on a network to populate the dashboard display. To enable communication
between the MnT node and the network devices, the switches and NADs must be configured properly.

## Synchronize Primary and Secondary Cisco ISE Nodes

You can make configuration changes to Cisco ISE only through the primary PAN. The configuration changes get replicated to all the secondary nodes. If, for some reason, this
replication does not occur properly, you can manually synchronize the secondary PAN with the primary PAN.

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Log in to the primary PAN. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon () and choose Administration  >  System  >  Deployment. |
| **Step 3** | Check the check box next to the node that you want to synchronize with the primary PAN, and click Syncup to force a full database replication. |

---

## Change Node Personas and Services

| **Note** | ---   When you enable or disable any of the services that run on a PSN or make any changes to a PSN, you will be restarting the application server processes on which these services run. Expect a delay while these services restart. Because this delay in restarting services, automatic failover, if enabled in your deployment, might get initiated. To avoid this, make sure that the automatic failover configuration is turned off.   --- |
| --- | --- |

You can edit the Cisco ISE
node configuration to change the personas and services that run on the node.

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Log in to the primary PAN. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon () and choose Administration  >  System  >  Deployment. |
| **Step 3** | Check the check box next to the node whose personas or services you want to change, and then click Edit. |
| **Step 4** | Choose the personas and services that you want to modify. |
| **Step 5** | Click Save. |
| **Step 6** | Verify the receipt of an alarm on your primary PAN to confirm the persona or service change. If the persona or service change is not saved successfully, an alarm is not generated. |

---

## Effects of Modifying Nodes in Cisco ISE

When you make any of the following changes to a node in a Cisco ISE, that node restarts, which causes a delay:

* Register a node (Standalone to Secondary)
* Deregister a node (Secondary to Standalone)
* Change a primary node to Standalone (if no other nodes are registered with it; Primary to Standalone)
* Promote an Administration node (Secondary to Primary)
* Change the personas (when you assign or remove the Policy Service or Monitoring persona from a node)
* Modify the services in the Policy Service node (enable or disable the session and profiler services)
* Restore a backup on the primary and a sync up operation is triggered to replicate data from primary to secondary nodes

| **Note** | ---   When you promote the secondary Administration node to the primary PAN position, the primary node will assume a secondary role. This causes both the primary and secondary nodes to restart, causing a delay.   --- |
| --- | --- |

## Create a Policy Service Node Group

When two or more Policy Service nodes (PSNs) are connected to the same high-speed Local Area Network (LAN), we recommend that
you place them in the same node group. This design optimizes the replication of endpoint profiling data by retaining less
significant attributes that are local to the group and reducing the information that is replicated to the remote nodes in
the network. Node group members also check on the availability of peer group members. If the group detects that a member has
failed, it attempts to reset and recover all URL-redirected sessions on the failed node.

The node groups are used for the PSN failover in the sessions on which URL redirect (posture services, guest services, and
MDM) is imposed.

| **Note** | ---   We recommend that you put all the PSNs in the same local network and as a part of the same node group. PSNs need not be a part of a load-balanced cluster to join the same node group. However, each local PSN in a load-balanced cluster should typically be part of the same node group.   --- |
| --- | --- |

Node group members can communicate over TCP/7800.

Before you add PSNs as members to a node group, you must create the node group. You can create, edit, and delete PSN groups
from the Deployment window of the Admin portal.

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon () and choose Administration  >  System  >  Deployment. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click the Settings icon at the top of the left navigation pane. |
| **Step 3** | Click Create Node Group. |
| **Step 4** | Enter a unique name for your node group.   | **Note** | We recommend that you do not configure a node group with the name None, because it may cause issues during node registration. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 5** | (Optional) Enter a description for your node group. |
| **Step 6** | (Optional) Check the Enable MAR Cache Distribution check box and fill in the other options. Ensure that the MAR is enabled in the Active Directory window before checking this check box. |
| **Step 7** | Click Submit to save the node group.  After you save the node group, it should appear in the left navigation pane. If you do not see the node group in the left pane, it may be hidden. Click the Expand button on the navigation pane to view the hidden objects.  Add a node to a node group, or edit a node by choosing the corresponding node group from the Include node in node group drop-down list in the Policy Service area. |

---

## Remove a Node from Deployment

To remove a node from a deployment, you must deregister it. The deregistered node becomes a standalone Cisco ISE node.

It retains the last configuration that it received from the primary PAN and assumes the default personas of a standalone node,
that is, Administration, Policy Service, or Monitoring. If you deregister an MnT node, this node will no longer be a syslog
target.

When a Primary PSN is deregistered, the endpoint data is lost. If you want the PSN to retain the endpoint data after it becomes
a standalone node, do one of the following:

* Obtain a backup from the primary PAN, and when the PSN becomes a standalone node, restore this data backup on it.
* Change the persona of the PSN to Administration (secondary PAN), synchronize the data in the Deployment window of the Admin portal, and then deregister the node. This node will now have all the data. You can then add a secondary
  PAN to the existing deployment.

You can view these changes in the Deployment window of the primary PAN. However, expect a delay of five minutes for the changes to take effect and appear in the Deployment window.

### Before you begin

Before you remove a secondary node from a deployment, perform a backup of Cisco ISE configuration, which you can then restore later, if needed.

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon () and choose Administration  >  System  >  Deployment. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Check the check box next to the secondary node that you want to remove, and click Deregister. |
| **Step 3** | Click OK. |
| **Step 4** | Verify the receipt of an alarm on your primary PAN to confirm that the secondary node is deregistered successfully. If the secondary node fails to deregister from the primary PAN, it means the alarm is not generated. |

---

## Shut Down a Cisco ISE Node

Before you run the **halt** command from the Cisco ISE CLI, we recommend that you stop the Cisco ISE application service and ensure that it is not performing
a backup, restore, installation, upgrade, or remove operation. If you run the **halt** command while the Cisco ISE is performing any of these operations, you will get one of the following warning messages:

`WARNING: A backup or restore is currently in progress! Continue with halt?`

`WARNING: An install/upgrade/remove is currently in progress! Continue with halt?`

If no processes are running when you use the **halt** command, or if you enter `Yes` in response to the warning message displayed, then you must respond to the following question:

`Do you want to save the current configuration?`

If you enter `Yes` to save the existing Cisco ISE configuration, the following message is displayed:

`Saved the running configuration to startup successfully.`

| **Note** | ---   We recommend that you stop the application process before rebooting the appliance.   --- |
| --- | --- |

We also recommend that you stop the application process before rebooting Cisco ISE. For more information, see the *[Cisco Identity Services Engine CLI Reference Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/security/identity-services-engine/products-command-reference-list.html).*

## Scenarios In Which Need to Reregister a Node

The following table summarizes some of the scenarios where you need to reregister a
node when it is corrupted:

| Scenarios | What needs to be done |
| --- | --- |
| If any of the nodes other than the Primary PAN is corrupted | 1. Deregister the failed node from the deployment. 2. Reinstall Cisco ISE on the failed node. 3. Reregister the node in the existing deployment.  | **Note** | You must import the old certificates to the node before or after the registration. | | --- | --- | |
| If the Primary PAN is corrupted | If, for example, there are two nodes, N1 (Primary PAN) and N2 (Secondary PAN):   1. Promote secondary PAN (N2) to Primary PAN. 2. Remove the failed node (N1) from the deployment. 3. Reinstall Cisco ISE on the failed node (N1). 4. Register the node (N1) as Secondary PAN to deployment. 5. Import the old certificates to the node (N1) after the    registration is completed. 6. Promote the node (N1) back to Primary PAN to have similar    deployment as earlier. |
| If both Primary PAN and Secondary PAN are corrupted | If, for example, there are two nodes, N1 (Primary PAN) and N2 (Secondary PAN):   1. Reinstall Cisco ISE on Primary PAN node (N1) and    Secondary PAN node (N2). 2. Restore configuration backup in Primary PAN node (N1). 3. Import old certificates in Primary PAN node (N1). 4. Register the other node (N2) as Secondary PAN in the deployment. 5. Perform reset-config on other nodes and register the nodes in the deployment. 6. Import certificates to all the nodes.  | **Note** | If the Primary PAN and Secondary PANs are VMs, reinstalling Cisco ISE might change the UDI. Hence, you must reinstall the licenses with the new UDIs. | | --- | --- | |

## Change the Hostname or IP Address of a Standalone Cisco ISE Node

You can change the hostname, IP address, or domain name of standalone Cisco ISE nodes. However, you cannot use **localhost** as the hostname for a node.

### Before you begin

If a Cisco ISE node is a part of a distributed deployment, you must first remove it from the deployment and ensure that it is a standalone node.

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Change the hostname or IP address of the Cisco ISE node using the hostname , ip address , or ip domain-name  command from the Cisco ISE CLI. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Reset the Cisco ISE application configuration using the application stop ise  command from the Cisco ISE CLI to restart all the services. |
| **Step 3** | Register the Cisco ISE node to the primary PAN if it is a part of a distributed deployment.   | **Note** | If you are using the hostname while registering the Cisco ISE node, the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the standalone node that you are going to register, for example, *abc.xyz.com*, must be DNS-resolvable from the primary PAN. Otherwise, node registration fails. You must enter the IP addresses and FQDNs of the Cisco ISE nodes that are a part of your distributed deployment in the DNS server. | | --- | --- |   After you register the Cisco ISE node as a secondary node, the primary PAN replicates the change in the IP address, hostname, or domain name to the other Cisco ISE nodes in your deployment. |

| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCisco Identity Services Engine RADIUS Denial of Service Vulnerability High   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-ise-radius-dos-W7cNn7gt  First Published: 2023 September 6 16:00 GMT  Version 1.0:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  No workarounds available  Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCwe47081](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwe47081)     CVE-2023-20243     CWE-399       CVSS Score: [Base 8.6](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=3.1&vector=CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X       CVE-2023-20243     CWE-399       [Download CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ise-radius-dos-W7cNn7gt/csaf/cisco-sa-ise-radius-dos-W7cNn7gt.json)   Email      Summary  * A vulnerability in the RADIUS message processing feature of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the affected system to stop processing RADIUS packets.  This vulnerability is due to improper handling of certain RADIUS accounting requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted authentication request to a network access device (NAD) that uses Cisco ISE for authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA). This would eventually result in the NAD sending a RADIUS accounting request packet to Cisco ISE. An attacker could also exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted RADIUS accounting request packet to Cisco ISE directly if the RADIUS shared secret is known. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the RADIUS process to unexpectedly restart, resulting in authentication or authorization timeouts and denying legitimate users access to the network or service. Clients already authenticated to the network would not be affected.  **Note:** To recover the ability to process RADIUS packets, a manual restart of the affected Policy Service Node (PSN) may be required. For more information, see the [Details](#details) section of this advisory.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link: <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ise-radius-dos-W7cNn7gt>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects Cisco ISE PSNs that are configured with RADIUS. If Cisco ISE is being used for TACACS only, the device is not affected.  **Note:** RADIUS is enabled by default and cannot be disabled. The default RADIUS policies may need to be configured to deny access to all users and devices if Cisco ISE is being used for TACACS only.  **Note:** For the exploit to be successful, attackers must have one of the following:    + Valid user credentials   + A NAD shared secret that can be used to connect to Cisco ISE   + Access to a NAD that connects to a Cisco ISE deployment and that is configured with MAC Authentication Bypass (MAB) so that the authentication policy succeeds even if a user is not found **Determine PSN Configuration**  To determine whether a node in the Cisco ISE deployment is a PSN, use the following steps:    1. Log in to the Cisco ISE web-based management interface.   2. Click the menuicon.   3. Choose **Administration** > **System** > **Deployment**.   4. Look at the **Personas** column in the table for the nodes in the deployment. If a node has **Policy Service** listed, the node is affected by this vulnerability. If **Policy Service** is not listed, the node is not affected by this vulnerability. **Determine the RADIUS Policy**  If a deployment is being used for TACACS only and the RADIUS policy is set to **DenyAccess**, the deployment is not affected by this vulnerability.  To determine whether a deployment has a **DenyAccess** RADIUS policy in effect, use the following steps:    1. Log in to the Cisco ISE web-based management interface.   2. Click the menuicon.   3. Choose **Policy** > **Policy Sets**. If RADIUS has never been deployed, only the **Default** policy should be listed. If more than one policy is listed, this deployment might be serving as a RADIUS server.   4. Click the arrow to check the **Default** policy.   5. In the **Authentication Policy** section, verify the following:   + All rules are disabled except the **Default** rule.   + Under **Default** > **Options**, all options are **REJECT** or **DROP**.7. In the **Authorization Policy - Local Exceptions** section, verify that all rules are disabled.   8. In the **Authorization Policy - Global Exceptions** section, verify that all rules are disabled.   9. In the **Authorization Policy** section, verify the following:      + All rules are disabled except the **Default** rule.      + The **Default** rule's profile is **DenyAccess**.Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Details  * The affected Cisco ISE PSN should restart automatically. If the restart fails, a manual restart should be performed. The recommendations for a manual restart are as follows:    + In a one-node deployment, the PSN persona will be located on the single node. That node will need to be restarted.   + In a multi-node deployment, only the affected PSN node will need to be restarted. For more information on Cisco ISE personas, see the [Cisco ISE Admin Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/ise/3-3/admin_guide/b_ise_admin_3_3/b_ISE_admin_33_deployment.html#typesofpersonas).  **Note:**    + If PSNs are behind a load balancer, the exploit traffic can cascade across to other PSNs.   + If PSN node groups are configured, the exploit traffic will not cascade across to other PSNs. **Restart Cisco ISE**  To stop and then start a Cisco ISE node from the CLI, use the following steps. For more details on each command, see the [Cisco ISE CLI Reference Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/ise/3-3/cli_guide/b_ise_CLI_Reference_Guide_33/b_ise_CLIReferenceGuide_33_chapter_01.html).  **Note:** During the restart period, any devices already authenticated will still be connected to the network. New authentications will not be processed unless PSN failover is configured.    1. Log in to the affected PSN through the CLI.   2. Issue the command **application stop ise** and wait for the prompt to return output, as shown in the following example: ```      ise/admin# application stop ise            Stopping ISE Monitoring & Troubleshooting Log Processor...      PassiveID WMI Service is disabled      PassiveID Syslog Service is disabled      PassiveID API Service is disabled...ise/admin#      ```   3. Issue the command **application start ise** and wait for the prompt to return output, as shown in the following example: ```      ise/admin# application start iseVerified OKISE Database processes already running, PID: 3310843 Stopping ISE Database processes... Starting ISE Messaging Service... Starting ISE API Gateway Database Service......ise/admin#            ```   4. Issue the command **show application status ise** to see the status of the processes, as shown in the following example.**Note:** When the Application Server is running, authentications will take place and the node will be accessible through the GUI. ```      ise/admin# show application status ise      ISE PROCESS NAME     STATE        PROCESS ID      --------------------------------------------------------------------      Database Listener            running       3313832      Database Server              running       92 PROCESSES      Application Server          running      3330909      Profiler Database             running       3321522      ISE Indexing Engine         running       3332725      ...ise/admin#      ``` **PSN Failover Information**  For PSN failover options, see the Policy Service Nodes and Node Groups section of [this Cisco Press article](https://www.ciscopress.com/articles/article.asp?p=2812072&seqNum=2).  For information on how to configure node groups, see the [Policy Service Node section](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/ise/3-3/admin_guide/b_ise_admin_3_3/b_ISE_admin_33_deployment.html#ID64) of the Cisco ISE Admin Guide.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability. However, several potential mitigations may help address this vulnerability.  To mitigate this vulnerability, customers can turn off RADIUS accounting on the network access device (NAD) sending the crafted packets to the Cisco ISE PSN. There may be other mitigations for this vulnerability for customers who cannot upgrade to a fixed release. To coordinate implementation of the mitigations, contact the [Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC)](https://www.cisco.com/go/tac/).  While these mitigations have been deployed and were proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released [free software updates](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#ssu) that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.  Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:<https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

Example 1:

```

ise193/admin#copy repository
To auto-complete the 'repository' command after typing 'copy r', press the Tab key twice.
ise193/admin#
ise193/admin#copy ?
Possible completions:
  <WORD> Enter URL (use disk:/path/file for local) (Max Size - 2048)
  logs   Dump logs to a remote URL.
  repository   Repository from where file needs to be copied

```

Example 2:

```

ise193/admin#application upgrade ?
Possible completions:
  <WORD>   Application bundle file name (Max Size - 255)
  cleanup   Cleanup previous prepared bundle so as to prepare a new bundle
  prepare   Download and prepare application for upgrade
  proceed   Proceed with upgrade using local prepared bundle

### Monitoring Database Settings

#### Before You begin

You must reset the monitoring database only when the Cisco ISE
server is not in the deployment.

| **Note** | ---   We recommend to reset primary and secondary Monitoring node databases at the same time to prevent discrepancy in log files.   --- |
| --- | --- |

To configure Monitoring database related tasks, use the
following options in the
application configure
ise  command:

* To reset the monitoring session database, use the option 1.

  | **Note** | ---   The reset option will cause ISE services to be temporarily unavailable until it restarts.   --- |
  | --- | --- |
* To rebuild unusable indexes in the monitoring database, use the
  option 2.
* To purge monitoring operational data, use the option 3.

  The purge option is used to clean up the data and will prompt to ask the number of days to be retained.
* To reset the monitoring database, use the option 4.

  The reset option is used to reset the database to the factory default, so that all the data is be permanently deleted. You
  can reset the database if the files are consuming too much file system space.

  | **Note** | ---   The reset option will cause ISE services to be temporarily unavailable until it restarts.   --- |
  | --- | --- |
* To refresh the monitoring database statistics, use the option 5.

#### Example

To reset the monitoring session database, use the option 1.

```

### Live Statistics of Profiling Events

To display live statistics from the profiling events by probe and type, use the Display Profiler Statistics option in the
application configure ise  command. This data is collected only from the Policy Service nodes and you will not see this data in Monitoring nodes.

It leverages
existing JMX counters that previously required the root patch or external
JConsole to retrieve, and so there is no need to use the root patch to capture
this data.

#### Example

```

ise/admin# application configure ise

### Export and Import Internal CA Store

To export Cisco ISE CA certificates and keys from the primary Administration Node (PAN) to be able to import them to the secondary
Administration Node in case of a PAN failure, use the application configure ise  command in EXEC mode.

When you promote
your secondary Administration Node to become the primary Administration Node
(PAN), you must import the Cisco ISE CA certificates and keys that you have
exported from the original PAN.

* To export a copy
  of the Cisco ISE CA certificates and keys, use option 7 in the
  application configure
  ise  command.
* To import a copy
  of the Cisco ISE CA certificates and keys, use option 8 in the
  application configure
  ise  command.

#### Example 1

To export a copy of
the Cisco ISE CA certificates and keys, use option 7.

### Key Performance Metrics Statistical Data

To obtain key performance metrics (KPM), use the Generate Daily KPM Stats or Generate KPM Stats for last 8 Weeks option in
the application configure ise  command. This data is collected from the Monitoring nodes. The output of this command provides statistical information about
the endpoints that connect to your deployment. You can choose to generate a report for KPM statistics daily or for the last
8 weeks. The report is saved to the local disk.

If you have reset
the Monitoring database (option 4) before generating the KPM statistics,
options 12 and 13 will not return any data because the Monitoring database is
reset.

#### Example

```

ise/admin# application configure ise

### Counter Attribute Collection

ISE Counters collect threshold values for various attributes. The values for these different attributes are collected at different
intervals (one at five minute interval and another greater than five minutes) and the data is presented in the ISE Counters
report.

Cisco ISE, by default, collects the values for these attributes. You can choose to disable this data collection from the Cisco
ISE CLI using the application configure ise  command. Choose option 14 to enable or disable counter attribute collection.

#### Example

To disable counter attribute collection, use option 14.

```

ise/admin# application configure ise
Selection ISE configuration option
[1]Reset M&T Session Database
[2]Rebuild M&T Unusable Indexes

### Localized ISE Installation

While reinstalling Cisco ISE, you can use the **Localized ISE Install** option (option 38) in the **application configure ise** command to reduce the installation time. By using this option, you can reduce the reinstallation time from an average of
5-7 hours, to approximately 1-2 hours. Though this option can be used for both Cisco Secure Network Server and virtual appliances,
it significantly reduces the reinstallation time for Cisco Secure Network Servers.

| **Note** | ---  * **Localized ISE Install** option is supported for Cisco ISE 3.1 Patch 9 and above, Cisco ISE 3.2 Patch 5 and above, and Cisco ISE 3.3 Patch 2 and above   releases. * You can use this option to reinstall the current version and higher versions. You cannot install a version that is older than   the current version.  --- |
| --- | --- |

To install Cisco ISE using the **Localized ISE Install** option:

1. Copy a Cisco ISE ISO file to the local disk (`disk://`) using the **copy** command. Here is an example:

   ```
   ise/admin#copy ftp://xx.xx.xxx.xx//iseBuild/3.x.x.xxx/ise-3.x.x.xxx.SPA.x86_64.iso disk://
   Enter username:admin
   Enter password:
   ```
2. Run the **application configure ise** command.

   The following options are displayed:

   ```
   Selection configuration option
   [1]Reset M&T Session Database
   [2]Rebuild M&T Unusable Indexes
   [3]Purge M&T Operational Data
   [4]Reset M&T Database

   [37]Enable/Disable/Current_status of RSA_PSS signature for EAP-TLS
   [38]Localised ISE Install
   [39]Enable/Disable Explicit EC Check
   [0]Exit
   ```
3. Choose the **Localized ISE Install** option (option 38).

   The ISO files that are stored in the local disk are listed.
4. Choose the ISO file that you want to install.
5. Verify the MD5 hash value of the chosen ISO file.

   If the MD5 checksum of the ISO file is not correct, the following error message is displayed:

   `Error in mounting ISO`

   You might face this error if the ISO file download was interupted due to any network issue. In this case, download the ISO
   file and verify the MD5 checksum again.
6. Enter **Y** to proceed with installation.

   The contents of the ISO file will be copied to the installer directories, and the appliance will reboot to install the chosen
   Cisco ISE release. Here is an example:

   ```
   ISO files present in the disk are:
   [1] ise-3.x.x.xxx.SPA.x86_64.iso
   Choose the ISO you want to install: 1

   Computing MD5 hash value of the selected ISO...
   File selected: ise-3.x.x.xxx.SPA.x86_64.iso (MD5: 8c3a2a73620bed0e3024044af9ccdf8e)

   Warning: Verify the MD5 checksum of the ISO before you proceed.

   Proceed with Installation? [y/n] y

   Copying ISO contents to installer directories. The copy may take around 5 minutes.

   % Notice: The appliance will reboot to install the chosen Cisco ISE release now.
   ```

## application remove

| **Note** | ---   You are not allowed to run the application remove  command from the command-line interface (CLI) to remove Cisco ISE unless you are explicitly instructed to do so for an upgrade.   --- |
| --- | --- |

To remove a specific application other than
Cisco ISE, use the
application remove
command in EXEC mode.

application [
remove {application-name}]

When you do not want to remove any other
application other than Cisco ISE, use the
no  form of this
command.

no
application [
remove {application-name}]

## Syntax Description

| remove | Removes or uninstalls an application. |
| --- | --- |
| application-name | Application name. Supports up to 255 alphanumeric characters.  Removes or uninstalls an application. |

### Command Default

No default behavior or values.

### Command Modes

EXEC

## Command History

| Release | Modification |
| --- | --- |
| 2.0.0.306 | This command was introduced. |

### Usage Guidelines

Removes or uninstalls an application.

### Example

```

ise/admin# application remove ise
Continue with application removal? [y/n] y
Application successfully uninstalled
ise/admin#

```

## application reset-config

To reset the Cisco ISE application configuration to factory
defaults or retain the existing factory settings, use the
application
reset-config  command in EXEC mode. In addition to self-signed
certificates, you can also reset server certificates or retain the existing
server certificates.

application [
reset-config {application-name}]

## Syntax Description

| reset-config | Resets the Cisco ISE application configuration and clears the Cisco ISE database. |
| --- | --- |
| application-name | Name of the application configuration you want to reset. Supports up to 255 alphanumeric characters. |

### Command Default

No default behavior or values.

### Command Modes

EXEC

## Command History

| Release | Modification |
| --- | --- |
| 2.0.0.306 | This command was introduced. |

### Usage Guidelines

You can use the
application
reset-config  command to reset the Cisco ISE configuration and
clear the Cisco ISE database without reimaging the Cisco ISE appliance or
VMware. The reset requires you to enter new Cisco ISE database administrator
and user passwords.

| **Note** | ---   Although the application reset-config  command resets the Cisco ISE configuration to factory defaults, the operating system (Cisco ADE-OS) configuration still remains intact. The Cisco ADE-OS configuration includes items such as the network settings, CLI password policy, and backup history.   --- |
| --- | --- |

When you reset the Cisco ISE application configuration from the
CLI, it performs a leave operation disconnecting the ISE node from the Active
Directory domain if it is already joined. However, the Cisco ISE node account
is not removed from the Active Directory domain. We recommend that you perform
a leave operation from the Cisco ISE Admin portal with the Active Directory
credentials. The leave operation removes the node account from the Active
Directory domain.

### Example

If a user selects
the No option, the command deletes server certificates and regenerates only
self-signed certificates. If the user selects the Yes option, the command
retains existing server certificates by exporting them to a location. The
server certificates are then imported from this location.

## application reset-passwd

To reset the Admin portal login password for a specified user account (usually an existing administrator account) in Cisco
ISE after the administrator account has been disabled due to incorrect password entries, use the application reset-passwd  command in EXEC mode.

application [ reset-passwd {application-name} {administrator-ID} ]

## Syntax Description

| reset-passwd | Resets the administrator account password. |
| --- | --- |
| application-name | Application name. Supports up to 255 alphanumeric characters. |
| administrator-ID | Name of a disabled administrator account for which you want to reset the password. |

### Command Default

No default behavior or values. necessary to
disable the administrator account in Cisco ISE

### Command Modes

EXEC

## Command History

| Release | Modification |
| --- | --- |
| 2.0.0.306 | This command was introduced. |

### Usage Guidelines

The following special characters are allowed
when resetting the Cisco ISE Admin portal password:

| ~ | ! | @ | $ | & | \* | - | \_ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| + | = | \ | " | , | ; | < | > |

If you enter an incorrect password for an
administrator user ID more than the specified number of times, then the Admin
portal “locks you out” of the system. Cisco ISE suspends the credentials for
it. administrator user ID until you have an opportunity to reset the password
associated with it. You can reset the administrator password only in the
Administration ISE node CLI.

UTF-8 admin users can change passwords only
through the Cisco ISE Admin portal.

### Example

```

ise/admin# application reset-passwd ise admin
Enter new password: ******
Confirm new password: ******
Password reset successfully.
ise/admin#

```

## application start

To enable a specific application, use the
application
start  command in EXEC mode. To disable starting an application,
use the
no  form of this
command.

application [ start {application-name [safe]}]

no application [ start {application-name  [safe]}]

## Syntax Description

| start | Enables an application bundle. |
| --- | --- |
| application-name | Name of the predefined application that you want to enable. Supports up to 255 alphanumeric characters. |
| safe | Starts an application in safe mode. |

### Command Default

No default behavior or values.

### Command Modes

EXEC

## Command History

| Release | Modification |
| --- | --- |
| 2.0.0.306 | This command was introduced. |

### Usage Guidelines

Enables an application.

You cannot use this command to start Cisco ISE. If you try to,
you will be prompted that Cisco ISE is already running.

You can use the application start
ise safe  command to start Cisco ISE in a safe mode that allows you to disable access control temporarily to the Admin portal and then
restart the application after making necessary changes.

The safe option provides a means of recovery in the event that
you as an administrator inadvertently lock out all users from accessing the
Cisco ISE Admin portal. This event can happen if you configure an incorrect "IP
Access" list in the Administration > Admin Access > Settings > Access
page. The 'safe' option also bypasses certificate-based authentication and
reverts to the default username and password authentication for logging into
the Cisco ISE Admin portal.

### Example 1

```
ise/iseadmin#application start ise

ISE Database processes already running, PID: xxxxxxx
Starting ISE Messaging Service...
Starting ISE API Gateway Database Service...
Starting ISE Profiler Database...
Starting ISE API Gateway Service...
Starting ISE Monitoring & Troubleshooting Session Database...
Starting edda-url-fetcher-service Service...
Starting ISE Process Monitoring Service...
Starting ISE Application Server...

ISE EST service is already running, PID: xxxxxxx
Starting ISE AD Connector...
Starting ISE Node Exporter...
Starting ISE Prometheus Service...
Starting ISE Grafana Service...
ISE MNT LogAnalytics Elasticsearch Service is disabled
ISE Logstash Service is disabled
ISE Kibana Service is disabled
Note: ISE Processes are initializing. Use 'show application status ise'
      CLI to verify all processes are in running state.
```

### Starting Cisco ISE Application in Safe Mode

The purpose of the
'safe' option is to bypass access restrictions that may have been caused
inadvertently. When the safe mode is used to start Cisco ISE services, the
following behavior is observed:

* IP access
  restriction is temporarily disabled to allow administrators logging into
  correct IP access restrictions if they inadvertently lock themselves.
* On FIPS enabled
  hosts, if the 'safe' option is passed on application startup, the FIPS
  integrity check is temporarily disabled. Normally, if FIPS integrity check
  fails, Cisco ISE services are not started. Users can bypass the FIPS integrity
  check with the 'safe' option on application start.
* On FIPS enabled
  hosts, if the 'safe' option is passed on application startup, the hardware
  random number generator integrity check is disabled.
* Cisco ISE initiates outbound SSH or SFTP connections in FIPS mode even if
  FIPS mode is not enabled on ISE. Ensure that the remote SSH or SFTP servers
  that communicate with ISE allow FIPS 140-2 approved cryptographic
  algorithms.

  Cisco ISE uses embedded FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic modules. For
  details of the FIPS compliance claims, see the [FIPS Compliance Letter](http://www.cisco.com/web/strategy/government/security_certification/net_business_benefit_seccert_fips140.html).
* If
  certificate-based authentication is used, the 'safe' option on application
  start will temporarily use username and password based authentication.

| **Note** | ---   These changes are temporary and only relevant for that instance of the Cisco ISE application. If the Cisco ISE services are restarted again without the 'safe' option, all of the default functionality is restored.   --- |

### Command Default

No default behavior or values.

### Command Modes

EXEC

## Command History

| Release | Modification |
| --- | --- |
| 2.0.0.306 | This command was introduced. |

### Usage Guidelines

You can encrypt and decrypt backups now by using user-defined
encryption keys when you perform a backup of Cisco ISE and Cisco ADE OS data in
a repository with an encrypted (hashed) or unencrypted plaintext password with
ise-config . To
perform a backup of only the Cisco ISE application data without the Cisco ADE
OS data, use the
ise-operational
command.

You can back up Cisco ISE operational data only from the primary
or secondary Monitoring nodes.

| **Important** | ---   When performing a backup and restore, the restore overwrites the list of trusted certificates on the target system with the list of certificates from the source system. It is critically important to note that backup and restore functions do not include private keys associated with the Internal Certificate Authority (CA) certificates.  If you are performing a backup and restore from one system to another, you will have to choose from one of these options to avoid errors:   * **Option 1:**  Export the CA certificates from the source ISE node through the   CLI and import them in to the target system through the CLI.  **Pros:**Any certificates issued to endpoints from the source   system will continue to be trusted. Any new certificates issued by the target   system will be signed by the same keys.  **Cons:**Any certificates that have been issued by the target   system prior to the restore function will not be trusted and will need to be   re-issued. * **Option 2:**  After the restore process, generate all new certificates for the   internal CA.  **Pros:**This option is the recommended and clean method,   where neither the original source certificates or the original target   certificates will be used. Certificates issued by the original source system   will continue to be trusted.  **Cons:**Any certificates that have been issued by the target   system prior to the restore function will not be trusted and will need to be   re-issued.  --- |

## Command History

| Release | Modification |
| --- | --- |
| 2.0.0.306 | This command was introduced. |

### Usage Guidelines

| **Caution** | ---  Changing the system time on a Cisco ISE appliance causes the Cisco ISE application to be unusable.  --- |
| --- | --- |

Sets the system clock. You must restart the Cisco ISE server
after you reset the clock for the change to take effect. Changing system time
impacts different Cisco ISE nodes types of your deployment.

To recover from the impact, use the following steps:

### Standalone or Primary ISE Node

| **Note** | ---  Changing the system time after installation is not supported on a standalone or primary ISE node.  --- |
| --- | --- |

If you inadvertently change the system time, do the following:

* Revert to the original system time (the time before it was
  changed).
* Run the
  application reset-config
  ise  command from the CLI of that node.
* Restore from the last known good backup before the time change
  on that node.

### Secondary ISE Node

| **Note** | ---  Changing the system time on a secondary node renders it unusable in your deployment.  --- |
| --- | --- |

To synchronize the system time of the secondary node with the
primary node, do the following:

* Deregister the secondary ISE node.
* Correct the system time to be in sync with the primary ISE node.
* Run the
  application reset-config
  ise  command from the CLI of the primary ISE node.
* Reregister the ISE node as a secondary ISE node to the primary
  ISE node.

  | **Note** | ---   To ensure that you have the correct system time set at the time of installation, the setup wizard requires you to specify an Network Time Protocol (NTP) server and tries to sync with it. You must ensure that the NTP server configured during setup is always reachable so that the system time is always kept accurate, especially in rare situations where the BIOS time can get corrupted because of power failure or CMOS battery failure. This, in turn, can corrupt the Cisco ADE-OS system time during a reboot. If you do not configure an NTP server during setup, then you have to ensure that the system BIOS time is set relative to the Universal Time Coordinated (UTC) time zone, as described in the Cisco Identity Services Engine Hardware Installation Guide.   --- |
  | --- | --- |

### Example

```

ise/admin# clock set August 30 18:07:20 2013
ise/admin# show clock
Fri Aug 30 18:07:26 UTC 2013
ise/admin#

```

```

## copy

To copy a file (such as a system image or configuration file) from local disk to a repository, use the following copy  command in EXEC mode.

copy
disk:/
filename
repository repository\_name

To copy a file from a repository to local disk, use the following copy  command in EXEC mode.

copy
repository
repo\_name
file
file\_name
localdisk\_destination\_path

Using the following copy  command, you can copy core files and heap dumps from Cisco ISE to a remote repository. See [Copying Log files](b_ise_CLIReferenceGuide_33_chapter_01.html#wp1179892706) for more information.

copy
logs [protocol://hostname/location]

## Command History

| Release | Modification |
| --- | --- |
| 2.0.0.306 | This command was introduced. |
| 3.2 | This command was modified to no longer support running-config and startup-config functions. |

### Usage Guidelines

The source and destination for the file specified uses the Cisco ISE file system, through which you can specify any supported
local or remote file location. The file system being used (a local memory source or a remote system) dictates the syntax used
in the command.

You can enter all necessary source and destination information
and the username and password to use; or, you can enter the
copy  command
and have the server prompt you for any missing information.

The entire copying process might take several minutes and
differs from protocol to protocol and from network to network.

Use the filename relative to the directory for file transfers.

Possible errors are standard File Transfer protocol (FTP) error messages.

* [Copying Log files](b_ise_CLIReferenceGuide_33_chapter_01.html#wp1179892706)

### Copying Log files

Use the following copy  command to copy system log files from the Cisco ISE system to another location:

copy logs [protocol://hostname/location]

#### Example 1

To copy log files to the local disk, use the following command:

```

ise/admin# copy logs disk:/
 Collecting logs...
ise/admin#

```

#### Example 2

To copy log files to another location, use the following
command:

```

ise/admin# copy disk://mybackup-100805-1910.tar.gz ftp://myftpserver/mydir
Username:
Password:
ise/admin#

```

#### Example 3

Cisco ISE moves the core files and heap dumps from the */var/tmp*
directory to the *disk:/corefiles* directory on an hourly basis. You can
copy these logs from the local disk to a remote repository using the copy
command. The core files and heap dumps contain critical information that would
help identify the cause of a crash. These logs are created when the application
crashes. You can use the dir command to view the core files in the local disk.

```
ise/admin# copy disk:/corefiles ftp://192.0.2.2/
Username: ftp
Password:
ise36/admin#
ise36/admin# dir

## crypto

To generate a new public key pair, export the current public key
to a repository, and import a public key to the authorized keys list, use the
crypto  command
in EXEC mode. It is also possible to view the public key information and delete
selected keys.

crypto key [
delete {hash |
authorized\_keys | rsa}]

crypto key [
export {filename | repository}]

crypto key [
generate {rsa}]

crypto key [
import {filename |
repository}]

crypto [host\_key {add | delete}]

## Syntax Description

| key | Allows you to perform crypto key operations. |
| --- | --- |
| delete | Deletes a public/private key pair. |
| hash | Hash value. Supports up to 80 characters. |
| authorized\_keys | Deletes authorized keys. |
| rsa | Deletes an RSA key pair. |
| export | Exports a public/private key pair to repository. |
| filename | The filename to which the public key is exported to. Supports up to 80 characters. |

### Command Default

No default behavior or values.

### Command Modes

EXEC

## Command History

| Release | Modification |
| --- | --- |
| 2.0.0.306 | This command was introduced. |

### Usage Guidelines

The Cisco ADE OS supports public key authentication with out the
password for SSH access to administrators and user identities.

Use the
crypto key generate
rsa  command to generate a new public/private key pair with a
2048-bit length for the current user. The key attributes are fixed, and
supports RSA key types. If the key pair already exists, you will be prompted to
permit an over-write before continuing with a passphrase. If you provide the
passphrase, you will be prompted for the passphrase whenever you access the
public/private key. If the passphrase is empty, no subsequent prompts for the
passphrase occurs.

Use the crypto ntp\_import\_autokey  command to import the public key generated from the NTP server.

| **Remember** | ---   The show crypto authorized keys command shows all authorized keys in an encrypted format.  You can delete individual key or all keys using the crypto key [ delete {hash | authorized\_keys | rsa}]  command.  When deleting an individual key using the hash value, if the last key is remaining, a warning is displayed. If the last key is deleted, a new key should be imported in the same session, or the administrator must login to the console to import a new key.  When deleting all authorized keys, a new key should be imported in the same session, or the administrator must login to the console to import a new key.   --- |
| --- | --- |

### Example 1

The following example shows the key management for SFTP repositories.

```

ise/admin# crypto key generate rsa
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
ise/admin# show crypto key
admin public key: ssh-rsa ad:14:85:70:fa:c3:c1:e6:a9:ff:b1:b0:21:a5:28:94 admin@ise
ise/admin# crypto key generate rsa
Private key for user admin already exists. Overwrite? y/n [n]: y
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
ise/admin# show crypto key
admin public key: ssh-rsa 41:ab:78:26:48:d3:f1:6f:45:0d:99:d7:0f:50:9f:72 admin@ise
ise/admin# crypto key export mykey_rsa repository myrepository
ise/admin# show crypto key
admin public key: ssh-rsa f8:7f:8a:79:44:b8:5d:5f:af:e1:63:b2:be:7a:fd:d4 admin@ise
ise/admin# crypto key delete  f8:7f:8a:79:44:b8:5d:5f:af:e1:63:b2:be:7a:fd:d4
ise/admin#
ise/admin# crypto key delete rsa
ise/admin# show crypto key
ise/admin#

```

### Example 2

The following example shows the key management for public keys that can be used to log in to Cisco ISE.

```
ise/admin# show crypto authorized_keys
Authorized keys for admin
ise/admin# crypto key delete authorized_keys

## password

To update the CLI account password, use the password  command in EXEC mode.

In Cisco ISE Release 3.2, to create a password with the hash symbol (#) or exclamation mark (!), you must first enter the
backslash symbol (\). For example: **abc\!23**, **abc\12#**, and so on.

| **Note** | ---   When you create a password for the administrator during installation or after installation in the CLI, do not use the $ character, except when it is the last character of the password. If that character is first or inside the other characters, the password is accepted, but you cannot use it to log on to the CLI.  You can fix this by logging into the console and using the CLI command, or by getting an ISE CD or ISO file. Instructions for using an ISO to reset the password are explained in the following document: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/identity-services-engine/200568-ISE-Password-Recovery-Mechanisms.html>   --- |

If you have the primary Administration node (PAN) auto-failover
configuration enabled in your deployment, disable it before you install the
patch. Enable the PAN auto-failover configuration after patch installation is
complete on all the nodes in your deployment.

When you install a
patch on Release 2.0, the patch installation process does not prompt you to
verify the hash value of the software. Beginning from Release 2.0 onwards, the
patch installation software automatically verifies the integrity of the patch
software using digital signatures. See the example given below for a sample
output of the
patch install  command.

No default behavior or values.

### Command Modes

## Command History

| Release | Modification |
| --- | --- |
| 2.0.0.306 | This command was introduced. |

### Usage Guidelines

The
ping6  command
sends an echo request packet to an address, and then waits for a reply. The
ping output can help you evaluate path-to-host reliability, delays over the
path, and whether or not you can reach a host.

The
ping6  command
is similar to the existing
ping  command.
The
ping6  command
does not support the IPv4 packet fragmentation (df , as
described in the
ping  command)
options, but it allows an optional specification of an interface. The interface
option is primarily useful for pinning with link-local addresses that are
interface-specific addresses. The packetsize and pingcount options work the
same way as they do with the
ping  command.

### Example 1

```

ise/admin# ping6 3ffe:302:11:2:20c:29ff:feaf:da05

## reload

This command has no keywords and arguments. To reboot the Cisco
ISE operating system, use the
reload  command
in EXEC mode.

reload  [cli ]

## Syntax Description

| *cli* | Restart the underlying Confd processes and generate the CLI again with updated values. |
| --- | --- |

### Command Default

No default behavior or values.

### Command Modes

EXEC

## Command History

| Release | Modification |
| --- | --- |
| 2.0.0.306 | This command was introduced. |
| 3.2 | The cli variable is introduced. |

### Usage Guidelines

The reload  command reboots the system. Use the reload  command after you enter configuration information into a file and save the running-configuration to the persistent startup-configuration
on the CLI. Save any settings in the Cisco ISE administration portal session.

Before you issue the reload  command, ensure that Cisco ISE is not performing any backup, restore, installation, upgrade, or remove operation. First,
run the application stop ise  command to stop Cisco ISE processes. Then, run the reload  command.

If Cisco ISE performs any of these operations and you issue the reload  command, you get one of the following warning messages:

```

WARNING: A backup or restore is currently in progress! Continue with reload?
WARNING: An install/upgrade/remove is currently in progress! Continue with reload?

```

If you get any of these warnings, enter Yes to continue with the
reload operation, or No to cancel it.

If no processes are running when you use the
reload  command
or you enter Yes in response to the warning message displayed, you must respond
to the following question:

```

Do you want to save the current configuration?

```

If you enter Yes to save the existing Cisco ISE configuration,
the following message is displayed:

```

Saved the running configuration to startup successfully

```

If automatic failover is enabled in your deployment, you receive the following warning message:

```
PAN Auto Failover feature is enabled, therefore
this operation will trigger a failover if ISE services are not
restarted within the fail-over window. Do you want to continue (y/n)?
```

Type 'y' if you want to continue or 'n' if you want to cancel.

In Cisco ISE 3.1 and earlier releases, when you carry out an operation such as adding a new NIC card to Cisco ISE, the running-config
and other appropriate commands are updated automatically to reflect the change. In Cisco ISE Release 3.2, you must enter the
reload cli command to reload the Cisco ISE CLI. Then, the newly added NIC card information is displayed in running-config and other
related areas.

| **Note** | ---  The Cisco ISE CLI service is interrupted for a few minutes when you run the reload cli command.  --- |
| --- | --- |

### Example 1

```

ise/admin# reload
Continue with reboot? [y/n]

```

### Example 2

```
ise/iseadmin#reload cli
%WARNING: : The Cisco ISE CLI will restart now and will be unavailable for a few minutes.
 Do you want to continue (yes/no) [no] ?yes
Connection to ise closed.
```

## reset-config

To reset the ADE-OS network configurations such
as ip address/mask/gateway, hostname, domain name, DNS server, and NTP server
using the
reset-config  command in
EXEC mode. These parameters are essentially the same parameters as that is
prompted during setup. The administrator will not be prompted for admin
password from this CLI. This command will also not reset the current ISE
configuration or operations data as these tasks are achieved by using the
application reset-config  command.

reset-config

### Command Default

No default behavior or values.

### Command Modes

EXEC

## Command History

| Release | Modification |
| --- | --- |
| 2.2.0.470 | This command was introduced. |

### Usage Guidelines

All services will be restarted upon completion.

| **Note** | ---  Updating the hostname will cause any certificate using the old hostname to become invalid. A new self-signed certificate using the new hostname will be generated now for use with HTTPS/EAP. If CA-signed certificates are used on this node, import the new ones with the correct hostname. In addition, if this node is part of an AD domain, delete any AD memberships before proceeding.  --- |
| --- | --- |

## restore

To restore a previous backup of the system, use the
restore  command
in EXEC mode. A restore operation restores data related to the Cisco ISE and
the Cisco ADE OS.

Use the following command to restore data related to the Cisco
ISE application and Cisco ADE OS:

restore [{filename}
repository {repository-name}
encryption-key hash |
plain {encryption-key-name}]

restore [{filename}
repository {repository-name}
encryption-key hash |
plain {encryption-key-name}
include-adeos]

## Syntax Description

| filename | Name of the backed-up file that resides in the repository. Supports up to 120 alphanumeric characters.   | **Note** | You must add the .tar.gpg extension after the filename (for example, myfile.tar.gpg). | | --- | --- | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| repository | The repository command. |
| repository-name | Name of the repository from which you want to restore the backup. Supports up to 120 characters. |
| encryption-key | (Optional). Specifies user-defined encryption key to restore backup. |
| hash | Hashed encryption key for restoring backup. Specifies an encrypted (hashed) encryption key that follows. Supports up to 40 characters. |
| plain | Plaintext encryption key for restoring backup. Specifies an unencrypted plaintext encryption key that follows. Supports up to 15 characters. |
| encryption-key-name | Specifies encryption key in hash | plain format. |
| include-adeos | Restores back up and reboots Cisco ISE, if ADE-OS configuration data is present in the backup |

If you have the Primary Administration Node
(PAN) auto-failover configuration enabled in your deployment, disable this
configuration before you restore a backup. You can enable the PAN auto-failover
configuration after the restore is complete.

### Command Default

No default behavior or values.

### Command Modes

EXEC

## Command History

| Release | Modification |
| --- | --- |
| 2.0.0.306 | This command was introduced. |

### Usage Guidelines

When you use restore commands in Cisco ISE, the Cisco ISE server
restarts automatically.

The encryption key is optional while restoring data. To support
restoring earlier backups where you have not provided encryption keys, you can
use the
restore  command
without the encryption key.

If
you have the PAN auto-failover configuration enabled in your deployment, the
following message appears:

```
PAN Auto Failover is enabled, this operation is
 not allowed! Please disable PAN Auto-failover first.
```

| **Note** | ---   Restoring from Cisco ISE, Release 1.0 and Cisco ISE, Release 1.0 MR backups are not supported in Cisco ISE, Release 1.2.   --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---   Cisco ISE, Release 1.4 supports restore from backups obtained from Release 1.2 and later.   --- |

### Usage Guidelines

The ssh  command
enables a system to make a secure, encrypted connection to another remote system or
server. With authentication and encryption, the SSH client allows for
secure communication over an insecure network.

| **Note** | ---   Cisco ISE initiates outbound SSH or SFTP connections in FIPS mode even if FIPS mode is not enabled on ISE. Ensure that the remote SSH or SFTP servers that communicate with ISE allow FIPS 140-2 approved cryptographic algorithms.  Cisco ISE uses embedded FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic modules. For details of the FIPS compliance claims, see the [FIPS Compliance Letter](http://www.cisco.com/web/strategy/government/security_certification/net_business_benefit_seccert_fips140.html).   --- |

## Command History

| Release | Modification |
| --- | --- |
| 2.0.0.306 | This command was introduced. |

### Usage Guidelines

If you see *bad UDP cksum* warnings in the tech dumptcp output, it may not be a cause for concern. The tech dumptcp  command examines outgoing packets before they exit through the Ethernet microprocessor. Most modern Ethernet chips calculate
checksums on outgoing packets, and so the operating system software stack does not. Hence, it is normal to see outgoing packets
declared as *bad UDP cksum*.

From Cisco ISE Release 3.0 onwards, the tech dumptcp  command has the following options as available interfaces:

* br-<...>
* docker0
* GigabitEthernet0 (and other GigabitEthernet interfaces if available)
* lo
* veth<...>

### Example 1

```

ise/admin# tech dumptcp 0 count 2
Invoking tcpdump. Press Control-C to interrupt.

* [Interpreting CPU and Memory Usage Data](b_ise_CLIReferenceGuide_33_chapter_01.html#wp2719592967)

### Interpreting CPU and Memory Usage Data

#### Usage Guidelines

The tech top  command output has the following options that provide information on memory and CPU usage:

* top shows uptime information
* Tasks shows process status information.
* %Cpu(s) shows various processor values.
* MiB Mem displays physical memory utilization. This value is based on the total amount of physical RAM installed on the system
  and provides the following information:

  + total shows total installed memory.
  + free shows available memory.
  + Used shows consumed memory.
  + buff/cache shows the amount of information cached to be written later.
* MiB Swap displays virtual memory utilization. OS can take advantage of virtual memory when physical memory space is used
  by borrowing storage space from storage disks. The process of swapping data back and forth between physical RAM and storage
  drives is time-consuming and uses system resources, so it is best to minimize the use of virtual memory. MiB Swap output provides
  the following information:

  + total shows total swap space.
  + free shows available swap space.
  + used shows consumed swap space.
  + buff/cache shows the amount of information cached for future reads.
* Load Average: The load average is broken down into three time increments. The first value displays the load for the last one
  minute, the second value for the last five minutes, and the final value for the last fifteen-minutes. For Cisco ISE high load
  average, use the five-minute interval. If the five-minute interval value goes beyond the cores allocated to the node, the
  load average alarm is triggered.

  Do not consider individual core usage, always monitor the load average for CPU or I/O consumption.

#### Example:

```

ise/admin# tech top
top - 06:33:08 up 13:03, 1 user
Tasks: 559 total, 1 running, 557 sleeping, 0 stopped, 1 zombie
%Cpu(s): 1.8 us, 0.7 sy, 0.0 ni, 97.3 id, 0.0 wa, 0.2 hi, 0.1 si, 0.0 st
MiB Mem: 31928.6 total, 5691.9 free, 22647.7 used, 3589.1 buff/cache
MiB Swap: 8000.0 total, 7126.7 free, 873.2 used. 6765.0 avail Mem
load average: 0.30, 0.38, 0.66

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |
| **Hours** | 24 hours a day, 7 days a week |

## Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco

There are several ways to stay connected and receive the latest security vulnerability information from Cisco. Customers should review the following table, and subsequent summaries, to determine the appropriate option for them:

| **Cisco.com** | <https://www.cisco.com/security/> |
| --- | --- |
| **Email** | cust-security-announce@cisco.com |
| **RSS** | <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44> |
| **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API** | [https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT/](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) |
| **My Notifications** | <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html> |

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

### **RSS Feeds**

Cisco security vulnerability information is also available via RSS feeds from Cisco.com. These feeds are free and do not require an active Cisco.com registration. For information on how to subscribe to the RSS feeds, visit the [Cisco Security RSS Feeds page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44).

### **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API**

The Cisco PSIRT openVuln application programming interface (API) is a RESTful API that conforms to the [representational state transfer](https://restfulapi.net/) (REST) software architectural style and allows customers to obtain Cisco security vulnerability information in different machine-consumable formats. To learn about accessing and using the API, visit the [PSIRT page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) on the Cisco DevNet website.

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

## Cisco ISE Deployment Terminology

The following terms are
commonly used when discussing Cisco ISE deployment scenarios:

* Service: A service is a specific feature that a persona provides, such as network access, profiler, posture, security group
  access, monitoring and troubleshooting, and so on.
* Node: A node is an individual instance that runs the Cisco ISE software. Cisco ISE is available as an appliance and also as
  a software that can be run on VMware. Each instance (appliance or VMware) that runs the Cisco ISE software is called a node.
* Persona: The persona of a node determines the services provided by the node. A Cisco ISE node can assume any of the following
  personas: Administration, Policy Service, Monitoring, and pxGrid. The menu options that are available through the Admin portal are dependent on the role and personas that a Cisco ISE node
  assumes.
* Deployment Model: Determines if your deployment is distributed, standalone, or high availability in standalone, which is a
  basic two-node deployment.

## Personas in Distributed Cisco ISE Deployments

A Cisco ISE node can assume the Administration, Policy Service, or Monitoring personas.

A Cisco ISE node can provide various services based on the persona that it assumes. Each node in a deployment can assume the
Administration, Policy Service, and Monitoring personas. In a distributed deployment, you can have the following combination
of nodes in your network:

* Primary Policy Administration Node (primary PAN) and secondary Policy Administration Node (secondary PAN) for high availability
* Primary Monitoring Node (primary MnT node) and Secondary Monitoring Node (secondary MnT node) for high availability
* A pair of health check nodes or a single health check node for the primary PAN automatic failover
* One or more Policy Service Nodes (PSNs) for the session failover

## Configure a Cisco ISE Node

After you install a Cisco ISE node, all the default services provided by the Administration, Policy Service, and Monitoring
personas run on it. This node is in a standalone state. You must log in to the Admin portal of the Cisco ISE node to configure
it. You cannot edit the personas or services of a standalone Cisco ISE node. You can, however, edit the personas and services
of the primary and secondary Cisco ISE nodes. You must first configure a primary ISE node and then register secondary ISE
nodes to the primary ISE node.

If you are logging in to the
node for the first time, you must change the default administrator password and
install a valid license.

We recommend that you do not change the host name and the domain name configured on Cisco ISE in production. If required,
reimage the appliance, make changes, and configure the details during the initial deployment.

### Before you begin

You should have a basic understanding of how distributed deployments are set up in Cisco ISE. See [Guidelines for Setting Up a Distributed Deployment](#ID209 "Guidelines for setting up a Distributed deployment").

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon () and choose Administration  >  System  >  Deployment. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Check the check box next to the Cisco ISE node that you want to configure, and click Edit. |
| **Step 3** | Enter the values, as required, and click Save. |

---

* [Configure a Primary Policy Administration Node](#ID330)
* [Register a Secondary Cisco ISE Node](#task_197D63FEC8BD473AA23901D25DD9C9F9)

### Configure a Primary Policy Administration Node

To set up a distributed deployment, you must first configure a Cisco ISE node as your primary PAN.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon () and choose Administration  >  System  >  Deployment.  The Register button is disabled initially. To enable this button, configure a Primary PAN. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Check the check box next to the current node, and click Edit. |
| **Step 3** | Click Make Primary to configure your primary PAN. |
| **Step 4** | Click Save to save the node configuration. |

---

#### What to do next

1. Add secondary
   nodes to your deployment.
2. Enable the
   profiler service and configure the probes, if required.

### Register a Secondary Cisco ISE Node

You can register Cisco ISE nodes to the primary PAN to form a multinode deployment. Nodes in a deployment other than the
primary PAN are referred to as secondary nodes. While registering a node, you can select the personas and services that must
be enabled on the node. Registered nodes can be managed from the primary PAN (for example, managing the node personas, services,
certificates, licenses, applying patches, and so on).

When a node is registered, the primary PAN pushes the configuration data to the secondary node, and the application server
on the secondary node restarts. After the complete data replication, further configuration changes done on the primary PAN
are replicated to the secondary node. The time taken for the changes to be replicated on the secondary node depends on various
factors, such as network latency, load on the system, and so on.

#### Before you begin

Ensure that the primary PAN and the node being registered are DNS resolvable to each other. If the node that is being registered
uses an untrusted self-signed certificate, you are prompted with a certificate warning along with details of the certificate.
If you accept the certificate, it is added to the trusted certificate store of the primary PAN to enable TLS communication
with the node.

If the node uses a certificate that is not self-signed (for example, signed by an external CA), you must manually import the
relevant certificate chain of that node to the trusted certificate store of the primary PAN. When you import the secondary
node's certificate to the trusted certificate store, check the Trust for Authentication within ISE check box in the Trusted Certificates window for the PAN to validate the secondary node's certificate.

While registering a node with session services enabled (such as Network Access, Guest, Posture, and so on), you can add it
to a node group. See [Create a Policy Service Node Group](#ID513 "When two or more PSNs are connected to the same LAN, you can place them in the same node group.") for more details.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Log in to the primary PAN. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon () and choose Administration  >  System  >  Deployment. |
| **Step 3** | Click **Register** to initiate registration of a secondary node. |
| **Step 4** | Enter the DNS-resolvable fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the standalone node that you are going to register (in the format hostname.domain-name, for example, abc.xyz.com). The FQDN of the primary PAN and the node being registered must be resolvable from each other. |
| **Step 5** | Enter the GUI-based administrator credentials for the secondary node in the Username and Password fields. |
| **Step 6** | Click **Next**.  The primary PAN tries to establish TLS communication (for the first time) after the node is registered.   * If the node uses a certificate that is trusted, you can proceed to Step 7. * If the node uses a self-signed certificate that is not trusted, a certificate warning message is displayed with details about   the certificate (such as, Issued-to, Issued-by, Serial number, and so on), which can be verified against the actual certificate   on the node. Click the **Import Certificate and Proceed** option to trust this certificate and proceed with registration. Cisco ISE imports the default self-signed certificate of   that node to the trusted certificate store of the primary PAN. If you do not want to use the default self-signed certificate,   click **Cancel Registration** and manually import the relevant certificate chain of that node to the trusted certificate store of the primary PAN. When   you import the secondary node's certificate to the trusted certificate store, check the **Trust for Authentication within ISE** check box adjacent to the corresponding PAN to validate the secondary node's certificate. * If the node uses a CA-signed certificate, an error message is displayed, stating that the registration cannot proceed until   certificate trust is set up. |
| **Step 7** | Check the check boxes to select the personas and services to be enabled on the node, and then click **Save**.  When a node is registered, an alarm (which confirms that a node has been added to the deployment) is generated on the primary PAN. You can view this alarm in the Alarms dashlet in the Cisco ISE GUI Dashboard. After the registered node is synchronized and restarted, you can log in to the secondary node GUI using the same credentials used on the primary PAN. |

---

#### What to do next

* For
  time-sensitive tasks such as guest user access and authorization, logging, and
  so on, ensure that the system time on your nodes is synchronized.
* If you registered a secondary PAN, and are using the internal Cisco ISE CA service, you must back up the Cisco ISE CA certificates
  and keys from the primary PAN and restore them on the secondary PAN.

## Support for Multiple Deployment Scenarios

Cisco ISE can be deployed
across an enterprise infrastructure, supporting 802.1X wired, wireless, and
Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).

The Cisco ISE architecture supports both standalone and distributed (also known as *high availability* or *redundancy*) deployments, where one machine assumes the primary role, and another *backup* machine assumes the secondary role. Cisco ISE features distinct configurable personas, services, and roles, which allow you
to create and apply Cisco ISE services where needed in the network. The result is a comprehensive Cisco ISE deployment that
operates as a fully functional and integrated system.

Cisco ISE nodes can be deployed with one or more of the Administration, Monitoring, and Policy Service personas. Each persona
performs a different, but vital, part in your overall network policy management topology. Installing Cisco ISE with an administration
persona allows you to configure and manage your network from a centralized portal to promote efficiency and ease of use.

## Cisco ISE Distributed Deployment

A deployment that has more than one Cisco ISE node is called a distributed deployment. To support failover and to improve
performance, you can set up your deployment with multiple Cisco ISE nodes in a distributed fashion. In a Cisco ISE distributed
deployment, the administration and monitoring activities are centralized, and processing is distributed across the PSNs. Depending
on your performance needs, you can scale your deployment. Each Cisco ISE node in a deployment can assume any of these personas-Administration,
Policy Service, and Monitoring.

* [Data Replication from Primary to Secondary Cisco ISE Nodes](#ID182)
* [Cisco ISE Node Deregistration](#ID185)
* [Node Status in a Cisco ISE Deployment](#Cisco_Concept.dita_2442ca4d-e572-43ad-8850-36b8dae63082)
* [Guidelines for Setting Up a Distributed Deployment](#ID209)
* [Menu Options Available on Primary and Secondary Nodes](#ID246)

### Cisco ISE Deployment Setup

After you install Cisco ISE on all your nodes, as described in the [Cisco Identity Services Engine Hardware Installation Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/security/identity-services-engine/products-installation-guides-list.html), the nodes come up in a standalone state. You must then define one node as your primary PAN. While defining your primary
PAN, you must enable the administration and monitoring personas on that node. You can optionally enable the policy service
persona on the primary PAN. After you complete the task of defining personas on the primary PAN, you can register other secondary
nodes to the primary PAN and define personas for the secondary nodes.

All Cisco ISE system and functionality-related configurations should be done only on the primary PAN. The configuration changes
that you perform on the primary PAN are replicated to all the secondary nodes in your deployment.

There must be at least one MnT in a distributed deployment. At the time of configuring your primary PAN, you must enable the
Monitoring persona. After you register an MnT node in your deployment, you can edit the primary PAN and disable the Monitoring
persona, if required.

### Data Replication from Primary to Secondary Cisco ISE Nodes

When you register a Cisco ISE node as a secondary node, Cisco ISE immediately creates a data replication channel from the
primary to the secondary node and begins the process of replication. Replication is the process of sharing Cisco ISE configuration
data from the primary to the secondary nodes. Replication ensures consistency among the configuration data available in all
the Cisco ISE nodes that are part of your deployment. From Cisco ISE, Release 3.3, dynamically discovered endpoints are not replicated to all the nodes in the Cisco ISE deployment
automatically. In the Endpoint Replication window (Administration > System > Settings > Endpoint Replication), click the corresponding radio button to enable or disable the replication of the dynamically discovered endpoints across
all the nodes in your Cisco ISE deployment:

* Click Replicate endpoints to all nodes to enable replication of endpoint information to all the nodes in the Cisco ISE deployment.
* Click Disable endpoint replication to all nodes to disable replication of endpoint information to all the nodes in the Cisco ISE deployment. This is selected by default.

Statically configured endpoints, endpoints imported from CSV files, endpoints created using OpenAPI, and guest and posture-enabled
endpoints are automatically replicated across all Cisco ISE nodes.

To enable or disable endpoint replication using OpenAPI, see the *[Cisco ISE API Reference Guide](https://developer.cisco.com/docs/identity-services-engine/v1/)*.

A full replication typically occurs when you first register a Cisco ISE node as a secondary node. Incremental replication
occurs after a full replication and ensures that any new changes, such as additions, modifications, or deletions to the configuration
data in the PAN are reflected in the secondary nodes. The process of replication ensures that all the Cisco ISE nodes in a
deployment are in sync. You can view the status of replication in the Node Status column in the Deployment window of the Cisco ISE Admin portal. When you register a Cisco ISE node as a secondary node or perform a manual synchronization
with the PAN, the node status shows an orange icon, indicating that the requested action is in progress. After the synchronization
is complete, the node status turns green, indicating that the secondary node is synchronized with the PAN.

| **Note** | ---  * "Disable endpoint replication to all nodes" does not lead to data loss, as it only stops replication for Dynamic Endpoints." * In Cisco ISE replication, if the primary node is unable to publish replication events to the secondary nodes and the number   of un-published events exceeds 1.5 million, the system marks all the secondary nodes OUT OF SYNC.  On the other hand, if the delta between the published sequence and the secondary nodes consuming the replication events exceeds   2 million, the system marks those specific PSNs OUT OF SYNC.  --- |
| --- | --- |

### Cisco ISE Node Deregistration

To remove a node from a deployment, you must deregister it. When you deregister a secondary node from the primary PAN, the
status of the deregistered node changes to standalone, and the connection between the primary and the secondary node is lost.
Replication updates are no longer sent to the deregistered standalone node.

When a PSN is deregistered, the endpoint data is lost. If you want the PSN to retain the endpoint data after it becomes a
standalone node, you can do one of the following:

* Obtain a backup from the primary PAN, and when the PSN becomes a standalone node, restore this data backup on it.
* Change the persona of the PSN to administration (secondary PAN), synchronize the data from the Deployment window of the Admin portal, and then deregister the node. This node will now have all the data. You can then add a secondary
  PAN to the existing deployment.

| **Note** | ---   You cannot deregister a primary PAN.   --- |

### Node Status in a Cisco ISE Deployment

Table 1. Cisco ISE Node Status

| Node Status | Description | Guidelines |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Connected | Node is connected and replication works fine. | - |
| Replication Stopped | Node is connected but replication has stopped. The node is reachable on ports 443 and 12001.  This is a temporary status that will change when the underlying replication issue is resolved. | The underlying issue may resolve by itself. If not, log in to the Cisco ISE GUI and perform a manual synchronization from the **Deployment** window. |
| Node Not Reachable | Node is not reachable on port 443 but replication works fine. | The node may come back up by itself when the underlying issue resolves. If not, log in to the Cisco ISE GUI and perform a manual synchronization from the **Deployment** window. |
| Disconnected | Node is not reachable and replication has stopped. | This status is set if the node is down for more than five minutes.  The node may come back up by itself when the underlying issue resolves. If not, log in to the Cisco ISE GUI and perform a manual synchronization from the **Deployment** window. |
| Registration failed | Node registration has failed. | Perform a manual synchronization. Deregister and register the affected Cisco ISE node again. |
| In Progress | Node registration or manual sync is in progress.  Currently, the In Progress status has a timeout value of 300 minutes, after which the status changes to:   * Connected if registration or manual sync is successful. * Registration Failed if node registration fails. * Not in Sync if manual sync fails. | No action is required if the status changes to Connected. If it changes to Registration Failed or Not in Sync, check the respective rows and perfom the necessary actions. |
| Not in Sync | Node is not in sync. | Perform a manual synchronization. Deregister and register the affected Cisco ISE node again. |
| Upgrading | Node upgrade is in progress. | - |

### Guidelines for Setting Up a Distributed Deployment

Read the following statements carefully before you set up Cisco ISE in a distributed environment:

* Choose a node type for the Cisco ISE server. You must choose a Cisco ISE node for administration, policy service, and monitoring
  capabilities.
* Choose the same Network Time Protocol (NTP) server for all the nodes. To avoid timezone issues among the nodes, you must provide
  the same NTP server name when setting up each node. This setting ensures that the reports and logs from the various nodes
  in your deployment are always synchronized with timestamps.
* Configure the Cisco ISE administrator password when you install Cisco ISE. The previous Cisco ISE administrator default login
  credentials (admin/cisco) are no longer valid. Use the username and password that was created during the initial setup, or
  the current password if it was changed later.
* Configure the DNS server. Enter the IP addresses and fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) of all the Cisco ISE nodes that
  are part of your distributed deployment in the DNS server. Otherwise, node registration fails.
* Configure the forward and the reverse DNS lookup for all the Cisco ISE nodes in your distributed deployment in the DNS server.
  Otherwise, you may run into deployment-related issues when registering and restarting Cisco ISE nodes. Performance might be
  degraded if reverse DNS lookup is not configured for all the nodes.
* (Optional) Deregister a secondary Cisco ISE node from the primary PAN to uninstall Cisco ISE from it.
* Back up the primary MnT, and restore the data to the new secondary MnT. This ensures that the history of the primary MnT is
  in sync with the new MnT because the new changes are replicated.
* Ensure that the primary PAN and the standalone node that you are about to register as a secondary node are running the same
  version of Cisco ISE.
* Enable **Internal CA Settings** on your Cisco ISE primary PAN before you add another node to your deployment to ensure that the Cisco ISE certificate services
  function as expected. To enable Internal CA Settings, click the Menu icon (![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/440001-450000/440001-441000/440197.jpg)) and choose Administration > System > Certificates > Certificate Authority > Internal CA Settings.
* While adding a new node to the deployment, make sure that the issuer certificate chain of wildcard certificates is part of
  the trusted certificates of the new node. When the new node is added to the deployment, the wildcard certificates are replicated
  to the new node.
* When configuring your Cisco ISE deployment to support Cisco TrustSec, or when Cisco ISE is integrated with Cisco Catalyst Center, do not configure a PSN as SXP-only. SXP is an interface between Cisco TrustSec and non-Cisco TrustSec devices. SXP does
  not communicate with the Cisco TrustSec-enabled network devices.

### Menu Options Available on Primary and Secondary Nodes

The menu options that are available in Cisco ISE nodes that are a part of a distributed deployment depend on the personas
that are enabled on them. You must perform all administration and monitoring activities through the primary PAN. For other
tasks, you must use the secondary nodes. Therefore, the user interface of the secondary nodes provides limited menu options
based on the persona that is enabled on them.

If a node assumes more than one persona, for example, the Policy Service persona, and a Monitoring persona with a primary
role, the menu options listed for the PSNs and the primary MnT are available on that node.

The following table lists the menu options that are available on the Cisco ISE nodes that assume different personas.

Table 2. Cisco ISE Nodes and Available
Menu Options

| Cisco ISE Node | Available Menu Options |
| --- | --- |
| All Nodes | * View and configure the system time and the NTP server settings. * Install the server certificate and manage certificate signing request. You can perform server certificate operations for all   the nodes in the deployment through the primary PAN that centrally manages all the server certificates.       | **Note** | The private keys are not stored in the local database and are not copied from the relevant node. The private keys are stored in the local file system. |   | --- | --- | |
| Primary Policy Administration node (primary PAN) | All menus and submenus. |
| Primary Monitoring node (primary MnT node) | * Provides access to monitoring data.       | **Note** | The Operations menu can be viewed only from the primary PAN. The Operations menu does not appear in the monitoring nodes. |   | --- | --- | |
| PSNs (Policy Service nodes) | Options to join, leave, and test the Active Directory connection are available. Each PSN must be separately joined to the Active Directory domain. You must first define the domain information and join the PAN to the Active Directory domain. Then, join the other PSNs to the Active Directory domain individually. |
| Secondary Policy Administration node (secondary PAN) | Option to promote the secondary PAN to primary PAN.   | **Note** | After you have registered the secondary nodes to the primary PAN, while logging in to the Admin portal of any of the secondary nodes, you must use the login credentials of the primary PAN. | | --- | --- | |

### General Node Settings

The following table describes the fields on the General Settings window of a Cisco ISE node. In this window, you can assign a persona to a node and configure the services to be run on it.
To view this window, click the Menu icon (![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/440001-450000/440001-441000/440197.jpg)) and choose
Administration > System > Deployment > Deployment Node > Edit > General Settings.

Table 4. General Node Settings

| Field Name | Usage Guidelines |
| --- | --- |
| **Hostname** | Displays the hostname of the Cisco ISE node. |
| **FQDN** | Displays the fully qualified domain name of the Cisco ISE node, for example, ise1.cisco.com. |
| **IP Address** | Displays the IP address of the Cisco ISE node. |
| **Node Type** | Displays the node type. |
| **Personas** | |
| **Administration** | Enable this toggle button if you want a Cisco ISE node to assume the Administration persona. You can enable the Administration persona only on nodes that are licensed to provide the administrative services.  Role: Displays the role that the Administration persona has assumed in the deployment. The persona can take one of these values—Standalone, Primary, or Secondary.  Make Primary: Click this to make this node your primary Cisco ISE node. You can have only one primary Cisco ISE node in a deployment. The other options in this window will become active only after you make this node primary. You can have only two Administration nodes in a deployment. If the node has a  Standalone role, the Make Primary button appears next to it. If the node has a Secondary role, the Promote to Primary button appears next to it. If the node has a Primary role, and there are no other nodes registered with it, the Make Standalone button appears next to it. Click the Make Standalone button to make your primary node a standalone node. |
| **Monitoring** | Click this toggle button if you want a Cisco ISE node to assume the Monitoring persona and function as your log collector. There must be at least one Monitoring node in a distributed deployment. At the time of configuring your primary PAN, you must enable the Monitoring persona. After you register a secondary Monitoring node in your deployment, you can edit the primary PAN and disable the Monitoring persona, if required.  To configure a Cisco ISE node on a VMware platform as your log collector, use the following guidelines to determine the minimum amount of disk space that you need: 180 KB per endpoint in your network per day and 2.5 MB per Cisco ISE node in your network per day.  You can calculate the maximum disk space that you need based on how many months of data you want to have in your Monitoring node. If there is only one Monitoring node in your deployment, it assumes the standalone role. If you have two Monitoring nodes in your deployment, Cisco ISE displays the name of the other Monitoring node too for you to configure the primary-secondary roles. To configure these roles, choose one of the following:   * Primary: For the current node to be the primary Monitoring node. * Secondary: For the current node to be the secondary Monitoring node. * None: If you do not want the Monitoring nodes to assume the primary-secondary roles.   If you configure one of your Monitoring nodes as primary or secondary, the other Monitoring node automatically becomes the secondary or primary node, respectively. Both the primary and secondary Monitoring nodes receive Administration and Policy Service logs. If you change the role for one Monitoring node to None, the role of the other Monitoring node also becomes None, thereby cancelling the high availability pair after you designate a node as a Monitoring node. You will find this node listed as a syslog target in the Remote Logging Targets window. To view this window, click the Menu icon () and choose Administration > System > Logging > Remote Logging Targets. |
| **Policy Service** | Click this toggle button to enable any one or all of the following services:  * Enable Session Services: Check this check box to enable network access, posture, guest, and client-provisioning services. From the Include Node in Node Group drop-down list, choose the group to which this Policy Service node belongs. Note that Certificate Authority (CA) and Enrollment   over Secure Transport (EST) services can only run on a Policy Service node that has session services enabled on it.  For Include Node in Node Group, choose None if you do not want this Policy Service node to be a part of a group.  All the nodes within the same node group should be configured on the network access device (NAD) as RADIUS clients and authorized   for CoA, because any one of them can issue a CoA request for the sessions that are established through any node in the node   group. If you are not using a load balancer, the nodes in a node group should be the same as, or a subset of the RADIUS servers   and clients configured on the NAD. These nodes would also be configured as RADIUS servers.  While a single NAD can be configured with many Cisco ISE nodes as RADIUS servers and dynamic-authorization clients, it is   not necessary for all the nodes to be in the same node group.  The members of a node group should be connected to each other using high-speed LAN connection such as Gigabit Ethernet. The   node group members need not be L2 adjacent, but L2 adjacency is highly recommended to ensure sufficient bandwidth and reachability.   See the [Create a Policy Service Node Group](#ID513 "When two or more PSNs are connected to the same LAN, you can place them in the same node group.") for more details. * Enable Profiling Service: Check this check box to enable the Profiling service. If you enable the Profiling service, you must click the Profiling Configuration tab and enter the details, as required. When you enable or disable any of the services that run on the Policy Service node   or make any changes to this node, you will be restarting the application server processes on which these services run. Expect   a delay while these services restart. You can determine when the application server has restarted on a node by using the **show application status ise** command from the CLI. * Enable Threat-Centric NAC Service: Check this check box to enable the Threat-Centric Network Access Control (TC-NAC) feature. This feature allows you to create   authorization policies based on the threat and vulnerability attributes received from the threat and vulnerability adapters.   Threat severity levels and vulnerability assessment results can be used to dynamically control the access level of an endpoint   or a user. * Enable SXP Service: Check this check box to enable SXP service on the node. You must also specify the interface to be used for SXP service.  If you have configured NIC bonding or teaming, the bonded interfaces are also listed along with the physical interfaces in   the Use Interface drop-down list. * Enable Device Admin Service: Check this check box to create TACACS policy sets, policy results, and so on, to control and audit the configuration of   network devices. * Enable Passive Identity Service: Check this check box to enable the Identity Mapping feature. This feature enables you to monitor users who are authenticated   by a Domain Controller and not by Cisco ISE. In networks where Cisco ISE does not actively authenticate users for network   access, you can use the Identity Mapping feature to collect user authentication information from the Active Directory Domain   Controller. |
| **pxGrid** | Check this check box to enable the pxGrid persona. Cisco pxGrid is used to share the context-sensitive information from the Cisco ISE session directory to other policy network systems such as Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA). The pxGrid framework can also be used to exchange policy and configuration data between nodes, for example, sharing tags and policy objects between Cisco ISE and third-party vendors, and for non-Cisco ISE-related information exchanges such as threat information. |

### Remote Logging Target Settings

The following table describes the fields in the Remote Logging Targets window that you can use to create external locations (syslog servers) to store logging messages. To access this window, Administration > System > Logging > Remote Logging Targets, and  click Add.

Table 6. Remote Logging Target
Settings

| Field Name | Usage Guidelines |
| --- | --- |
| Name | Enter a name for the new syslog target. |
| Target Type | Select the target type from the drop-down list. The default value is UDP Syslog. |
| Description | Enter a brief description of the new target. |
| IP Address | Enter the IP address or hostname of the destination machine that will store the logs. Cisco ISE supports IPv4 and IPv6 formats for logging. |
| Port | Enter the port number of the destination machine. |
| Facility Code | Choose the syslog facility code that must be used for logging, from the drop-down list. Valid options are Local0 through Local7. |
| Maximum Length | Enter the maximum length of the remote log target messages. Valid values are from 200 through 1024 bytes. |
| Include Alarms For this Target | When you check this check box, alarm messages are sent to the remote server as well. |
| Comply to RFC 3164 | When you check this check box, the delimiters (, ; { } \ \) in the syslog messages sent to the remote servers are not escaped even if a backslash (\) is used. |
| Buffer Message When Server Down | This check box is displayed when you choose TCP Syslog or Secure Syslog from the Target Type drop-down list. Check this check box to allow Cisco ISE to buffer the syslog messages when a TCP syslog target or secure syslog target is unavailable. Cisco ISE retries sending messages to the target when the connection to the target resumes. After the connection resumes, messages are sent sequentially, starting with the oldest, and proceeding to the newest. Buffered messages are always sent before new messages. If the buffer is full, old messages are discarded. |
| Buffer Size (MB) | Set the buffer size for each target. By default, it is set to 100 MB. Changing the buffer size clears the buffer, and all the existing buffered messages for the specific target are lost. |
| Reconnect Timeout (Sec) | Enter the time (in seconds) to configure how long the TCP and secure syslogs are stored for before being discarded when the server is down. |
| Select CA Certificate | This drop-down list is displayed when you choose Secure Syslog from the Target Type drop-down list. Choose a client certificate from the drop-down list. |
| Ignore Server Certificate Validation | This check box is displayed when you choose Secure Syslog from the Target Type drop-down list. Check this check box for Cisco ISE to ignore server certificate authentication and accept any syslog server. By default, this option is set to Off unless the system is in FIPS mode when this is disabled. |

#### Configure Client Authentication for Secure Syslog Target Connections

From Cisco ISE Release 3.3, client authentication is mandatory when a client tries to connect to a secure syslog target. For
client authentication, you must import the certificate to be shared with the Cisco ISE server into the Cisco ISE Trusted Certificate
Store. This trusted certificate must contain the client hostname in the common name (CN) or subject alternative name (SAN)
fields.

If you have two standalone Cisco ISE nodes where one is the client and the other is the remote syslog target, carry out the
following steps. In this example, 10.0.0.1 is the client and 10.0.0.2 is the remote syslog target:

1. In 10.0.0.1, in the Remote Logging Targets window, configure a new remote syslog target with the **Host/IP Address** field filled as **10.0.0.2**.
2. In 10.0.0.2, in the Remote Logging Targets window, enable the default SecureSyslogCollector.
3. Upload a trusted certificate for 10.0.0.1 into the Trusted Certificate store of 10.0.0.2.

   * In the remote syslog target configuration in 10.0.0.1, if you choose the self-signed certificate in the Select CA Certificate field, then upload this self-signed certificate as the trusted certificate in 10.0.0.2.
   * In the remote syslog target configuration in 10.0.0.1, if you choose a third-party CA certificate in the Select CA Certificate field upload the chain of root CA certificate and CA-signed certificate as the trusted certificate in 10.0.0.2
4. Upload a trusted certificate for 10.0.0.2 into the Trusted Certificate store of 10.0.0.1.

   * In the remote syslog target configuration in 10.0.0.2, if you choose the self-signed certificate in the Select CA Certificate
     field, upload the self-signed certificate as the trusted certificate in 10.0.0.1.
   * In the remote syslog target configuration in 10.0.0.2, if you choose a third-party CA certificate in the Select CA Certificate
     field upload the chain of root CA certificate and CA-signed certificate as the trusted certificate in 10.0.0.1
5. 10.0.0.2 sends the configured certificate, either self-signed on CA-signed, to 10.0.0.1 for authentication.
6. 10.0.0.1 receives the certificate from 10.0.0.2 and responds with the configured trusted certificate to complete the authentication
   workflow.

### Configure Logging Categories

The following table describes the fields that you can use to configure a logging category. Set a log severity level and choose
the logging targets for the logs of a logging category. To access this window, choose Administration > System > Logging > Logging Categories.

For some logging categories, you can choose one of the following severity levels from a drop-down list:   * FATAL: Emergency level. This level means that you cannot use Cisco ISE and you must immediately take the necessary action. * ERROR: This level indicates a critical error condition. * WARN: This level indicates a normal but significant condition. This is the default level set for many logging categories. * INFO: This level indicates an informational message. * DEBUG: This level indicates a diagnostic bug message. |
| Local Logging | Check this check box to enable logging events for a category on the local node. |
| Targets | This area allows you to choose the targets for a logging category by transferring the targets between the Available and the Selected areas using the left and right arrow icons.  The Available area contains the existing logging targets, both local (predefined) and external (user-defined).  The Selected area, which is initially empty, then displays the targets that have been chosen for the category. |

### High Availability for Administrative Node

In a high-availability configuration, the primary Policy Administration Node (PAN) is in the Active state. The secondary PAN
is in the Standby state, which means it receives all configuration updates from the primary PAN, but is not active in the
Cisco ISE network.

Cisco ISE supports manual and automatic failover. With automatic failover, when the primary PAN goes down, an automatic promotion
of the secondary PAN is initiated. Automatic failover requires a nonadministration secondary node, which is called a health
check node. The health check node checks the health of the primary PAN. If the health check node detects that the primary
PAN is down or unreachable, it initiates the promotion of the secondary PAN to take over the primary role.

To deploy the Automatic Failover feature, you must have at least three nodes, with two of them assuming the Administration
persona, and one acting as the health check node. A health check node is a nonadministration node and can be a PSN, MnT, or
pxGrid node, or a combination of these. If the primary and secondary PANs are in different data centers, you must have a health
check node for each PAN.

The following table lists the features that are affected when the primary PAN goes down and the secondary PAN is yet to take
over.

Table 10. Availability of Features

| Feature Name | Available When Primary PAN is Down? (Yes/No) |
| --- | --- |
| Existing internal user RADIUS authentication | Yes |
| Existing or new AD user RADIUS authentication | Yes |
| Existing endpoint with no profile change | Yes |
| Existing endpoint with profile change | No |
| New endpoint learned through profiling. | No |
| Existing guest: Local Web Authentication (LWA) | Yes |
| Existing guest: Central Web Authentication (CWA) | Yes (apart from flows enabled for device registration, such as Hotspot, BYOD, and CWA with automatic device registration) |
| Guest change password | No |
| Guest: AUP | No |
| Guest: Max Failed Login Enforcement | No |
| New Guest (Sponsored or Self-registered) | No |
| Posture | Yes |
| BYOD with Internal CA | No |
| Existing Registered Devices | Yes |
| MDM on-boarding | No |
| pxGrid Service | No |
| System 360 - Monitoring | No |
| System 360 – Log Analytics | No (When the Primary PAN also has a Secondary MNT persona) |
| Log in to GUI of secondary nodes | Yes (The login process is delayed because a blocking call to the PAN is attempted to update the last login details. Login proceeds after this call times out.) |

| **Note** | ---  * Authentication response time increases when the rate of incoming PSN authentications exceeds 100 per second while the PAN   is down. * Actions must be taken to bring the PAN back into deployment within 12 hours.  --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---   To support certificate provisioning with the internal CA, you must to import the root certificate of the original primary PAN and its key into the new primary node, after promotion. Certificate provisioning does not work after automatic failover for the PSN nodes that are added after the promotion of the secondary node to primary PAN.   --- |
| --- | --- |

### High-Availability Health Check Nodes

The health check node for the Primary PAN is called the active health check node. The health check node for the Secondary
PAN is called the passive health check node. The active health check node is responsible for checking the status of the Primary
PAN, and managing the automatic failover of Administration nodes. We recommend that you use two nonadministrative ISE nodes
as health check nodes, one for the Primary PAN and one for the Secondary PAN. If you use only one health check node, and that
node goes down, automatic failover will not happen.

When both the PANs are in the same data center, you can use a single nonadministrative ISE node as the health check node for
both the Primary PAN and the Secondary PAN. When a single health check node checks the health of both the Primary PAN and
the Secondary PAN, it assumes both the active and passive roles.

A health check node is a nonadministration node, which means it can be a Policy Service, Monitoring, or pxGrid node, or a
combination of these. We recommend that you designate PSN nodes as health check nodes in the same data center as the Administration
nodes. However, in a small or a centralized deployment, where the two Administration nodes are not in the same location (LAN
or data center), any node (PSN, pxGrid, or MnT) not having the Administration persona can be used as the health check node.

| **Note** | ---   If you chose to not enable automatic failover, and rely on manually promoting the secondary node when the primary PAN fails, you do not need any check nodes.   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Health Check Node for the Secondary PAN

The health check node for the Secondary PAN is a passive monitor. It does not take any action until the Secondary PAN has
been promoted as the Primary PAN. When the Secondary PAN takes over the primary role, its associated health check node takes
the active role for managing automatic failover of Administration nodes. The health check node of the previous Primary PAN
becomes the health check node for the Secondary PAN now and monitors it passively.

#### Disabling and Restarting Health Check

When a node is removed from the health check role or auto failover configuration is disabled, the health check service is
stopped on that node. When the auto failover configuration is enabled on the designated high-availability health check node,
the node starts checking the health of Administration nodes again. Designating or removing the high-availability health check
role of a node does not involve any application restart on that node; only the health check activities are started or stopped.

If the high-availability health check node is restarted, it ignores the previous downtimes of the Primary PAN and starts checking
the health status afresh.

### Health Check Nodes

The active health check node checks the health status of the primary PAN at a configured polling interval. It sends a request
to the primary PAN, and if the response that it receives matches the configuration, the health check node considers the primary
PAN to be in good health. If the health of the primary PAN is continuously poor for more than the configured failover period,
the health check node initiates failover to the secondary PAN.

If, at any time during a health check, the health status is found to be good after being reported as poor previously within
the failover period, the health check node marks the primary PAN status as good, and resets the health check cycle.

The response from the health check of the primary PAN is validated against the configuration values available on its health
check node. If the response does not match, it raises an alarm. However, a promotion request is made to the secondary PAN.

#### Changing Health Nodes

You can change the Cisco ISE node that you are using for a health check, but there are some things to consider.

For example, assume that the health check node (H1) goes out-of-sync, and another node (H2) is made the health check node
of the primary PAN. In such a case, after the primary PAN goes down, there is no way for H1 to know that another node (H2)
is checking the same primary PAN. Later, if H2 goes down or goes out of the network, an actual failover is required. The secondary
PAN, however, retains the right to reject the promotion request. So, after the secondary PAN is promoted to the primary role,
a promotion request from H2 is rejected with an error. Even if a health check node for the primary PAN is out of sync, it
continues to check the health of the primary PAN.

### Automatic Failover to the Secondary PAN

You can configure Cisco ISE to automatically promote the Secondary PAN when the Primary PAN becomes unavailable. The configuration
is done on the Primary PAN in the Deployment window. To view this window, click the Menu icon (![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/440001-450000/440001-441000/440197.jpg)) and choose
Administration > System > Deployment. The failover period is defined as the number of times configured in Number of Failure Polls Before Failover times the number of seconds configured in Polling Interval. In the default configuration, that time is 10 minutes. Promotion of the Secondary PAN to Primary PAN takes another 10 minutes.
So, by default, the total time from Primary PAN failure to secondary PAN working is 20 minutes.

When the Secondary PAN receives the failover call, it carries out the following validations before proceeding with the actual
failover:

* The Primary PAN is not available in the network.
* The failover request came from a valid health check node.
* The failover request is for the Secondary PAN.

If all the validations pass, the Secondary PAN promotes itself to the primary role.

The following are some sample (but not limited to) scenarios where automatic failover of the Secondary PAN can be attempted:

* Health of the Primary PAN is consistently not good for the Number of failure polls before failover value during the polling period.
* Cisco ISE services on the Primary PAN are manually stopped, and remain stopped for the failover period.
* The Primary PAN is shut down using soft halt or reboot option, and remains shut down for the configured failover period.
* The Primary PAN goes down abruptly (power down), and remains down for the failover period.
* The network interface of the Primary PAN is down (network port shut or network service down), or it is not reachable by the
  health check node for any other reason, and remains down for the configured failover period.

#### Health Check Node Restarts

Upon restart, the high-availability health check node ignores the previous downtimes of the Primary PAN and checks the health
status afresh.

#### Bring Your Own Device in Case of Automatic Failover to Secondary PAN

When the Primary PAN is down, authentication is not interrupted for the endpoints that already have certificates issued by
the Primary PAN root CA chain. This is because all the nodes in the deployment have the entire certificate chain for trust
and validation purposes.

However, until the Secondary PAN is promoted to Primary, new BYOD devices will not be onboarded. BYOD onboarding requires
an active Primary PAN.

After the original primary PAN is brought back up or the Secondary PAN is promoted, new BYOD endpoints are onboarded without
any issues.

If the Primary PAN that failed can not be rejoined as the Primary PAN, regenerate the root CA certificate on the newly promoted
Primary PAN (the original secondary PAN).

For existing certificate chains, triggering a new root CA certificate results in the automatic generation of the subordinate
CA certificates. Even when new subordinate certificates are generated, endpoint certificates that were generated by the previous
chain continue to be valid.

### Sample Scenarios when Automatic Failover is Avoided

The following are some sample scenarios that depict cases where automatic failover by the health check node might be avoided
or a promotion request to the secondary node rejected:

* The node receiving the promotion request is not the secondary node.
* The promotion request received by the Secondary PAN does not have the correct Primary PAN information.
* The promotion request is received from an incorrect health check node.
* The promotion request is received, but the Primary PAN is up and in good health.
* The node receiving the promotion request goes out-of-sync.

### Functionalities Affected by the PAN Automatic Failover Feature

The following table lists the functionalities that are blocked or require additional configuration changes if the PAN automatic
failover configuration is enabled in your deployment.

| Functionality | Affected Details |
| --- | --- |
| Operations that are Blocked | |
| Upgrade | Upgrade through the CLI is blocked.  By default, this feature is disabled.  To deploy the Automatic Failover feature, you must have at least three nodes, where two of the nodes assume the Administration persona, and one node acts as the health check node. (A health check node is a nonadministration node and can be a PSN, MnT, or pxGrid node, or a combination of these). If the PANs are in different data centers, you must have a health check node for each PAN. |
| Restore of Backup | Restore action through the CLI and user interface is blocked.  If the PAN automatic failover configuration was enabled prior to restore, you must reconfigure it after a successful restore. |
| Change Node Persona | Change of the following node personas through the GUI is blocked:   * Administration persona in both the Primary and Secondary PANs * Persona of the PAN * Deregistration of health check node after enabling the PAN Automatic Failover feature |
| Other CLI Operations | The following admin operations through the CLI is blocked:   * Patch installation and rollback * DNS server change * IP   address change of eth1, eth2, and eth3 interfaces * Host   alias change of eth1, eth2, and eth3 interfaces * Time zone change |
| Other Administration Portal Operations | The following administrative operations through the GUI is blocked:   * Patch installation and rollback * Change of HTTPS certificate * Change of admin authentication type from password-based authentication to certificate-based authentication and vice versa |
| Users with maximum connected devices cannot connect. | Some session data is stored on the failed PAN, and cannot be updated by the PSN. |
| Operations that Require PAN Automatic Failover to be Disabled | |
| CLI Operations | The following administrative operations through the CLI display a warning message if the PAN automatic failover configuration is enabled. These operations may trigger automatic failover if a service or system is not restarted within the failover window. Hence, while performing the following operations, we recommend that you to disable the PAN automatic failover configuration:   * Manually stopping the Cisco ISE service * Soft reload (reboot) of Cisco ISE using the admin CLI |

### Configure Primary PAN for Automatic Failover

#### Before you begin

To deploy the Automatic Failover feature, you must have at least three nodes, of which two nodes assume the Administration
persona, and one node acts as the health check node. A health check node is a nonadministration node and can be a PSN, MnT,
or pxGrid node, or a combination of these. If the PANs are in different data centers, you must have a health check node for
each PAN.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Log in to the Primary PAN GUI. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon () and choose Administration > System > Deployment > PAN Failover. |
| **Step 3** | Check the Enable PAN Auto Failover check box to enable automatic failover of the primary PAN.   | **Note** | You can only promote a Secondary PAN to become the Primary PAN. Cisco ISE nodes that assume only the PSN, MnT, or pxGrid node, or a combination of these, cannot be promoted to become the Primary PAN. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 4** | Choose the health check node for the primary PAN from the Primary Health Check Node drop-down list containing all the available secondary nodes.  We recommend that you have this node in the same location or data center as the primary PAN. |
| **Step 5** | Choose the health check node for the secondary PAN, from the Secondary Health Check Node drop-down list containing all the available secondary nodes.  We recommend that you have this node in the same location or data center as the secondary PAN. |
| **Step 6** | Provide the Polling Interval time after which the PAN status is checked. The valid range is 30 to 300 seconds. |
| **Step 7** | Provide the count for Number of Failure Polls before Failover.  Failover occurs if the status of the PAN is not good for the specified number of failure polls. The valid range is 2 to 60 counts. |
| **Step 8** | Click Save. |

---

#### What to do next

After the promotion of the Secondary PAN to the Primary PAN, do the following:

* Manually sync the old Primary PAN to bring it back into the deployment.
* Manually sync any other secondary node that is outof sync, to bring it back into the deployment.

### Manually Promote Secondary PAN to Primary

If the Primary PAN fails and you have not configured PAN automatic failover, you must manually promote the Secondary PAN to become the new Primary PAN.

#### Before you begin

Ensure that you have a second Cisco ISE node configured with the Administration persona to promote as your Primary PAN.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Log in to the Secondary PAN GUI. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon () and choose Administration  >  System  >  Deployment. |
| **Step 3** | In the Edit Node window, click Promote to Primary.   | **Note** | You can only promote a secondary PAN to become the primary PAN. Cisco ISE nodes that assume only the Policy Service or Monitoring persona, or both, cannot be promoted to become the primary PAN. | | --- | --- |    If the node that was originally the Primary PAN, comes back up, it will be demoted automatically and become the Secondary PAN. You must perform a manual synchronization on this node (that was originally the Primary PAN) to bring it back into the deployment.  In the Edit Node window of a secondary node, you cannot modify the personas or services because the options are disabled. You have to log in to the Admin portal to make changes. |
| **Step 4** | Click Save. |

### Reusing a Node of an Existing Cisco ISE Deployment as a Primary PAN for a New Cisco ISE Deployment

If you want to repurpose a node of an existing Cisco ISE deployment to the primary PAN of a new Cisco ISE deployment you must,
perform these steps:

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Run the Cisco ISE Perform System Erase utility, as described in the *Cisco ISE Installation Guide* for your version of Cisco ISE. This document is available at: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/security/identity-services-engine/products-installation-guides-list.html> |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Perform a fresh install of Cisco ISE, as described in the *Cisco ISE Installation Guide*. |
| **Step 3** | Configure the standalone node as a primary Policy Administration node, as described in [Configure a Primary Policy Administration Node](#ID330 "To set up a distributed deployment, you must first configure a Cisco ISE node as your primary PAN."). |

---

### Restoring Service to the Primary PAN

Cisco ISE does not support automatic fallback to the original primary PAN. After the automatic failover to the secondary
PAN is initiated, if you bring the original primary PAN back into the network, you should configure it as the secondary PAN.

## Support for Automatic Failover for the Administration Node

Cisco ISE supports automatic failover for the Administration persona. To enable the Automatic Failover feature, at least
two nodes in your distributed setup should assume the Administration persona and one node should assume the nonadministration
persona. If the Primary PAN goes down, an automatic promotion of the Secondary PAN is initiated. For this, a nonadministration
secondary node is designated as the health check node for each of the PANs. The health check node checks the health of the
primary PAN at configured intervals. If the health check response received for the primary PAN is not good for reasons, such
as the device being down or unreachable, the health check node initiates the promotion of the secondary PAN to take over the
primary role after waiting for the configured threshold value. Some features are unavailable after automatic failover of the
secondary PAN. Cisco ISE does not support fallback to the original primary PAN. See [High Availability for the Administration Nodes](#ID59 "In a high-availability configuration, the primary PAN is in the active state and the secondary PAN is in the standby state.").

## Policy Service Node

A Policy Service node (PSN) is a Cisco ISE node with the Policy Service persona, and provides network access, posture, guest
access, client provisioning, and profiling services.

At least one node in your distributed setup should assume the Policy Service persona. This persona evaluates the policies
and makes all the decisions. Typically, there is more than one PSN in a distributed deployment.

All the PSNs that reside in the same high-speed Local Area Network (LAN) or behind a load balancer can be grouped together
to form a node group. If one of the nodes in a node group fails, the other nodes detect the failure and reset URL-redirected
sessions, if any.

* [High Availability in Policy Service Nodes](#ID67)
* [Load Balancer to Distribute Requests Evenly Among PSNs](#concept_FCF3371A3F2F460DB7B5107F9E0B8F0D)
* [Session Failover in Policy Service Nodes](#concept_6D26AEAD132A45DB91C51ED0B8890746)
* [Number of Nodes in a Policy Service Node Group](#ID84)
* [Light Data Distribution](#Cisco_Concept.dita_986b9117-b102-40d6-954e-6beccfd7bd06)
* [RADIUS Session Directory](#Cisco_Concept.dita_e682e614-daaa-471f-bace-2657df5eeb24)
* [Endpoint Owner Directory](#id_124200)

### High Availability in Policy Service Nodes

To detect node failure and to reset all URL-redirected sessions on the failed node, two or more PSNs can be placed in the
same node group. When a node that belongs to a node group fails, another node in the same node group issues a Change of Authorization
(CoA) for all URL-redirected sessions on the failed node.

All the nodes within the same node group should be configured on the network access device (NAD) as RADIUS clients and authorized
for CoA, because any one of them can issue a CoA request for the sessions that are established through any node in the node
group. If you are not using a load balancer, the nodes in a node group should be the same as, or a subset of, the RADIUS servers
and clients configured on the NAD. These nodes should also be configured as RADIUS servers.

| **Note** | ---   While a single NAD can be configured with many Cisco ISE nodes as RADIUS servers and dynamicauthorization clients, it is not necessary for all the nodes to be in the same node group.   --- |
| --- | --- |

The members of a node group should be connected to each other using high-speed LAN connection such as Gigabit Ethernet. The
node group members need not be L2 adjacent, but L2 adjacency is highly recommended to ensure sufficient bandwidth and reachability.
See [Create a Policy Service Node Group](#ID513 "When two or more PSNs are connected to the same LAN, you can place them in the same node group.") for more details.

### Load Balancer to Distribute Requests Evenly Among PSNs

When you have multiple PSNs in the deployment, you can use a load balancer to distribute the requests evenly. The load balancer
distributes the requests to the functional nodes behind it. See [Cisco and F5 Deployment Guide: ISE Load Balancing using BIG-IP](https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/security/ise/how_to/HowTo-95-Cisco_and_F5_Deployment_Guide-ISE_Load_Balancing_Using_BIG-IP.pdf) for more information, and to know about best practices when deploying PSNs behind a load balancer.

### Session Failover in Policy Service Nodes

PSNs in a node group share session information. The nodes exchange heartbeat messages to detect node failures. If a node fails,
one of its peers from the node group knows which sessions were on the failed PSN, and issues a CoA to disconnect those sessions.
Most clients automatically reconnect, and establish a new session.

Some clients don’t automatically reconnect. For example, if a client connects through a VPN, then that client may not see
the CoA. Clients that are IP phones, multihost 802.1X ports, or virtual machines may also not see or be able to respond to
a CoA. URL-redirected clients (webauth) also can’t connect automatically. Those clients must manually reconnect.

Timing issues can also prevent reconnection, for example, if the posture state is pending at the time of PSN failover.

For more information about PSN session sharing, see [Light Data Distribution](#Cisco_Concept.dita_986b9117-b102-40d6-954e-6beccfd7bd06 "Light Data Distribution eliminates the need to be dependent on the PAN or MnT nodes for user session details.").

### Number of Nodes in a Policy Service Node Group

The number of nodes that you
can have in a node group depends on your deployment requirements. Node groups
ensure that node failures are detected and that a peer issues a CoA for
sessions that are authorized, but not yet postured. The size of the node group
does not have to be very large.

If the size of the node group increases, the number of messages and heartbeats that are exchanged between the nodes increases
significantly. As a result, traffic also increases. Having fewer nodes in a node group helps reduce the traffic and at the
same time provides sufficient redundancy to detect PSN failures.

There is no hard limit on the number of PSNs that you can have in a node group cluster.

### Light Data Distribution

Light Data Distribution is used to store user session information and replicate it across the PSNs in a deployment, thereby
eliminating the need to be dependent on the PAN or MnT nodes for user session details.

Light Data Distribution consists of the following directories:

* [RADIUS Session Directory](#Cisco_Concept.dita_e682e614-daaa-471f-bace-2657df5eeb24 "This directory stores only the session attributes that are required for CoA.")
* [Endpoint Owner Directory](#id_124200 "The endpoint ownership now changes only in case of a successful RADIUS authentication of that endpoint on another PSN.")

In addition, you can configure the following options under **Advanced Settings**:

* **Batch Size**: The session updates can be sent in batches. This value specifies the number of records sent in each batch from a Light Data
  Distribution instance to the other PSNs in the deployment. If this field is set to 1, the session updates are *not* sent in batches. The default value is 10 records.
* **TTL**: This value specifies the maximum time a session will wait for a batch to complete before updating the Light Data Distribution.
  The default value is 1000 milliseconds.

In case of connectivity issues between the PSNs, for example, when a PSN is down, the session details are retrieved from the
MnT session directory and stored for future use.

Large deployments can hold up to 2,000,000 session records. Small deployments can store 1,000,000 session records. When an
accounting stop request is received for a session, the corresponding session data is deleted from all Light Data Distribution
instances. When the number of stored records exceeds the maximum limit, the oldest sessions are deleted based on the timestamp.

| **Note** | ---  * If the IPv6 prefix length of a session is less than 128 bits and the interface ID is not specified, the IPv6 prefix is rejected,   thereby preventing multiple sessions from having the same key. * Light Data Distribution uses Cisco ISE messaging services for inter-node communication. Cisco ISE Release 3.0 and later support Certificate Signing Request generation for Cisco ISE Messaging Service. Thus, Cisco   ISE Release 3.0 and later have both internal and external CA support for ISE Messaging Service. If you face issues with the Cisco ISE messaging service, you have to regenerate Cisco ISE messaging service certificate. * 1. In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon () and choose      Administration > System > Certificates > Certificate Management > Certificate Signing Requests   2. In the Certificate(s) will be used for section, select ISE Messaging service.   3. Click Generate ISE messaging service certificate.  --- |
| --- | --- |

### RADIUS Session Directory

The RADIUS Session Directory is used to store the user session information and replicate it across the PSNs in a deployment. This directory stores only
the session attributes that are required for CoA.

This functionality is enabled by default from Cisco ISE Release 2.7. You can enable or disable this functionality, by checking
or unchecking the RADIUS Session Directory check box in the Light Data Distribution window. To view this window, click the Menu icon (![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/440001-450000/440001-441000/440197.jpg)) and choose
Administration > System > Settings > Light Data Distribution.

### Endpoint Owner Directory

Until Cisco ISE Release 2.6, when an endpoint probe is received on a Policy Service node (PSN) that is different from the
one that originally handled the requests for that specific endpoint, the endpoint owner is changed to the new PSN. This results
in endpoint ownership flapping.

From Cisco ISE Release 2.7, the Endpoint Owner Directory is used to store the PSN FQDN of each MAC address connecting to Cisco ISE and to replicate this data across the PSNs in a
deployment. This avoids endpoint ownership flapping because all the PSNs are now aware of all the endpoint owners. The endpoint
ownership now changes only in case of a successful RADIUS authentication of that endpoint on another PSN.

In addition, the static endpoint assignments are prioritized over the attributes received by an incoming probe for the same
endpoint, avoiding attribute override issues.

This feature is enabled by default from Cisco ISE Release 2.7. If required, you can disable it to fall back to the old mechanism
of not using the endpoint owner directory. The Endpoint Owner Directory is also used in profiling, and disabling this option will use the legacy profiler owner's directory. You can enable or disable
this feature by checking or unchecking the Enable Endpoint Owner Directory check box in the Light Data Distribution window. (To view this window, click the Menu icon (![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/440001-450000/440001-441000/440197.jpg)) and choose
Administration > System > Settings > Light Data Distribution).

## Monitoring Node

A Cisco ISE node with the Monitoring persona functions as the log collector and stores log messages from the PANs and PSNs
in your network. This persona provides advanced monitoring and troubleshooting tools that you can use to effectively manage
your network and resources. A node with this persona aggregates and correlates the data that it collects to provide you with
meaningful information in the form of reports.

Cisco ISE allows you to have a maximum of two nodes with this persona that can take on primary or secondary roles for high
availability. Both the primary and secondary MnT nodes collect log messages. If the primary MnT goes down, the primary PAN
points to the secondary node to gather monitoring data. But the secondary node will not be promoted to primary automatically.
This should be done by following the procedure described in [manually modifying the Monitoring and Troubleshooting (MnT) role](#id_94618 "You can manually modify MnT roles from the primary PAN.").

At least one node in your distributed setup should assume the Monitoring persona. We recommend that you do not have the Monitoring
and Policy Service personas enabled on the same Cisco ISE node, and that the node be dedicated solely to monitoring, for optimum
performance.

You can access the Monitoring
menu from the PAN
in your deployment.

| **Note** | ---   If you have enabled pxGrid, you must create a new certificate for the pxGrid node. Create the certificate template with digital signature usage and generate a new PxGrid certificate.   --- |

* [Syslog over Cisco ISE Messaging Service](#id_100229)
* [Automatic Failover in MnT Nodes](#ID95)

### Manually Modify the MnT Role

You can manually modify MnT roles (both from primary to secondary and from secondary to primary) from the primary PAN.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Log in to the primary PAN GUI. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon () and choose Administration  >  System  >  Deployment. |
| **Step 3** | From the list of nodes, check the check box next to the MnT node for which you want to change the role. |
| **Step 4** | Click Edit. |
| **Step 5** | In the Monitoring section, change the role to Primary or Secondary.  You can enable the Dedicated MnT option if you want to disable all the other personas and services enabled on that node. When this option is enabled, the configuration data replication process is stopped on that node. This helps to improve the performance of the MnT node. When you disable this option, manual synchronization is triggered. |
| **Step 6** | Click Save. |

### Syslog over Cisco ISE Messaging Service

Cisco ISE, Release 2.6, offers MnT WAN survivability for the default, built-in UDP syslog collection targets, LogCollector
and LogCollector2. This survivability can be enabled by the option Use "ISE Messaging Service" for UDP Syslogs delivery to MnT (In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon (![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/440001-450000/440001-441000/440197.jpg)) and choose
System > Logging > Log Settings). After you enable this option, the UDP syslogs are protected by Transport Layer Security (TLS).

The Use "ISE Messaging Service" for UDP Syslogs delivery to MnT option is disabled by default in Cisco ISE, Release 2.6, First Customer Ship (FCS). This option is enabled by default in
Cisco ISE, Release 2.6, Cumulative Patch 2 and later releases.

Using the Cisco ISE messaging service for UDP syslogs retains the operational data for a finite duration even when the MnT
node is unreachable. The MnT WAN survivability period is approximately 2 hours and 30 mins.

This service uses TCP port 8671. Please configure your network accordingly and allow the connections to TCP port 8671 on each
Cisco ISE node from all other Cisco ISE nodes in the deployment.

| **Note** | ---   If your deployment uses TCP or secure syslogs for Cisco ISE deployment, the functionality remains same as the earlier releases.  We recommend defining the UDP syslog target using the IP address. This avoids the latencies encountered while defining UDP syslog targets using the DNS name or DNS server.   --- |

**Queue Link Alarm**

The Cisco ISE messaging service uses a different certificate, signed by the internal CA chain. You will get a `queue-link alarm` message in the Alarms dashlet in the Cisco ISE GUI dashboard. Ensure that the following are in place to resolve the alarm:

* All the nodes are connected and synced.
* All the nodes and Cisco ISE messaging services are functional.
* The Cisco ISE messaging services ports are not blocked by external entities such as firewalls.
* The Cisco ISE messaging certificate chain on each node is not broken, and the state of the certificate is good.

To resolve the queue link alarm, regenerate the Cisco ISE root CA chain:

1. In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon (![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/440001-450000/440001-441000/440197.jpg)) and choose
   Administration > System > Certificates > Certificate Management > Certificate Signing Requests.
2. Click  Generate Certificate Signing Request (CSR) and then select the  ISE Root CA in the Certificate(s) will be used for drop-down list.
3. Click Replace ISE root CA Certificate Chain.

A Queue Link Error alarm is generated in the following scenarios:

* Timeout: A Queue Link Error alarm with the cause as Timeout occurs when there is a network issue between two nodes in the Cisco ISE deployment. Check the connectivity on port 8671 to
  troubleshoot this error.
* Unknown CA: A Queue Link Error alarm with the cause as Unknown CA occurs when when there is a broken Cisco ISE Messaging Certificate present in the System Certificates window (To view this window, click the Menu icon (![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/440001-450000/440001-441000/440197.jpg)) and choose
  Administration > System > Certificates > System Certificates.) This issue can be resolved by regenerating the Cisco ISE Messaging Certificate by choosing Administration > System > Certificates > Certificate Management > Certificate Signing Requests and then clicking on Generate Certificate Signing Request (CSR) on the Cisco ISE GUI.

  | **Note** | ---   Regeneration is not required if you have already replaced the Cisco ISE root CA certificate chain.   --- |
  | --- | --- |

When you replace the Cisco ISE Root CA chain, the Cisco ISE Messaging Service certificate is also replaced. This is followed
by the restart of the Cisco ISE Messaging service with a downtime of about two minutes. The syslogs are lost during this downtime.
To avoid losing the syslogs during the downtime, the Cisco ISE Messaging Service can be disabled for a short period.

To enable or disable the Cisco ISE messaging service for UDP syslogs delivery to MnT, perform this procedure:

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon () and choose System > Logging > Log Settings. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Check or uncheck the Use “ISE Messaging Service” for UDP Syslogs delivery to MnT check box to enable or disable the use of the Cisco ISE Messaging Service. |
| **Step 3** | Click Save. |

---

### Automatic Failover in MnT Nodes

MnT nodes do not offer high availablity, but do offer active standby. The PSN copies operational audit data to both the primary
and secondary MnT nodes.

#### Automatic Failover Process

When a primary MnT node goes down, the secondary MnT node takes over all the monitoring and troubleshooting information.

To manually convert the secondary node to a primary node, see  [promote the secondary node to a primary role](#id_94618 "You can manually modify MnT roles from the primary PAN."). If the primary node comes up again after the secondary node is promoted, the primary node takes on the secondary role. If
the secondary node is not promoted, the primary MnT node resumes the primary role after it comes up again.

| **Caution** | ---   When the primary node comes back up after a failover, back up of the secondary and restore the data to update the primary node.   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Guidelines for Setting Up an Active Standby Pair of MnT Nodes

You can specify two MnT nodes on a Cisco ISE network, and configure them to be an active standby pair. We recommend that you
back up the primary MnT node, and restore the data to the new secondary MnT node. This ensures that the history of the primary
MnT node is synchronized with the new secondary node because the primary replicates new data. The following rules apply to
an active standby pair:

* All changes are logged to the primary MnT node. The secondary node is read-only.
* Changes made to the primary node are automatically replicated on the secondary node
* Both the primary and secondary nodes are listed as log collectors, to which all other nodes send logs.
* The Cisco ISE dashboard is the main entry point for monitoring and troubleshooting. Monitoring information is displayed on
  the dashboard from the PAN
  . If the primary node goes down, monitoring information is available on the secondary node.
* Backing up and purging MnT data is not a part of a standard Cisco ISE node backup process. You must configure repositories
  for backup and data purging on both the primary and secondary MnT nodes, and use the same repositories for each.

#### MnT Node Failover Scenarios

The following scenarios apply to the active-standby or single-node configurations corresponding to the MnT nodes:

* In an active-standby configuration of the MnT nodes, the primary PAN always points to the primary MnT node to collect the
  monitoring data. After the primary MnT node fails, the PAN points to the standby MnT node. The failover from the primary node
  to the secondary node takes place after it is down for more than five minutes.

  However, after the primary node fails, the secondary node does not become the primary node. If the primary node comes up,
  the PAN starts collecting the monitoring data again from the resumed primary node.
* If the primary MnT node is down, and you want to promote the standby MnT node to active status, you can do so by following
  the procedure provided in [manually modifying MnT role](#id_94618 "You can manually modify MnT roles from the primary PAN.") or by deregistering the existing primary MnT node. When you deregister the existing primary MnT node, the standby node becomes
  the primary MnT node, and the PAN automatically points to the newly promoted primary node.
* In an active-standby pair, if you deregister the secondary MnT node, or if the secondary MnT node goes down, the existing
  primary MnT node remains the current primary node.
* If there is only one MnT node in the Cisco ISE deployment, then that node acts as the primary MnT node, and provides monitoring
  data to the PAN. However, when you register a new MnT node, and make it the primary node in the deployment, the existing primary
  MnT node automatically becomes the standby node. The PAN points to the newly registered primary MnT node to collect monitoring
  data.

## Monitoring Database

The rate and amount of data that is utilized by the monitoring functions requires a separate database on a dedicated node
that is used for these purposes.

Like PSN, the MnT node has a dedicated database that requires you to perform maintenance tasks, as described in the topics
covered in this section.

* [Back Up and Restore the Monitoring Database](#ID1268)
* [Monitoring Database Purge](#ID1290)
* [Guidelines for Purging the Monitoring Database](#ID1301)
* [Operational Data Purging](#id_39776)
* [Purge Older Operational Data](#id_39640)

### Back Up and Restore the Monitoring Database

The Monitoring database handles large volumes of data. Over time, the performance and efficiency of the MnT node depends on
how well you manage that data. To increase efficiency, we recommend that you back up the data and transfer it to a remote
repository on a regular basis. You can automate this task by scheduling automatic backups.

| **Note** | ---   You should not perform a backup when a purge operation is in progress. If you start a backup during a purge operation, the purge operation stops or fails.   --- |
| --- | --- |

If you register a secondary MnT node, we recommend that you first back up the primary MnT node and then restore the data to
the new secondary MnT node. This ensures that the history of the primary MnT node is in sync with the new secondary node when
the new changes are replicated.

### Monitoring Database Purge

The purging process allows you to manage the size of the Monitoring database by specifying the number of months to retain the data during a purge. The default is three months. This value is
utilized when the disk space usage threshold for purging (80 percentage of the total disk space) is met. For this option,
each month consists of 30 days. A default of three months equals 90 days.

### Guidelines for Purging the Monitoring Database

Follow these guidelines for optimal Monitoring database disk usage:

* If the Monitoring  database disk usage is greater than 80 percent of the threshold setting, that is 60 percent of total disk space, a critical
  alarm is generated, indicating that the database size is about to exceed the maximum amount of allocated disk size. If the
  disk usage is greater than 90 percent of the threshold setting, that is 70 percent of total disk space, another alarm is generated,
  indicating that the database size has exceeded the maximum amount of allocated disk size.

  A purge process runs, creating a status history report that you can view in the Data Purging Audit window. To view this window, click the Menu icon (![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/440001-450000/440001-441000/440197.jpg)) and choose
  Operations > Reports > Reports > Audit > Data Purging Audit. An information (INFO) alarm is generated after the purge is completed.
* Purging is also based on the percentage of consumed disk space for the database. When the consumed disk space for the Monitoring  database is equal to or exceeds the threshold (the default is 80 percentage of the total disk space), the purge process starts.
  This process deletes only the oldest seven days' monitoring data, irrespective of what is configured in the Admin portal.
  It continues this process in a loop until the disk space is below 80 percent. Purging always checks the Monitoring database disk space limit before proceeding.

### Operational Data Purging

Cisco ISE Monitoring Operational database contains information that is generated as Cisco ISE reports. Recent Cisco ISE (Cisco
ISE Release 2.4 and above) releases have options to purge the monitoring operational data and reset the monitoring database
when the application configure ise command is run.

The purge option is used to clean up the data and prompts you to enter the number of days for which to retain the data. The
reset option is used to reset the database to the factory default, so that all the data that is backed up is permanently deleted.
Specify the database if the files are consuming too much file system space.

| **Note** | ---   The reset option causes Cisco ISE services to be temporarily unavailable.   --- |
| --- | --- |

The Operational Data Purging window contains the Database Utilization and Purge Data Now areas. To view this window, click the Menu icon (![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/440001-450000/440001-441000/440197.jpg)) and choose
Administration > System > Maintenance > Operational Data Purging. You can view the total available database space and the RADIUS and TACACS data stored in the Database Utilization area. Hover the mouse over the status bar to display the available disk space and the number of days the existing data is
stored for in the database. Specify the period for which the RADIUS and TACACS data is supposed to be retained in the **Data Retention Period** area. Data is purged at 4 a.m. every day, and you can configure the export of data to a repository before it is purged, by specifying
the number of retention days. Check the Enable Export Repository check box to select and create a repository, and specify an Encryption Key.

 In the Purge Data Now area, you can purge all the RADIUS and TACACS data or specify the number of days beyond which data is supposed to be purged.

| **Note** | ---   You must export RADIUS authentication and accounting, TACACS authorization and accounting, RADIUS errors, and misconfigured supplicants tables to a repository before purging.   --- |
| --- | --- |

**Related Tasks**
[Purge Older Operational Data](#id_39640 "Operational data can be purged instantly or periodically.")

### Purge Older Operational Data

The operational data is collected in the server over a period of time. It can be purged either instantly or periodically.
You can verify the success of the data purge by viewing the Data Purging Audit report.

#### Before you begin

To perform the following task, you must be a Super Admin or System Admin.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon () and choose Administration > System > Maintenance > Operational Data Purging. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Do one of the following:   * In the Data Retention Period area:   1. Specify the time period, in days, for which RADIUS and TACACS data should be retained. All the data prior to the specified      time period is exported to a repository.   2. In the Repository area, check the Enable Export Repository check box to choose the repository to save data.   3. In the Encryption Key field, enter the required password.   4. Click Save.             | **Note** | If the configured retention period is less than the existing retention thresholds corresponding to the diagnostics data, the configured value overrides the existing threshold values. For example, if you configure the retention period as three day,s and this value is less than the existing thresholds in the diagnostics tables (for example, a default of five days), the data is purged according to the value that you configure (three days) in this window. |      | --- | --- | * In the Purge Data Now area:   1. Choose to purge all the data or to purge the data that is older than the specified number of days. Data is not saved in any      repository.   2. Click Purge. |

---

## Configure MnT Nodes for Automatic Failover

If you have two MnT nodes in a deployment, you can configure a primary-secondary pair for automatic failover to avoid downtime
in the Cisco ISE Monitoring service. A primary-secondary pair ensures that a secondary MnT node automatically provides monitoring
if the primary node fails.

### Before you begin

* Before you configure MnT nodes for automatic failover, they must be registered as Cisco ISE nodes.
* Configure monitoring roles and services on both the nodes and name them for their primary and secondary roles, as appropriate.
* Configure repositories for backup and data purging on both the primary and secondary MnT nodes. For the backup and purging
  features to work properly, use the same repositories for both the nodes. Purging takes place on both the primary and secondary
  nodes of a redundant pair. For example, if the primary MnT node uses two repositories for backup and purging, you must specify
  the same repositories for the secondary node.

  Configure a data repository for a MnT node using the repository  command in the system CLI.

| **Note** | ---   For scheduled backup and purge to work properly on the nodes of a monitoring redundant pair, configure the same repository, or repositories, on both the primary and secondary nodes using the CLI. The repositories are not automatically synced between the two nodes.   --- |
| --- | --- |

From the Cisco ISE dashboard, verify that the MnT nodes are ready. The System Summary dashlet shows the MnT nodes with a green check mark to the left when their services are ready.

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon () and choose Administration  >  System  >  Deployment. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | In the Deployment Nodes window, check the check box next to the MnT node that you want to specify as primary, and click Edit . |
| **Step 3** | Click the General Settings tab and choose Primary from the Role drop-down list.  When you choose an MnT node as primary, the other MnT node automatically becomes secondary. In the case of a standalone deployment, primary and secondary role configuration is disabled. |
| **Step 4** | Click Save . Both the primary and secondary nodes restart. |

## Cisco pxGrid Node

You can use Cisco pxGrid to share the context-sensitive information from Cisco ISE session directory with other network systems
such as Cisco ISE ecosystem, partner systems, and other Cisco platforms. The pxGrid framework can also be used to exchange
policy and configuration data between nodes, such as sharing tags and policy objects between Cisco ISE and third-party vendors,
and for other information exchanges. Cisco pxGrid also allows third-party systems to invoke adaptive network control actions (ANC) to quarantine users or devices or both in response to a network or security event. Cisco TrustSec information, such as tag
definition, value, and description can be passed from Cisco ISE through the Cisco TrustSec topic to other networks. The endpoint
profiles with Fully Qualified Names (FQNs) can be passed from Cisco ISE to other networks through an endpoint profile meta
topic. Cisco pxGrid also supports bulk download of tags and endpoint profiles.

You can publish and subscribe to SXP bindings (IP-SGT mappings) through Cisco pxGrid. For more information about SXP bindings,
see [e](b_ISE_admin_33_segmentation.html#concept_6D1DCD2EA57A42A89BF8791E8C36BB7C "This topic explains the Security Group Tag Exchange Protocol in Cisco ISE.")
.

The following logs are available for the Cisco pxGrid node:

* pxgrid.log: Provides state change notifications.
* pxgrid-cm.log: Displays updates on publisher or subscriber or both and data exchange activity between the client and the server.
* pxgrid-controller.log: Displays the details of client capabilities, groups, and client authorization.
* pxgrid-jabberd.log: Displays all the logs related to system state and authentication.
* pxgrid-pubsub.log: Displays all the information related to publisher and subscriber events.

| **Note** | ---  * You can enable Cisco pxGrid and Cisco pxGrid persona with the Cisco ISE Advantage license. * Cisco pxGrid should be defined in order to work with the Passive ID Work Center. For more information,   see [PassiveID Work Center](b_ISE_admin_33_asset_visibility.html#concept_qfh_cvl_tw "Overview of PassiveID Work Center")  --- |
| --- | --- |

### High Availability for pxGrid 2.0

pxGrid 2.0 nodes operate in an Active/Active configuration. For high availability, there should be at least two pxGrid nodes
in the deployment. Large deployments can have up to four nodes for increased scale and redundancy. We recommend that you configure
IP addresses for all the nodes, so that if one node goes down, that node's clients connect to the working node. When the PAN
goes down, the pxGrid server stops handling the activations. Manually promote the PAN to activate the pxGrid server. For more
information about pxGrid deployments, see [**Performance and Scalability Guide for Cisco Identity Services Engine**](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/ise/performance_and_scalability/b_ise_perf_and_scale.html)

All the pxGrid service provider clients periodically reregister themselves with the pxGrid controller within a span of 7.5
minutes. If the client does not reregister, the PAN node assumes that the client is inactive and deletes the client. If the
PAN node goes down for more than 7.5 minutes, when it comes back up, it deletes all the clients with timestamp values older
than 7.5 minutes. All those clients must then register again with the pxGrid controller.

pxGrid 2.0 clients use WebSocket and REST-based APIs for pub/sub and query. These APIs are served by the ISE application server
on port 8910. The pxGrid processes shown by `show logging application pxgrid` don’t apply to pxGrid 2.0.

| **Note** | ---   All the references to pxGrid 1.0 processes in the GUI and the CLI have been removed.   --- |

### Deploy Cisco pxGrid Node

 You can enable Cisco pxGrid
persona both on a standalone node and distributed deployment node.

#### Before you begin

* You must have a Cisco ISE Advantage license to enable the Cisco pxGrid persona. For licensing requirements, see [ISE Licensing / Ordering](http://cs.co/ise-licensing).
* All nodes use the CA certificate for Cisco pxGrid service usage. If you used the default certificate for Cisco pxGrid service
  before the upgrade, the upgrade replaces that certificate with the internal CA certificate.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon () and choose Administration > System > Deployment. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | In the Deployment Nodes window, check the check box next to the node for which you want to enable the Cisco pxGrid services, and click Edit. |
| **Step 3** | Click the General Settings tab and enable the pxGrid toggle button. |
| **Step 4** | Click Save.   | **Note** | When you upgrade from the previous version, the Save option might be disabled. This happens when the browser cache refers to the old files from the previous version of Cisco ISE. Clear the browser cache to enable the Save option. | | --- | --- | |

---

### Configure Cisco pxGrid Settings

#### Before you begin

To perform the
following task, you must be a Super Admin or System Admin.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon () and choose Administration > pxGrid Services > Settings. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Check one of the following check boxes based on your requirements:   * Automatically approve new certificate-based   accounts: Check this check box to automatically   approve the connection requests from new Cisco pxGrid clients. * Allow password-based account creation: Check   this check box to enable username or password-based authentication   for Cisco pxGrid clients. When this option is enabled, Cisco pxGrid   clients cannot be automatically approved. |
| **Step 3** | Click **Save**.  Use the Test option in the Cisco pxGrid Settings window to run a health check on the Cisco pxGrid node. View the details in the pxgrid or pxgrid-test.log file.  Use the PxGrid Client Auto Approval API to:   * Enable automatic approval of certificate-based connection requests from new pxGrid clients. Enable this option only when you   trust all the clients in your environment. * Enable username or password-based authentication for the pxGrid clients. When this option is enabled, pxGrid clients cannot   be automatically approved. A pxGrid client can register itself with the pxGrid controller by sending the username through   a REST API. The pxGrid controller generates a password for the pxGrid client during client registration. An administrator   can approve or deny the connection request.   For more information about the PxGrid Client Auto Approval API, see the “pxGrid Settings” section in the ERS SDK. You can access the ERS SDK at the following URL:  https://<*ISE-Admin-Node*>:9060/ers/sdk  Only users with ERS Admin role can access the ERS SDK. |

---

### Generate Cisco pxGrid Certificate

#### Before you begin

* You must not use the same certificate for Cisco ISE pxGrid server and pxGrid clients. You must use client certificates for
  the pxGrid clients. To generate client certificates, choose **Administration > System > Certificates**.
* Some versions of Cisco ISE have a certificate for Cisco pxGrid that uses NetscapeCertType. We recommend that you generate
  a new certificate.
* To perform the following task, you must be a Super Admin or System Admin.
* A Cisco pxGrid certificate must be generated from the primary PAN.
* If the Cisco pxGrid certificate uses the subject alternative name (SAN) extension, be sure to include the FQDN of the subject
  identity as a DNS name entry.
* Create a certificate template with digital signature usage and use that to generate a new Cisco pxGrid certificate.

  | **Note** | ---   If FIPS mode is enabled, the pxGrid certificate template’s RSA private key size must be 2048 bits or greater. Else an error is displayed when you try to generate a pxGrid certificate. To change the private key size of the certificate template, see [Change pxGrid Certificate Template Key Size](b_ISE_admin_33_pxgrid.html#Cisco_Task.dita_f2910803-7308-4763-a726-da4d70eabdc8 "This task helps you to change the key size of the pxGrid certificate template.").   --- |
  | --- | --- |

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon () and choose Administration > pxGrid Services > Client Management > Certificates. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | From the I want to drop-down list, choose one of the following options:   * Generate a single certificate (without a certificate signing request): You must enter the Common Name (CN) if you select this option. * Generate a single certificate (with a certificate signing request): You must enter the Certificate Signing Request details if you select this option. |
| **Step 3** | (Optional) Enter a description for this certificate. |
| **Step 4** | Click the pxGrid\_Certificate\_Template link to download and edit the certificate template based on your requirements. |
| **Step 5** | Enter the Subject Alternative Name (SAN). You can add multiple SANs. The following options are available:   * IP address: Enter the IP address of the Cisco pxGrid client to be associated with the certificate. * FQDN: Enter the FQDN of the pxGrid client. |
| **Step 6** | From the Certificate Download Format drop-down list, choose one of the following options:   * Certificate in Private Enhanced Electronic Mail (PEM) format, key in PKCS8 PEM format (including certificate chain): The root certificate, the intermediate CA certificates, and the end entity certificate are represented in the PEM format.   PEM-formatted certificates are BASE64-encoded ASCII files. Each certificate starts with the `"--------BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----"` tag and ends with the `"-------END CERTIFICATE----"` tag. The end entity’s private key is stored using PKCS\* PEM. It starts with the `"-----BEGIN ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY----"` tag and ends with the `"-----END ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY----"` tag. * PKCS12 format (including certificate chain; one file for both the certificate chain and key): A binary format to store the root CA certificate, the intermediate CA certificate, and the end entity's certificate and   private key in one encrypted file. |
| **Step 7** | Enter the password for the certificate. |
| **Step 8** | Click Create.  You can view the certificate that you created in the Issued Certificates window. To view this window, click the Menu icon () and choose Administration > System > Certificates > Certificate Authority > Issued Certificates.   | **Note** | From Cisco ISE 2.4 patch 13 onwards, the certificate requirements have become stricter for the pxGrid service. If you are using the Cisco ISE default self-signed certificate as the pxGrid certificate, Cisco ISE might reject that certificate after applying Cisco ISE 2.4 patch 13 or later. This is because the earlier versions of that certificate have the Netscape Cert Type extension specified as SSL Server, which now fails (a client certificate is also required now). | | --- | --- |   Any client with a noncompliant certificate fails to integrate with Cisco ISE. Use a certificate issued by the internal CA, or generate a new certificate with proper usage extensions:   * The Key Usage extension in the certificate must contain the Digital Signature and Key Encipherment fields. * The Extended Key Usage extension in the certificate must contain the Client Authentication and Server Authentication fields. * The Netscape Certificate Type extension is not required. If you want to include that extension, add both SSL Client and SSL Server in the extension. * If you are using a self-signed certificate, the Basic Constraints CA field must be set to **True**, and the Key Usage extension must contain the Key Cert Sign field. |

### Control Permissions for Cisco pxGrid Clients

You can create Cisco pxGrid authorization rules for controlling the permissions for the Cisco pxGrid clients. Use these rules
to control the services that are provided to the Cisco pxGrid clients.

You can create different types of groups and map the services provided to the Cisco pxGrid clients to these groups. Use the
Groups option in the Client Management window to add new groups. You can view the example authorization rules in the Client Management > Policies window. Note that you can update only the **Custom Operations** field for the predefined rules.

To create an
authorization rule for pxGrid clients:

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon () and choose Administration > pxGrid Services > Client Management > Policy. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | From the Service drop-down list, choose one of the following options:   * **com.cisco.ise.pubsub** * **com.cisco.ise.config.anc** * **com.cisco.ise.config.profiler** * **com.cisco.ise.config.trustsec** * **com.cisco.ise.service** * **com.cisco.ise.system** * **com.cisco.ise.radius** * **com.cisco.ise.sxp** * **com.cisco.ise.trustsec** * **com.cisco.ise.mdm** |
| **Step 3** | From the Operation drop-down list, choose one of the following options:   * **<ANY>** * **publish** * **publish /topic/com.cisco.ise.session** * **publish /topic/com.cisco.ise.session.group** * **publish /topic/com.cisco.ise.anc** * **<CUSTOM>**: You can specify a custom operation if you   select this option.   See [pxGrid Operations and Services Use Cases](#reference_rsm_h5k_2bc "This topic explains the pxGrid operations and services sse cases.") for more information.   | **Note** | The following additional attributes are published to the /topic/com.cisco.ise.session for REST ID store for Cisco ISE 3.0 patch 5 and later releases:   * identityProvider:Azure * oid * tenantID * preferredUsername | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 4** | From the Groups drop-down list, choose the groups that you want to map to this service.  ANC and manually added groups are listed in this drop-down list.   | **Note** | Only the clients that belong to the groups included in the policy can subscribe to the service specified in that policy. For example, if you define a pxGrid policy for com.cisco.ise.pubsub service and assign the ANC group to this policy, only the clients that belong to the ANC group can subscribe to the com.cisco.ise.pubsub service. | | --- | --- | |

---

### pxGrid Operations and Services Use Cases

When creating a new pxGrid policy, note that some pxGrid operations are only applicable to specific services.

You can find the following pxGrid operations in the Cisco ISE GUI.

#### Operation <ANY>

When you use the <ANY> operation with a service and a particular user group, any operation related to that service is only
accessible to the users in the chosen user group.

Consider the following example.

Service: com.cisco.ise.session; Operation: <ANY>; Groups: SessionUsers.

In this example, only pxGrid clients that are part of the ‘SessionUsers’ group will be able to perform any operation related
to session topic (like subscribe/gets operations).

#### Operation publish

All the publish related operations are applicable only when com.cisco.ise.pubsub is chosen as the service. You can use the
publish operation to create a pxGrid policy specifying that only a pxGrid client of a particular user group can publish a
chosen topic or can publish all topics.

#### Operation <Custom>

You can use the <Custom> operation to specify an operation that is not provided in the Operation drop-down list. Currently,
pxGrid supports the following operations but not all of them are listed in the Operation drop-down list:

1. 'sets' (applicable on all services and topics except pubsub) – You can use this to restrict access to REST API calls that
   perform a set operation.
2. 'gets' (applicable on all services and topics except pubsub) – You can use this to restrict access to REST API calls that
   perform a get operation.
3. 'publish' followed by a particular topic name (only applicable on pubsub service) – You can use this to restrict access to
   users who can publish a particular topic.

   For example, Service: com.cisco.ise.pubsub, Operation: publish/topic/com.cisco.ise.session.

   However, some rules with the same operation, service, and topic are incomprehensible and must be avoided. For example, Service:
   com.cisco.ise.session, Operation: publish /topic/com.cisco.ise.session.
4. subscribe' followed by topic name (only applicable on pubsub service) – You can use this to restrict access to users who can
   subscribe to a particular topic.

   For example, Service: com.cisco.ise.pubsub, Operation: publish /topic/com.cisco.ise.session

## View Nodes in a Deployment

In the Deployment Nodes window, you can view all the Cisco ISE nodes, primary and secondary, that are a part of your deployment.

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Log in to the primary Cisco ISE Admin portal. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon () and choose Administration  >  System  >  Deployment. |
| **Step 3** | Click Deployment in the navigation pane on the left.  All the Cisco ISE nodes that are a part of your deployment are listed. |

## Download Endpoint Statistical Data from MnT Nodes

You can download statistical data about the endpoints that connect to your network from the MnT nodes. Key Performance Metrics
(KPM), which include the load, CPU usage, and authentication traffic data are available. You can use this data to monitor
and troubleshoot issues in your network. From the Cisco ISE CLI, run the application configure ise  command and choose Option 12 or Option 13 to download the daily KPM statistics or the KPM statistics for the last eight weeks.

The output of this command provides the following data about
endpoints:

* Total endpoints in your network
* Number of endpoints that established a successful connection
* Number of endpoints that failed authentication
* Total number of new endpoints that have connected each day
* Total number of endpoints onboarded each day

The output also includes time stamp details, the total number of endpoints that connected through each of the Policy Service
nodes (PSNs) in the deployment, total number of endpoints, active endpoints, load, and authentication traffic details.

See the *[Cisco Identity Services Engine CLI Reference Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/ise/3-2/cli_guide/b_ise_CLI_Reference_Guide_32.html)* for more information on this command.

## Database Crash or File Corruption Issues

Cisco ISE may crash if the Oracle database files are corrupted because of a power outage or other reasons, resulting in data
loss. Based on the incident, follow these instructions to recover from data loss:

* In case of PAN corruption in the deployment, you should promote the Secondary PAN to Primary PAN. If the secondary PAN's promotion
  is not possible because the deployment is small or any other reason, restore the most recent available backup as described
  in *[Cisco Identity Services Engine CLI Reference Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/ise/1-0/cli_ref_guide/ise10_cli/ise10_cli_app_a.html#pgfId-1718131)*.
* In case of PSN corruption, follow the steps to deregister, reset config, and register, as described in the *[Cisco Identity Services Engine CLI Reference Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/ise/1-0/cli_ref_guide/ise10_cli/ise10_cli_app_a.html#pgfId-1718131)*.
* In case of a standalone device, restore the most recent backup that is available, as described in the *[Cisco Identity Services Engine CLI Reference Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/ise/1-0/cli_ref_guide/ise10_cli/ise10_cli_app_a.html#pgfId-1718131)*.

  | **Note** | ---   Obtain the backup from the standalone device regularly to avoid loss in the latest configuration changes.   --- |
  | --- | --- |

## Device Configuration for Monitoring

The MnT node receives and uses data from the devices on a network to populate the dashboard display. To enable communication
between the MnT node and the network devices, the switches and NADs must be configured properly.

## Synchronize Primary and Secondary Cisco ISE Nodes

You can make configuration changes to Cisco ISE only through the primary PAN. The configuration changes get replicated to all the secondary nodes. If, for some reason, this
replication does not occur properly, you can manually synchronize the secondary PAN with the primary PAN.

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Log in to the primary PAN. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon () and choose Administration  >  System  >  Deployment. |
| **Step 3** | Check the check box next to the node that you want to synchronize with the primary PAN, and click Syncup to force a full database replication. |

---

## Change Node Personas and Services

| **Note** | ---   When you enable or disable any of the services that run on a PSN or make any changes to a PSN, you will be restarting the application server processes on which these services run. Expect a delay while these services restart. Because this delay in restarting services, automatic failover, if enabled in your deployment, might get initiated. To avoid this, make sure that the automatic failover configuration is turned off.   --- |
| --- | --- |

You can edit the Cisco ISE
node configuration to change the personas and services that run on the node.

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Log in to the primary PAN. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon () and choose Administration  >  System  >  Deployment. |
| **Step 3** | Check the check box next to the node whose personas or services you want to change, and then click Edit. |
| **Step 4** | Choose the personas and services that you want to modify. |
| **Step 5** | Click Save. |
| **Step 6** | Verify the receipt of an alarm on your primary PAN to confirm the persona or service change. If the persona or service change is not saved successfully, an alarm is not generated. |

---

## Effects of Modifying Nodes in Cisco ISE

When you make any of the following changes to a node in a Cisco ISE, that node restarts, which causes a delay:

* Register a node (Standalone to Secondary)
* Deregister a node (Secondary to Standalone)
* Change a primary node to Standalone (if no other nodes are registered with it; Primary to Standalone)
* Promote an Administration node (Secondary to Primary)
* Change the personas (when you assign or remove the Policy Service or Monitoring persona from a node)
* Modify the services in the Policy Service node (enable or disable the session and profiler services)
* Restore a backup on the primary and a sync up operation is triggered to replicate data from primary to secondary nodes

| **Note** | ---   When you promote the secondary Administration node to the primary PAN position, the primary node will assume a secondary role. This causes both the primary and secondary nodes to restart, causing a delay.   --- |
| --- | --- |

## Create a Policy Service Node Group

When two or more Policy Service nodes (PSNs) are connected to the same high-speed Local Area Network (LAN), we recommend that
you place them in the same node group. This design optimizes the replication of endpoint profiling data by retaining less
significant attributes that are local to the group and reducing the information that is replicated to the remote nodes in
the network. Node group members also check on the availability of peer group members. If the group detects that a member has
failed, it attempts to reset and recover all URL-redirected sessions on the failed node.

The node groups are used for the PSN failover in the sessions on which URL redirect (posture services, guest services, and
MDM) is imposed.

| **Note** | ---   We recommend that you put all the PSNs in the same local network and as a part of the same node group. PSNs need not be a part of a load-balanced cluster to join the same node group. However, each local PSN in a load-balanced cluster should typically be part of the same node group.   --- |
| --- | --- |

Node group members can communicate over TCP/7800.

Before you add PSNs as members to a node group, you must create the node group. You can create, edit, and delete PSN groups
from the Deployment window of the Admin portal.

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon () and choose Administration  >  System  >  Deployment. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click the Settings icon at the top of the left navigation pane. |
| **Step 3** | Click Create Node Group. |
| **Step 4** | Enter a unique name for your node group.   | **Note** | We recommend that you do not configure a node group with the name None, because it may cause issues during node registration. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 5** | (Optional) Enter a description for your node group. |
| **Step 6** | (Optional) Check the Enable MAR Cache Distribution check box and fill in the other options. Ensure that the MAR is enabled in the Active Directory window before checking this check box. |
| **Step 7** | Click Submit to save the node group.  After you save the node group, it should appear in the left navigation pane. If you do not see the node group in the left pane, it may be hidden. Click the Expand button on the navigation pane to view the hidden objects.  Add a node to a node group, or edit a node by choosing the corresponding node group from the Include node in node group drop-down list in the Policy Service area. |

---

## Remove a Node from Deployment

To remove a node from a deployment, you must deregister it. The deregistered node becomes a standalone Cisco ISE node.

It retains the last configuration that it received from the primary PAN and assumes the default personas of a standalone node,
that is, Administration, Policy Service, or Monitoring. If you deregister an MnT node, this node will no longer be a syslog
target.

When a Primary PSN is deregistered, the endpoint data is lost. If you want the PSN to retain the endpoint data after it becomes
a standalone node, do one of the following:

* Obtain a backup from the primary PAN, and when the PSN becomes a standalone node, restore this data backup on it.
* Change the persona of the PSN to Administration (secondary PAN), synchronize the data in the Deployment window of the Admin portal, and then deregister the node. This node will now have all the data. You can then add a secondary
  PAN to the existing deployment.

You can view these changes in the Deployment window of the primary PAN. However, expect a delay of five minutes for the changes to take effect and appear in the Deployment window.

### Before you begin

Before you remove a secondary node from a deployment, perform a backup of Cisco ISE configuration, which you can then restore later, if needed.

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | In the Cisco ISE GUI, click the Menu icon () and choose Administration  >  System  >  Deployment. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Check the check box next to the secondary node that you want to remove, and click Deregister. |
| **Step 3** | Click OK. |
| **Step 4** | Verify the receipt of an alarm on your primary PAN to confirm that the secondary node is deregistered successfully. If the secondary node fails to deregister from the primary PAN, it means the alarm is not generated. |

---

## Shut Down a Cisco ISE Node

Before you run the **halt** command from the Cisco ISE CLI, we recommend that you stop the Cisco ISE application service and ensure that it is not performing
a backup, restore, installation, upgrade, or remove operation. If you run the **halt** command while the Cisco ISE is performing any of these operations, you will get one of the following warning messages:

`WARNING: A backup or restore is currently in progress! Continue with halt?`

`WARNING: An install/upgrade/remove is currently in progress! Continue with halt?`

If no processes are running when you use the **halt** command, or if you enter `Yes` in response to the warning message displayed, then you must respond to the following question:

`Do you want to save the current configuration?`

If you enter `Yes` to save the existing Cisco ISE configuration, the following message is displayed:

`Saved the running configuration to startup successfully.`

| **Note** | ---   We recommend that you stop the application process before rebooting the appliance.   --- |
| --- | --- |

We also recommend that you stop the application process before rebooting Cisco ISE. For more information, see the *[Cisco Identity Services Engine CLI Reference Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/security/identity-services-engine/products-command-reference-list.html).*

## Scenarios In Which Need to Reregister a Node

The following table summarizes some of the scenarios where you need to reregister a
node when it is corrupted:

| Scenarios | What needs to be done |
| --- | --- |
| If any of the nodes other than the Primary PAN is corrupted | 1. Deregister the failed node from the deployment. 2. Reinstall Cisco ISE on the failed node. 3. Reregister the node in the existing deployment.  | **Note** | You must import the old certificates to the node before or after the registration. | | --- | --- | |
| If the Primary PAN is corrupted | If, for example, there are two nodes, N1 (Primary PAN) and N2 (Secondary PAN):   1. Promote secondary PAN (N2) to Primary PAN. 2. Remove the failed node (N1) from the deployment. 3. Reinstall Cisco ISE on the failed node (N1). 4. Register the node (N1) as Secondary PAN to deployment. 5. Import the old certificates to the node (N1) after the    registration is completed. 6. Promote the node (N1) back to Primary PAN to have similar    deployment as earlier. |
| If both Primary PAN and Secondary PAN are corrupted | If, for example, there are two nodes, N1 (Primary PAN) and N2 (Secondary PAN):   1. Reinstall Cisco ISE on Primary PAN node (N1) and    Secondary PAN node (N2). 2. Restore configuration backup in Primary PAN node (N1). 3. Import old certificates in Primary PAN node (N1). 4. Register the other node (N2) as Secondary PAN in the deployment. 5. Perform reset-config on other nodes and register the nodes in the deployment. 6. Import certificates to all the nodes.  | **Note** | If the Primary PAN and Secondary PANs are VMs, reinstalling Cisco ISE might change the UDI. Hence, you must reinstall the licenses with the new UDIs. | | --- | --- | |

## Change the Hostname or IP Address of a Standalone Cisco ISE Node

You can change the hostname, IP address, or domain name of standalone Cisco ISE nodes. However, you cannot use **localhost** as the hostname for a node.

### Before you begin

If a Cisco ISE node is a part of a distributed deployment, you must first remove it from the deployment and ensure that it is a standalone node.

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Change the hostname or IP address of the Cisco ISE node using the hostname , ip address , or ip domain-name  command from the Cisco ISE CLI. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Reset the Cisco ISE application configuration using the application stop ise  command from the Cisco ISE CLI to restart all the services. |
| **Step 3** | Register the Cisco ISE node to the primary PAN if it is a part of a distributed deployment.   | **Note** | If you are using the hostname while registering the Cisco ISE node, the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the standalone node that you are going to register, for example, *abc.xyz.com*, must be DNS-resolvable from the primary PAN. Otherwise, node registration fails. You must enter the IP addresses and FQDNs of the Cisco ISE nodes that are a part of your distributed deployment in the DNS server. | | --- | --- |   After you register the Cisco ISE node as a secondary node, the primary PAN replicates the change in the IP address, hostname, or domain name to the other Cisco ISE nodes in your deployment. |

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

### **RSS Feeds**

Cisco security vulnerability information is also available via RSS feeds from Cisco.com. These feeds are free and do not require an active Cisco.com registration. For information on how to subscribe to the RSS feeds, visit the [Cisco Security RSS Feeds page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44).

### **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API**

The Cisco PSIRT openVuln application programming interface (API) is a RESTful API that conforms to the [representational state transfer](https://restfulapi.net/) (REST) software architectural style and allows customers to obtain Cisco security vulnerability information in different machine-consumable formats. To learn about accessing and using the API, visit the [PSIRT page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) on the Cisco DevNet website.

### **My Notifications**

The [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) allows registered Cisco.com users to subscribe to and receive important Cisco product and technology information, including Cisco Security Advisories. This service provides an improved unified subscription experience, allowing users to choose the timing of notifications as well as the notification delivery method (email or RSS feed). The level of access will be determined by the subscriber's relationship with Cisco.

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.
