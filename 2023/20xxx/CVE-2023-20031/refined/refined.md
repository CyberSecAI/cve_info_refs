    "summary": "The vulnerability is due to a logic error in handling SSL/TLS certificates under load in the Snort 3 detection engine of Cisco FTD Software, which could lead to a denial of service. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a high rate of SSL/TLS connection requests to trigger a Snort process reload. The impact depends on device configuration, and can cause service bypass or DoS. The advisory provides a detailed description of the vulnerability, conditions that make a device vulnerable, and workarounds.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a logic error in the Snort 3 detection engine's SSL/TLS certificate handling when processing a high volume of SSL/TLS connection requests. This issue leads to improper management of system resources and, under specific time-based constraints, causes the Snort process to reload.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper management of system resources during SSL/TLS certificate processing",
        "Logic error in Snort 3 detection engine's certificate handling"
      ],
      "impact": "An unauthenticated, remote attacker can cause the Snort 3 detection engine to reload, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition or potentially a bypass of configured policies depending on the device's configuration and if `snort preserve-connection` is enabled.",
      "attack_vectors": "The attacker sends a high rate of specially crafted SSL/TLS connection requests to be inspected by the Snort 3 detection engine on an affected device. Specifically, the attacker exploits the time-based constraint to make the vulnerability occur during certificate access under load during SSL connection initiation.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An unauthenticated, remote attacker. The attacker needs the ability to send high-rate of SSL/TLS connections to the targeted device. The attacker needs to induce a high load of SSL/TLS processing to trigger the bug."
