{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the Settings application, specifically related to the Factory Reset Protection (FRP) bypass mechanism.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Insufficient checks within the Settings app's code allow for bypassing FRP when the user hasn't completed the setup flow.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass Factory Reset Protection, gaining unauthorized access to a device after a factory reset.",
  "Attack vectors": "Exploitation occurs during the setup process after a factory reset, by not completing the required user flow in Settings application.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs physical access to the device that has been factory reset and knowledge of the vulnerable method."
