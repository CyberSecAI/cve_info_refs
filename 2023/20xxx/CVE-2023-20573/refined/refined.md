  "CVE-2023-20573": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "A host can suppress delivery of debug exceptions to SEV-SNP guests that have the restricted injection feature enabled.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Suppression of guest debug exceptions.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "A software-based debugger may not see the exceptions delivered to the VM guest. Hardware debug traps such as single-stepping and data breakpoints may not be observed in the guest.",
    "Attack vectors": "A privileged attacker on the host system.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have privileged access on the host system and be able to interact with SEV-SNP guests."
