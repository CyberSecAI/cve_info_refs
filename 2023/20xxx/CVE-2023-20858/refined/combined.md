The Carbon Black team is pleased to announce the general availability of the 8.9.4 App Control Server.

The VMware Carbon Black App Control Server has been identified to contain a critical security vulnerability. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project ([cve.mitre.org](https://cve.mitre.org/)) has assigned the identifier [CVE-2023-20858](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-20858) to this issue. We strongly recommend that you upgrade as soon as possible.

For more information, see the VMware Security Advisory: [VMSA-2023-0004](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2023-0004.html). For questions and assistance with installation, please contact Customer Support.

The 8.9.4 Server resolves the vulnerability identified in [CVE-2023-20858](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-20858). We strongly recommend that you upgrade to the 8.9.4 Server as soon as possible.

This release includes new functionality and addresses several defects. New functionality includes:

* Server Support for Mac Trusted Publisher

  The 8.9.4 App Control Server can now receive publisher certificate information from the latest 8.8.0 macOS Agent. For more information, see [Approving or Banning by Publisher](../../../VMware-Carbon-Black-App-Control/8.9.4/vmw-carbon-black-app-control-ug/GUID-82FDD30A-6960-4D8F-A070-66DF7CBA146A.html) in the [8.9.4 User Guide](../../../VMware-Carbon-Black-App-Control/8.9.4/vmw-carbon-black-app-control-ug/GUID-3F2B1374-2557-4E38-8AB2-22E5A3345519.html).
* New Action on the Computers Page

  Cache consistency checks can now be run on multiple computers at once. Also, you can use the new cache consistency menu option, Re-evaluate publishers, for example, to retrieve publisher certificate information from files on previous macOS Agents that did not support Trusted Publishers. For more information, see [Performing a Cache Consistency Check](../../../VMware-Carbon-Black-App-Control/8.9.4/vmw-carbon-black-app-control-ug/GUID-36706B4E-6A20-4FD9-945C-5202F50DF076.html) in the [8.9.4 User Guide](../../../VMware-Carbon-Black-App-Control/8.9.4/vmw-carbon-black-app-control-ug/GUID-3F2B1374-2557-4E38-8AB2-22E5A3345519.html).
* Other Updates

  This includes a new available agent config property in the Server and improved performance on the Computers page.

For more details about this release, see the [8.9.4 Release Notes](../../../VMware-Carbon-Black-App-Control/8.9.4/rn/vmware-carbon-black-app-control-server-894-release-notes/index.html).
