A vulnerability in an API of the Web Bridge feature of Cisco Meeting Server could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of HTTP requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a partial availability condition, which could cause ongoing video calls to be dropped due to the invalid packets reaching the Web Bridge.
