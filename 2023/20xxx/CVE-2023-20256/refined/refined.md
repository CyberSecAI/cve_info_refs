    "related": true,
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerabilities are due to a logic error that could occur when the affected software constructs and applies per-user-override rules.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Access Control List Bypass"
      ],
      "impact": "An unauthenticated, remote attacker can bypass a configured access control list (ACL) and allow traffic that should be denied to flow through an affected device, potentially accessing protected resources.",
      "attack_vector": "An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by connecting to a network through an affected device that has a vulnerable configuration.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be unauthenticated and remote. They need to be able to establish a VPN connection through an affected device with a vulnerable configuration.",
      "additional_information": "The vulnerability affects Cisco products running a vulnerable version of Cisco ASA or FTD Software and meets the following conditions:\n    + The sysopt connection permit-vpn command, which allows all of the traffic that enters the security appliance through a VPN tunnel to bypass interface ACLs, was disabled.\n    + At least one interface ACL had the per-user-override feature (per-user-override) enabled.\n    + At least one remote access VPN connection profile or site-to-site VPN connection profile (tunnel-group) was configured and associated with a group policy (group-policy) that specifies a filter ACL (vpn-filter).\n    + A VPN tunnel that was associated with an affected connection profile (tunnel-group) was currently up.  In Cisco FTD Software, the per-user-override feature can be enabled through FlexConfig only."
