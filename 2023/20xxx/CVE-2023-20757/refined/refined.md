- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A missing bounds check in the `cmdq` component allows for an out-of-bounds write.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper input validation (CWE-20), specifically a missing bounds check leading to an out-of-bounds write.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Local escalation of privilege.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited locally.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: System execution privileges are required, but user interaction is not needed.
