```
{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `DevicePolicyResourcesManager.getString()` method was called in multiple places inside the system server. This method uses `DeviceConfig.getBoolean` to determine if a feature is enabled. However, `clearCallingIdentity()` was not always called before calling `DeviceConfig.getBoolean`. This resulted in a SecurityException due to a mismatch in the AttributionSource, where the calling UID is from the binder client while the context is 'android' (which should have calling UID 0).",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect handling of calling identity",
      "Missing security check before accessing device configuration"
    ],
    "impact": "This bug could lead to unexpected behavior, such as packages failing to be uninstalled by the admin.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered internally within the system server, specifically when calling DevicePolicyResourcesManager.getString(). An attacker does not directly trigger this via an attack vector, but it could be a step in a larger exploit.",
    "required_capabilities": "No specific attacker capabilities are listed. The issue is related to how the system server handles permission checks and context within the system."
