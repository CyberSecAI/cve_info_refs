Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a mismatch in pattern matching between Spring Security and Spring MVC when using `"**"` as a pattern in Spring Security configuration with the `mvcRequestMatcher`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Security Bypass:** The core issue is a security bypass due to the inconsistent handling of double wildcard patterns. Spring Security and Spring MVC interpret the `"**"` pattern differently, leading to potential authorization bypasses.
*   **Pattern Matching Mismatch:** The vulnerability exists because the pattern matching logic differs between the two components involved (Spring Security and Spring MVC) when dealing with the double wildcard (`**`) pattern.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Modification/Addition:** Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized addition or modification of data, potentially leading to integrity issues.
*   **Security Bypass:** Attackers can bypass intended security checks and access resources they shouldn't.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), meaning the vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring any prior authentication (PR:N).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** Attackers must have network access to the vulnerable application.
*   **No Authentication Required:** No specific attacker capabilities or prior authentication are needed to exploit the vulnerability.

**Affected Products and Versions:**

*   **Spring Framework:** Versions 6.0.0 to 6.0.6 and 5.3.0 to 5.3.25 are affected.
*   **NetApp Products:** Specifically, the vulnerability affects:
    *   Active IQ Unified Manager for Linux
    *   Active IQ Unified Manager for Microsoft Windows
    *   Active IQ Unified Manager for VMware vSphere

**Mitigation:**

*   Upgrade to Spring Framework version 6.0.7+ or 5.3.26+
*   NetApp has provided fixes for the affected Active IQ Unified Manager products via patches.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.1 score of 7.5 (HIGH).
*   Public discussion of this vulnerability is known.
*   The vulnerability was discovered internally by Spring.
