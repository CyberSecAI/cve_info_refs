VMware Workstation:

* To remove hardware from a selected virtual machine, select VM > Settings, click the Hardware tab,
* Select the CD/DVD and click Remove.

VMware Fusion

* Select a virtual machine in the Virtual Machine Library window. Click on "Virtual Machine" menu and click on "Settings".
* Under Removable Devices in the Settings window, select CD/DVD > Advanced Options > Remove CD/DVD Drive.

2. Configure the virtual machine NOT to use a virtual SCSI controller on the impacted products by following the procedure described here:

VMware Workstation:

* Select VM > Settings, click the Hardware tab, select the CD/DVD > Advanced > CD/DVD Advanced Settings > Virtual device node
* You can configure the Bus type

VMware Fusion

* Select a virtual machine in the Virtual Machine Library window. Click on "Virtual Machine" menu and click on "Settings".
* Under Removable Devices in the Settings window, Select CD/DVD > Advanced options > Bus type
* You can configure the Bus type
