## About VMware Workstation Pro

VMware Workstation Pro™ enables technical professionals to develop, test, demonstrate, and deploy software by running multiple x86-based Windows, Linux, and other operating systems simultaneously on the same PC.

You can replicate server, desktop, and tablet environments in a virtual machine and allocate multiple processor cores, gigabytes of main memory, and graphics memory to each virtual machine, whether the virtual machine resides on a personal PC or on a private enterprise cloud.

For more information, see the [VMware Workstation Pro documentation](http://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Workstation-Pro/index.html).

## System Requirements

* A compatible 64-bit x86/AMD64 CPU launched in 2011 or later.

* Please refer to the vendor's recommended processor requirements for specific Host Operating Systems (HOS):

  + For Microsoft-specific HOS, refer to the Microsoft documentation
  + For Linux-specific HOS, refer to the Linux Vendor-specific documentation

## What's New

* This release resolves CVE-2023-20869, and CVE-2023-20870. For more information on these vulnerabilities and their impact on VMware products, see [VMSA-2023-0008](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2023-0008.html).
* This release contains bug fixes.

## Prior Releases

Features and Known Issues from prior releases of VMware Workstation 17 Pro are described in the release notes for each release. To view the release notes for a prior release, click the appropriate link:

* [VMware Workstation 17.0.1 Pro](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Workstation-Pro/17.0.1/rn/vmware-workstation-1701-pro-release-notes/index.html)
* [VMware Workstation 17.0.0 Pro](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Workstation-Pro/17.0/rn/vmware-workstation-170-pro-release-notes/index.html)

## Resolved Issues

* **Cannot close Workstation Pro while upgrading Workstation Pro**

  If you try to upgrade Workstation Pro from version 17.0.0 or 17.0.1, you cannot close the Workstation application after the upgrade installer appears. The issue is expected to appear when you upgrade Workstation Pro from version 17.0.0 or 17.0.1 to 17.0.2.

  This issue is resolved now in this release and is not expected to appear when you upgrade Workstation Pro from version 17.0.2 to a higher version.
