- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a CSRF bypass in VMware vRealize Operations (vROps).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) bypass.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious user could execute actions on the platform on behalf of an authenticated victim user.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted request that bypasses CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to perform actions as an authenticated victim user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick an authenticated user into interacting with the malicious request. The attacker doesn't need to have direct access to the vROps platform. The user interaction required is for the victim to be authenticated and interact with a malicious request.
