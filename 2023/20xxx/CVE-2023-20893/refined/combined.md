##### **2. Introduction**

Multiple memory corruption vulnerabilities in VMware vCenter Server were privately reported to VMware. Updates are available to remediate these vulnerabilities in affected VMware products.

##### **3a. VMware vCenter Server heap-overflow vulnerability (CVE-2023-20892)**

**Description:** The vCenter Server contains a heap overflow vulnerability due to the usage of uninitialized memory in the implementation of the DCERPC protocol. VMware has evaluated the severity of this issue to be in the [Important severity range](https://www.vmware.com/support/policies/security_response.html) with a maximum CVSSv3 base score of [8.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).

**Known Attack Vectors:** A malicious actor with network access to vCenter Server may exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code on the underlying operating system that hosts vCenter Server.

**Resolution:** To remediate CVE-2023-20892 apply the updates listed in the 'Fixed Version' column of the 'Response Matrix' below to affected deployments.

**Workarounds:** None.

**Additional Documentation:** Async patches for vCenter Servers have been made available for VCF customers. Please see [knowledge base article 88287](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/88287) for more information.
A supplemental FAQ was created for additional clarification. Please see: <https://via.vmw.com/vmsa-2023-0014-qna>.

**Acknowledgments:** VMware would like to thank Aleksandar Nikolic of Cisco for reporting this issue to us.

**Notes:** None.

**3b. VMware vCenter Server use-after-free vulnerability (CVE-2023-20893)**

**Description:** The vCenter Server contains a use-after-free vulnerability in the implementation of the DCERPC protocol. VMware has evaluated the severity of this issue to be in the [Important severity range](https://www.vmware.com/support/policies/security_response.html) with a maximum CVSSv3 base score of [8.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).

**Known Attack Vectors:** A malicious actor with network access to vCenter Server may exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code on the underlying operating system that hosts vCenter Server.

#### Issue/Introduction

This article lists individual product updates, also known as async patches, that can be applied to VCF environments with the help of [Async Patch Tool](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Foundation/services/ap-tool/GUID-49818DF1-94EA-4C85-8CB6-6EFFCE5F8060.html). Async Patch Tool is a CLI utility which helps automate patch steps and enables users to apply these patches using SDDC Manager's in-product LCM automation, without impacting future upgrades.

This article outlines two key details

1. VCF releases versions can support a given async patch
2. VCF releases that patched environments can upgrade the full SDDC stack to, without the risk of downgrading critical fixes applied via async patches or propagating stale configurations

Refer to the [Async Patch Tool documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Foundation/services/ap-tool/GUID-49818DF1-94EA-4C85-8CB6-6EFFCE5F8060.html) for detailed instructions on how to:

* Download Async Patch Tool.
* Apply an async patch.
* Upgrade an async patched version of VMware Cloud Foundation.

For more information about known issues, see the [Async Patch Tool Release Notes](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Foundation/services/rn/async-patch-tool-release-notes/index.html).

Symptoms:

* A VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) environment needs a critical security patch or bug fix, but you are not ready to upgrade the full SDDC stack to a new VCF version which includes this fix.
* After applying individual product patch(es) to VCF environment in the past, now you want to upgrade to new VCF version.
* **VMSA-2023-0023 Online AP Tool Remediation Steps:**[KB-95284](https://knowledge.broadcom.com/external/article?articleNumber=327206)
* **VMSA-2023-0023 Offline AP Tool Remediation Steps:**  [KB-95287](https://knowledge.broadcom.com/external/article?articleNumber=327210)

**NOTE: Prior to applying any patches, please review** [KB 95536](https://knowledge.broadcom.com/external/article?articleNumber=314663) **and implement the corrective action.**
**NOTE: For VCF on VxRail environments, prior to applying any patches complete the pre-requisites as per** [KB-91830](https://knowledge.broadcom.com/external/article?articleNumber=324139)

#### Environment

VMware Cloud Foundation 4.2.1

VMware Cloud Foundation 4.3.x

VMware Cloud Foundation 4.4.x

VMware Cloud Foundation 4.5.x

VMware Cloud Foundation 5.0.x

VMware Cloud Foundation 5.1.x

#### Cause

<https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX/4.1.2.5/rn/vmware-nsx-4125-release-notes/index.html>

#### Resolution

#### **Terminology**

l **Product Version**
The product patch you wish to apply on a VCF instance.

l **Patch Identifier**
<*Product Type*>:<*Product Version*>
Patch details to be passed as an argument to AP Tool --patch or --download options, used to uniquely identify the correct bundle artifacts to download and/or apply.

l **Patch Bundle Name**
The name identifier of the bundle, as seen on the VMware Depot.

**l Install Bundle Name**
Will be required only when SDDC Manager is on 5.2 version.

The install bundles for the versions of NSX Manager and vCenter Server that are running in the management domain must be available in SDDC Manager 5.2 before you can create a VI workload domain. For example, if you have patched the versions of NSX Manager and/or vCenter Server in the management domain to a version higher than what is listed in the BOM, you must download the new install bundles. See [Downloading Install Bundles for VMware Cloud Foundation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Foundation/5.2/vcf-admin/GUID-7F2C072D-D220-4C85-970D-FC6F62E37895.html).

l **Supported VCF SKU**
The type of VCF environment that the patch can be applied to. Below are 2 types of supported VCF SKUs:
1. VCF
2. VCF on VxRail

l **Prerequisites**
Any prerequisite steps that are required to be performed on the system prior to enabling the specified patch.

l **Minimum Target VCF Release**
The minimum recommended VCF release to upgrade to after applying a patch.
Example: If the minimum target VCF release is 4.5.x, then you must use a target VCF release of 4.5.0.0 or newer when enabling the future upgrade path.
**Note:** \* If you have applied multiple async patches to your VCF environment, look up the target VCF release recommended for each one and choose the highest of those. This is the target VCF release you should upgrade to, at minimum.

Applying an async patch to update a BOM component does not guarantee support for features introduced in the new version of the component. SDDC Manager supports the same features with the new version of the BOM component as it supported with the older version of the BOM component.

If you are looking for an individual product patch that is not listed or is not compatible with your environment, please contact VMware Support. Additionally, if you have applied a patch to your environment and would like to upgrade to a target VCF release that is not listed as being compatible, please contact VMware support.

#### Additional Information

Please refer to the [Async Patch Tool](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Foundation/services/ap-tool/GUID-49818DF1-94EA-4C85-8CB6-6EFFCE5F8060.html) for detailed instructions on utilizing the CLI tool to enable patches and enable forward upgrades in your VCF environment.

## Resolved Issues

## Install and Upgrade Issues

**vCenter 7.x installation might fail during firstboot with an error for a missing install parameter**While installing vCenter 7.x, you might see the error cis.exceptions.InstallParameterException during the firstboot step due to a missing upgrade.import.directory install parameter. The error occurs if vCenter does not find the parameter due to VM restarts, or restores to a VM Snapshot without memory before running the firstboot configuration.This issue is resolved in this release. The fix makes sure that the upgrade.import.directory install parameter is correctly passed during vCenter installation.
## Known Issues from Prior Releases

## vSphere Cluster Services Issues

**If all vSphere Cluster Service agent virtual machines in a cluster are down, vSphere DRS does not function in the cluster**If vSphere Cluster Service agent virtual machines fail to deploy or power on in a cluster, services such as vSphere DRS might be impacted.Workaround: For more information on the issue and workarounds, see VMware knowledge base article [79892](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/79892).**System virtual machines that support vSphere Cluster Services might impact cluster and datastore maintenance workflows**In vCenter Server 7.0 Update 1, vSphere Cluster Services adds a set of system virtual machines in every vSphere cluster to ensure the healthy operation of vSphere DRS. The system virtual machines deploy automatically with an implicit datastore selection logic. Depending on your cluster configuration, the system virtual machines might impact some of the cluster and datastore maintenance workflows.Workaround: For more information on the impacted workflows and possible workarounds, see VMware knowledge base articles [79892](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/79892) and [80483](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/80483).
## Installation, Upgrade, and Migration Issues

**Upgrade to vSphere 7.0 Update 3c might require additional steps to force a full host-sync**The supported upgrade sequence for vSphere systems is first to upgrade vCenter Server and then ESXi. However, in certain environments with ESXi hosts of version 7.0 Update 2d and later, you need to update ESXi first to 7.0 Update 3c and then vCenter Server. Such an upgrade sequence requires additional steps to force a full host-sync.Workaround: Log in to the appliance shell as a user with super administrative privileges (for example, root) and follow these steps:

- Stop the vpxd service.
- Run the command /opt/vmware/vpostgres/current/bin/psql -U postgres -d VCDB -c "update VPX\_HOST\_SYNC\_GEN set master\_gen=0 where host\_id in (select id from VPX\_HOST where product\_version like '7.0.3%')".
- Start the vpxd service.
**Hot-patched ESXi hosts with both i40en and i40enu Intel network drivers installed might fail to configure vSphere High Availability after upgrade to vCenter Server 7.0 Update 3c**Due to the name change in the Intel i40en driver to i40enu and back to i40en, vCenter Server 7.0 Update 3c adds an upgrade precheck to make sure that ESXi hosts affected from the change are properly upgraded. However, if you apply an ESXi hot patch that is released after vCenter Server 7.0 Update 3c and then upgrade your system to vCenter Server 7.0 Update 3c, the hot patch might not be listed in the precheck. As a result, you might not follow the proper steps to the upgrade and vSphere HA might fail to configure on such hosts.Workaround: Upgrade the hot-patched ESXi hosts to version 7.0 Update 3c.**The vCenter Upgrade/Migration pre-checks fail with "Unexpected error 87"**The vCenter Server Upgrade/Migration pre-checks fail when the Security Token Service (STS) certificate does not contain a Subject Alternative Name (SAN) field. This situation occurs when you have replaced the vCenter 5.5 Single Sign-On certificate with a custom certificate that has no SAN field, and you attempt to upgrade to vCenter Server 7.0. The upgrade considers the STS certificate invalid and the pre-checks prevent the upgrade process from continuing.Workaround: Replace the STS certificate with a valid certificate that contains a SAN field then proceed with the vCenter Server 7.0 Upgrade/Migration.**Problems upgrading to vSphere 7.0 with pre-existing CIM providers**After upgrade, previously installed 32-bit CIM providers stop working because ESXi requires 64-bit CIM providers. Customers may lose management API functions related to CIMPDK, NDDK (native DDK), HEXDK, VAIODK (IO filters), and see errors related to **uwglibc** dependency.The syslog reports module missing, "32 bit shared libraries not loaded."Workaround: There is no workaround. The fix is to download new 64-bit CIM providers from your vendor.**Patching to vCenter Server 7.0 Update 1 from earlier versions of vCenter Server 7.x is blocked when vCenter Server High Availability is enabled**Patching to vCenter Server 7.0 Update 1 from earlier versions of vCenter Server 7.x is blocked when vCenter Server High Availability is active.Workaround: To patch your system to vCenter Server 7.0 Update 1 from earlier versions of vCenter Server 7.x, you must remove vCenter Server High Availability and delete the passive and witness nodes. After the upgrade, you must re-create your vCenter Server High Availability clusters.**Migration of a 6.7.x vCenter Server system to vCenter Server 7.x fails with an UnicodeEncodeError**If you select the option to import all data for configuration, inventory, tasks, events, and performance metrics, the migration of a 6.7.x vCenter Server system to vCenter Server 7.x might fail for any vCenter Server system that uses a non-English locale. At step 1 of stage 2 of the migration, in the vSphere Client, you see an error such as:Error while exporting events and tasks data: …ERROR UnicodeEncodeError: Traceback (most recent call last):Workaround: You can complete the migration operation by doing either:

* Select the default option **Configuration and Inventory** at the end of stage 1 of the migration.This option does not include tasks and events data.
* Clean the data in the events tables and run the migration again.
**If a Windows vCenter Server system has a database password containing non-ASCII characters, pre-checks of the VMware Migration Assistant fail**If you try to migrate a 6.x vCenter Server system to vCenter Server 7.x by using the VMware Migration Assistant, and your system has a Windows OS, and uses an external database with a password containing non-ASCII characters, the operation fails. For example, Admin!23迁移. In the Migration Assistant console, you see the following error:Error:Component com.vmware.vcdb failed with internal errorResolution:File Bugzilla PR to VPX/VPX/vcdb-upgradeWorkaround: None**During an update from vCenter Server 7.x to vCenter Server 7.0 Update 1, you get prompts to provide the vCenter Single Sign-On password**During an update from vCenter Server 7.x to vCenter Server 7.0 Update 1, you get prompts to provide vCenter Single Sign-On administrator password.Workaround: If you run the update by using the vCenter Server Management Interface, you must provide the vCenter Single Sign-On administrator password.If you run the update by using software-packages or CLI in an interactive manner, you must interactively provide the vCenter Single Sign-On administrator password.If you run the update by using software-packages or CLI in a non-interactive manner, you must provide the vCenter Single Sign-On administrator password by an answer file in the format{ "vmdir.password": "SSO Password of Administrator@<SSO-DOMAIN> user" }**Smart Card and RSA SecurID authentication might stop working after upgrading to vCenter Server 7.0**If you have configured vCenter Server for either Smart Card or RSA SecurID authentication, see the VMware knowledge base article at <https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/78057> before starting the vSphere 7.0 upgrade process. If you do not perform the workaround as described in the KB, you might see the following error messages and Smart Card or RSA SecurID authentication does not work."Smart card authentication may stop working. Smart card settings may not be preserved, and smart card authentication may stop working."or"RSA SecurID authentication may stop working. RSA SecurID settings may not be preserved, and RSA SecurID authentication may stop working."Workaround: Before upgrading to vSphere 7.0, see the VMware knowledge base article at <https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/78057>.**You might not be able to apply or remove NSX while you add ESXi hosts by using a vSphere Lifecycle Manager image to a cluster with enabled VMware vSphere High Availability**If you start an operation to apply or remove NSX while adding multiple ESXi hosts by using a vSphere Lifecycle Manager image to a vSphere HA-enabled cluster, the NSX-related operations might fail with an error in the vSphere Client such as:vSphere HA agent on some of the hosts on cluster <cluster\_name> is neither vSphere HA master agent nor connected to vSphere HA master agent. Verify that the HA configuration is correct.The issue occurs because vSphere Lifecycle Manager configures vSphere HA for the ESXi hosts being added to the cluster one at a time. If you run an operation to apply or remove NSX while vSphere HA configure operations are still in progress, NSX operations might queue up between the vSphere HA configure operations for two different ESXi hosts. In such a case, the NSX operation fails with a cluster health check error, because the state of the cluster at that point does not match the expected state that all ESXi hosts have vSphere HA configured and running. The more ESXi hosts you add to a cluster at the same time, the more likely the issue is to occur.
Workaround: Deactivate and enable Sphere HA on the cluster. Proceed with the operations to apply or remove NSX.
**After an upgrade of a vCenter Server 7.0 system, you cannot see the IP addresses of pods in the vSphere Pod Summary tab of the vSphere Client**If you upgrade your vCenter Server 7.0 system to a later version, you can no longer see the IP addresses of pods in the **vSphere Pod Summary** tab of the vSphere Client.Workaround: Use the Kubernetes CLI Tools for vSphere to review details of pods:

- As a prerequisite, copy the pod and namespace names.
  * In the vSphere Client, navigate to **Workload Management** > **Clusters.**
  * Copy the IP displayed in the **Control Plane Node IP Address** tab.
  * You can navigate to https://<control\_plane\_node\_IP\_address> and download the Kubernetes CLI Tools, kubectl and kubectl-vsphere.Alternatively, follow the steps in [Download and Install the Kubernetes CLI Tools for vSphere](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/vmware-vsphere-with-kubernetes/GUID-0F6E45C4-3CB1-4562-9370-686668519FCA.html).
- Use the CLI plug-in for vSphere to review the pod details.
  - Log in to the Supervisor cluster by using the commandkubectl vsphere login --server=https://<server\_adress> --vsphere-username <your user account name> --insecure-skip-tls-verify
  - By using the names copied in step 1, run the commands for retrieving the pod details:kubectl config use-context <namespace\_name> andkubectl describe pod <pod\_name> -n <namespace\_name>

​As a result, you can see the IP address in an output similar to:$ kubectl describe pod helloworld -n my-podvm-ns ... Status: RunningIP: 10.0.0.10 IPs:  IP: 10.0.0.10 ...**Upgrading a vCenter Server with an external Platform Services Controller from 6.7u3 to 7.0 fails with VMAFD error**When you upgrade a vCenter Server deployment using an external Platform Services Controller, you converge the Platform Services Controller into a vCenter Server appliance. If the upgrade fails with the error install.vmafd.vmdir\_vdcpromo\_error\_21, the VMAFD firstboot process has failed. The VMAFD firstboot process copies the VMware Directory Service Database (data.mdb) from the source Platform Services Controller and replication partner vCenter Server appliance.Workaround: Deactivate TCP Segmentation Offload (TSO) and Generic Segmentation Offload (GSO) on the Ethernet adapter of the source Platform Services Controller or replication partner vCenter Server appliance before upgrading a vCenter Server with an external Platform Services Controller. See Knowledge Base article: https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/74678**vCenter Server system upgrades fail in the pre-check stage**Upgrades of your vCenter Server system might fail in the pre-check stage due to a limit in the authorization (Authz) connections. In the /var/log/vmware/vpxd-svcs/vpxd-svcs\*.log file you see entries such as:Session count for user [after add]: *<DOMAIN-NAME>*\machine-xxxx is 200​Session limit reached for user: *<DOMAIN-NAME>*\machine-xxxx with 200 sessions.You might also see delayed response from the vSphere Client to load the inventory.Workaround: Restart vmware-vpxd-svcs in your vCenter Server system by using the command service-control --restart vmware-vpxd-svcs. Use the command only when no other activity runs in the vCenter Server system to avoid any interruptions to the workflow. For more information, see VMware knowledge base article [81953](http://kb.vmware.com/s/article/81953).**Upgrading vCenter Server using the CLI incorrectly preserves the Transport Security Layer (TLS) configuration for the vSphere Authentication Proxy service**If the vSphere Authentication Proxy service (vmcam) is configured to use a particular TLS protocol other than the default TLS 1.2 protocol, this configuration is preserved during the CLI upgrade process. By default, vSphere supports the TLS 1.2 encryption protocol. If you must use the TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 protocols to support products or services that do not support TLS 1.2, use the TLS Configurator Utility to enable or deactivate different TLS protocol versions.Workaround: Use the TLS Configurator Utility to configure the vmcam port. To learn how to manage TLS protocol configuration and use the TLS Configurator Utility, see the *VMware Security* documentation.**You do not see a precheck error when patching to vCenter Server 7.0 Update 3c by using CLI**Due to the name change in the Intel i40en driver to i40enu and back to i40en, vCenter Server 7.0 Update 3c adds an upgrade precheck to make sure that ESXi hosts affected from the change are properly upgraded. In some cases, if such hosts exist in your system, patching from an vCenter Server version earlier than 7.0 Update 3 to a version later than 7.0 Update 3 by using CLI might fail with the error Installation failed. Retry to resume from the current state. Or please collect the VC support bundle..However, instead of this error, you must see the precheck error message. Workaround: If you do not see the precheck error and patching your system to vCenter Server 7.0 Update 3c fails, make sure all ESXi hosts are upgraded to ESXi 7.0 Update 3c or higher, by using either a baseline created from an ISO or a single image, before upgrading vCenter Server. Do not use patch baselines based on the rollup bulletin. You can find additional debug log information at /var/log/vmware/applmgmt. For more details, see VMware knowledge base articles [87319](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/87319) and [86447](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/86447).**Smart card and RSA SecurID settings may not be preserved during vCenter Server upgrade**Authentication using RSA SecurID will not work after upgrading to vCenter Server 7.0. An error message will alert you to this issue when attempting to login using your RSA SecurID login.Workaround: Reconfigure the smart card or RSA SecureID.**Upgrade to vSphere 7.0 Update 3c might require additional steps to force a full host-sync**The supported upgrade sequence for vSphere systems is first to upgrade vCenter Server and then ESXi. However, in certain environments with ESXi hosts of version 7.0 Update 2c and later, you need to update ESXi first to 7.0 Update 3c and then vCenter Server. Such an upgrade sequence requires additional steps to force a full host-sync.Workaround: Log in to the appliance shell as a user with super administrative privileges (for example, root) and follow these steps:

- Stop the vpxd service.
- Run the command /opt/vmware/vpostgres/current/bin/psql -U postgres -d VCDB -c "update VPX\_HOST\_SYNC\_GEN set master\_gen=0 where host\_id in (select id from VPX\_HOST where product\_version like '7.0.3%')".
- Start the vpxd service.
**Migration of vCenter Server for Windows to vCenter Server appliance 7.0 fails with network error message**Migration of vCenter Server for Windows to vCenter Server appliance 7.0 fails with the error message IP already exists in the network. This prevents the migration process from configuring the network parameters on the new vCenter Server appliance. For more information, examine the log file: /var/log/vmware/upgrade/UpgradeRunner.logWorkaround:

- Verify that all Windows Updates have been completed on the source vCenter Server for Windows instance, or deactivate automatic Windows Updates until after the migration finishes.
- Retry the migration of vCenter Server for Windows to vCenter Server appliance 7.0.

**Hot-patched ESXi hosts with both i40en and i40enu Intel network drivers installed might fail to configure vSphere High Availability after upgrade to vCenter Server 7.0 Update 3c**Due to the name change in the Intel i40en driver to i40enu and back to i40en, vCenter Server 7.0 Update 3c adds an upgrade precheck to make sure that ESXi hosts affected from the change are properly upgraded. However, if you apply an ESXi hot patch that is released after vCenter Server 7.0 Update 3c and then upgrade your system to vCenter Server 7.0 Update 3c, the hot patch might not be listed in the precheck. As a result, you might not follow the proper steps to the upgrade and vSphere HA might fail to configure on such hosts.Workaround: Upgrade the hot-patched ESXi hosts to version 7.0 Update 3c.**When you configure the number of virtual functions for an SR-IOV device by using the max\_vfs module parameter, the changes might not take effect**In vSphere 7.0, you can configure the number of virtual functions for an SR-IOV device by using the Virtual Infrastructure Management (VIM) API, for example, through the vSphere Client. The task does not require reboot of the ESXi host. After you use the VIM API configuration, if you try to configure the number of SR-IOV virtual functions by using the max\_vfs module parameter, the changes might not take effect because they are overridden by the VIM API configuration.Workaround: None. To configure the number of virtual functions for an SR-IOV device, use the same method every time. Use the VIM API or use the max\_vfs module parameter and reboot the ESXi host.**Upgraded vCenter Server appliance instance does not retain all the secondary networks (NICs) from the source instance**During a major upgrade, if the source instance of the vCenter Server appliance is configured with multiple secondary networks other than the VCHA NIC, the target vCenter Server instance will not retain secondary networks other than the VCHA NIC. If the source instance is configured with multiple NICs that are part of VDS port groups, the NIC configuration will not be preserved during the upgrade. Configurations for vCenter Server appliance instances that are part of the standard port group will be preserved.Workaround: None. Manually configure the secondary network in the target vCenter Server appliance instance.**After upgrading or migrating a vCenter Server with an external Platform Services Controller, users authenticating using Active Directory lose access to the newly upgraded vCenter Server instance**After upgrading or migrating a vCenter Server with an external Platform Services Controller, if the newly upgraded vCenter Server is not joined to an Active Directory domain, users authenticating using Active Directory will lose access to the vCenter Server instance.Workaround: Verify that the new vCenter Server instance has been joined to an Active Directory domain. See Knowledge Base article: https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2118543**Migrating a vCenter Server for Windows with an external Platform Services Controller using an Oracle database fails**If there are non-ASCII strings in the Oracle events and tasks table the migration can fail when exporting events and tasks data. The following error message is provided: UnicodeDecodeErrorWorkaround: None.**After an ESXi host upgrade, a Host Profile compliance check shows non-compliant status while host remediation tasks fail**The non-compliant status indicates an inconsistency between the profile and the host.This inconsistency might occur because ESXi 7.0 does not allow duplicate claim rules, but the profile you use contains duplicate rules. For example, if you attempt to use the Host Profile that you extracted from the host before upgrading ESXi 6.5 or ESXi 6.7 to version 7.0 and the Host Profile contains any duplicate claim rules of system default rules, you might experience the problems.Workaround:

- Remove any duplicate claim rules of the system default rules from the Host Profile document.
- Check the compliance status.
- Remediate the host.
- If the previous steps do not help, reboot the host.

**Error message displays in the vCenter Server Management Interface**After installing or upgrading to vCenter Server 7.0, when you navigate to the Update panel within the vCenter Server Management Interface, the error message "Check the URL and try again" displays. The error message does not prevent you from using the functions within the Update panel, and you can view, stage, and install any available updates.Workaround: None.**Patching witness or passive nodes of environments with VMware vCenter Server High Availability enabled might fail**In environments with vCenter Server High Availability enabled, patching a witness or passive node might fail with a message similar to:​RuntimeError: unidentifiable C++ exception.
Workaround: Deactivate vCenter Server High Availability. Apply patches to your vCenter Server system. Re-enable vCenter Server High Availability.**After patching your vCenter Server system to vCenter Server 7.0.0a, the TLS version of the VC Storage Clients might revert to the default**If you have a TLS configuration for the VC Storage Clients service different from the default TLS 1.2 only, the TLS version might revert to the default after patching your vCenter Server system to vCenter Server 7.0.0a.Workaround: Use the TLS Configuration utility to enable or deactivate TLS versions on your vCenter Server system after the update.**After updating your system to vCenter Server 7.0.0b, you see systemd core dump in the /var/core folder**After updating your system to vCenter Server 7.0.0b from either vCenter Server 7.0.0a or vCenter Server 7.0, in the /var/core folder you see systemd core dump, such as core.systemd-journal.393 and core.systemd-udevd.405. The core dump is harmless and can be removed.Workaround: None**After updating your vCenter Server system to 7.0.0b, the vCenter Server version is not updated in the Direct Console User Interface (DCUI)**After updating your system to vCenter Server 7.0.0b from vCenter Server 7.0.0a or vCenter Server 7.0, you still see the previous vCenter Server version in the DCUI.Workaround: After you complete the update, to refresh the vCenter Server version, in the appliance shell, run the command /usr/lib/applmgmt/dcui/notify.**Update Planner fails with error Configured repository is not accessible due to network connectivity or incorrect URL**If you use Update Planner, which is part of vSphere Lifecycle Manager used to facilitate vCenter Server updates, you might see the following error in the vSphere Client:Configured repository is not accessible due to network connectivity or incorrect URL. Verify the repository settings.The issue occurs when you use a custom local repository, such as https:///uploads/dpe/ or a DBC path, to store the extracted . If the custom repository for URL-based patching has an authentication policy, Update Planner might not be able to fetch the list of available updates.
Workaround: Configure the custom repository such that authentication is not needed to access the custom repository URL.**After upgrading to vCenter Server 7.0.0b, you see vSphere HA errors on vSphere Lifecycle Manager Image based clusters**After upgrading to vCenter Server 7.0.0b, on vSphere Lifecycle Manager Image based clusters that are configured with vSphere HA, you might see error messages about the vSphere HA configuration after logging in for the first time to the environment. In the vSphere Client, you see messages such as:Cannot complete the configuration of the vSphere HA agent on the host. or
Applying HA VIBs on the cluster encountered a failure.The issue occurs because exports of the image depot might take long and cause a timeout of the task. In the/storage/log/vmware/vmware-updatemgr/vum-server/vmware-vum-server.log you see this message: ​Export taking too long (Failure case)Workaround: This is a transient issue that resolves in 10 minutes after the vCenter Server is up and running. The issue does not affect any functionality. vSphere HA on the affected clusters operates as expected. All operations related to virtual machines, such as power on and migration, work across the vSphere HA-enabled clusters while this error recovery is still in progress. **You do not see a precheck error when patching to vCenter Server 7.0 Update 3d by using CLI**Due to the name change in the Intel i40en driver to i40enu and back to i40en, vCenter Server 7.0 Update 3d and later add an upgrade precheck to make sure that ESXi hosts affected from the change are properly upgraded. In some cases, if such hosts exist in your system, patching from a vCenter Server version earlier than 7.0 Update 3 to a version later than 7.0 Update 3 by using CLI might fail with the error Installation failed. Retry to resume from the current state. Or please collect the VC support bundle.. However, instead of this error, you must see the precheck error message. Workaround: If you do not see the precheck error and patching your system to vCenter Server 7.0 Update 3d fails, make sure all ESXi hosts are upgraded to ESXi 7.0 Update 3d, by using either a baseline created from an ISO or a single image, before upgrading vCenter Server. Do not use patch baselines based on the rollup bulletin. You can find additional debug log information at /var/log/vmware/applmgmt.

## Security Features Issues

**Encrypted virtual machine fails to power on when HA-enabled Trusted Cluster contains an unattested host**In VMware® vSphere Trust Authority™, if you have enabled HA on the Trusted Cluster and one or more hosts in the cluster fails attestation, an encrypted virtual machine cannot power on.Workaround: Either remove or remediate all hosts that failed attestation from the Trusted Cluster.**Encrypted virtual machine fails to power on when DRS-enabled Trusted Cluster contains an unattested host**In VMware® vSphere Trust Authority™, if you have enabled DRS on the Trusted Cluster and one or more hosts in the cluster fails attestation, DRS might try to power on an encrypted virtual machine on an unattested host in the cluster. This operation puts the virtual machine in a locked state.Workaround: Either remove or remediate all hosts that failed attestation from the Trusted Cluster.**Migrating or cloning encrypted virtual machines across <span>vCenter Server</span> instances fails when attempting to do so using the vSphere Client**If you try to migrate or clone an encrypted virtual machine across vCenter Server instances using the vSphere Client, the operation fails with the following error message: "The operation is not allowed in the current state."Workaround: You must use the vSphere APIs to migrate or clone encrypted virtual machines across vCenter Server instances.
## Networking Issues

**When you use the VMware Remote Console, the envoy service might intermittently fail**An issue with the envoy service specific to the VMware Remote Console might lead to intermittent failures of the service. As a result, the vCenter Server Management Interface or vCenter Server APIs might also become unavailable.Workaround: Use the vSphere Client as an alternative to the VMware Remote Console.**Reduced throughput in networking performance on Intel 82599/X540/X550 NICs**The new queue-pair feature added to ixgben driver to improve networking performance on Intel 82599EB/X540/X550 series NICs might reduce throughput under some workloads in vSphere 7.0 as compared to vSphere 6.7.Workaround: To achieve the same networking performance as vSphere 6.7, you can deactivate the queue-pair with a module parameter. To deactivate the queue-pair, run the command:# esxcli system module parameters set -p "QPair=0,0,0,0..." -m ixgbenAfter running the command, reboot.**If you try to deactivate vSphere with Tanzu on a vSphere cluster, the operation stops with an error**If some virtual machines outside of a Supervisor Cluster reside on any of the NSX segment port groups on the cluster, the cleanup script cannot delete such ports and deactivate vSphere with Tanzu on the cluster. In the vSphere Client, you see the error Cleanup requests to NSX Manager failed and the operation stops at Removing status. In the/var/log/vmware/wcp/wcpsvc.log file, you see an error message such asSegment path=[...] has x VMs or VIFs attached. Disconnect all VMs and VIFs before deleting a segment.Workaround: Delete the virtual machines indicated in the /var/log/vmware/wcp/wcpsvc.log file from the segment. Wait for the operation to restore.**After upgrading to NSX 6.4.7, when a static IPv6 address is assigned to workload VMs on an IPv6 network, the VMs are unable to ping the IPv6 gateway interface of the edge**This issue occurs after upgrading the vSphere Distributed Switches from 6.x to 7.0.Workaround 1:Select the VDS where all the hosts are connected, go to the **Edit** setting, and under **Multicast** option switch to basic.Workaround 2:Add the following rules on the edge firewall:Ping allow rule.Multicast Listener Discover (MLD) allow rule, which are icmp6, type 130 (v1) and type 143 (v2).**High throughput virtual machines may experience degradation in network performance when Network I/O Control (NetIOC) is enabled**Virtual machines requiring high network throughput can experience throughput degradation when upgrading from vSphere 6.7 to vSphere 7.0 with NetIOC enabled.Workaround: Adjust the ethernetx.ctxPerDev setting to enable multiple worlds.**IPv6 traffic fails to pass through VMkernel ports using IPsec**When you migrate VMkernel ports from one port group to another, IPv6 traffic does not pass through VMkernel ports using IPsec.Workaround: Remove the IPsec security association (SA) from the affected server, and then reapply the SA. To learn how to set and remove an IPsec SA, see the *vSphere Security* documentation.**Higher ESX network performance with a portion of CPU usage increase**ESX network performance may increase with a portion of CPU usage.Workaround: Remove and add the network interface with only 1 rx dispatch queue. For example:esxcli network ip interface remove --interface-name=vmk1esxcli network ip interface add --interface-name=vmk1 --num-rxqueue=1**VM might lose Ethernet traffic after hot-add, hot-remove or storage vMotion**A VM might stop receiving Ethernet traffic after a hot-add, hot-remove or storage vMotion. This issue affects VMs where the uplink of the VNIC has SR-IOV enabled. PVRDMA virtual NIC exhibits this issue when the uplink of the virtual network is a Mellanox RDMA capable NIC and RDMA namespaces are configured.Workaround: You can hot-remove and hot-add the affected Ethernet NICs of the VM to restore traffic. On Linux guest operating systems, restarting the network might also resolve the issue. If these workarounds have no effect, you can reboot the VM to restore network connectivity.**Change of IP address for a VCSA deployed with static IP address requires that you create the DNS records in advance**With the introduction of the DDNS, the DNS record update only works for VCSA deployed with DHCP configured networking. While changing the IP address of the vCenter server via VAMI, the following error is displayed:The specified IP address does not resolve to the specified hostname.Workaround: There are two possible workarounds.

- Create an additional DNS entry with the same FQDN and desired IP address. Log in to the VAMI and follow the steps to change the IP address.
- Log in to the VCSA using ssh. Execute the following script:./opt/vmware/share/vami/vami\_config\_netUse option 6 to change the IP adddress of eth0. Once changed, execute the following script:./opt/likewise/bin/lw-update-dnsRestart all the services on the VCSA to update the IP information on the DNS server.
**It may take several seconds for the NSX Distributed Virtual Port Group (NSX DVPG) to be removed after deleting the corresponding logical switch in NSX Manager.**As the number of logical switches increases, it may take more time for the NSX DVPG in vCenter Server to be removed after deleting the corresponding logical switch in NSX Manager. In an environment with 12000 logical switches, it takes approximately 10 seconds for an NSX DVPG to be deleted from vCenter Server.Workaround: None.**Hostd runs out of memory and fails if a large number of NSX Distributed Virtual port groups are created.**In vSphere 7.0, NSX Distributed Virtual port groups consume significantly larger amounts of memory than opaque networks. For this reason, NSX Distributed Virtual port groups can not support the same scale as an opaque network given the same amount of memory.Workaround:To support the use of NSX Distributed Virtual port groups, increase the amount of memory in your ESXi hosts. If you verify that your system has adequate memory to support your VMs, you can directly increase the memory of hostd using the following command.localcli --plugin-dir /usr/lib/vmware/esxcli/int/ sched group setmemconfig --group-path host/vim/vmvisor/hostd --units mb --min 2048 --max 2048Note that this will cause hostd to use memory normally reserved for your environment's VMs. This may have the affect of reducing the number of VMs your ESXi host can support.**DRS may incorrectly launch vMotion if the network reservation is configured on a VM**If the network reservation is configured on a VM, it is expected that DRS only migrates the VM to a host that meets the specified requirements. In a cluster with NSX transport nodes, if some of the transport nodes join the transport zone by NSX-T Virtual Distributed Switch (N-VDS), and others by vSphere Distributed Switch (VDS) 7.0, DRS may incorrectly launch vMotion. You might encounter this issue when:

* The VM connects to an NSX logical switch configured with a network reservation.
* Some transport nodes join transport zone using N-VDS, and others by VDS 7.0, or, transport nodes join the transport zone through different VDS 7.0 instances.

Workaround: Make all transport nodes join the transport zone by N-VDS or the same VDS 7.0 instance.**When adding a VMkernel NIC (vmknic) to an NSX portgroup, vCenter Server reports the error "Connecting VMKernel adapter to a NSX Portgroup on a Stateless host is not a supported operation. Please use Distributed Port Group instead."**

* For stateless ESXi on Distributed Virtual Switch (VDS), the vmknic on a NSX port group is blocked. You must instead use a Distributed Port Group.
* For stateful ESXi on VDS, vmknic on NSX port group is supported, but vSAN may have an issue if it is using vmknic on a NSX port group.

Workaround: Use a Distributed Port Group on the same VDS.**Enabling SRIOV from vCenter for QLogic 4x10GE QL41164HFCU CNA might fail**If you navigate to the **Edit Settings** dialog for physical network adapters and attempt to enable SR-IOV, the operation might fail when using QLogic 4x10GE QL41164HFCU CNA. Attempting to enable SR-IOV might lead to a network outage of the ESXi host.Workaround: Use the following command on the ESXi host to enable SRIOV:esxcfg-module
## Storage Issues

**VMFS datastores are not mounted automatically after disk hot remove and hot insert on HPE Gen10 servers with SmartPQI controllers**When SATA disks on HPE Gen10 servers with SmartPQI controllers without expanders are hot removed and hot inserted back to a different disk bay of the same machine, or when multiple disks are hot removed and hot inserted back in a different order, sometimes a new local name is assigned to the disk. The VMFS datastore on that disk appears as a snapshot and will not be mounted back automatically because the device name has changed.Workaround: None. SmartPQI controller does not support unordered hot remove and hot insert operations.**ESXi might terminate I/O to NVMeOF devices due to errors on all active paths**Occasionally, all active paths to NVMeOF device register I/O errors due to link issues or controller state. If the status of one of the paths changes to Dead, the High Performance Plug-in (HPP) might not select another path if it shows high volume of errors. As a result, the I/O fails.Workaround: Deactivate the configuration option **/Misc/HppManageDegradedPaths** to unblock the I/O.**VOMA check on NVMe based VMFS datastores fails with error**VOMA check is not supported for NVMe based VMFS datastores and will fail with the error:
```
ERROR: Failed to reserve device. Function not implemented
```
Example:
```
# voma -m vmfs -f check -d /vmfs/devices/disks/: <partition#>
Running VMFS Checker version 2.1 in check mode
Initializing LVM metadata, Basic Checks will be done

Checking for filesystem activity
Performing filesystem liveness check..|Scanning for VMFS-6 host activity (4096 bytes/HB, 1024 HBs).
ERROR: Failed to reserve device. Function not implemented
Aborting VMFS volume check
VOMA failed to check device : General Error
```
Workaround: None. If you need to analyse VMFS metadata, collect it using the -l option, and pass to VMware customer support. The command for collecting the dump is:
```
voma -l -f dump -d /vmfs/devices/disks/:<partition#>
```
**Using the VM reconfigure API to attach an encrypted First Class Disk to an encrypted virtual machine might fail with error**If an FCD and a VM are encrypted with different crypto keys, your attempts to attach the encrypted FCD to the encrypted VM using the VM reconfigure API might fail with the error message:
```
Cannot decrypt disk because key or password is incorrect.
```
Workaround: Use the attachDisk API rather than the VM reconfigure API to attach an encrypted FCD to an encrypted VM.**ESXi host might get in non responding state if a non-head extent of its spanned VMFS datastore enters the Permanent Device Loss (PDL) state**This problem does not occur when a non-head extent of the spanned VMFS datastore fails along with the head extent. In this case, the entire datastore becomes inaccessible and no longer allows I/Os.In contrast, when only a non-head extent fails, but the head extent remains accessible, the datastore heartbeat appears to be normal. And the I/Os between the host and the datastore continue. However, any I/Os that depend on the failed non-head extent start failing as well. Other I/O transactions might accumulate while waiting for the failing I/Os to resolve, and cause the host to enter the non responding state.Workaround: Fix the PDL condition of the non-head extent to resolve this issue.**After recovering from APD or PDL conditions, VMFS datastore with enabled support for clustered virtual disks might remain inaccessible**You can encounter this problem only on datastores where the clustered virtual disk support is enabled. When the datastore recovers from an All Paths Down (APD) or Permanent Device Loss (PDL) condition, it remains inaccessible. The VMkernel log might show multiple SCSI3 reservation conflict  messages similar to the following:2020-02-18T07:41:10.273Z cpu22:1001391219)ScsiDeviceIO: vm 1001391219: SCSIDeviceCmdCompleteCB:2972: Reservation conflict retries 544 for command 0x45ba814b8340 (op: 0x89) to device "naa.624a9370b97601e346f64ba900024d53"The problem can occur because the ESXi host participating in the cluster loses SCSI reservations for the datastore and cannot always reacquire them automatically after the datastore recovers.Workaround: Manually register the reservation using the following command:vmkfstools -L registerkey /vmfs/devices/disks/<device name>where the <device name> is the name of the device on which the datastore is created.**Virtual NVMe Controller is the default disk controller for Windows 10 guest operating systems**The Virtual NVMe Controller is the default disk controller for the following guest operating systems when using Hardware Version 15 or later:Windows 10Windows Server 2016Windows Server 2019Some features might not be available when using a Virtual NVMe Controller. For more information, see <https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2147714>**Note**: Some clients use the previous default of LSI Logic SAS. This includes ESXi host client and PowerCLI.Workaround: If you need features not available on Virtual NVMe, switch to VMware Paravirtual SCSI (PVSCSI) or LSI Logic SAS. For information on using VMware Paravirtual SCSI (PVSCSI), see <https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/1010398>**After an ESXi host upgrade to vSphere 7.0, presence of duplicate core claim rules might cause unexpected behavior**Claim rules determine which multipathing plugin, such as NMP, HPP, and so on, owns paths to a particular storage device. ESXi 7.0 does not support duplicate claim rules. However, the ESXi 7.0 host does not alert you if you add duplicate rules to the existing claim rules inherited through an upgrade from a legacy release. As a result of using duplicate rules, storage devices might be claimed by unintended plugins, which can cause unexpected outcome.Workaround: Do not use duplicate core claim rules. Before adding a new claim rule, delete any existing matching claim rule.**A CNS query with the compliance status filter set might take unusually long time to complete**The CNS QueryVolume API enables you to obtain information about the CNS volumes, such as volume health and compliance status. When you check the compliance status of individual volumes, the results are obtained quickly. However, when you invoke the CNS QueryVolume API to check the compliance status of multiple volumes, several tens or hundreds, the query might perform slowly.Workaround: Avoid using bulk queries. When you need to get compliance status, query one volume at a time or limit the number of volumes in the query API to 20 or fewer. While using the query, avoid running other CNS operations to get the best performance.**<span style="color:#CC0000">New</span> Deleted CNS volumes might temporarily appear as existing in the CNS UI**After you delete an FCD disk that backs a CNS volume, the volume might still show up as existing in the CNS UI. However, your attempts to delete the volume fail. You might see an error message similar to the following:The object or item referred to could not be found.
Workaround: The next full synchronization will resolve the inconsistency and correctly update the CNS UI.**<span style="color:#CC0000">New</span> Under certain circumstances, while a CNS operation fails, the task status appears as successful in the vSphere Client**This might occur when, for example, you use an incompliant storage policy to create a CNS volume. The operation fails, while the vSphere Client shows the task status as successful.Workaround: The successful task status in the vSphere Client does not guarantee that the CNS operation succeeded. To make sure the operation succeeded, verify its results.**<span style="color:#CC0000">New</span> Unsuccessful delete operation for a CNS persistent volume might leave the volume undeleted on the vSphere datastore**This issue might occur when the CNS Delete API attempts to delete a persistent volume that is still attached to a pod. For example, when you delete the Kubernetes namespace where the pod runs. As a result, the volume gets cleared from CNS and the CNS query operation does not return the volume. However, the volume continues to reside on the datastore and cannot be deleted through the repeated CNS Delete API operations.Workaround: None.
## vCenter Server and vSphere Client Issues

**You do not see the VLAN ID in the port properties page of a VMkernel network adapter in the vSphere Client**In the vSphere Client, when you follow the path Host > Add Networking, after you select a VMkernel network adapter and an existing standard switch, in the Port properties page you might not see the VLAD ID. The issue occurs because the VLAN ID component is part of the network-ui module, which is lazy loaded and needs a trigger to refresh.Workaround: Go to Host > Configure > Networking > Virtual Switches to trigger the loading of the network ui module and the VLAD ID appears.**Vendor providers go offline after a PNID change​**When you change the vCenter IP address (PNID change), the registered vendor providers go offline.Workaround: Re-register the vendor providers.**You see a message Error retrieving when trying to view the status of Key Management Server (KMS) instances in the vSphere Client**In the vSphere Client, you might see a message Error retrieving for several minutes when trying to view Key Management Server (KMS) instances. The issue occurs when a KMS instance in a standard key provider loses connectivity. Until all network requests to the affected KMS time out, which takes around 4 minutes, you cannot see the status of any KMS instance in your system, only the error message for the key provider. After the timeout, you can see the status of all KMS instances.Workaround: If you see the Error retrieving message, wait for 4 minutes.**Cross vCenter migration of a virtual machine fails with an error**When you use cross vCenter vMotion to move a VM's storage and host to a different vCenter server instance, you might receive the error The operation is not allowed in the current state.This error appears in the UI wizard after the Host Selection step and before the Datastore Selection step, in cases where the VM has an assigned storage policy containing host-based rules such as encryption or any other IO filter rule.Workaround: Assign the VM and its disks to a storage policy without host-based rules. You might need to decrypt the VM if the source VM is encrypted. Then retry the cross vCenter vMotion action.**Due to a default timeout setting of 2 minutes, log in to vCenter instances in Enhanced Linked Mode takes long when any of the vCenters is down**When you have a number of vCenter instances in Enhanced Linked Mode, if one of the instances is down for some reason, such as maintenance, log in to the other instances might take up to 2 minutes, which is the default timeout setting. Changing the timeout property that specifies the wait time for log in to linked vCenter instances is a complex task that requires manually editing the LinkedVcGroup.login.timeout property located in vim-commons-vsphere.properties. To simlify the task, starting with vCenter Server 7.0 Update 3l, the setting LinkedVcGroup.login.timeout=120000 moves from vim-commons-vsphere.properties to the webclient.properties file. Editing this option allows you to reduce the wait time so that if one of the vCenter logins is taking more time, it does not affect the log in time for other instances.Workaround: Edit /etc/vmware/vsphere-ui/webclient.properties and change the value of LinkedVcGroup.login.timeout from 120000 to a smaller value in milliseconds, but consider that a value of <= 0 is an infinite timeout.**Storage Sensors information in Hardware Health tab shows incorrect values on vCenter UI, host UI, and MOB**When you navigate to **Host > Monitor > Hardware Health > Storage Sensors** on vCenter UI, the storage information displays either incorrect or unknown values. The same issue is observed on the host UI and the MOB path “runtime.hardwareStatusInfo.storageStatusInfo” as well.Workaround: None.**vSphere UI host advanced settings shows the current product locker location as empty with an empty default**vSphere UI host advanced settings shows the current product locker location as empty with an empty default. This is inconsistent as the actual product location symlink is created and valid. This causes confusion to the user. The default cannot be corrected from UI.Workaround: User can use the esxcli command on the host to correct the current product locker location default as below.1. Remove the existing Product Locker Location setting with: "esxcli system settings advanced remove -o ProductLockerLocation"2. Re-add the Product Locker Location setting with the appropriate default: 2.a. If the ESXi is a full installation, the default value is "/locker/packages/vmtoolsRepo" export PRODUCT\_LOCKER\_DEFAULT="/locker/packages/vmtoolsRepo" 2.b. If the ESXi is a PXEboot configuration such as autodeploy, the default value is: "/vmtoolsRepo" export PRODUCT\_LOCKER\_DEFAULT="/vmtoolsRepo" Run the following command to automatically figure out the location: export PRODUCT\_LOCKER\_DEFAULT=`readlink /productLocker`  Add the setting: esxcli system settings advanced add -d "Path to VMware Tools repository" -o ProductLockerLocation -t string -s $PRODUCT\_LOCKER\_DEFAULT You can combine all the above steps in step 2 by issuing the single command:esxcli system settings advanced add -d "Path to VMware Tools repository" -o ProductLockerLocation -t string -s `readlink /productLocker`**Skyline Health page displays garbage characters**In the vSphere Client, when you navigate to vCenter Server or select an ESXi host in the vSphere Client navigator and click Monitor > Skyline Health, the page displays garbage characters in the following locales: Korean, Japanese, German and French.Workaround: Switch to English locale.
## Virtual Machine Management Issues

**You cannot add or modify an existing network adapter on a virtual machine**If you try to add or modify an existing network adapter on a virtual machine, the Reconfigure Virtual Machine task might fail with an error such as Cannot complete operation due to concurrent modification by another operation in the vSphere Client. In the/var/log/hostd.log file of the ESXi host where the virtual machine runs, you see logs such as:2020-07-28T07:47:31.621Z verbose hostd[2102259] [Originator@6876 sub=Vigor.Vmsvc.vm:/vmfs/volumes/vsan:526bc94351cf8f42-41153841cab2f9d9/bad71f5f-d85e-a276-4cf6-246e965d7154/interop\_l2vpn\_vmotion\_VM\_1.vmx] NIC: connection control message: Failed to connect virtual device 'ethernet0'.

- Put the ESXi host in Maintenance Mode.
- Reboot the ESXi host.

For more information, see VMware knowledge base article [80399](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/80399). **ESXi 6.5 hosts with AMD Opteron Generation 3 (Greyhound) processors cannot join Enhanced vMotion Compatibility (EVC) AMD REV E or AMD REV F clusters on a vCenter Server 7.0 Update 1 system**In vCenter Server 7.0 Update 1, vSphere cluster services, such as vSphere DRS and vSphere HA, run on ESX agent virtual machines to make the services functionally independent of vCenter Server. However, the CPU baseline for AMD processors of the ESX agent virtual machines have POPCNT SSE4A instructions, which prevents ESXi 6.5 hosts with AMD Opteron Generation 3 (Greyhound) processors to enable EVC mode AMD REV E and AMD REV F on a vCenter Server 7.0 Update 1 system.Workaround: None**The postcustomization section of the customization script runs before the guest customization**When you run the guest customization script for a Linux guest operating system, the precustomization section of the customization script that is defined in the customization specification runs before the guest customization and the postcustomization section runs after that. If you enable Cloud-Init in the guest operating system of a virtual machine, the postcustomization section runs before the customization due to a known issue in Cloud-Init.Workaround: Deactivate Cloud-Init and use the standard guest customization. **Group migration operations in vSphere vMotion, Storage vMotion, and vMotion without shared storage fail with error**When you perform group migration operations on VMs with multiple disks and multi-level snapshots, the operations might fail with the error com.vmware.vc.GenericVmConfigFault Failed waiting for data. Error 195887167. Connection closed by remote host, possibly due to timeout.Workaround: Retry the migration operation on the failed VMs one at a time.**Deploying an OVF or OVA template from a URL fails with a 403 Forbidden error**The URLs that contain an HTTP query parameter are not supported. For example, http://webaddress.com?file=abc.ovf or the Amazon pre-signed S3 URLs.Workaround: Download the files and deploy them from your local file system.**Importing or deploying local OVF files containing non-ASCII characters in their name might fail with an error**When you import local .ovf files containing non-ASCII characters in their name, you might receive 400 Bad Request Error. When you use such .ovf files to deploy a virtual machine in the vSphere Client, the deployment process stops at 0%. As a result, you might receive 400 Bad Request Error or 500 Internal Server Error.Workaround:

- Remove the non-ASCII characters from the .ovf and .vmdk file names.
  * To edit the .ovf file, open it with a text editor.
  * Search the non-ASCII .vmdk file name and change it to ASCII.
- Import or deploy the saved files again.
**<span style="color:#CC0000">New </span>The third level of nested objects in a virtual machine folder is not visible**Perform the following steps:

- Navigate to a data center and create a virtual machine folder.
- In the virtual machine folder, create a nested virtual machine folder.
- In the second folder, create another nested virtual machine, virtual machine folder, vApp, or VM Template.

As a result, from the VMs and Templates inventory tree you cannot see the objects in the third nested folder.Workaround: To see the objects in the third nested folder, navigate to the second nested folder and select the VMs tab.**vSAN file services operations fail on vSphere Lifecycle Manager-enabled clusters**During a change in the state of an ESXi host, vSAN file services operations might fail on vSphere Lifecycle Manager-enabled clusters due to a race condition with the vSphere ESX Agent Manager (EAM). The problem happens during upgrades and operations, such as power on or power off, booting, or when the host exits maintenance or standby mode. The race condition occurs when an endpoint has been unavailable before the change of state of the ESXi host. In such cases, the EAM starts a remediation process that cannot be resolved and fails operations from other services, such as the vSAN file services.Workaround: Restart the vSphere ESX Agent Manager.
## vSphere HA and Fault Tolerance Issues

**VMs in a cluster might be orphaned after recovering from storage inaccessibility such as a cluster wide APD**Some VMs might be in orphaned state after cluster wide APD recovers, even if HA and VMCP are enabled on the cluster.This issue might be encountered when the following conditions occur simultaneously:

* All hosts in the cluster experience APD and do not recover until VMCP timeout is reached.
* HA primary initiates failover due to APD on a host.
* Power on API during HA failover fails due to one of the following:
  + APD across the same host
  + Cascading APD across the entire cluster
  + Storage issues
  + Resource unavailability
* FDM unregistration and VCs steal VM logic might initiate during a window where FDM has not unregistered the failed VM and VC's host synchronization responds that multiple hosts are reporting the same VM. Both FDM and VC unregister the different registered copies of the same VM from different hosts, causing the VM to be orphaned.

Workaround: You must unregister and reregister the orphaned VMs manually within the cluster after the APD recovers.If you do not manually reregister the orphaned VMs, HA attempts failover of the orphaned VMs, but it might take between 5 to 10 hours depending on when APD recovers.The overall functionality of the cluster is not affected in these cases and HA will continue to protect the VMs. This is an anomaly in what gets displayed on VC for the duration of the problem.
## vSphere Lifecycle Manager Issues

**You cannot enable NSX-T on a cluster that is already enabled for managing image setup and updates on all hosts collectively**NSX-T is not compatible with the vSphere Lifecycle Manager functionality for image management. When you enable a cluster for image setup and updates on all hosts in the cluster collectively, you cannot enable NSX-T on that cluster. However, you can deploy NSX Edges to this cluster.Workaround: Move the hosts to a new cluster that you can manage with baselines and enable NSX-T on that new cluster.**vSphere Lifecycle Manager and vSAN File Services cannot be simultaneously enabled on a vSAN cluster in vSphere 7.0 release**If vSphere Lifecycle Manager is enabled on a cluster, vSAN File Services cannot be enabled on the same cluster and vice versa. In order to enable vSphere Lifecycle Manager on a cluster, which has VSAN File Services enabled already, first deactivate vSAN File Services and retry the operation. Please note that if you transition to a cluster that is managed by a single image, vSphere Lifecycle Manager cannot be deactivated on that cluster.Workaround: None.**When a hardware support manager is unavailable, vSphere High Availability (HA) functionality is impacted**If hardware support manager is unavailable for a cluster that you manage with a single image, where a firmware and drivers addon is selected and vSphere HA is enabled, the vSphere HA functionality is impacted. You may experience the following errors.

* Configuring vSphere HA on a cluster fails.
* Cannot complete the configuration of the vSphere HA agent on a host: Applying HA VIBs on the cluster encountered a failure.
* Remediating vSphere HA fails: A general system error occurred: Failed to get Effective Component map.
* Disabling vSphere HA fails: Delete Solution task failed. A general system error occurred: Cannot find hardware support package from depot or hardware support manager.

Workaround:

* If the hardware support manager is temporarily unavailable, perform the following steps.

- Reconnect the hardware support manager to vCenter Server.
- Select a cluster from the Hosts and Cluster menu.
- Select the Configure tab.
- Under Services, click vSphere Availability.
- Re-enable vSphere HA.

* If the hardware support manager is permanently unavailable, perform the following steps.

- Remove the hardware support manager and the hardware support package from the image specification
- Re-enable vSphere HA.
- Select a cluster from the Hosts and Cluster menu.
- Select the Updates tab.
- Click Edit .
- Remove the firmware and drivers addon and click Save.
- Select the Configure tab.
- Under Services, click vSphere Availability.
- Re-enable vSphere HA.

**I/OFilter is not removed from a cluster after a remediation process in vSphere Lifecycle Manager**Removing I/OFilter from a cluster by remediating the cluster in vSphere Lifecycle Manager, fails with the following error message: iofilter XXX already exists. Тhe iofilter remains listed as installed.Workaround:

- Call IOFilter API UninstallIoFilter\_Task from the vCenter Server managed object (IoFilterManager).
- Remediate the cluster in vSphere Lifecycle Manager.
- Call IOFilter API ResolveInstallationErrorsOnCluster\_Task from the vCenter Server managed object (IoFilterManager) to update the database.

**While remediating a vSphere HA enabled cluster in vSphere Lifecycle Manager, disabling and re-enabling vSphere HA causes a vSphere HA error state**Disabling and re-enabling vSphere HA during remediation process of a cluster, may fail the remediation process due to vSphere HA health checks reporting that hosts don't have vSphere HA VIBs installed. You may see the following error message: Setting desired image spec for cluster failed.Workaround: Аfter the cluster remediation operation has finished, deactivate and re-enable vSphere HA for the cluster.**Checking for recommended images in vSphere Lifecycle Manager has slow performance in large clusters**In large clusters with more than 16 hosts, the recommendation generation task could take more than an hour to finish or may appear to hang. The completion time for the recommendation task depends on the number of devices configured on each host and the number of image candidates from the depot that vSphere Lifecycle Manager needs to process before obtaining a valid image to recommend.Workaround: None.**Checking for hardware compatibility in vSphere Lifecycle Manager has slow performance in large clusters**In large clusters with more than 16 hosts, the validation report generation task could take up to 30 minutes to finish or may appear to hang. The completion time depends on the number of devices configured on each host and the number of hosts configured in the cluster.Workaround: None**Incomplete error messages in non-English languages are displayed, when remediating a cluster in vSphere Lifecycle Manager**You can encounter incomplete error messages for localized languages in the vCenter Server user interface. The messages are displayed, after a cluster remediation process in vSphere Lifecycle Manager fails. For example, your can observe the following error message.The error message in English language: Virtual machine 'VMC on DELL EMC -FileServer' that runs on cluster 'Cluster-1' reported an issue which prevents entering maintenance mode: Unable to access the virtual machine configuration: Unable to access file[local-0] VMC on Dell EMC - FileServer/VMC on Dell EMC - FileServer.vmxThe error message in French language: La VM « VMC on DELL EMC -FileServer », située sur le cluster « {Cluster-1} », a signalé un problème empêchant le passage en mode de maintenance : Unable to access the virtual machine configuration: Unable to access file[local-0] VMC on Dell EMC - FileServer/VMC on Dell EMC - FileServer.vmxWorkaround: None.**When you convert a cluster that uses baselines to a cluster that uses a single image, a warning is displayed that vSphere HA VIBs will be removed**Converting a vSphere HA enabled cluster that uses baselines to a cluster that uses a single image, may result a warning message displaying that vmware-fdm component will be removed.Workaround: This message can be ignored. The conversion process installs the vmware-fdm component.**If vSphere Update Manager is configured to download patch updates from the Internet through a proxy server, after upgrade to vSphere 7.0 that converts Update Manager to vSphere Lifecycle Manager, downloading patches from VMware patch repository might fail**In earlier releases of vCenter Server you could configure independent proxy settings for vCenter Server and vSphere Update Manager. After an upgrade to vSphere 7.0, vSphere Update Manager service becomes part of the vSphere Lifecycle Manager service. For the vSphere Lifecycle Manager service, the proxy settings are configured from the vCenter Server appliance settings. If you had configured Update Manager to download patch updates from the Internet through a proxy server but the vCenter Server appliance had no proxy setting configuration, after a vCenter Server upgrade to version 7.0, the vSphere Lifecycle Manager fails to connect to the VMware depot and is unable to download patches or updates.Workaround: Log in to the vCenter Server Appliance Management Interface, https://*vcenter-server-appliance-FQDN-or-IP-address*:5480, to configure proxy settings for the vCenter Server appliance and enable vSphere Lifecycle Manager to use proxy.**If you use a Java client to review remediation tasks, you cannot extract the results from the remediation operations**If you use a Java client to review remediation tasks, extracting the results might fail with a ConstraintValidationException error. The issue occurs when an ESXi host fails to enter maintenance mode during the remediation and gets a status SKIPPED, but at the same time wrongly gets an In Progress flag for the consecutive remediation operations. This causes the ConstraintValidationException error on the Java Clients and you cannot extract the result of the remediation operation.Workaround: Fix the underlying issues that prevent ESXi hosts to enter Maintenance Mode and retry the remediation operation.**The general vSphere Lifecycle Manager depot and local depots in Remote Office and Branch Office (ROBO) deployments might not be in sync**ROBO clusters that have limited or no access to the Internet or limited connectivity to vCenter Server can download an image from a depot that is local for them instead of accessing the vSphere Lifecycle Manager depot in vCenter Server. However, vSphere Lifecycle Manager generates software recommendations in the form of pre-validated images only on a central level and a recommended image content might not be available at a depot override.Workaround: If you decide to use a recommended image, make sure the content between depot overrides and the central depot are in sync.**Cluster remediation by using the vSphere Lifecycle Manager might fail on ESXi hosts with enabled lockdown mode**If a cluster has ESXi hosts with enabled lockdown mode, remediation operations by using the vSphere Lifecycle Manager might skip such hosts. In the log files, you see messages such as Host scan task failed and com.vmware.vcIntegrity.lifecycle.EsxImage.UnknownError An unknown error occurred while performing the operation..Workaround: Add the root user to the exception list for lockdown mode and retry the cluster remediation.**You cannot use an ESXi image with OEM content to create clusters by using vSphere Lifecycle Manager workflows after an update**When you update an ESXi image with OEM content, for example Dell ESXi 7.0 Update 2a to Dell ESXi 7.0 Update 3d, some reserved VIBs, such that are present in the VMware base image but overridden by async VIBs packaged by the OEM, might be deleted. The same issue might occur after updating your system by using a non-critical baseline and then update to a higher version by using an ESXi image with OEM content. For example, if you update to 7.0 Update 2 by using a non-critical baseline and then update to 7.0 Update 3 by using a Dell ESXi 7.0 Update 3 image, reserved VIBs might also be deleted. As a result, you cannot use ESXi hosts with the updated version to create a vSphere Lifecycle Manager cluster managed by a single image. The operation fails and in the backtrace, you see errors such as:2021-11-24T09:42:49Z lifecycle: 2101166: HostSeeding:956 ERROR Extract depot failed: ('VMW\_bootbank\_bnxtroce\_216.0.58.0-23vmw.703.0.0.18644231', 'Failed to add reserved VIB VMW\_bootbank\_bnxtroce\_216.0.58.0-23vmw.703.0.0.18644231: not found in the reserved VIB cache storage')2021-11-24T09:42:50Z lifecycle: 2101166: imagemanagerctl:373 ERROR Extract depot failed.021-11-24T09:42:50Z lifecycle: 2101166: imagemanagerctl:152 ERROR [ReservedVibExtractError] ('VMW\_bootbank\_bnxtroce\_216.0.58.0-23vmw.703.0.0.18644231', 'Failed to add reserved VIB VMW\_bootbank\_bnxtroce\_216.0.58.0-23vmw.703.0.0.18644231: not found in the reserved VIB cache storage')Workaround: Use interactive or scripted upgrade instead of vSphere Lifecycle Manager workflows. **After you upgrade to vCenter Server 7.0.0b, in the vSphere Lifecycle Manager home view in the vSphere Client, you do not see the Show only rollup updates toggle button**In vCenter Server 7.0.0b, you can use the **Show only rollup updates** toggle button to filter and select patches that you want to include in a baseline when you use the vSphere Lifecycle Manager.The button is available in the **Updates** tab on the **Lifecycle Manager** pane, **Menu** > **Lifecycle Manager**, which is the vSphere Lifecycle Manager home view in the vSphere Client. The button is also available in the **Select Patches Manually** page on the **Baselines** tab in the **Create Baseline** wizard, which opens when you select **New** > **Baseline**.However, the **Show only rollup updates** toggle button might not be visible after you upgrade to vCenter Server 7.0.0b.Workaround: After an upgrade to vCenter Server 7.0.0b, restart the vSphere Client.

Workaround: Manually invoke the API. For more details, see the [vSphere Automation API](https://code.vmware.com/apis/991/vsphere-automation/operations/com/vmware/vcenter/lcm/discovery/interop_report.create-task-operation.html).
## Miscellaneous Issues

**When applying a host profile with version 6.5 to a ESXi host with version 7.0, the compliance check fails**Applying a host profile with version 6.5 to a ESXi host with version 7.0, results in Coredump file profile reported as not compliant with the host.Workaround: There are two possible workarounds.

- When you create a host profile with version 6.5, set an advanced configuration option VMkernel.Boot.autoCreateDumpFile to false on the ESXi host.
- When you apply an existing host profile with version 6.5, add an advanced configuration option VMkernel.Boot.autoCreateDumpFile in the host profile, configure the option to a fixed policy, and set value to false.

**Cannot migrate container volume due to insufficient space**The Migrate volume dialog in vSphere Client considers the current size of container volumes and the free space available on the target datastores. If the free space of a datastore is less than the volume size, then you cannot select the datastore for migration. vSphere preserves the storage policy as it migrates the volume, but the file size of the volume might change depending on the destination datastore type and its supported features. The vSphere Client might show the datastore has insufficient space to perform the migration, even though enough space is available.Workaround: None**The Actions drop-down menu does not contain any items when your browser is set to language different from English**When your browser is set to language different from English and you click the **Switch to New View** button from the virtual machine **Summary** tab of the vSphere Client inventory, the **Actions** drop-down menu in the **Guest OS** panel does not contain any items.Workaround: Select the **Actions** drop-down menu on the top of the virtual machine page.**Mellanox ConnectX-4 or ConnectX-5 native ESXi drivers might exhibit minor throughput degradation when Dynamic Receive Side Scaling (DYN\_RSS) or Generic RSS (GEN\_RSS) feature is turned on**Mellanox ConnectX-4 or ConnectX-5 native ESXi drivers might exhibit less than 5 percent throughput degradation when DYN\_RSS and GEN\_RSS feature is turned on, which is unlikely to impact normal workloads.Workaround: You can deactivate DYN\_RSS and GEN\_RSS feature with the following commands:# esxcli system module parameters set -m nmlx5\_core -p "DYN\_RSS=0 GEN\_RSS=0"# reboot**RDMA traffic between two VMs on the same host might fail in PVRDMA environment**In a vSphere 7.0 implementation of a PVRDMA environment, VMs pass traffic through the HCA for local communication if an HCA is present. However, loopback of RDMA traffic does not work on qedrntv driver. For instance, RDMA Queue Pairs running on VMs that are configured under same uplink port cannot communicate with each other.In vSphere 6.7 and earlier, HCA was used for local RDMA traffic if SRQ was enabled. vSphere 7.0 uses HCA loopback with VMs using versions of PVRDMA that have SRQ enabled with a minimum of HW v14 using RoCE v2.The current version of Marvell FastLinQ adapter firmware does not support loopback traffic between QPs of the same PF or port.Workaround: Required support is being added in the out-of-box driver certified for vSphere 7.0. If you are using the inbox qedrntv driver, you must use a 3-host configuration and migrate VMs to the third host.**Unreliable Datagram traffic QP limitations in qedrntv driver**There are limitations with the Marvell FastLinQ qedrntv RoCE driver and Unreliable Datagram (UD) traffic. UD applications involving bulk traffic might fail with qedrntv driver. Additionally, UD QPs can only work with DMA Memory Regions (MR). Physical MRs or FRMR are not supported. Applications attempting to use physical MR or FRMR along with UD QP fail to pass traffic when used with qedrntv driver. Known examples of such test applications are ibv\_ud\_pingpong and ib\_send\_bw.Standard RoCE and RoCEv2 use cases in a VMware ESXi environment such as iSER, NVMe-oF (RoCE) and PVRDMA are not impacted by this issue. Use cases for UD traffic are limited and this issue impacts a small set of applications requiring bulk UD traffic.Marvell FastLinQ hardware does not support RDMA UD traffic offload. In order to meet the VMware PVRDMA requirement to support GSI QP, a restricted software only implementation of UD QP support was added to the qedrntv driver. The goal of the implementation is to provide support for control path GSI communication and is not a complete implementation of UD QP supporting bulk traffic and advanced features.Since UD support is implemented in software, the implementation might not keep up with heavy traffic and packets might be dropped. This can result in failures with bulk UD traffic.Workaround: Bulk UD QP traffic is not supported with qedrntv driver and there is no workaround at this time. VMware ESXi RDMA (RoCE) use cases like iSER, NVMe, RDMA and PVRDMA are unaffected by this issue.**Servers equipped with QLogic 578xx NIC might fail when frequently connecting or disconnecting iSCSI LUNs**If you trigger QLogic 578xx NIC iSCSI connection or disconnection frequently in a short time, the server might fail due to an issue with the qfle3 driver. This is caused by a known defect in the device's firmware.Workaround: None.**ESXi might fail during driver unload or controller disconnect operation in Broadcom NVMe over FC environment**In Broadcom NVMe over FC environment, ESXi might fail during driver unload or controller disconnect operation and display an error message such as: @BlueScreen: #PF Exception 14 in world 2098707:vmknvmeGener IP 0x4200225021cc addr 0x19Workaround: None.**ESXi does not display OEM firmware version number of i350/X550 NICs on some Dell servers**The inbox ixgben driver only recognizes firmware data version or signature for i350/X550 NICs. On some Dell servers the OEM firmware version number is programmed into the OEM package version region, and the inbox ixgben driver does not read this information. Only the 8-digit firmware signature is displayed.Workaround: To display the OEM firmware version number, install async ixgben driver version 1.7.15 or later.**X710 or XL710 NICs might fail in ESXi**When you initiate certain destructive operations to X710 or XL710 NICs, such as resetting the NIC or manipulating VMKernel's internal device tree, the NIC hardware might read data from non-packet memory.Workaround: Do not reset the NIC or manipulate vmkernel internal device state.**NVMe-oF does not guarantee persistent VMHBA name after system reboot**NVMe-oF is a new feature in vSphere 7.0. If your server has a USB storage installation that uses vmhba30+ and also has NVMe over RDMA configuration, the VMHBA name might change after a system reboot. This is because the VMHBA name assignment for NVMe over RDMA is different from PCIe devices. ESXi does not guarantee persistence.Workaround: None.**Backup fails for vCenter database size of 300 GB or greater**If the vCenter database size is 300 GB or greater, the file-based backup will fail with a timeout. The following error message is displayed: Timeout! Failed to complete in 72000 secondsWorkaround: None.**A restore of vCenter Server 7.0 which is upgraded from vCenter Server 6.x with External Platform Services Controller to vCenter Server 7.0 might fail**When you restore a vCenter Server 7.0 which is upgraded from 6.x with External Platform Services Controller to vCenter Server 7.0, the restore might fail and display the following error: Failed to retrieve appliance storage listWorkaround: During the first stage of the restore process, increase the storage level of the vCenter Server 7.0. For example if the vCenter Server 6.7 External Platform Services Controller setup storage type is small, select storage type large for the restore process.**Enabled SSL protocols configuration parameter is not configured during a host profile remediation process**Enabled SSL protocols configuration parameter is not configured during a host profile remediation and only the system default protocol tlsv1.2 is enabled. This behavior is observed for a host profile with version 7.0 and earlier in a vCenter Server 7.0 environment.Workaround: To enable TLSV 1.0 or TLSV 1.1 SSL protocols for SFCB, log in to an ESXi host by using SSH, and run the following ESXCLI command: esxcli system wbem -P <protocol\_name>**Unable to configure Lockdown Mode settings by using Host Profiles**Lockdown Мode cannot be configured by using a security host profile and cannot be applied to multiple ESXi hosts at once. You must manually configure each host. Workaround: In vCenter Server 7.0, you can configure Lockdown Mode and manage Lockdown Mode exception user list by using a security host profile.**When a host profile is applied to a cluster, Enhanced vMotion Compatibility (EVC) settings are missing from the ESXi hosts**Some settings in the VMware config file /etc/vmware/config are not managed by Host Profiles and are blocked, when the config file is modified. As a result, when the host profile is applied to a cluster, the EVC settings are lost, which causes loss of EVC functionalities. For example, unmasked CPUs can be exposed to workloads.Workaround: Reconfigure the relevant EVC baseline on cluster to recover the EVC settings.**Using a host profile that defines a core dump partition in vCenter Server 7.0 results in an error**In vCenter Server 7.0, configuring and managing a core dump partition in a host profile is not available. Attempting to apply a host profile that defines a core dump partition, results in the following error: No valid coredump partition found.Workaround: None. In vCenter Server 7.0., Host Profiles supports only file-based core dumps.**You cannot paste by right clicking in the vi editor**If you use the vi text editor on a vCenter Server Appliance instance, you cannot paste previously copied content by right clicking. Instead, the vi editor changes mode to Visual.Workaround: From the vCenter Server Appliance shell, run the command/usr/bin/sed -i.bak -E '2alet skip\_defaults\_vim=1' /etc/vimrc.**HTTP requests from certain libraries to vSphere might be rejected**The HTTP reverse proxy in vSphere 7.0 enforces stricter standard compliance than in previous releases. This might expose pre-existing problems in some third-party libraries used by applications for SOAP calls to vSphere.If you develop vSphere applications that use such libraries or include applications that rely on such libraries in your vSphere stack, you might experience connection issues when these libraries send HTTP requests to VMOMI. For example, HTTP requests issued from vijava libraries can take the following form:
```
POST /sdk HTTP/1.1
SOAPAction
Content-Type: text/xml; charset=utf-8
User-Agent: Java/1.8.0_221
```
The syntax in this example violates an HTTP protocol header field requirement that mandates a colon after SOAPAction. Hence, the request is rejected in flight.Workaround: Developers leveraging noncompliant libraries in their applications can consider using a library that follows HTTP standards instead. For example, developers who use the vijava library can consider using the latest version of the yavijava library instead.**SNMP dynamic firewall ruleset is modified by Host Profiles during a remediation process**The SNMP firewall ruleset is a dynamic state, which is handled during runtime. When a host profile is applied, the configuration of the ruleset is managed simultaneously by Host Profiles and SNMP, which can modify the firewall settings unexpectedly. Workaround: There are two possible workarounds.

* To allow the ruleset to manage itself dynamically, exclude the SNMP firewall ruleset option in the configuration of the host profile.

* To proceed with the double management of the ruleset, when needed, correct the firewall ruleset state.

**You might see a dump file when using Broadcom driver lsi\_msgpt3, lsi\_msgpt35 and lsi\_mr3**When using the lsi\_msgpt3, lsi\_msgpt35 and lsi\_mr3 controllers, there is a potential risk to see dump file lsuv2-lsi-drivers-plugin-util-zdump. There is an issue when exiting the storelib used in this plugin utility. There is no impact on ESXi operations, you can ignore the dump file.Workaround: You can safely ignore this message. You can remove the lsuv2-lsi-drivers-plugin with the following command:esxcli software vib remove -n lsuv2-lsiv2-drivers-plugin**You might see reboot is not required after configuring SR-IOV of a PCI device in vCenter, but device configurations made by third party extensions might be lost and require reboot to be re-applied.**In ESXi 7.0, SR-IOV configuration is applied without a reboot and the device driver is reloaded. ESXi hosts might have third party extensions perform device configurations that need to run after the device driver is loaded during boot. A reboot is required for those third party extensions to re-apply the device configuration.Workaround: You must reboot after configuring SR-IOV to apply third party device configurations.**You see black or grey zones in the background of a parent window in the Direct Console User Interface (DCUI) after a child window closes**In the DCUI, when you close a child window by pressing the ESC or Enter keys, or the **Cancel** or **OK** buttons, the parent window appearance might change. The background color changes to grey or black for some part of the parent window. However, all required information from the DCUI is properly displayed and all operations performed in the DCUI complete successfully.Workaround: Wait for 1 minute without refreshing the current window in the DCUI or pressing any key.
## Backup Issues

**If you use the NFS and SMB protocols for file-based backup of vCenter Server, the backup fails after an update from vCenter Server 7.x to vCenter Server 7.0 Update 1**If you use the Network File System (NFS) and Server Message Block (SMB) protocols for file-based backup of vCenter Server, the backup fails after an update from an earlier version of vCenter Server 7.x to vCenter Server 7.0 Update 1. In the applmgmt.log, you see an error message such as Failed to mount the remote storage. The issue occurs because of Linux kernel updates that run during the patch process. The issue does not occur on fresh installations of vCenter Server 7.0 Update 1.Workaround: Reboot the vCenter Server appliance after the update is complete.**Microsoft Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) logins might fail after restoring a vCenter Server Appliance**If you manually add a certificate to the vCenter Server JRE truststore or modify the /etc/hosts file when setting up ADFS, the changes are not preserved after restoring and might cause ADFS logins to fail.Workaround: Add the ADFS certificate to the vCenter Server JRE truststore after restoring your vCenter Server Appliance.

##### CWE

CWE-416 - Use After Free

##### DETAILS

DCERPC is a remote procedure call protocol that is the basis for RPC functionality on Windows. DCERPC is used as a library in VMWare vCenter to implement this protocol and enable interoperability of Windows network services inside vCenter.

VMware vCenter is a key component of VMware vSphere, typically used in cloud environments enabling advanced management of VMs. It enables a number of services, like certificate management, directory services, single sign-on, etc. Some services use the DCERPC protocol for communication, with the implementation provided by the Likewise-Open library. Specifically, it is used in the daemons for VMware Certificate Management Service (vmcad, port 2014), VMware Directory Service (vmdird, port 2012) and VMware Authentication Framework (vmafdd, port 2020), accessible by default from the local network.

The DCERPC specification defines an association as a utility object aiding the communication between server and client. These associations correspond to one transport connection and are logically grouped in so-called association groups. For every RPC session a new association object is allocated. In the codebase, an association object has a type of `rpc_cn_assoc_s_t`.

```
struct rpc_cn_assoc_s_t
{
    rpc_list_t                          link;   /* MUST BE 1ST */       [1]
    rpc_cn_sm_ctlblk_t                  assoc_state;
    unsigned32                          assoc_status;
    unsigned32                          assoc_local_status;
    unsigned16                          assoc_flags;
    unsigned16                          assoc_ref_count;
    unsigned16                          assoc_acb_ref_count;
    ...
}
...
typedef struct
{
    pointer_t   next;   /* next element of list                     */
    pointer_t   last;   /* last element of list in a descriptor or  */
                        /* pointer to the prior element in an element */
} rpc_list_t, *rpc_list_p_t;

```

The associations are logically put into association groups. Typically a server and client communication will create one association group, with each association being responsible for an RPC session. An association group is a doubly linked list holding association objects, with every association object holding a `next` and `last` pointer for the corresponding list elements at [1] above.

Through the `do_assoc_req_action_rtn()` and `accept_add_action_rtn()` RPC calls, the function `rpc__cn_assoc_grp_alloc()` is called, which quite predictably allocates a new association group and adds the association to the group.

```

  rpc_addr_p_t            rpc_addr,
  rpc_transport_info_p_t  transport_info,

  unsigned32              rem_id,
  unsigned32              *st
)
{
    ...
    /*
     * Ideally we'd like to locate an association group in the
     * existing table which is not being used. Worst case we'll
     * increase the size of the table to get a new group.
     */
    assoc_grp = rpc_g_cn_assoc_grp_tbl.assoc_grp_vector;
    for (i = 0, found_assoc_grp = false;
         i < rpc_g_cn_assoc_grp_tbl.grp_count;
         i++)
    {
        if (assoc_grp[i].grp_state.cur_state == RPC_C_ASSOC_GRP_CLOSED)         [2]
        {
            assoc_grp = &assoc_grp[i];
            found_assoc_grp = true;
            break;
        }
    }

    if (!found_assoc_grp)
    {
        /*
         * The association group table will have to be expanded to
         * get a free group.
         */
        grp_id = rpc__cn_assoc_grp_create (st);                                 [3]
        ...
    }

    ...

    /*
     * Finally send a new association event through the group state
     * machine.
     */
    RPC_CN_ASSOC_GRP_EVAL_EVENT (assoc_grp,
                                 RPC_C_ASSOC_GRP_NEW,
                                 NULL,
                                 assoc_grp->grp_status);
    ...
}

```

If no available association group is found at [2], the code proceeds to create a new group in `rpc__cn_assoc_grp_create()` at [3] above.

```
#define RPC_C_ASSOC_GRP_ALLOC_SIZE              10

INTERNAL rpc_cn_local_id_t rpc__cn_assoc_grp_create
(
  unsigned32              *st

{
    ...
    new_count = old_count + RPC_C_ASSOC_GRP_ALLOC_SIZE;                                [4]
    ...
    /*
     * First allocate a new association group table larger than the
     * existing by a fixed amount.
     */
    RPC_MEM_ALLOC (new_assoc_grp,
                   rpc_cn_assoc_grp_p_t,
                   sizeof(rpc_cn_assoc_grp_t) * new_count,
                   RPC_C_MEM_CN_ASSOC_GRP_BLK,
                   RPC_C_MEM_WAITOK);

    /*
     * If there is an old association group table copy it into the
     * new table and free it.
     */
    if (rpc_g_cn_assoc_grp_tbl.assoc_grp_vector != NULL)
    {
        memcpy (new_assoc_grp,
                rpc_g_cn_assoc_grp_tbl.assoc_grp_vector,
                (old_count * sizeof (rpc_cn_assoc_grp_t)));
        for (i = 0; i < old_count; i++)
        {
            /*
             * Relocate the "last" pointer in the head of the grp_assoc_list.
             * We don't check group's state because they must be all active.
             * Otherwise, this function never get called. (grp_assoc_list.next
             * shouldn't be NULL.)
             */
            if (new_assoc_grp[i].grp_assoc_list.next != NULL)
            {
                ((rpc_list_p_t)(new_assoc_grp[i].grp_assoc_list.next))->last =          [5]
                    (pointer_t)&new_assoc_grp[i].grp_assoc_list;
            }
        }
        ...
    }
    ...
}

```

At [4], it is evident that the code allocates groups in increments of 10. So at first call, memory for 10 new groups is allocated, then memory for 20 groups is allocated, 10 previous groups and 10 new groups, etc. Next, the old groups are copied to the newly allocated memory. Finally at [5], an update at the linked list is performed for each head element, setting the value of the `last` pointer to the head of the group linked list.

When the connection between client and server terminates, the association object is freed in `rpc__cn_assoc_acb_dealloc()`. Many cleanup actions are performed; however, no care is employed to make sure that the association is removed from a group. In essence, if an association is deallocated for any reason, a dangling reference of the association object may still exist in an association group.

We saw that the code allocates groups in increments of 10. After 10 association requests by a client, in the 11th association request a new association group will need to be allocated. Then at [5] the `last` pointer of the head element of each association group will be updated. Naturally, if the head element is a previously freed association, a use-after-free scenario can occur.
Timing of free and reuse depend on network connections and are under attacker control. With precise timing and memory layout control, this use-after-free can result in memory corruption, which can ultimately lead to arbitrary code execution.

Note that the original DCERPC codebase was independently modified and reused by both VMWare in vCenter and Apple in macOS hence this analysis is largely the same as the one described in TALOS-2022-1717.

## Resolved Issues

## Upgrade Issues

**vCenter 8.x installation might fail during firstboot with an error for a missing install parameter**While installing vCenter 8.x, you might see the error cis.exceptions.InstallParameterException during the firstboot step due to a missing upgrade.import.directory install parameter. The error occurs if vCenter does not find the parameter due to VM restarts, or restores to a VM Snapshot without memory before running the firstboot configuration.This issue is resolved in this release. The fix makes sure that the upgrade.import.directory install parameter is correctly passed during vCenter installation.**Installation and upgrades to vCenter 8.0 Update 1 fail when a vCenter Single Sign-On domain contains uppercase letters**If your vCenter Single Sign-On domain contains uppercase letters such as [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) or [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection), installation, patching and upgrades to vCenter 8.0 Update 1 might fail. During installation or upgrade from an earlier version, in the install wizard, you see an error such as Failed to start the Workload Control Plane Service. During patching from 8.x, in the Virtual Appliance Management Interface, you see the error Exception occurred in postInstallHook. Messages in the /var/log/vmware/wcp/wcpsvc.log file shows a failure such as:2023-04-17T13:04:54.017Z error wcp [gcauth/gc\_auth.go:94] Failed to parse VC JWKS: invalid character '<' looking for beginning of value2023-04-17T13:04:54.017Z error wcp [gcauth/gc\_auth.go:59] Unable to get VC public key configuration : invalid character '<' looking for beginning of value2023-04-17T13:04:54.017Z fatal wcp [gcauth/gc\_auth.go:47] Unable to get VC public key configuration : invalid character '<' looking for beginning of valueYou can see the case of an SSO domain by using the following command: /usr/lib/vmware-vmafd/bin/vmafd-cli get-domain-name --server-name localhost . Example output of the above command might be VSPHERE.LOCAL.This issue is resolved in this release.
## Miscellaneous Issues

**If no vSphere vMotion bandwidth for migration of VMs with vGPUs is available, the vpxd service might fail at regular intervals**If vpxd restarts during a migration of VMs with vGPUs and for some reason vSphere vMotion has no bandwidth available, vpxd might start failing on regular intervals.This issue is resolved in this release. If you already face the issue, restart the vpxd service, re-add ESXi hosts using the Quickstart workflow, and reconfigure the vSphere vMotion network to make sure bandwidth is available.
## Known Issues from Previous Releases

## Installation, Upgrade, and Migration Issues

**You see an error Failed to get ceip status in the Virtual Appliance Management Interface (VAMI) during update to vCenter Server 8.0 Update 1**During an update, vCenter stops and restarts the VMDir service and within this interval, if you try to log in to the VAMI, you might see an error such as Failed to get ceip status. This is expected and does not indicate an actual issue with the vCenter system.Workaround: Wait for the VMDir service to restart and refresh the Virtual Appliance Management Interface.**If you apply a host profile using a software FCoE configuration to an ESXi 8.0 host, the operation fails with a validation error**Starting from vSphere 7.0, software FCoE is deprecated, and in vSphere 8.0 software FCoE profiles are not supported. If you try to apply a host profile from an earlier version to an ESXi 8.0 host, for example to edit the host customization, the operation fails. In the vSphere Client, you see an error such as Host Customizations validation error.Workaround: Disable the Software FCoE Configuration subprofile in the host profile.**Failed parallel remediation by using vSphere Lifecycle Manager on one ESXi host might cause other hosts to remain in a pending reboot state**An accidental loss of network connectivity during a parallel remediation by using vSphere Lifecycle Manager might cause the operation to fail on one of the ESXi hosts. Remediation on other hosts continues, but the hosts cannot reboot to complete the task.Workaround: If an ESXi host consistently fails remediation attempts, manually trigger a reboot. For more information, see VMware knowledge base article [91260](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/91260).**You cannot use ESXi hosts of version 8.0 as a reference host for existing host profiles of earlier ESXi versions**Validation of existing host profiles for ESXi versions 7.x, 6.7.x and 6.5.x fails when only an 8.0 reference host is available in the inventory.Workaround: Make sure you have a reference host of the respective version in the inventory. For example, use an ESXi 7.0 Update 2 reference host to update or edit an ESXi 7.0 Update 2 host profile.**Firmware compliance details are missing from a vSphere Lifecycle Manager image compliance report for an ESXi standalone host**Firmware compliance details might be missing from a vSphere Lifecycle Manager image compliance report for an ESXi standalone host in two cases:

- You run a compliance report against a standalone host managed with a vSphere Lifecycle Manager image from vSphere Client and then navigate away before the compliance report gets generated.
- You trigger a page refresh after the image compliance reports are generated.

In such cases, even when you have the firmware package available in the Desired State, the firmware compliance section remains empty when you revisit or refresh the vSphere Client browsing session. If you use GET image compliance API, then firmware compliance details are missing from the response.Workaround: Invoke the image compliance scan for a standalone host managed with a vSphere Lifecycle Manager image by using the vSphere Client and do not navigate away or refresh the browser. For API, use the Check image compliance API for fetching the firmware details as apposed to GET image compliance.**VMNICs might be down after an upgrade to ESXi 8.0**If the peer physical switch of a VMNIC does not support Media Auto Detect, or Media Auto Detect is disabled, and the VMNIC link is set down and then up, the link remains down after upgrade to or installation of ESXi 8.0.Workaround: Use either of these 2 options:

- Enable the option media-auto-detect in the BIOS settings by navigating to System Setup Main Menu, usually by pressing **F2** or opening a virtual console, and then **Device Settings** > *<specific broadcom NIC>* > **Device Configuration Menu** > **Media Auto Detect**. Reboot the host.
- Alternatively, use an ESXCLI command similar to: esxcli network nic set -S <your speed> -D full -n <your nic>. With this option, you also set a fixed speed to the link, and it does not require a reboot.
**If a vCenter Server Security Token Service (STS) refresh happens during upgrade to ESXi 8.0, the upgrade might fail**In vSphere 8.0, vCenter Single Sign-On automatically renews a VMCA-generated STS signing certificate. The auto-renewal occurs before the STS signing certificate expires and before triggering the 90-day expiration alarm. However, in long-running upgrade or remediation tasks by using a vSphere Lifecycle Manager image on multiple ESXi hosts in a cluster, vSphere Lifecycle Manager might create a cache of STS certificates internally. In very rare cases, if an STS certificates refresh task starts in parallel with the long-running upgrade or remediation task, the upgrade task might fail as the STS certificates in the internal cache might be different from the refreshed certificates. After the upgrade task fails, some ESXi hosts might remain in maintenance mode.Workaround: Manually exit any ESXi hosts in maintenance mode and retry the upgrade or remediation. Refreshing or importing and replacing the STS signing certificates happens automatically and does not require a vCenter Server restart, to avoid downtime.**After upgrade to ESXi 8.0, you might lose some nmlx5\_core driver module settings due to obsolete parameters**Some module parameters for the nmlx5\_core driver, such as device\_rss, drss and rss, are deprecated in ESXi 8.0 and any custom values, different from the default values, are not kept after an upgrade to ESXi 8.0.Workaround: Replace the values of the device\_rss, drss and rss parameters as follows:

* device\_rss: Use the DRSS parameter.
* drss: Use the DRSS parameter.
* rss: Use the RSS parameter.
**Second stage of vCenter Server restore procedure freezes at 90%**When you use the vCenter Server GUI installer or the vCenter Server Appliance Management Interface (VAMI) to restore a vCenter from a file-based backup, the restore workflow might freeze at 90% with an error 401 Unable to authenticate user, even though the task completes successfully in the backend. The issue occurs if the deployed machine has a different time than the NTP server, which requires a time sync. As a result of the time sync, clock skew might fail the running session of the GUI or VAMI.Workaround: If you use the GUI installer, you can get the restore status by using the restore.job.get command from the appliancesh shell. If you use VAMI, refresh your browser.
## Miscellaneous Issues

**In Hybrid Linked Mode, the cloud vCenter is not able to discover plug-ins deployed on an on-prem vCenter**Hybrid Linked Mode allows you to link your cloud vCenter Server instance with an on-premises vCenter Single Sign-On domain, but the cloud vCenter might not be able to discover plug-ins deployed on the on-prem instance because it does not have the necessary permissions.Workaround: Install the vCenter Cloud Gateway in your on-premises environment and either browse the plug-ins deployed on the on-prem instance from the VMware Cloud Console or directly from the vSphere Client on the on-prem vCenter.**If a PCI passthrough is active on a DPU during the shutdown or restart of an ESXi host, the host fails with a purple diagnostic screen** If an active virtual machine has a PCI passthrough to a DPU at the time of shutdown or reboot of an ESXi host, the host fails with a purple diagnostic screen. The issue is specific for systems with DPUs and only in case of VMs that use PCI passthrough to the DPU.Workaround: Before shutdown or reboot of an ESXi host, make sure the host is in maintenance mode, or that no VMs that use PCI passthrough to a DPU are running. If you use auto start options for a virtual machine, the Autostart manager stops such VMs before shutdown or reboot of a host.**In a vCenter Server system with DPUs, if IPv6 is disabled, you cannot manage DPUs**Although the vSphere Client allows the operation, if you disable IPv6 on an ESXi host with DPUs, you cannot use the DPUs, because the internal communication between the host and the devices depends on IPv6. The issue affects only ESXi hosts with DPUs.Workaround: Make sure IPv6 is enabled on ESXi hosts with DPUs.**You might see 10 min delay in rebooting an ESXi host on HPE server with pre-installed Pensando DPU**In rare cases, HPE servers with pre-installed Pensando DPU might take more than 10 minutes to reboot in case of a failure of the DPU. As a result, ESXi hosts might fail with a purple diagnostic screen and the default wait time is 10 minutes.Workaround: None.**If you have an USB interface enabled in a remote management application that you use to install ESXi 8.0, you see an additional standard switch vSwitchBMC with uplink vusb0**Starting with vSphere 8.0, in both Integrated Dell Remote Access Controller (iDRAC) and HP Integrated Lights Out (ILO), when you have an USB interface enabled, vUSB or vNIC respectively, an additional standard switch vSwitchBMC with uplink vusb0 gets created on the ESXi host. This is expected, in view of the introduction of data processing units (DPUs) on some servers but might cause the VMware Cloud Foundation Bring-Up process to fail.Workaround: Before vSphere 8.0 installation, disable the USB interface in the remote management application that you use by following vendor documentation.After vSphere 8.0 installation, use the ESXCLI command esxcfg-advcfg -s 0 /Net/BMCNetworkEnable to prevent the creation of a virtual switch vSwitchBMC and associated portgroups on the next reboot of host.See this script as an example:~# esxcfg-advcfg -s 0 /Net/BMCNetworkEnableThe value of BMCNetworkEnable is 0 and the service is disabled.~# rebootOn host reboot, no virtual switch, PortGroup and VMKNIC are created in the host related to remote management application network.**If an NVIDIA BlueField DPU is in hardware offload mode disabled, virtual machines with configured SR-IOV virtual function cannot power on**NVIDIA BlueField DPUs must be in hardware offload mode enabled to allow virtual machines with configured SR-IOV virtual function to power on and operate.Workaround: Always use the default hardware offload mode enabled for NVIDIA BlueField DPUs when you have VMs with configured SR-IOV virtual function connected to a virtual switch.**Some ionic\_en driver uplinks might work with just a single receive queue and you see slower performance in native mode**Pensando Distributed Services Platform (DSC) adapters have 2 high speed ethernet controllers (for example vmnic6 and vmnic7) and one management controller (for example vmnic8)::~] esxcfg-nics -lvmnic6 0000:39:00.0 ionic\_en\_unstable Up 25000Mbps Full 00:ae:cd:09:c9:48 1500 Pensando Systems DSC-25 10/25G 2-port 4G RAM 8G eMMC G1 Services Card, Ethernet Controllervmnic7 0000:3a:00.0 ionic\_en\_unstable Up 25000Mbps Full 00:ae:cd:09:c9:49 1500 Pensando Systems DSC-25 10/25G 2-port 4G RAM 8G eMMC G1 Services Card, Ethernet Controller:~] esxcfg-nics -lSvmnic8 0000:3b:00.0 ionic\_en\_unstable Up 1000Mbps Full 00:ae:cd:09:c9:4a 1500 Pensando Systems DSC-25 10/25G 2-port 4G RAM 8G eMMC G1 Services Card, Management ControllerThe high-speed ethernet controllers vmnic6 and vmnic7 register first and operate with RSS set to 16 receive queues.:~] localcli --plugin-dir /usr/lib/vmware/esxcli/int networkinternal nic privstats get -n vmnic6…Num of RSS-Q=16, ntxq\_descs=2048, nrxq\_descs=1024, log\_level=3, vlan\_tx\_insert=1, vlan\_rx\_strip=1, geneve\_offload=1 }However, in rare cases, if the management controller vmnic8 registers first with the vSphere Distributed Switch, the high-speed ethernet controllers vmnic6 or vmnic7 uplink might end up operating with RSS set to 1 receive queue.:~] localcli --plugin-dir /usr/lib/vmware/esxcli/int networkinternal nic privstats get -n vmnic6…Num of RSS-Q=1, ntxq\_descs=2048, nrxq\_descs=1024, log\_level=3, vlan\_tx\_insert=1, vlan\_rx\_strip=1, geneve\_offload=1 }As a result, you might see slower performance in native mode.Workaround: Reload the ionic\_en driver on ESXi by using the following commands::~] esxcfg-module -u ionic\_en:~] esxcfg-module ionic\_en:~] localcli --plugin-dir /usr/lib/vmware/esxcli/int/ deviceInternal bind.**In the Virtual Appliance Management Interface (VAMI), you see a warning message during the pre-upgrade stage**Moving vSphere plug-ins to a remote plug-in architecture, vSphere 8.0 deprecates support for local plug-ins. If your 8.0 vSphere environment has local plug-ins, some breaking changes for such plug-ins might cause the pre-upgrade check by using VAMI to fail.In the Pre-Update Check Results screen, you see an error such as:Warning message: The compatibility of plug-in package(s) %s with the new vCenter Server version cannot be validated. They may not function properly after vCenter Server upgrade.Resolution: Please contact the plug-in vendor and make sure the package is compatible with the new vCenter Server version.Workaround: Refer to the [VMware Compatibility Guide](https://www.vmware.com/resources/compatibility/search.php) and [VMware Product Interoperability Matrix](http://partnerweb.vmware.com/comp_guide2/sim/interop_matrix.php) or contact the plug-in vendors for recommendations to make sure local plug-ins in your environment are compatible with vCenter Server 8.0 before you continue with the upgrade. For more information, see the blog [Deprecating the Local Plugins :- The Next Step in vSphere Client Extensibility Evolution](https://core.vmware.com/blog/deprecating-local-plugins-next-step-vsphere-client-extensibility-evolution) and VMware knowledge base article [87880](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/87880).**You cannot remove a PCI passthrough device assigned to a virtual Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) node from a virtual machine with CPU Hot Add enabled**Although by default when you enable CPU Hot Add to allow the addition of vCPUs to a running virtual machine, virtual NUMA topology is deactivated, if you have a PCI passthrough device assigned to a NUMA node, attempts to remove the device end with an error. In the vSphere Client, you see messages such as Invalid virtual machine configuration. Virtual NUMA cannot be configured when CPU hotadd is enabled.Workaround: See VMware knowledge base article [89638](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/89638).**If you deploy a virtual machine from an OVF file or from the Content Library, the number of cores per socket for the VM is set to 1**If you deploy a virtual machine from an OVF file or from the Content Library, instead of ESXi automatically selecting the number of cores per socket, the number is pre-set to 1.Workaround: You can manually set the number of cores per socket by using the vSphere Client. For more information, see VMware knowledge base article [89639](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/89639).
## Networking Issues

**Overlapping hot-add and hot-remove operations for DirectPath I/O devices might fail**With vSphere 8.0 Update 1, by using vSphere API you can add or remove a DirectPath I/O device without powering off VMs. However, if you run several operations at the same time, some of the overlapping tasks might fail.Workaround: Plan for 20 seconds processing time between each hot-add or hot-remove operation for DirectPath I/O devices.**You cannot set the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) on a VMware vSphere Distributed Switch to a value larger than 9174 on a Pensando DPU**If you have the vSphere Distributed Services Engine feature with a Pensando DPU enabled on your ESXi 8.0 system, you cannot set the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) on a vSphere Distributed Switch to a value larger than 9174.Workaround: None.**Hot adding and removing of DirectPath I/O devices is not automatically enabled on virtual machines**With vSphere 8.0 Update 1, by using vSphere API you can add or remove a DirectPath I/O device without powering off VMs. When you enable the hotplug functionality that allows you to hot add and remove DirectPath I/O devices to a VM, if you use such a VM to create an OVF and deploy a new VM, the new VM might not have the hotplug functionality automatically enabled.Workaround: Enable the hotplug functionality as described in [Hot-add and Hot-remove support for VMDirectPath I/O Devices](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/8.0/vsphere-networking/GUID-FAD98A33-EBFC-40D2-9BD2-195C0E620341.html).**You see link flapping on NICs that use the ntg3 driver of version 4.1.3 and later**When two NICs that use the ntg3 driver of versions 4.1.3 and later are connected directly, not to a physical switch port, link flapping might occur. The issue does not occur on ntg3 drivers of versions earlier than 4.1.3 or the tg3 driver. This issue is not related to the occasional Energy Efficient Ethernet (EEE) link flapping on such NICs. The fix for the EEE issue is to use a ntg3 driver of version 4.1.7 or later, or disable EEE on physical switch ports.Workaround: Upgrade the ntg3 driver to version 4.1.8 and set the new module parameter noPhyStateSet to 1. The noPhyStateSet parameter defaults to 0 and is not required in most environments, except they face the issue.**VMware NSX installation or upgrade in a vSphere environment with DPUs might fail with a connectivity error**An intermittent timing issue on the ESXi host side might cause NSX installation or upgrade in a vSphere environment with DPUs to fail. In the nsxapi.log file you see logs such as Failed to get SFHC response. MessageType MT\_SOFTWARE\_STATUS.Workaround: Wait for 10 min and retry the NSX install or upgrade.**If you do not reboot an ESXi host after you enable or disable SR-IOV with the icen driver, when you configure a transport node in ENS Interrupt mode on that host, some virtual machines might not get DHCP addresses**If you enable or disable SR-IOV with the icen driver on an ESXi host and configure a transport node in ENS Interrupt mode, some Rx (receive) queues might not work if you do not reboot the host. As a result, some virtual machines might not get DHCP addresses.Workaround: Either add a transport node profile directly, without enabling SR-IOV, or reboot the ESXi host after you enable or disable SR-IOV.**You cannot use Mellanox ConnectX-5, ConnectX-6 cards Model 1 Level 2 and Model 2 for Enhanced Network Stack (ENS) mode in vSphere 8.0**Due to hardware limitations, Model 1 Level 2, and Model 2 for Enhanced Network Stack (ENS) mode in vSphere 8.0 is not supported in ConnectX-5 and ConnectX-6 adapter cards.Workaround: Use Mellanox ConnectX-6 Lx and ConnectX-6 Dx or later cards that support ENS Model 1 Level 2, and Model 2A.**Pensando DPUs do not support Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) on physical switch ports of ESXi hosts**When you enable LLDP on an ESXi host with a DPU, the host cannot receive LLDP packets.Workaround: None.
## Storage Issues

**VASA API version does not automatically refresh after upgrade to vCenter Server 8.0**vCenter Server 8.0 supports VASA API version 4.0. However, after you upgrade your vCenter Server system to version 8.0, the VASA API version might not automatically change to 4.0. You see the issue in 2 cases:

- If a VASA provider that supports VASA API version 4.0 is registered with a previous version of VMware vCenter, the VASA API version remains unchanged after you upgrade to VMware vCenter 8.0. For example, if you upgrade a VMware vCenter system of version 7.x with a registered VASA provider that supports both VASA API versions 3.5 and 4.0, the VASA API version does not automatically change to 4.0, even though the VASA provider supports VASA API version 4.0. After the upgrade, when you navigate to **vCenter Server** > **Configure** > **Storage Providers** and expand the **General** tab of the registered VASA provider, you still see VASA API version 3.5.
- If you register a VASA provider that supports VASA API version 3.5 with a VMware vCenter 8.0 system and upgrade the VASA API version to 4.0, even after the upgrade, you still see VASA API version 3.5.
Workaround: Unregister and re-register the VASA provider on the VMware vCenter 8.0 system.**vSphere Storage vMotion operations might fail in a vSAN environment due to an unauthenticated session of the Network File Copy (NFC) manager**Migrations to a vSAN datastore by using vSphere Storage vMotion of virtual machines that have at least one snapshot and more than one virtual disk with different storage policy might fail. The issue occurs due to an unauthenticated session of the NFC manager because the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) body exceeds the allowed size.Workaround: First migrate the VM home namespace and just one of the virtual disks. After the operation completes, perform a disk only migration of the remaining 2 disks.**You cannot create snapshots of virtual machines due to an error in the Content Based Read Cache (CBRC) that a digest operation has failed**A rare race condition when assigning a content ID during the update of the CBRC digest file might cause a discrepancy between the content ID in the data disk and the digest disk. As a result, you cannot create virtual machine snapshots. You see an error such as An error occurred while saving the snapshot: A digest operation has failed in the backtrace. The snapshot creation task completes upon retry.Workaround: Retry the snapshot creation task.
## vCenter Server and vSphere Client Issues

**The Utilization view of resource pools and clusters might not automatically refresh when you change the object**When you have already opened the **Utilization** view under the **Monitor** tab for a resource pool or a cluster and then you change the resource pool or cluster, the view might not automatically refresh. For example, when you open the **Utilization** view of one cluster and then select a different cluster, you might still see the statistics of the first cluster.Workaround: Click the refresh icon.**If you load the vSphere virtual infrastructure to more than 90%, ESXi hosts might intermittently disconnect from vCenter Server**In rare occasions, if the vSphere virtual infrastructure is continuously using more than 90% of its hardware capacity, some ESXi hosts might intermittently disconnect from the vCenter Server. Connection typically restores within a few seconds.Workaround: If connection to vCenter Server accidentally does not restore in a few seconds, reconnect ESXi hosts manually by using vSphere Client.**In the vSphere Client, you do not see banner notifications for historical data imports**Due to a backend issue, you do not see banner notifications for background migration of historical data in the vSphere Client.Workaround: Use the vCenter Server Management Interface as an alternative to the vSphere Client. For more information, see [Monitor and Manage Historical Data Migration](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/8.0/vsphere-vcenter-upgrade/GUID-82BF6D0C-211E-4862-AC6C-C7DEDA564D90.html).**You see an error for Cloud Native Storage (CNS) block volumes created by using API in a mixed vCenter environment**If your environment has vCenter Server systems of version 8.0 and 7.x, creating Cloud Native Storage (CNS) block volume by using API is successful, but you might see an error in the vSphere Client, when you navigate to see the CNS volume details. You see an error such as Failed to extract the requested data. Check vSphere Client logs for details. + TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'cluster'). The issue occurs only if you review volumes managed by the 7.x vCenter Server by using the vSphere Client of an 8.0 vCenter Server.Workaround: Log in to vSphere Client on a vCenter Server system of version 7.x to review the volume properties.**ESXi hosts might become unresponsive, and you see a vpxa dump file due to a rare condition of insufficient file descriptors for the request queue on vpxa**In rare cases, when requests to the vpxa service take long, for example waiting for access to a slow datastore, the request queue on vpxa might exceed the limit of file descriptors. As a result, ESXi hosts might briefly become unresponsive, and you see a vpxa-zdump.00\* file in the /var/core directory. The vpxa logs contain the line Too many open files.Workaround: None. The vpxa service automatically restarts and corrects the issue.**If you use custom update repository with untrusted certificates, vCenter Server upgrade or update by using vCenter Lifecycle Manager workflows to vSphere 8.0 might fail**If you use a custom update repository with self-signed certificates that the VMware Certificate Authority (VMCA) does not trust, vCenter Lifecycle Manager fails to download files from such a repository. As a result, vCenter Server upgrade or update operations by using vCenter Lifecycle Manager workflows fail with the error Failed to load the repository manifest data for the configured upgrade.Workaround: Use CLI, the GUI installer, or the Virtual Appliance Management Interface (VAMI) to perform the upgrade. For more information, see VMware knowledge base article [89493](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/89493).
## Virtual Machine Management Issues

**When you add an existing virtual hard disk to a new virtual machine, you might see an error that the VM configuration is rejected**When you add an existing virtual hard disk to a new virtual machine by using the VMware Host Client, the operation might fail with an error such as The VM configuration was rejected. Please see browser Console. The issue occurs because the VMware Host Client might fail to get some properties, such as the hard disk controller.Workaround: After you select a hard disk and go to the **Ready to complete** page, do not click **Finish**. Instead, return one step back, wait for the page to load, and then click **Next** > **Finish**.
## vSphere Lifecycle Manager Issues

**If a parallel remediation task fails, you do not see the correct number of ESXi hosts that passed or skipped the operation**With vSphere 8.0, you can enable vSphere Lifecycle Manager to remediate all hosts that are in maintenance mode in parallel instead of in sequence. However, if a parallel remediation task fails, in the vSphere Client you might not see the correct number of hosts that passed, failed, or skipped the operation, or even not see such counts at all. The issue does not affect the vSphere Lifecycle Manager functionality, but only the reporting in the vSphere Client.Workaround: None.**If you use an ESXi host deployed from a host profile with enabled stateful install as an image to deploy other ESXi hosts in a cluster, the operation fails**If you extract an image of an ESXi host deployed from a host profile with enabled stateful install to deploy other ESXi hosts in a vSphere Lifecycle Manager cluster, the operation fails. In the vSphere Client, you see an error such as A general system error occurred: Failed to extract image from the host: no stored copy available for inactive VIB VMW\_bootbank\_xxx. Extraction of image from host xxx.eng.vmware.com failed.Workaround: Use a different host from the cluster to extract an image.**You see error messages when try to stage vSphere Lifecycle Manager Images on ESXi hosts of version earlier than 8.0**ESXi 8.0 introduces the option to explicitly stage desired state images, which is the process of downloading depot components from the vSphere Lifecycle Manager depot to the ESXi hosts without applying the software and firmware updates immediately. However, staging of images is only supported on an ESXi 8.0 or later hosts. Attempting to stage a vSphere Lifecycle Manager image on ESXi hosts of version earlier than 8.0 results in messages that the staging of such hosts fails, and the hosts are skipped. This is expected behavior and does not indicate any failed functionality as all ESXi 8.0 or later hosts are staged with the specified desired image.Workaround: None. After you confirm that the affected ESXi hosts are of version earlier than 8.0, ignore the errors.**A remediation task by using vSphere Lifecycle Manager might intermittently fail on ESXi hosts with DPUs**When you start a vSphere Lifecycle Manager remediation on an ESXi hosts with DPUs, the host upgrades and reboots as expected, but after the reboot, before completing the remediation task, you might see an error such as:A general system error occurred: After host … remediation completed, compliance check reported host as 'non-compliant'. The image on the host does not match the image set for the cluster. Retry the cluster remediation operation.This is a rare issue, caused by an intermittent timeout of the post-remediation scan on the DPU.Workaround: Reboot the ESXi host and re-run the vSphere Lifecycle Manager compliance check operation, which includes the post-remediation scan.
## VMware Host Client Issues

**VMware Host Client might display incorrect descriptions for severity event states**When you look in the VMware Host Client to see the descriptions of the severity event states of an ESXi host, they might differ from the descriptions you see by using Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) or Lenovo XClarity Controller (XCC). For example, in the VMware Host Client, the description of the severity event state for the PSU Sensors might be Transition to Non-critical from OK, while in the XCC and IPMI, the description is Transition to OK.Workaround: Verify the descriptions for severity event states by using the ESXCLI command esxcli hardware ipmi sdr list and Lenovo XCC.
## Security Features Issues

**If you use an RSA key size smaller than 2048 bits, RSA signature generation fails**Starting from vSphere 8.0, ESXi uses the OpenSSL 3.0 FIPS provider. As part of the FIPS 186-4 requirement, the RSA key size must be at least 2048 bits for any signature generation, and signature generation with SHA1 is not supported.Workaround: Use RSA key size larger than 2048.
