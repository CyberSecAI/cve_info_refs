A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Secure Email and Web Manager, formerly known as Content Security Management Appliance (SMA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface.
 This vulnerability is due to insufficient user input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of an affected interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.
