- **Root cause:** Improper synchronization in the GPU driver leading to a race condition.
- **Weaknesses:** Use-after-free vulnerability.
- **Impact:** Local escalation of privilege.
- **Attack vector:** Exploiting a race condition in the GPU driver.
- **Required attacker capabilities:** System execution privileges are needed. User interaction is not required.
