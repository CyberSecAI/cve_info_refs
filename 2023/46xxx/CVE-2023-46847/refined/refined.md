Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-46847:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a buffer overflow vulnerability in Squid's HTTP Digest Authentication mechanism. This vulnerability stems from an incorrect conversion between numeric types within the HTTP request parsing, which allows a remote attacker to send specially crafted requests to trigger a denial of service.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **Buffer Overflow:** A stack or heap-based buffer overflow exists in the HTTP Digest authentication parsing logic. This allows an attacker to write an excessive amount of data to memory, leading to a crash or other unexpected behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation can lead to a denial of service condition, preventing legitimate users from accessing the proxy server. This results from a crash or unexpected behavior of the squid process.
*   **System compromise (in some cases):** Although not always directly stated as a consequence, a buffer overflow vulnerability can also be potentially used to achieve arbitrary code execution in some scenarios where memory protections are insufficient. 

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The attack can be performed remotely over the network by sending specifically crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable Squid proxy server, making it easily exploitable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote Access:** The attacker only needs network access to the vulnerable Squid proxy server.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication or user privileges to trigger the vulnerability.
*  **Knowledge of the vulnerable component**: An attacker needs to be able to formulate an HTTP request to a squid proxy server. The attack is targeted towards the HTTP Digest Authentication part of the proxy service.
* The attacker can craft a specific ftp:// url within an HTTP request, or through FTP native input, to trigger the bug.

**Additional notes from the provided content:**

*   The vulnerability is rated as "Critical" by Red Hat and "High" by NetApp.
*   Various Red Hat Security Advisories (RHSAs) have been released to address this issue, indicating its widespread impact on Red Hat-based systems.
*   Affected Squid versions range from 3.2.0.1 up to 6.3.
*   The official fix is in Squid version 6.4 but also available as patches for some versions.
*   A workaround is to disable HTTP Digest authentication.
*    NetApp states that their products are not affected by this vulnerability, but it is still present in their software, however, it is unused in any of the NetApp products listed.
*   The Debian LTS advisory also confirms that a buffer overflow is caused during HTTP Digest Authentication, and that support for Gopher protocol was removed as a mitigation strategy for CVE-2023-46728.
* The Debian LTS advisory states a DoS can be achieved by sending a large X-Forwarded-For header
* The github advisory states the severity is critical, with a CVSS score of 9.9.
* The github advisory also mentioned the vulnerability can occur when squid is configured to accept HTTP Digest Authentication, which leads to the overflow on the heap.
