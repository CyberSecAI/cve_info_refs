Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-46974

**Root Cause:** The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization within the "Best Courier Management System" version 1.000. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize user-supplied input passed through the `page` parameter in URLs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS vulnerability. User-supplied input through the `page` URL parameter is directly rendered into the web page without proper encoding or sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the vulnerable web page. When a user visits the crafted URL, the injected script will execute in the user's browser.
*   **Cookie Theft:** The video demonstration explicitly shows how an attacker can use XSS to steal user cookies, potentially gaining access to the user's session and account.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Attack:** The attack can be launched remotely, and no local access is required.
*   **Crafted URL:** The attack vector is primarily a crafted URL. An attacker constructs a malicious URL containing the XSS payload within the `page` parameter. The victim must click on this malicious URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Knowledge of vulnerable parameter:** The attacker needs to know that the `page` parameter is vulnerable.
*   **Ability to craft malicious URL:** The attacker must be capable of constructing a URL with the malicious XSS payload.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker must get the victim to click on the crafted URL.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is present across multiple pages within the application. Any page that uses the vulnerable parameter is susceptible.
*   The proof-of-concept demonstrates injecting javascript to extract document cookies which can lead to session hijacking.
