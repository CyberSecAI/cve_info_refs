[00:01] hi team this is jish and today I'm going
[00:03] to show you in
[00:07] accessability in the best cier
[00:09] management system which is taken from
[00:11] codster and uh let's move forward for
[00:14] the avilability so first I'm going to
[00:16] enter the email and uh here is the email
[00:21] infospace
[00:26] gmail.com may. infospace gmail.com and
[00:30] password is admin
[00:32] simply so I don't know there is an issue
[00:35] so we need to log three to four
[00:39] times and I think the cookies would have
[00:42] been set so yeah uh we ref it and we are
[00:46] logged in so here we are going to
[00:51] this uh password fun add password
[00:53] functional at partial functionality okay
[00:57] and here uh we are going to in put our
[01:00] accss payload that is
[01:04] iph
[01:08] [Music]
[01:10] confirm then our favorite
[01:16] document. cookie payload hyphen to grab
[01:21] cookies and then we have uh sending this
[01:26] enter we are copying this Bel and we we
[01:29] are sending this and here we are
[01:33] presented with an accesss popup that is
[01:35] containing
[01:37] cookies on the screen okay so let's try
[01:41] the same on the other Pages as well
[01:44] because the same vulnerability is
[01:46] existing in the multiple pages okay so
[01:50] here it is so this is something known as
[01:53] URL based TSS in the best career
[01:55] management
[01:58] system
[02:01] M
[02:02] so uh
[02:05] Branch head staff parcel new parcel
[02:08] parcel status uh wherever uh we are
[02:11] going and it is having some parameter we
[02:15] are injecting this and uh we are getting
[02:17] the
[02:18] popup so uh let's try removing this we
[02:22] just uh simply put simply we will be
[02:25] putting one or two and trying this so
[02:30] yeah this confirms the existence of
[02:32] accss in the best career management
[02:36] system which is now being reported
[02:38] thanks for
[02:42] watching
