Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2023-46944:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the GitLens extension for Visual Studio Code (VSCode) executing Git commands within untrusted workspaces. This is problematic because Git allows local repositories to have their own configurations that can override global or user settings. These local configurations can specify custom commands to run during certain events, allowing for arbitrary code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution via Git Local Configuration:** GitLens was found to be executing `git` commands in the directory of the workspace, even when the workspace was not trusted. This allowed an attacker to craft a malicious repository with a custom `.git/config` file that would execute arbitrary code when the repository was opened in VSCode with the GitLens extension installed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By opening a malicious repository, a user would be vulnerable to arbitrary code execution on their machine, enabling attackers to install malware, steal data, or perform other malicious actions.
*   **Workspace Trust Bypass:** The vulnerability allowed attackers to bypass the Workspace Trust security boundary of VSCode, which is designed to prevent untrusted code from being executed.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Repository:** The primary attack vector is a specially crafted Git repository containing malicious configurations.
*   **User Interaction:** The user must open the malicious repository in VSCode with the vulnerable version of the GitLens extension installed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to create and distribute a Git repository:** An attacker must be able to create and distribute a malicious Git repository.
*   **Victim needs to have GitLens extension installed.**
*   **Victim needs to open the malicious repository in VSCode:** The attacker must persuade a victim to open the malicious repository.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   The vulnerability was present in GitLens before version 14.0.0.
*   The vulnerability is triggered when the user opens a malicious folder.
*   The blog post details the specific code changes made in GitLens to mitigate the issue, which involves disabling the Git integration for untrusted workspaces.
