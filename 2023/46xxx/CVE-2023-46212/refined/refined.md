- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin has missing authorization, authentication or nonce token check in a function. This allows an unprivileged user to execute a higher privileged action.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control. Specifically, the absence of proper authorization/authentication mechanisms.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user (subscriber) can perform actions that should be restricted to users with higher privileges. The specific impact varies case by case.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited through a function lacking authorization checks. The specific method of exploitation would vary.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a subscriber level user.
