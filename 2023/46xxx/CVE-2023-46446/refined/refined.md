{
  "CVE-2023-46446": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "A state machine flaw in AsyncSSH server allows it to accept an unauthenticated user authentication request message and defer it until the client has requested the authentication protocol.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
        "State machine flaw"
      ],
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can log the client into the attacker's account without the client detecting it, gaining complete control over the remote end of the SSH session, including keyboard input, terminal output, forwarded network ports, and forwarded SSH Agent, leading to a complete break of confidentiality and integrity.",
      "Attack vectors": "The attacker injects a chosen authentication request before the client's NewKeys message. The attacker needs a shell account on the AsyncSSH server.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must have a shell account on the AsyncSSH server and be able to intercept and modify network traffic (man-in-the-middle)."
    },
    {
        "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the AsyncSSH server's state machine where it accepts an unauthenticated user authentication request and defers it. This occurs before the client has even requested the authentication protocol.",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
          "State machine flaw allowing out-of-order message processing",
          "Accepting unauthenticated authentication request"
        ],
        "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject a rogue authentication request, potentially logging a victim into the attacker's account. This provides the attacker with complete control over the remote SSH session, enabling data interception, output manipulation, port forwarding abuse, and potentially compromised SSH Agent use.",
        "Attack vectors": "Man-in-the-middle attack involving injecting a crafted authentication request before the client's `NewKeys` message during the SSH handshake.",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Network-level man-in-the-middle access, a valid account on the AsyncSSH server, and the ability to inject/remove packets during the handshake."
    }
  ],
  "CVE-2023-46445": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "An implementation flaw in AsyncSSH allows an attacker to inject a chosen extension info message and delete the original one, effectively replacing it.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
        "Implementation flaw in processing of extension info messages",
        "Accepting unauthenticated extension info messages"

      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can downgrade the algorithm used for client authentication by manipulating the 'server-sig-algs' extension.",

      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Network-level man-in-the-middle access."

    {
        "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the AsyncSSH implementation incorrectly processing unauthenticated extension info messages during the SSH handshake.",

          "Improper handling of unauthenticated extension info messages",
          "Lack of validation on extension info messages before processing"
        ],
        "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can replace the original extension info message with one of their choosing, enabling downgrade attacks such as forcing the use of weaker algorithms during client authentication (e.g., SHA-1 instead of SHA-2).",
        "Attack vectors": "Man-in-the-middle attack on an SSH connection, injecting a rogue `EXT_INFO` message before the client's `NewKeys` message during the SSH handshake.",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Network-level man-in-the-middle access, the target must use AsyncSSH as a client and connect to a server that sends an extension info message."
