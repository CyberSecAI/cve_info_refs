Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The Splunk Add-on Builder application, in versions below 4.1.4, writes user session tokens to its internal log files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-532** (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File):  The application logs sensitive session tokens.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  An attacker who gains access to the log files or has administrative access to internal indexes could potentially gain unauthorized access to user accounts by using the exposed session tokens. This could lead to:
    - **Confidentiality Breach:** Access to user data and configuration.
    - **Integrity Violation:** Modification of system configurations or data.
    - **Availability Impact:**  Disruption of services.
- The CVSS score reflects a high severity due to potential for high impact on Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local File Access:** An attacker with local access to the server where the Splunk Add-on Builder is installed can directly read the log files.
- **Administrative Access to Internal Indexes:** An attacker with administrative privileges within Splunk can access internal logs through the indexing system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** Physical or remote shell access to the server hosting the Splunk Add-on Builder.
- **Splunk Admin Access:** Administrative credentials or compromised administrator account that allows querying of internal indexes.
- **User interaction:** The user whose session token is exposed must have interacted with the application.

**Additional Details:**
- The advisory provides a detailed list of specific log files that contain the exposed session tokens:
    - `splunk_app_addon-builder_default_metric_events.log`
    - `splunk_app_addon-builder_ta_builder_validation.log`
    - `splunk_app_addon-builder_ta_builder.log`
    - `splunk_app_addon-builder_validation_engine.log`
- The advisory recommends upgrading to version 4.1.4 or higher, deleting the log files, and clearing the internal index.
- The fix is specific to the Splunk Add-on Builder and does not affect the add-ons generated by it.
