**CWE:** [CWE-532](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/532.html)

**Bug ID:** ADDON-63902

## Description

In Splunk Add-on Builder versions below 4.1.4, the application writes user session tokens to internal log files.The vulnerability requires either local access to the log files or administrative access to internal indexes, which by default only the admin role receives. Review roles and capabilities on your instance and restrict internal index access to administrator-level roles. See [Define roles on the Splunk platform with capabilities](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Security/Rolesandcapabilities) for more information.

## Solution

To fully remedy the vulnerability, do the following:

1. Upgrade Splunk Add-on Builder to version 4.1.4 or higher
2. Delete all Splunk Add-on Builder log files located at $SPLUNK\_HOME/var/log/splunk/ including the following:
   * splunk\_app\_addon-builder\_default\_metric\_events.log
   * splunk\_app\_addon-builder\_ta\_builder\_validation.log
   * splunk\_app\_addon-builder\_ta\_builder.log
   * splunk\_app\_addon-builder\_validation\_engine.log
3. Delete all Splunk Add-on Builder log file events by running the following command:\*
    `index=_* sourcetype="splunk:tabuilder:log" | delete`
4. Restart Splunk Enterprise\*

\*Note: Restarting Splunk Enterprise invalidates all session tokens.

\*\*Note: The delete command requires the can\_delete role, which administrators do not receive by default. See [delete](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/SplunkCloud/latest/SearchReference/Delete) for more info on the delete search command.

The solution applies to the Splunk Add-on Builder only. Add-ons that the Splunk Add-on Builder generates are not directly affected and do not require updating or editing.
