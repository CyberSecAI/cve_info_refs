# Nmap Network Scanning

[![Cover of Nmap Network Scanning](https://nmap.org/book/cover/nns-whole-cover-326x200.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0979958717?tag=secbks-20)

*Nmap Network Scanning* is
the official guide to the [Nmap Security Scanner](https://nmap.org/),
a free and open source utility used by millions of people for
network discovery, administration, and security auditing. From
explaining port scanning basics for novices to detailing
low-level packet crafting methods used by advanced hackers, this book suits
all levels of security and networking professionals. A 42-page reference
guide documents every Nmap feature and option, while the rest of the
book demonstrates how to apply those features to quickly solve
real-world tasks. Examples and diagrams show actual communication on
the wire.

Topics include subverting firewalls and intrusion detection systems,
optimizing Nmap performance, and automating common networking tasks
with the Nmap Scripting Engine. Hints and instructions are provided
for common uses such as taking network inventory, penetration testing,
detecting rogue wireless access points, and quashing network worm
outbreaks. Nmap runs on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X.

Nmap's original author, Gordon “Fyodor” Lyon, wrote
this book to share everything he has learned about network scanning
during more than a decade of Nmap development. It was briefly the #1
selling computer book on Amazon
([screenshot](https://nmap.org/book/img/nns-top-seller-942x1024.png)).
The book is in English, though [several translations](#translations) are in the works.

Key facts: The ISBN is 978-0-9799587-1-7 (ISBN-10 is 0-9799587-1-7)
and suggested retail prices are $49.95 in the U.S., £34.95 in
the U.K., and €39.95 in Europe. Like most books, it costs less
online (as little as $32.97 - see [purchasing
options](#purchase)). It is 468 pages long. The official release date was
January 1, 2009, though Amazon managed to beat that by a couple weeks.

About half of the content is [available in the
free online edition](toc.html). Chapters exclusive to the print edition
include “Detecting and Subverting Firewalls and Intrusion
Detection Systems”, “Optimizing Nmap Performance”,
“Port Scanning Techniques and Algorithms”, “Host
Discovery (Ping Scanning)”, and more.
The *solution* selections which provide detailed
instructions on the best way to solve common networking tasks are also
exclusive to the printed book. The
[final table of contents](toc.pdf) and [cover art](cover/) are available.

## Updates

Several people asked whether Nmap Network Scanning
is still up to date, particularly after the release of [Nmap 5.00](https://nmap.org/5/). The good news is that virtually all of the
content remains accurate. But we have added some new features and
NSE scripts which aren't yet documented in NNS.

For a comprehensive and completely current view of Nmap, I
recommend reading Nmap Network Scanning first, then read all the
changelog entries we've produced since the book was finished. The
book is completely up-to-date with Nmap 4.76. So after (or before)
you're done reading Nmap Network Scanning, visit
the [Nmap changelog](https://nmap.org/changelog.html) and search
in the file for “Nmap 4.76”. Read each item upward from there
(scrolling backward) until you get to the top.
## Translations

We would love to make the Nmap book more accessible by working with foreign publishers who will translate and distribute it in their markets. If you are such a publisher or know a good one to suggest, please let me know. Here are the current or in-progress translations:

* [![Cover of 'Nmap - Netzwerke scannen, analysieren und absichern'](xlate/nmap-opensourcepress-de-cover-95x125.jpg)](https://www.opensourcepress.de/index.php?26&backPID=178&tt_products=270)
  [Nmap - Netzwerke scannen, analysieren und absichern](https://www.opensourcepress.de/index.php?26&backPID=178&tt_products=270) is the German translation by Open Source Press, released in June 2009 at a list price of €39.90. Translation was performed expertly by Dinu Gherman. They have contributed back their [Nmap Reference Guide German translation](/man/de/).* [![Cover of 'Exame de Redes com NMAP'](xlate/nmap-ciencia-moderna-cover-95x125.jpg)](http://www.lcm.com.br/index.php?Escolha=20&Livro=L00778)
    [Exame de Redes com NMAP](http://www.lcm.com.br/index.php?Escolha=20&Livro=L00778) is the Brazilian Portuguese translation by Editora Ciência Moderna. Translation was done by [Angico](http://www.angico.org) and release was August 26, 2009. You can [buy it directly from the publisher](http://www.lcm.com.br/index.php?Escolha=20&Livro=L00778) for R$95.20.* [![Cover of '엔맵 네트워크 스캐닝'](xlate/nmap-acornpub-ko-cover-95x125.png)](http://www.acornpub.co.kr/book/nmap)
      The official Korean translation, entitled [엔맵 네트워크 스캐닝](http://www.acornpub.co.kr/book/nmap), has been created by [Acorn Publishing Co](http://www.acornpub.co.kr/). The release date was November 16, 2009 at a list price of KRW 35,000.

## Current status

**August 26:** Many Barnes & Noble stores now stock NNS, as described in the [purchasing section](#purchase).

**August 26:** Editora Ciência Moderna released the Brazilian Portuguese translation. See [translations](#translations).

**July 31:** Held a [book signing](http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q3/0426.html) at Defcon. All copies sold out in 3 hours.

**July 17:** Added [Updates](#updates) section.

**July 16:** [Nmap 5.00](https://nmap.org/5/) released!

**June 11:** The German translation from Open Source Press is [now available](https://www.opensourcepress.de/index.php?26&backPID=178&tt_products=270). They also contributed back a [German translation of the Nmap Reference Guide.](/man/de/)

**January 30:** Today the Amazon price is back to $32.97 after several days at $37.96. I hope they keep it at this price!

**January 23:** Amazon has raised their prices, so I've added [more purchase options](#purchase), though the cheapest is still only about $4.50 less than Amazon when domestic shipping is taken into account.

**January 21:** NNS receives a [glowing review](http://netsecurity.about.com/od/14/gr/NMapBook.htm) from About.Com.

**January 19:** Translation contracts have been signed for Korean and Brazilian Portuguese editions of Nmap Network Scanning! See the new [Translations](#translations) section for details.

**January 5:** [Acorn Publishing Co.](http://www.acornpub.co.kr) will be publishing the official Korean translation of Nmap Network Scanning! Release is expected in August.

**January 4:** NNS is finally in stock at [Amazon U.K.](http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0979958717) and [Amazon Germany](http://www.amazon.de/dp/0979958717). Amazon Canada currently still has a [1-3 week backlog](http://www.amazon.ca/dp/0979958717).

**December 31, 2008:** NNS makes Richard Bejtlich's TaoSecurity [Top Books of 2008](http://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2008/12/best-book-bejtlich-read-in-2008.html) list.

**December 29, 2008:** A new [Information Week review](http://www.informationweek.com/blog/main/archives/2008/12/nmap_network_sc.html) is one of the best so far!

**December 19, 2008:** The book is [back in stock on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0979958717?tag=secbks-20) after a 10 day dry spell!

**December 10, 2008:** Amazon has now indexed this book as part of
their “Search Inside” program. While Amazon intends this
as a marketing tool for prospective buyers, it can be even more useful
for folks who already own the book. While we're proud of our index,
Search Inside can help find more obscure terms or combinations of them. You can try this out by visiting
the [Amazon
NNS page](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0979958717?tag=secbks-20), scrolling down to the Search Inside box, and typing in a
term such as Trinity or Microsoft.

**December 9, 2008:** Sales were so high that Amazon ran out of stock in the US, UK, and Germany. They say it may take a week or more to ship. Amazon still offers a great price, but for those who can't wait, I've added a [purchasing options](#purchase) section. It includes vendor such as A1Books and Barnes & Noble with NNS in stock now.

**December 9, 2008:** Nmap Network Scanning sales surge further to become #1 on [Amazon's computer book best seller list](http://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/5/ref%3Dpd_zg_hrsr_b_1_2%26tag%3Dsecbks-20)! Since we can't keep that rank forever, I took a [screenshot](img/nns-top-seller-471x512.png) ([larger version](img/nns-top-seller-942x1024.png)).

**December 8, 2008:**
An [excellent
Slashdot review](http://books.slashdot.org/books/08/12/08/1443223.shtml) causes NNS to rocket into [Amazon's top 10 computer books](http://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/5/ref%3Dpd_zg_hrsr_b_1_2%26tag%3Dsecbks-20).

**December 6, 2008:** Amazon has [fixed the price](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0979958717?tag=secbks-20) so it is now $33.71 rather than $49.95. NNS is **in stock and shipping**!

**December 2, 2008:** The book has [an initial page on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0979958717?tag=secbks-20). You can pre-order it now, but Amazon is showing a pre-order price of $49.95. I expect the price to be about $33 when Amazon starts shipping it within a week or two. Amazon will probably refund the difference per their "Pre-order price guarantee", but it might be safer to wait. Book seller BOOKSPLUSMORESTUFF claims to have the book "in stock" on Amazon for $53.94 including shipping. That may or may not be true.

**November 14, 2008:** The book is finished and submitted to the
printer! The official release date is January 1, 2009, though our
goal is to make it available on Amazon and other retailers by
mid-December. To be notified upon publication, join the
low-traffic [nmap-hackers
announcement mailing list](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce).

**September 15, 2008:** The Black Hat/Defcon pre-release was a huge
success! All of the Defcon copies were snapped up as soon as the
vendor room opened, and the Black Hat copies also sold out in the
first morning of the conference. Thanks to Bill Pollock of No Starch
Press and Dave Hemsath of BreakPoint Books for handling sales. My
conference presentation video and audio have
been [posted
online](http://insecure.org/presentations/) just in time for
the [Nmap
4.75 release](http://seclists.org/nmap-hackers/2008/0004.html) which includes the new features discussed in that
presentation.

**July 25, 2008**: Defcon Pre-Release announced! We have decided to
launch the book with a limited pre-release version at Defcon 16.

**July 1, 2008**: After years of work, Nmap Network Scanning is nearing completion. You can browse the [current table of contents](toc.pdf) to see what is coming. We recently conducted a test-printing of some prepublication copies:

[![Prepublication test-print of Nmap Network Scanning](images/nns-preprint3-750w.jpg)](images/nns-preprint3-1224x1466.jpg)

1 Introduction

1.1  Overview

The  L-INX  product  family  consists  of  high  performance,  reliable  and  secure  network
infrastructure  components  that  implement  an  embedded  automation  server.  The  different
models of the L-INX family contain a number of components and network technologies. As
protocols on the control network side, the L-INX implements access to BACnet, CEA-709,
KNX, Modbus, and M-Bus. The BACnet models are BTL-certified B-BC devices.

The  L-GATE  product  family  is  intended  for  use  as  universal  gateways.  They  provide  a
similar user interface and set of protocols as the L-INX family. The L-GATE provides data
access to a defined set of data points, which are mapped from one control network technology
to  another  control  network  technology.  In  particular,  the  CEA-709/BACnet  Gateway
(LGATE-902)  implements  mappings  between  a  set  of  CEA-709  network  variables  (NVs)
and a set of standard BACnet server objects. Which NVs are mapped to BACnet objects can
be configured by an LNS plug-in or stand-alone configuration software. The LGATE-902 is
equipped with a 100-BaseT Ethernet port (IP), an FT-10 port (CEA-709), and an RS-485 port
(MS/TP).  The  device
is  fully  compliant  with  ANSI/CEA-709  and  ENV14908,
ANSI/ASHRAE-135-2004 and ISO 16484. The LGATE-95X extends the 902 model with a
number of additional protocol ports and supports more data points for the gateway.

Data from the supported network technologies are available as data points in the automation
server. Those data points are freely configurable via configuration software, which provides
a  fast  and  easy  way  to  configure  the  L-INX  and  L-GATE  using  online  network  scans,
import/export  features  or  device  templates.  Data  points  between  different  network
technologies  can  be  connected  to  each  other  for  data  transfer  between  those  network
technologies (gateway). Data  points are  also subject to alarming,  trending and scheduling
(AST)  functions  of  the  automation  server.  The  usage  of  math  objects  allows  basic
calculations and the built-in E-mail client allows the L-INX and L-GATE to transmit e-mails
on  certain  conditions.  Generated  alarms  can  be  configured  to  send  e-mails  to  predefined
addresses. Alarms can also be stored in a historical alarm log. Trended data collected by the
device and is available in CSV format and through a dedicated Web service.

An embedded OPC server exposes a defined set of data points as OPC tags. It implements
the  OPC  XML-DA  standard  OPC XML-DA 1.01,  which  lets  OPC  clients  access  the  data
points via Web services. For secure OPC communication some L-INX models add an OPC
UA  server.  Which  native  data  points  are  exposed  to  OPC  can  also  be  configured  by  the
configuration  software.  AST  objects  such  as  schedules  are  exposed  as  a  set  of  OPC  tags.
Using the supplied L-WEB designer, users can easily generate a Web-based visualization for
the L-INX.

Only  the  L-INX  family  contains  a  freely  programmable  controller  that  can  operate  on  all
L-INX data points. The controller application is developed using the provided IEC-61131
compliant design tool.

LOYTEC

The L-INX and the  L-GATE permanently collect statistical information from the attached
network channels (OPC connections, FT traffic, MS/TP token passing, Ethernet traffic, etc.).
Using this data, the device is able to detect problems on these channels (overload, lost tokens,
connection problems, etc.) and warns the  system operator via LEDs (see Section  6.4). An
intuitive user interface allows fast and easy network troubleshooting without any additional
analysis tools or deep system knowledge. For troubleshooting Ethernet protocols a local and
remote Wireshark packet capture can be configured (see Section 10.2).

The  built-in  Web  server  allows  convenient  device  configuration  through  a  standard  Web
browser such as the Internet Explorer or Firefox. The Web interface also provides statistics
information for system installation and network troubleshooting. Some devices also have an
LCD display, which provides a quick way to configure basic settings of the device via a jog
dial.  Also  available  on  some  L-INX  models  are  ports  for  SD  card  memory  and  a  USB
peripheral bus.

Some L-INX and L-GATE models are also equipped with a 2-port Ethernet Switch/Hub. In
switched mode an Ethernet daisy chain can be built, which reduces cabling effort. The two
Ethernet connectors can also be configured to work as two isolated IP interfaces. This can be
used to safely connect a local building network while keeping it isolated from WAN access,
that exposes some aspects using secure services. By using the external L-WLAN adapter, the
device also provides a WLAN interface, which can link to an existing access point, set up its
own access point or work in a wireless mesh network.

The L-INX is used for:

  Exposing  data  of  control  network  devices  from  different  technologies  (CEA-709,

BACnet, KNX, Modbus, M-Bus) to data points in the automation server,

  Directly connecting I/Os to data points in the automation server,







exposing data points to OPC tags,

1.2  CEA-709.1

L-INX automation server models that have CEA-709 and all L-GATE models are equipped
with  an  FT  port  (CEA-709)  and  a  100Base-T  Ethernet  port  (CEA-852).  CEA-709  L-INX
models come with a router option or an RNI option. L-INX models with the router option
contain a CEA-709 router between the FT and the IP-852 channel, which can be configured
like  an  L-IP.  It  includes  a  configuration  server  (CS)  to  manage  the  IP-852  channel.  The
L-INX models without the router option contain a remote network interface (RNI) instead of
the router for remote network access. Please refer to Table 1 to learn, which device models
have CEA-709 and the router option.

The  CEA-709  L-INX  and  L-GATE  device  is  fully  compliant  with  ANSI/CEA-709,
ANSI/CEA-852-A, EN 14908. The CEA-709 node, that is going to be commissioned in the
network, is always connected to the FT port of the device.

The  function  of  the  CEA-709  node  is  to  expose  CEA-709  network  variables  (NVs)  and
configuration properties (CPs) to data points in the automation server or the gateway. The
configuration software can be run as LNS plug-in or stand-alone. The CEA-709 data points
can be bound in the CEA-709 network as NVs or operated as “external NVs”. External NVs
are polled or explicitly written to without allocating static or dynamic NVs on the device. In
this case, address information is supplied by the configuration software by importing e.g., a
CSV file. User-defined network variable types (UNVTs) can be used as dynamic or external
NVs. Configuration properties (CPs) on other devices can be accessed through file transfer.
To transfer CPs, the device supports both the LONMARK file transfer and the read memory
access  method.  For  CPs,  the  standard  SCPTs  and  user-defined  UCPTs  are  supported.  All
those CEA-709 data points can be exposed to the automation server or the gateway.

The  CEA-709  L-INX  with  the  router  option  possesses  a  router  between  the  CEA-852
interface (IP-852) and the FT interface. The CEA-852 interface can be used to connect the
L-INX to an IP-based high-speed backbone. The L-INX’s router can be used as a standard
CEA-709 configured router or it can be used as a self-learning plug&play router based on the
high-performance, well-proven routing core from our L-Switch plug&play multi-port router
devices (“smart switch mode”). The self-learning router doesn’t need a network management
tool for configuration but is a true plug&play and easy to use IP infrastructure component.
For a detailed description of the CEA-709 router’s usage refer to the L-IP User Manual [8].

The L-GATE and the CEA-709 L-INX without the router option can be configured to run
either on the CEA-852 interface (IP-852 mode) or on the FT interface (FT mode). In the FT
mode, the device provides a remote network interface (RNI), which appears like a LOYTEC
NIC-IP is intended to be used together with the LOYTEC NIC software [3]. The RNI can be
utilized for remote access and configuration as well as trouble-shooting with the remote LPA.
Please  consult  our  product  literature  for  the  LPA-IP  to  learn  more  about  this  IP-based
CEA-709 protocol analyzer.

The CEA-709 technology in the L-INX and L-GATE allows for:

  Exposing CEA-709 network variables (NVs) and configuration properties (CPs) as data

points to the automation server or gateway,







supporting standard (SNVT, SCPT) and user-defined (UNVT, UCPT) types,

scheduling CEA-709 network variables,

generating alarms over the LONMARK node object,

  CEA-709 PC applications (as a CEA-709 network interface),





remote LPA functionality,

communicating  on  CEA-709  with  either  FT  or  IP-852  (IP  channel  on  the
Intranet/Internet),



connecting  an  FT  channel  to  a  high-performance  backbone  using  existing  IP  infra-
structure,



operating as a configuration server for IP-852 devices with the router option.

1.3  BACnet

L-INX  automation  server  models  that  have  BACnet  and  all  L-GATE  models  are  BTL-
certified products that implement the B-BC profile. They are equipped with an MS/TP port
and a 100Base-T Ethernet port (BACnet/IP and/or BACnet/SC). The MS/TP port supports
remote Wireshark packet capture for troubleshooting. BACnet L-INX models with the router
option also contain a BACnet router between the MS/TP and the BACnet/IP and BACnet/SC
ports, which can be configured like an LIP-ME20X. The router models also include a BACnet
broadcast  management  device  (BBMD)  to  manage  BACnet/IP  internetworks,  which  span
across IP routers. BACnet models without the router can register as a foreign device (FD)
with other BBMDs. The device is fully compliant with ANSI/ASHRAE 135-2020 (Rev 1.16)
and ISO 16484-5. Please refer to Table 1 to learn, which device models have BACnet and
the router option.

The BACnet L-INX and the L-GATE expose BACnet server objects and client mappings to
data points of the automation server or the gateway. For client mappings, the BACnet address
information is supplied by the configuration software  by importing e.g., a  CSV  file or by
performing an online network scan.

The BACnet L-INX  and L-GATE models also support the LOYTEC Alarming, Scheduling
and  Trending  (AST)  features  in  native  BACnet  objects.  The  device  provides  BACnet
scheduler/calendar  objects,  which  can  directly  schedule  BACnet  server  objects,  remote
BACnet  objects  or  non-BACnet  registers.  For  alarm  conditions  the  device  supports  the
intrinsic reporting method of BACnet objects. Trend logs can be uploaded from the device
via the native BACnet read range.

The  BACnet  L-INX  with  the  router  option  possesses  a  BACnet  router  between  the
BACnet/IP port, the BACnet/SC port, and the MS/TP port. This router can be operated and
configured like the  LIP-ME20X from  LOYTEC. The BACnet/IP or BACnet/SC interface
can be used to connect the L-INX to an IP-based high-speed backbone. The L-INX also can
act as a BBMD for a BACnet/IP network. For a detailed description of the BACnet router’s
usage refer to the LIP-ME20X User Manual [9].

A BACnet L-INX without the router option and the L-GATE can be configured to run either
on the BACnet/IP or on the BACnet/SC or on the MS/TP interface. In BACnet/IP mode, the
L-INX can be configured as a foreign device in another BBMD. The BACnet L-INX without
the router option does not provide the BBMD functionality itself. The L-GATE can also be
configured to be a BBMD. Please refer to Table 1 to learn, which models can be configured
as a BBMD.

The BACnet technology in the L-INX and L-GATE allows for:

  Using the device as a BTL-certified B-BC,













exposing local BACnet server objects (analog, binary, multi-state) and remote objects
(client mappings) to data points,

1.4  M-Bus

In addition to the basic network technologies all models except the LGATE-900 support the
M-Bus interface according to the standards EN 13757-2 and EN 13757-3. To get access to
the M-Bus network, an external M-Bus interface such as the L-MBUS by LOYTEC must be
attached to the device. On devices with a serial port, the M-Bus interface is connected to the
serial  connector.  In  this  case  the  user  needs  to  turn  M-Bus  support  on  and  off  via  a  DIP
switch. On devices without a serial port, the L-MBUS interface must be used and is connected
to the extension port (EXT).

Through the M-Bus interface the L-INX can be used to scan the attached M-Bus network for
devices,  pull  M-Bus  data  points  into  a  configuration,  connect  those  data  points  to  other
technologies and expose M-Bus data points to the automation server. All AST functions can
be used directly on M-Bus data points. Especially trending data and polling for data on M-
Bus devices has been optimized for automatic meter reading applications.

For debugging purposes a protocol analyzer is included in the firmware and can be operated
via the Web-UI and the configuration software. For more information on how to set up the
device for using M-Bus, configuring and using M-Bus data points, refer to the M-Bus Chapter
in the LINX Configurator User Manual [2].

1.5  Modbus

In addition to the basic network technologies the all models support the Modbus RTU and
the Modbus TCP interface. To get access to the Modbus network, the appropriate interfaces
have to be activated either in the Web UI or in the configuration software. Modbus RTU is
operated  with  8N1.  A  Modbus  port  can  either  be  operated  as  Modbus  master  or  Modbus
slave.

On some BACnet L-INX models, the Modbus RTU and BACnet MS/TP protocols share the
same port. On those models, Modbus RTU can only be used, if BACnet MS/TP is disabled.
Please refer to Table 1 to learn, which BACnet L-INX models have this restriction.

Using the LRS232-802 interface extends a LOYTEC device by two RS-232 ports over the
USB connector. Modbus ASCII or RTU can be operated on those RS-232 extension ports
where RS-232 cennectivity is required.

Through the Modbus interface the device can be used to data points to other technologies,
and  expose  Modbus  data  points  to  OPC  tags.  All  AST  functions  can  be  used  directly  on
Modbus data points. Especially trending data and polling for data on Modbus devices has
been optimized for automatic meter reading applications.

For debugging purposes a protocol analyzer is included in the firmware and can be operated
via the Web UI and the configuration software. For more information on how to set up the
device for using Modbus, configuring and using Modbus data points, refer to  the Modbus
Chapter in the LINX Configurator User Manual [2].

In  addition  to  the  basic  network  technologies,  some  L-INX  and  L-GATE  models  can  be
connected to KNX networks (see Section 1.12). To gain access to a KNX TP1 network, the
LKNX-300 interface has to be attached to the device for TP1 networks. All KNX-capable
models support KNXnet/IP directly with their Ethernet interface.

The  KNX  interface  allows  creating  KNX  data  points  which  can  be  used  with  the  AST
functions, the OPC server and also the PLC on the L-INX models. The device configuration
can be imported from an ETS database export.

For  more information on how to set up the  device  for using KNX, configuring and using
KNX data points, refer to the KNX Chapter in the LINX Configurator User Manual [2].

1.7  EnOcean

In addition to the basic network technologies, some L-INX and L-GATE models can integrate
EnOcean  wireless devices (see Section  1.12). To gain access to an EnOcean network, the
LENO-800 interface has to be attached via one of the USB ports USB 1 or USB 2.

The EnOcean interface is represented in the Configurator as a technology folder. EnOcean
devices are created from device templates and provide data points, which can be used with
the AST functions, the OPC server and also the PLC on the L-INX models.

For debugging purposes a protocol analyzer is included in the firmware and can be operated
via  the  Web  UI.  For  more  information  on  how  to  set  up  the  device  for  using  EnOcean,
configuring  and  using  EnOcean  data  points,  refer  to  the  EnOcean  Chapter  in  the  LINX
Configurator User Manual [2].

1.8  SMI

In  addition  to  the  basic  network  technologies,  some  L-INX  and  L-GATE  models  can  be
connected  to  SMI  networks  (see  Section  1.12).  To  get  access  to  the  SMI  network,  the
LSMI-800 interface has to be attached to the EXT port of the device (for one SMI channel),
or the LSMI-804 interface to the USB port (for four SMI channels).

The SMI interface is represented in the Configurator as a technology folder. SMI devices are
created  from  device  templates  and  provide  data  points,  which  can  be  used  with  the  AST
functions, the OPC server and also the PLC on the L-INX models.

For debugging purposes a protocol analyzer is included in the firmware and can be operated
via the Web UI. For more information on how to set up the device for using SMI, configuring
and using SMI data points, refer to the SMI Chapter in the LINX Configurator User Manual
[2].

1.9  MP-Bus

In  addition  to  the  basic  network  technologies,  some  L-INX  and  L-GATE  models  can  be
connected to MP-Bus networks (see Section 1.12). To get access to the MP-Bus network, the
LMPBUS-804 interface has to be attached to the built-in USB ports USB 1 and USB 2. Up
to two LMPBUS-804 interfaces can be operated at the same time, covering a maximum of 8
MP-Bus channels. External USB hubs are not supported.

configuring  and  using  MP-Bus  data  points,  refer  to  the  MP-Bus  Chapter  in  the  LINX
Configurator User Manual [2].

1.10  L-IOB

The L-INX automation server models allow connecting physical I/Os to the device via the
L-IOB I/O modules (see Table 1). On some models those modules can be stacked up directly
to the L-INX using the LIOB-Connect feature (see Section 1.12). The connected I/O modules
are automatically identified and coupled as data points into the L-INX automation server. All
L-INX models also support easy integration of L-IOB I/O modules over FT cabling using the
LIOB-FT feature, or over Ethernet using the LIOB-IP feature.

L-IOB modules are available with digital inputs and outputs, analog inputs and outputs and
universal  inputs  that  are  configurable.  Some  models  are  also  available  with  a  differential
pressure sensor.

The I/O modules can be parameterized over the configuration software or the Web UI. All
parameterization data is stored on the L-INX and can be reloaded to the LIOB modules when
needed. The exchange of modules is detected automatically. For more information on how
to setup and use L-IOB I/Os please refer to the L-IOB I/O module user manual [7].

1.11  Scripting

Select  programmable  L-INX  and  L-GATE  models  provide  a  JavaScript-based  scripting
engine (see Table 1 and Table 2). On some of them, a license (L-IOT1) needs to be purchased
to enable the feature. The script engine allows users to implement custom protocols using
RESTful APIs, JSON, Web services for IoT integration into the LOYTEC data point model.
The dpal-js API gives JavaScript modules access to the data point server. Script modules are
embedded into and deployed along with the data point configuration.

The Web interface of the LOYTEC device offers an overview of installed script modules and
allows starting scripts in debug mode. The debug mode implements the inspector interface
of Google Chrome to debug JavaScript on the device. For more information read the new
Scripting Chapter in the LINX Configurator User Manual [2].

Node-RED™ is also available on LOYTEC devices with script support. The Node-RED™
editor is fully integrated in the Web interface. With Node-RED™ it is a simple task to use
published nodes and palettes for various tasks, such as REST APIs, MQTT, circadian light,
etc. There is also a built-in LOYTEC palette that provides nodes for reading and writing data
points on the device. This combination makes it easy to integrate various IoT components on
the LOYTEC device.

1.12  L-INX and L-GATE Models

This Section provides an overview of the different L-INX and L-GATE models in Table 1
and Table 2. This table identifies the different features of those models. Models that possess
a certain feature have a check mark () in the respective column. If a feature is not available
in the particular model, the column is left blank.

LOYTEC

L-INX  models  with  the  router  option  have  a  CEA-709  router  or  a  BACnet  router,
respectively. The LINX-151 has both a CEA-709 router between FT and IP and a BACnet
router between MS/TP and IP.

On L-INX models without the router option and on all L-GATE models, certain ports can
only be used alternatively. On models with CEA-709 this means either as CEA-709 FT or as
CEA-852 IP (see note 1 in Table 1 and Table 2). On models with BACnet this means either
as  BACnet  MS/TP  or  as  BACnet  IP  (see  note  2  in  Table  1  and  Table  2).  Some  BACnet
models have a restriction on Modbus RTU and BACnet MS/TP as they share the same port.
On those models Modbus RTU can only be used, if BACnet MS/TP is disabled (see note 3
in Table 1 and Table 2).

The LGATE-951 has two EXT ports and therefore can operate M-Bus and KNX TP1 at the
same time, while the LGATE-950 can use etiher M-Bus or KNX TP1. The LGATE-952 has
two RS-485 and three EXT ports.

The following items must be observed when earth-grounding system zero
24VAC:





In principle, both earth-grounding and non-grounding of system zero
of the operating voltage 24VAC is permitted. Important are the local
regulations and customs. Due to functional requirements, earth ground
may be necessary or inadmissible.
It is recommended to ground 24VAC systems unless this contradicts
the manufacturer’s instructions.

  To avoid earth loops, systems with PELV may only be connected to
earth  ground  at  one  point  in  the  system.  Unless  otherwise  stated,
usually at the transformer.

  The same applies to 24VDC power supplies.

CAUTION

Functional Earth

Functional earth must be connected to the building’s protective earthing (PE)
system on the installation side.

CAUTION

Operating Voltage 24V AC/DC

The power supply must meet the requirements for SELV or PELV. Permitted
deviation of the nominal voltage:

  At the transformer or power supply: 24V AC/DC -10 … + 10%
  At the device: 24V AC or DC ±10 %

CAUTION

Specification for 24VAC Transformers

4 What’s New in L-INX/L-GATE

4.1  New in L-INX/L-GATE 8.2.0

L-LOGICAD Licence Discontinued on L-INX

For new L-INX devices since production week 50/2023 (A64 models) the L-LOGICAD run-
time  license  is  no  longer  available.  PLC  programs  need  to  be  migrated  to  run  on  the  L-
STUDIO 61131 run-time instead. Upgrading older L-INX controllers to firmware 8.2.0 does
not remove an already installed L-LOGICAD license and it can still be used.

New generic trend mode “Interval+COV”

Generic  trends  now  offer  a  new  trending  mode:  Interval+COV.  This  is  a  combination  of
periodic logging and COV trends. Data records are recorded when the COV condition is met
and in a periodic fashion.

New historic filter “Current Value”

Historic filters can be configured to use an offset correction data point. In order to process
the current value including offset correction, the “Current value” filter item was added. This
item  contains  the  offset-corrected  value  of  the  underlying  data  point.  It  can  be  used,  for
example, to trend an offset-corrected meter value after replacing a meter.

Figure 1: Current value filter item for offset-corrected historic filters.

Edit BACnet Priority Array on Web UI

The detailed data point Web UI for BACnet objects now offers an editor for the priority array
of the underlying BACnet object. The editor allows editing each priority slot,  including a
clear option to withdraw a slot.

New iCalendar Schedulers

LOYTEC devices support a new scheduler object class that is based on iCalendar events.
This  scheduler  class  can  be  selected  as  an  alternative  to  the  generic  scheduler  class.  It
supports extended features such as events that span over midnight or last for several days,
flexible  recurrence  patterns  known  from  Outlook,  and  booking  information.  The  Web
interface has been extended to display an event view of the scheduler. External iCalendar
data sources can be imported by using a calendar URL, which allows pulling in data from
published Outlook or Google calendars.

The new currentEvent, upcomingEvent and upcomingTime data points can be used to display
booking information of a meeting room, while the known timeToNext and nextEvent data
points allow optimum start algorithms on the controller.

Edge Trigger Mode

Trends  and  alarms  can  be  based  on  trigger  conditions.  There  are  two  new  trigger  modes
available: rising edge and falling edge. These can be used to trigger a recording, if the trigger
data point changes from inactive to active (rising) or from active to inactive (falling).

Folder Component Placeholder for Alarm Messages

In addition to the full data point path, individual folder components of the path can now be
addressed using the %{fN} placeholder, where N refers to the N-th folder part above the data
point. For example on the data point “/User Registers/Building2/Floor3/Room101/temp” the
placeholder  %{f1}  expands  to  “Room101”  and  %{f2}  to  “Floor3”.  This  way,  individual
compositions of the folder components can be assembled to form the alarm message.

New WLAN Configuration Tabs and System Registers

The WLAN configuration of the port configuration has been re-modelled to better match the
client and access point (AP) use cases. The tabs are now labelled WLAN Client and WLAN
Access Point. These tabs are restricted to settings that apply to their respective use.

Figure 4: New WLAN configuration tabs

The system registers have also been moved to sub-folders named WLAN Client and WLAN
Access Point.  Setting SSID, Key and writing the new Enable system register under either
port allows enabling the client or AP, respectively.

BACnet/SC

LOYTEC devices support the BACnet/SC node function. This allows LOYTEC devices to
register with BACnet/SC hubs and be integrated in BACnet/SC networks, thus benefitting
from  increased  security  including  TLS  encryption  and  authentication.  On  devices  with  a
BACnet router, BACnet/SC can be enabled in addition to or as a replacement of BACnet/IP.
Devices without the BACnet routing function can enable either BACnet/SC or BACnet/IP.

The  internal  device  certificate  can  be  used  out-of-the-box,  and  CA-signed  operational
certificates can be installed as needed. When BACnet/SC and BACnet/IP and/or MS/TP are
enabled,  the  device  acts  as  a  router  between  those  interfaces.  It  is  also  possible  to  run
BACnet/SC on a separate network than BACnet/IP.

Node-RED™ 3.0 and AST for Scripts

The scripting support on LOYTEC devices has been improved by supporting Node-RED™
3.0. This includes new editor UI features. The underlying node.js has been updated to 18.7.
This allows up-to-date palettes and script packages to work on LOYTEC devices.

The API available for node.js scripts has been extended to fully support alarm summaries,
alarm acknowledgement, reading and writing schedules, as well as flexible access to historic
data in trend logs.

4.3  New in L-INX/L-GATE 7.6.0

This section describes the major changes and new features. For a full list of changes refer to
the Readme file.

New Structure for System Registers

The system registers have been re-organized under a folder structure. The old system register
locations  are  available  for  back-ward  compatibility.  A  new  system  register  “Time  Zone
Name” has been added that allows configuration of the time zone offset and DST settings
according to the timezone database. Writing a valid time zone name to that register sets the
new timezone information, e.g., “CET” for Central European Time.

Figure 6: New system register layout.

WiFi Enterprise

To  further  increase  security  in  a  WiFi  network,  IT  departments  support  the  802.1X
authentication method on WiFi also known as WiFi Enterprise. LOYTEC devices can enable
WiFi Enterprise in the WiFi settings by selecting WPA2-ENTERPRISE key management.
The authentication methods Protected EAP (PEAP), Tunneled TLS (TTLS) and EAP-TLS
(using certificates) are supported.

Historic Filters

A new filter item type has been added to historic filters: The Offset Correction item. This
item allows correcting the underlying meter value by a given offset. That offset will be added
to the measured value before the value is processed by other historic filters. After replacing
a meter, the offset correction can be used to maintain continuous consumption.

In addition, historic filter items can now be written to on the Web interface to set historic
values. For example, it is now possible to set the value of Jan 1 or any other historic value.
On the details page, all historic filter values can be exported to a CSV file. That file can be
imported on other historic filter data points allowing the simple transfer of historic values.

Node-RED™ 2.0

The scripting support on LOYTEC devices has been improved by supporting Node-RED™
2.0. This includes new editor UI features. A new safe mode allows debugging problems in
third-party packages.

BTL Testplan 16 Certified

The BACnet certification of all BACnet models has been updated to comply with protocol
revision 16. All  new device  models are  now BTL certified. New BACnet  features in that
release include

  Support Fault_Type and Fault_Parameters in the Event Enrollment object,

  Fault_High_Limit and Fault_Low_Limit properties,

  Support extended “jumbo” MS/TP frames.

New Menu Structure on Web UI

The  menu  structure  on  the  Web  UI  has  been  redesigned  to  be  more  intuitive  and  group
frequent  actions  together.  New  top-level  menus  help  keeping  the  menus  organized  into
typical tasks, such as statistics, data viewing, commissioning, configuration, programming,
security, and maintenance.

User Management on the Device

LOYTEC devices now provide a simple user management to create users and passwords on
the go. Users can be assigned roles, such as ‘admin’, ‘operator’ or ‘lweb’ roles. Users having
the ‘lweb’ role are limited to using LWEB-802/803 visualization projects only and have no
other device operation capabilities.

The Web UI on the device allows creating, deleting and modifying users and assigning roles.
As  an  example,  an  additional  admin  user  can  be  created  who  is  allowed  to  configure  the
device without knowing the master admin password. This user account can easily be disabled
again.

Figure 8: User management on the device.

Support for LRS232-802

The new LRS232-802 interface supports two RS-232 ports and is connected to the device’s
USB port. LOYTEC devices that support the LRS232-802 can be configured to run Modbus
ASCII on it or a custom RS-232 serial protocol implemented by a script module. The protocol
settings can be found on port tabs under the USB port.

Figure 9: Configure Modbus ASCII on LRS232-802.

Late Linkage of L-IOB Native BACnet Objects

A new feature now allows linking existing BACnet objects as L-IOB native BACnet objects
for a given L-IOB I/O as an alternative to the automatic creation of native BACnet objects.
This feature is beneficial when using library components with a collection of BACnet objects,
that need to be linked to actual I/O configurations when instantiating the library components.
This can be easily done on the L-IOB tab by choosing a BACnet object to serve as the native
object for an I/O.

BACnet Features for AMEV AS-B Profile and Protocol Rev 1.15

The BACnet implementation now supports additional features to comply  with the  AMEV
AS-B profile. This includes:

  Additional properties for the Loop object,



new properties for intrinsic reporting,  including event and reliability inhibition, alarm
message texts config, time delay normal,

  External Notification-B (AE-N-E-B) in the Event_Enrollment object,

  Minimum_On/Off_Time properties for commandable binary objects,

  Min/Max_Pres_Value properties for Analog Value objects,

  Current_Command_Priority for all commandable objects.

Alarming

Both BACnet and generic alarms now support an option to define a different delay for the to-
normal transition. Simply select the Time delay normal option and set a delay in the alarm
condition  dialog.  On  BACnet,  intrinsic  reporting  and  algorithmic  reporting  facilitate  the
property Time_Delay_Normal to carry this value. Also, the layout of the alarm dialog has
been reorganized to better group the settings by the different alarm transitions.

Figure 11: Option to define a different to-normal delay.

New L-IOB Features

Data  points  for  L-IOB  terminal  name  and  description  have  been  added.  These  allow
modification via the data point interface. The I/O description can now also be changed on the
L-IOB Web page.

Operating  mode  "manual  disable".  This  new  L-IOB  operating  mode  can  be  selected  to
manually  disable  a  terminal.  The  setting  persists  an  L-STUDIO  deploy  and  cannot  be
changed over the network until the terminal is manually enabled again.

Spike suppression on pulse counter inputs allows filtering short signal spikes. This feature
can be used to de-bounce a contact connected to a pulse counter input.

Network Port Authentication

To further increase security in a network installation, IT departments support the 802.1X port
authentication method. This standard requires a device to authenticate its port on the network
switch, before traffic into the network is allowed.

Support for LTE

LOYTEC devices now support the LTE-800 mobile interface. This interface is connected via
the USB port and offers LTE/UMTS/GSM mobile network access. A SIM card from your
provider needs to be inserted and the LOYTEC device is ready on the mobile network. A
Mobile tab has been added to the port configuration interface for configuring the LTE-800.
Simply enable Mobile Network, enter your APN data and select which protocols shall be run
on LTE.

New system registers offer mobile communication statistics such as Bytes transferred or SMS
sent. The VPN client is also ready to be used on the LTE mobile network.

Internet Connection Sharing

Combined with an LTE-800 mobile interface a LOYTEC device can act as a NAT router to
share  the  mobile  Internet  connection  with  other  devices  on  the  LAN.  For  doing  so,  the
Internet connection sharing feature can be enabled on the IP Host tab, where the default
router interface is selected. Other devices on the LAN need to specify the IP address of the
LOYTEC  device  offering  connection  sharing  as  their  default  gateway.  This  way,  local
devices can use NTP, VPN client or other Internet services.

Figure 14: Internet connection sharing

Dynamic DNS

LOYTEC devices can now  make use of a dynamic DNS service to register a public DNS
name. This makes the device reachable over a public IP address that can change over time,
for instance an LTE-800 mobile interface using a public IP address assigned by the mobile
carrier. A number of dynamic DNS providers are preconfigured and can be selected on the
IP Host tab of the port configuration as shown in Figure 15.

Figure 15: Dynamic DNS Settings

Secure Building Automation Protocols using VPN

This  firmware  version  enhances  flexibility  and  control  over  which  building  automation
protocols are directly available on the VPN. A separate VPN tab has been added to the port
configuration that allows configuring IP-based control protocols to be running directly on the
VPN  client.  This  effectively  secures  otherwise  unsecured  automation  protocols  such  as
BACnet/IP, Modbus TCP, KNXnet/IP or CEA-852. When running on the VPN interface, the
protocols are assigned the VPN’s IP address and as a protocol node, the LOYTEC device is
also reachable over multi-NAT access networks, such as LTE.

For example, simply set up the CEA-852 configuration server on the VPN interface and add
all other CEA-852 clients on the same VPN. The same can be done for BACnet/IP.  Each
node  establishes  a  secure  channel  to  the  OpenVPN  server  hub,  which  routes  the  traffic
between the communicating peer nodes. No unencrypted traffic will ever be transmitted.

SMS Delivery

The new SMS template message type can be used to configure SMS transmission just like E-
Mail templates for E-Mail transmission. SMS can be triggered and contain arbitrary variable
text and placeholders. One application is SMS alarm delivery.

Figure 17: SMS template configuration.

SMS can be sent using a locally attached LTE-800 mobile interface or over the network using
another LOYTEC device  acting as an SMS proxy for its LTE-800 mobile interface. SMS
proxy mode can be configured in the new SMS configuration menu on the Web UI. As a
result, only one LTE-800 is required to offer SMS service for an entire local network.

Node-RED™ Integration

LOYTEC  devices  that  support  the  scripting  feature  now  also  natively  integrate  the
Node-RED™  run-time.  The  Web  interface  provides  a  configuration  menu  to  open  the
Node-RED™ editor UI. As a default, the run-time is not executing and needs to be enabled.
Once enabled, the run-time automatically starts the configured flows. An example is shown
in Figure 18.

palette items. Custom palette items can also be installed, like the ‘worldmap’. The editor UI
is also accessible on a stand-alone Web browser page under the ‘/nodered’ device URL.

Parameter and Default Values

A new Parameter Value property has been introduced in the data point configuration that
tracks  the  current  parameter  value  on  the  device.  This  is  in  addition  to  the  Default  Value
property.  When  uploading  parameter  values  from  the  device  into  the  configuration,  the
parameter value property is updated where selected so in the parameter merge dialog. The
default value property remains unaffected by a parameter upload. This way it is possible to
track current parameter values while still keeping their original default values. When desired,
parameter values can be reset to their default values.

Figure 19: The new Parameter Value property.

New universal IN/OUT Analog/Digital L-IOB Terminal Type

With  the  introduction  of  the  LIOB-110/LIOB-590  models,  a  new  L-IOB  I/O  terminal
hardware  type  has  been  introduced:  a  universally  configurable  IN/OUT  Analog/Digital
terminal.  The  signal  type  of  this  terminal  determines  whether  it  is  an  input  (measure
resistance, current, voltage) or an output (drive 0-10V voltage output). Within its signal type
class,  the  known  signal  interpretations  can  be  configured  (e.g.  PT1000,  linear,  translation
table).

IPv6

LOYTEC devices now support IPv6 using stateless address autoconfiguration (SLAAC) or
having a configured, fixed IPv6 address. The IPv6 feature is available on all Ethernet and
WLAN  ports.  With  SLAAC  no  further  configuration  (except  the  required  IPv6  router

equipment) is required. The static IPv6 address can be configured on the TCP/IP settings on
the port configuration.

Protocols that support IPv6 are  the  Web interface, SSH, HTTPS, NTP and BACnet/IPv6.
Additional IPv6 statistics have been added to the IP statistics pages for troubleshooting.

BACnet Dynamic Object Creation and Event Enrollment

New BACnet protocol features have been added to LOYTEC devices. First, dynamic object
creation is now supported for Trend_Log, Scheduler, Calendar, Notification_Class objects.
This means that a BACnet OWS can dynamically create and delete those objects during run-
time. No reserved BACnet objects are required in the data point configuration.

Second, algorithmic reporting has been implemented in the Event_Enrollment object. This
object can be  created and configured by a BACnet OWS  to dynamically add and remove
alarm conditions on any BACnet object in the device.

In  combination  with  IPv6  support,  the  BACnet  protocol  can  be  configured  to  run  on  the
BACnet/IPv6 data link. Simply choose IPv6 in the BACnet/IP protocol configuration.

4.6  New in L-INX/L-GATE 7.0.0

This section describes the major changes and new features. For a full list of changes refer to
the Readme file.

Support two LMPBUS-804

Up to two LMPBUS-804 interfaces can now be connected to the built-in USB ports of the
LOYTEC device. This increases the maximum number for supported MP-Bus channels from
4 to 8. Note, that no external USB hubs are supported. The LMPBUS-804 interfaces need to
be directly attached to the two built-in USB ports.

Alarming

The  data  point  alarming  brings  two  new  features  for  alarm  messages:  First,  the  new
placeholders  %{bacName},  %{bacDescr}  have  been  added.  These  expand  to  the  native
BACnet server object name and description. Since these may be updated by an OWS at run-
time, alarm messages will now reflect those updates when using the new placeholders.

Another  change  to  alarmed  data  points  are  new  property  relation  data  points  for  alarm
message texts: msgNormal, msgOffnormal, msgHigh, msgLow, and msgFault. The content
of these property data point overwrite the pre-configured alarm messages and can be changed
at run-time. This allows easy configuration of alarm messages by linking to common string
data points that are parameters. For example, all temperature alarms may lnk their msgHigh
property relation to the string parameter  msgTempHigh configured to a  local text such  as
“Temperature %{name} exceeds %{hi}”.

VPN

LOYTEC devices support joining a virtual private network (VPN). This feature is based on
the widely-used and open-protocol OpenVPN technology. An OpenVPN configuration file
(.ovpn) can be installed on the Web interface and makes the LOYTEC device a VPN client
and dial into the OpenVPN server defined by that file. Any standard OpenVPN configuration
file  can  be  used,  which  is  auto-login,  i.e.  does  not  require  entering  a  password  when
connecting. After having registered, the LOYTEC device can be reached via its VPN address.

LOYTEC

Figure 20: VPN client configuration on the Web interface

Setting up a VPN client on the LOYTEC device may solve NAT router issues, because no
port forwarding rules need to be configured. The device dials out to the OpenVPN server
running on a public IP and establishes the VPN channel. This VPN channel provides a secure
connection  for building automation protocols, such as BACnet/IP, Modbus TCP or CEA-
852.  Being  part  of  a  VPN  the  LOYTEC  device  is  also  reachable  over  multi-NAT  access
networks, such as LTE.

An alternative method is to enable simple server mode on the LOYTEC device. In this mode,
the device provides an OpenVPN server and allows downloading a client configuration file
from the Web interface. This file can be installed on any OpenVPN client and allows that
client connect to the LOYTEC device over the secure VPN channel. Only one client may
connect at a time.

Data Point Web UI

The LOYTEC device is now tracking information on the source of a written value for each
data  point.  This  information  is  shown  on  the  data  point  details  Web  UI  next  to  the
modification timestamp and can be used for troubleshooting, for example, whether a value
was modified over the Web UI or is written by a local connection.

Figure 21: Write source info on the data point Web interface

Make protocol logs more verbose

LOYTEC devices have been improved to decode protocol logs of its supported technologies
to be displayed in a more verbose manner. This makes it easier for Modbus, M-Bus, MP-
Bus,  SMI,  DALI,  EnOcean  to  analyze  communication  problems  with  other  third-party
devices. Simply click the Protocol Analyzer link on the statistics Web page of the respective
protocol.

EnOcean over L-STAT

L-STAT devices with EnOcean capability can now be used by LOYTEC devices as remote
EnOcean antennas like a LENO-800 interface. This EnOcean over Modbus feature expands
the  air  coverage  of  EnOcean  in  a  multi-room  setup.  An  EnOcean  repeater  setup  that  is
cumbersome  and  difficult  to  troubleshoot  is  no  longer  needed.  Simply  add  EnOcean  L-
STATs to extend the wireless reach of the LOYTEC device.

BACnet for Japan

This software release includes some minor changes to improve BACnet interoperability in
Japan. First, a new client mapping mode was added: COV unsolicited + poll. In this mode
the client map not only accepts updates via unsolicited broadcast messages but also actively
polls  the  remote  devices.  Second,  any  kind  of  UnconfirmedEventNotification  broadcast
(event  or  alarm)  can  be  used  to  receive  value  updates.  Third,  also  status  flags  of  client
mappings are updated by event/COV notifications that include status flags.

Support Custom Serial Port in JavaScript

A  new  API  has  been  added  that  allows  using  the  serial  port  on  a  LOYTEC  device  in
JavaScript. This  feature  can  be  used  to  implement  custom  serial  protocols. The  port Web
interface offers a choice to select such a custom serial implementation based on meta data
provided by the JavaScript module. An example for such custom protocol support is DMX,
which is distributed as an add-on script resource.

Figure 22: New Web interface to select custom serial protocols.

Other scripting features added to this release are defining debug filter keywords on the Web
interface, enabling and disabling scripts, and a new system API to allow firewall ports on the
LOYTEC device.

Localized Web Interface

The entire Web interface of the device has been localized to German, French, and Chinese
language. Simply change the language on the LCD display or directly on the Web interface
via the new flag symbol on the upper right corner. Changing language is instant and does not
require a reboot.

Safe Reboot and Auto-Login

Changing  IP  settings  and  rebooting  could  end  in  a  device  unreachable,  if  something  was
different than expected. The new safe reboot feature helps out by reverting the changes made,
if not logged in in on the Web interface within 5 minutes after the reboot. Locking oneself
out by entering a mistaken IP address is no longer possible.

Figure 24: Safe reboot screen suggesting new IP address.

Another  new  feature  that  helps  getting  logged  in  again  is  the  session  auto-login.  After  a
device has rebooted the Web interface restores the session and automatically logs in again.
Even when changing a static IP address the device tries to connect to the new IP or suggests
links for opening the device info page under the new IP address.

Backup before Upgrade

The firmware upgrade feature has been made safer by creating a backup before executing the
upgrade.  This  feature  has  been  added  to  firmware  and  Configurator  upgrade  paths.  It  is,
however, optional and can be turned off by deselecting the check box.

Figure 25: Backup before Upgrade on the Web interface.

Multiple M-Bus Ports

LOYTEC  devices  with  multiple  EXT  ports  now  support  operating  an  LMBUS-20/80
interface on each port in parallel. This way the total number of M-Bus devices managed by
the  LOYTEC  device  can  be  increased  by  using  several  LMBUS-20/80  interfaces.  The
commission Web interface supports EXT port assignment and moving M-Bus devices from
one EXT port to another.

Binary Interpretation of Analog Inputs

A simple way to turn an analog universal input (UI) into a digital data point has been added.
On the UI select the option Digital Input and enter an on/off value hysteresis. A binary data
point will be created instead of the analog one.

Support Custom Protocols and IoT by Scripting

New models of programmable L-INX and L-GATE devices now include a JavaSript-based
scripting engine. This engine allows users to implement their own protocol support for the
IoT  world  using  RESTful  APIs,  JSON  or  Web  services.  The  LOYTEC  data  point  server
allows integrating data points into the scripting language using the dpal-js API. The script
modules can be embedded into and deployed along with the data point configuration.

provides both router and RNI functionality, which can be configured as needed. The LINX-
153 as the larger sibling combines the functionality of the bigger L-INX models LINX-12x,
15x, 22x and also provides a configurable router/RNI. The new LINX-154 model has been
designed  to  accommodate  a  maximum  number  of  Modbus  RTU  and/or  BACnet  MS/TP
devices on its four RS-485 ports.

L-STUDIO 3.0 with 61131 Run-Time

New L-INX and L-IOB controller models are now embedded into the L-STUDIO workflow
using  a  61131  program  run-time  environment.  This  new  environment  combines  both
advantages, the well-known 61131 programming workflow and the powerful mechanisms of

respective Chapters in the Device User Manual [1] and the LINX Configurator User Manual
[2].

LCD Interface

The user interface on the LCD display has been extended by a firmware upgrade menu. This
menu allows installing a new firmware image from an attached USB memory stick. This is
beneficial for WLAN-only devices. When plugging in a USB memory stick, a menu pops up
(Figure  27)  on  the  LCD  interface  that  shows  selected  quick  options,  including  firmware
upgrade and backup.

Figure 27: LCD pop-up menu for USB storage

BACnet Features

A new BACnet client mapping type has been added: The COV unsolicited type. This new
read  mapping  type,  a  client  mapping  will  accept  broadcast  COV  updates  without
subscription.

A new type of BACnet favorites has been added, which offer BACnet-related options such
as adding BACnet properties. When linking a BACnet favorite to a BACnet server object,
the respective BACnet property data points are added and linked to the link target.

L-IOB Firmware Upgrade and V2 Models

The L-IOB firmware upgrade has been enhanced by a parallel upgrade mode. This mode is
back-ward  compatible  to  existing  L-IOB  devices  and  allows  parallel  upgrade  over  the
network. This  means a  number of devices receive the  firmware  upgrade at the same time
which greatly improves upgrade time over LIOB-FT. This also applies to the new V2 L-IOB
models.  The  Configurator  firmware  upgrade  dialog  has  also  been  extended  to  allow  the
assignment of a universal L-IOB firmware ZIP archive to all L-IOB models.

Web UI

The data point details page on the Web UI provides write usage information. This information
can now be used to determine by which objects a certain data point is being written to. The
Web  UI  design  has  also  been  reworked  according  to  the  latest  security  standards,  now
suggesting usage of strong passwords.

4.10  New in L-INX/L-GATE 6.1.0

This section describes the major changes and new features. For a full list of changes refer to
the Readme file.

LSMI-804

The LSMI-804 interface is supported. This is a four-channel SMI interface connected to the
USB  port  of  the  LOYTEC  device.  It  also  contains  four  relays  for  SMI  channel  power-on

functionality. This saves energy while the SMI bus is idle. For more information on SMI read
the  respective  Chapters  in  the  Device  User  Manual  [1]  and  the  LINX  Configurator  User
Manual [2].

Selective Backup and Restore

The backup and restore interface on the Web interface has been extended by content options.
It is now possible to decide whether a created backup shall contains passwords, IP settings
or historical data (trend logs, alarm logs). Also when restoring a backup archive it can be
selected whether password and IP settings shall be accepted from the backup or not. This
makes  it  easier  to  replicate  devices  without  scarifying  the  IP  configuration  and  password
settings. An example is shown in Figure 28.

Figure 28: Backup and restore options on the Web UI.

L-STAT Configuration Backup

The Modbus commission Web UI has been extended to better support L-STAT devices. Now
it is possible to upload one or more L-STAT backup files and save them on disk. Those L-
STAT backup files can also be restored to L-STAT devices. The regular device backup now
includes all L-STAT device backups as well.

Advanced WLAN Mesh Configuration

The WLAN Mesh configuration has been enhanced by a graphical floorplan editor as well as
an online monitor of inter-link communication quality. This tool allows not only easier setup
of a Mesh network but also simple troubleshooting by identifying radio bottleneck between
Mesh points (see Figure 29).

Flexible Column Layout in Configurator

The Configurator now supports a flexible column layout in the data point list. It is possible
to modify the column arrangement and add/remove columns as needed. This provides for
better overview in situations where the default column layout misses important information.
The new Configure Columns dialog makes this possible.

Incremental Data Point Scan

The data point scanning engine of the Configurator has been extended to mark data points
already used on the device and data points found in new scans. The last two columns Used
on Device and Last Scan of Figure 30 show an example and can be used to sort the list. This
way the data point configuration can be easily adapted to incremental changes of the scanned
devices.

Figure 30: Example of an incremental data point scan

LCD Interface

The  user  interface  on  the  LCD  display  has  been  localized  for  the  Chinese  simplified  and
traditional language sets. The language can be selected from the main page and is switched
immediately without a device reboot.

LOYTEC

Another feature on the LCD display is the option to rotate the display 180 degrees. This is a
useful setting, if the device is mounted upside down.

EnOcean VLD Profile Support

EnOcean devices that require variable-length data (VLD) profiles are now fully supported.
The respective device templates are provided by LOYTEC. In addition to new profiles, the
teach-in  process  on  the  Web  interface  has  been  improved  by  dialog  wizards  that  guide
through bi-directional teach-in and assignment of transmission IDs.

4.11  New in L-INX/L-GATE 6.0.0

This section describes the major changes and new features. For a full list of changes refer to
the Readme file.

New User Manual Structure

The L-INX/L-GATE User Manual has been split up into three parts: The L-INX/L-GATE
User Manual, which now covers the specific functions of the L-INX and L-GATE device
models.  The  LINX  Configurator  User  Manual  is  a  common  description  for  using  the
Configurator software for the L-INX, L-GATE, L-ROC, L-IOB, and L-DALI product line.
And the LOYTEC Device User Manual covers hardware, Web interface,  LCD display and
operating interfaces topics common to all LOYTEC devices.

New Models and Combined Firmware

The new LROC-400 room controller models are now supported by the device firmware and
in the LINX Configurator. The different device firmware images for LROC-10x, LIOB-AIR,
and LROC-400 have been integrated in one image for all L-ROC, L-INX, LIOB-AIR and L-
GATE models.

SMI

A new protocol is now supported: SMI for controlling sunblinds over the Standardized Motor
Interface.  All  LOYTEC  devices  with  an  EXT  port  can  now  be  extended  by  the  L-SMI
interface and connect to an SMI bus. The LINX Configurator provides SMI device templates,
which can be commissioned on the device Web interface. The Web interface supports manual
address assignment, scanning for SMI devices and calibration. For more information on SMI
read the respective Chapters in the Device User Manual [1] and the LINX Configurator User
Manual [2].

Flexible CSV Import/Export

The  entire  CSV  import/export  engine  of  the  LINX  Configurator  has  been  revisited.
Previously special export options with fixed columns for CEA-709, Modbus, etc. have been
replaced by a general CSV engine that is able to configure columns for any set of data point
properties. Default property sets have been added, which can be modified by the user and
saved  for  later  use.  The  new  CSV  import/export  allows  modifying  existing  data  point
properties by batch edit in Excel or creating new data points. The property sets can be viewed
and modifed in a comfortable export editor (see Figure 31). The new engine also integrates
CSV data point templates. Learn more about this flexible import/export mechanism in the
LINX Configurator User Manual [2].

Override Function for Data Points

The  data  point  model  in  LOYTEC  devices  has  been  extended  with  a  manual  override
function. On the Web interface and on the LCD display data point values can be overridden
to manual values. If an override value is set, the running control logic no longer affects the
data point value, neither does network communication. The override value is in effect until
it is removed again by the user.

Figure 32: Overriding a data point on the Web interface.

WLAN Mesh Configuration

The Mesh Point mode has been extended by a whitelist function. This allows configuration
of a Mesh network with up to 32 nodes. The whitelist contains all mesh point IDs that may
contact each other. In order to make configuration of  the  mesh  network easier, the Quick
Wireless  Setup  has  been  added,  which  allows  a  first  mesh  setup  in  only  a  few  steps.  For
optimizing the whitelist the Web interface offers  a graphical editor, which makes changes
quick  and  simple.  On  device  models  with  an  LCD  display  the  wireless  setup  can  also  be
completed using the jog dial. For more information on how to set up a Mesh network please
refer to the respective Sections of the LOYTEC Device User Manual [1].

Alarm Messages

The  length  of  alarm  messages  has  been  extended  to  250.  This  increased  length  comes  in
combination with a new %{path} variable placeholder that can identify the data point path
in alarm messages. This is beneficial for mass-engineering alarm conditions on data points

Version 8.2

LOYTEC electronics GmbH

LOYTEC

that have the same name but  are located in different path locations. Alarm logs have also
been updated to support the new maximum legnth. BACnet now supports the Event Message
Texts property of an alarmed object, which allows retrieving the messages also after a reboot
of an alarm client. And analog alarm conditions have been extended to specify a high limit
and a low limit alarm message.

Trend Logs

The generic trend logs have been extended to support recording string values. These trends
can be operated as polled, COV or triggered. These trend logs can be beneficial to record
arbitrary messages The string recording is currently limited to generic trend logs only.

New E-Mail Placeholders

E-Mail configuration has become even more flexible by adding new variable placeholders.
The variable placeholders can be augmented by name, description and path specifiers that
expand to the respective information in the e-mail. A new date format specifier allows for
readable timestamps and the %{last_timestamp} variable expands to the time the last e-mail
was transmitted.

BTL Testplan 12 Certified

The BACnet certification of all BACnet models has been updated to comply with protocol
revision 12. All new device models are now BTL certified.

4.12  New in L-INX/L-GATE 5.3.0

This section describes the major changes and new features. For a full list of changes refer to
the Readme file.

New L-INX and L-GATE Models

The new L-INX and L-GATE models in the small enclosure are now supported. Equipped
with dual Ethernet, a built-in firewall and LCD display, these new models serve as a plug-in
replacement for the older devices. Existing data point configurations and device backups can
be used without modification. Only logiCAD programs need to be re-compiled for the new
hardware  resource.  In  addition,  the  new  models  also  support  L-IOB  connect,  wireless
technologies and KNX.

Extended Support for U.S. Units

An extended support for U.S. units has been built into LOYTEC devices. A device can now
be configured to run either in the SI or the U.S. unit system by defining SI and U.S. units per
data point as shown in Figure 33. When configured for U.S. units, all data points and L-IOB
I/Os process values in the respective U.S. units. This includes the Web UI, the OPC server,
the  parameter  file,  global  connections,  and  logiCAD  programs.  Also  the  Configurator
displays values in U.S. units and conversions are done automatically. A device can even be
switched from one unit system to the other. In this case all persistent parameters are reset to
their default values in the chosen unit system. A system register shows the currently running
unit system. This makes it easy to entirely engineer a device in U.S. units or build devices
that can be configured for either European or U.S. markets and meet local requirements at
the same time. For more information on units please refer to  the LINX Configurator User
Manual [2].

OPC Client

L-INX and L-GATE devices are extended by their own OPC client technology. Using the
OPC client you are able to integrate other LOYTEC devices simply by importing  the data
point  configuration  of  their  OPC  servers.  This  way  an  L-DALI  device  can  be  added  to  a
L-INX  configuration  in  a  few  steps.  The  OPC  client  can  also  take  advantage  of  the
commission later feature by using the Web UI in order to assign OPC server URLs at the
time of device commissioning. Even the base path to imported OPC tags can be replaced.
This  way  sub-configurations  can  be  imported  to  save  OPC  client  tags  and  be  re-assigned
later. Learn more about the OPC client function in the LINX Configurator User Manual [2].

Forward Delay in Connections

For applications that require staggered start/stop and randomization, the device implements
a configurable forward delay in local and global connections. All receive data point items
can be configured with a delay. A received value is written to the data point after the delay
expires.  The  delay  can  be  a  fixed  time  or  a  time  interval,  in  which  the  actual  delay  is
randomized. With a resolution of 0.1 seconds the total delay can be up to 100 minutes. Learn
more about forward delay in the LINX Configurator User Manual [2].

Auto-Generate and Connect

The auto-connect feature has been extended:

  Support  %{folder_descr}  as  a  placeholder  in  auto-generate  templates.  This

evaluates the description property of the parent folder.

  Generate into existing connections. Epecially when auto-generating the same source
data points to different technologies, the same connections are used. This makes it
easier to manage auto-generated local connections.

Enhanced Structure Support on the Web UI

The display of data point structures has been improved on the Web UI. The data point listing
shows a textual short version of the structured value instead of a hexadecimal Byte buffer.
Also CEA-709 structures of NVs without sub-data points are displayed and can be edited.

Project Documentation

A new feature on the device is a Web UI for creating and viewing project documentation on
the device. The documentation editor requires admin rights and allows storing files on the
device or creating documentation links as URLs. Both items can be viewed by guest users.
Examples  include  storing  cabling  plans  as  PDF  or  adding  links  to  a  Web  site  containing
manuals, plans or other  useful project documentation.  Consult the  LOYTEC Device  User
Manual [1] to learn more about project documentation on the device.

LWEB-802 Application on Device

The L-INX and L-GATE device now come with a pre-installed version of the LWEB-802
application.  This  enables  out-of-the-box  L-WEB  applications  on  sites  without  Internet
access.  An  enhanced  Web  UI  also  allows  installing  a  specific  version  of  the  LWEB-802
application, which overrides the pre-installed one. As a default, the Internet version is still

Version 8.2

LOYTEC

available. To learn more on how to configure the L-WEB application refer to the LOYTEC
Device User Manual [1].

BACnet

All previously extended BACnet features and new features have been BTL-certified in the
5.X firmware series. New features include:

  BACnet object names can be made writeable. With this new option the user can create
data point configurations with generic object names and assign location-specific names
later in his OWS.

  BACnet  simple  value  objects  are  now  supported.  The  user  can  create  Large  Analog
Value, Signed Integer Value, Unsigned Integer Value, Character String Value and Octet
String Value objects as needed. Also auto-connect supports these new object types.

  For Trend Log objects, the properties Notify_Type, Event_Enable, Notification_Class

can be pre-configured in the data point configuration.

User-defined Serial Protocols in logiCAD

A new logiCAD service block has been introduced, which allows implementation of generic
serial protocols. The ‘SerialComm’ service block can receive and transmit strings from and
to a serial port using start frame and end frame delimiting characters. A logical bus number
is assigned to the service block, which can be selected as a custom serial protocol on the port
configuration Web UI as shown in Figure 34. Please read Section 8.6.10 to learn more about
using the ‘SerialComm’ block.

Figure 34: Selecting a custom logiCAD serial protocol.

Data Point Creation from CSV Lists

The Configurator implements a new data point template CSV import feature, which can be
used by external tools to generate a list of data points. Each line in this CSV references a data
point template file that describes all properties of the data point. The CSV supplies name,
description  and  path  of  the  data  point  to  be  created.  Additionally,  data  points  can  be
automatically scheduled and trended.  Learn  more about data point templates in the  LINX
Configurator User Manual [2].

KNX Protocol Analyzer

Devices  that  support  the  KNX  protocol  now  have  a  built-in  protocol  analyzer.  It  can  be
accessed through the KNX statistics Web interface and allows starting, stopping and storing
protocol logs on any of the KNX interfaces. Protocol logs can be loaded from the device and
stored on the PC either in CSV or in XML format. The XML format can be opened in the
ETS protocol viewer. Learn more about the KNX protocol analyzer in the KNX Chapter of
the LOYTEC Device User Manual [1].

ekey Fingerprint Readers

LOYTEC  devices  can  now  be  used  to  build  applications  with  biometric  access  control
(fingerprints). The ekey fingerprint reader devices can be attached to the RS-485 port. Users
and fingers can be enrolled and grant or deny access when swiping the finger over a reader.
User groups can be implemented and distributed over reader devices. Learn more about ekey
fingerprint reader support in the ekey Chapter of the LOYTEC Device User Manual [1].

4.13  New in L-INX/L-GATE 5.1.0

This section describes the major changes and new features. For a full list of changes refer to
the Readme file.

Dual-Ethernet with Separate Networks

L-INX and L-GATE models with two Ethernet interfaces can now be configured to work
with separate and isolated IP networks. For example, one Ethernet interface can be accessed
over HTTPS from a WAN connected to Ethernet 2 while the building network services are
running locally on the LAN connected to Ethernet 1. For configuration the device provides
separate Ethernet tabs in the port configuration, which allow selecting the offered services
on each interface. The example in Figure 35 shows a WAN interface with HTTPS and OPC
UA only, while BACnet/IP or CEA-709 over IP are still bound to Ethernet 1 (LAN). Another
use case for this feature is operating a gateway between otherwise entirely isolated building
networks, e.g. BACnet/IP on Ethernet 1 and KNXnet/IP on Ethernet 2.

Figure 35: New Ethernet 2 (WAN) tab

WLAN Interface

In combination with the external LWLAN-800 interface, the device provides new interface
tabs for wireless IP networks. Similar to the second Ethernet interface, one can choose which
protocols are available on the wireless network. The wireless interface can be configured as
a  WLAN  client,  access  point  or  mesh  node.  Using  the  latter,  a  wireless  mesh  network  of
LOYTEC devices can be built. Please refer to the LOYTEC Device User Manual [1] to learn
more about the WLAN interface.

EnOcean

The EnOcean technology is now supported by the L-INX and L-GATE devices. Together
with  the  external  LENO-800  interface,  EnOcean  sensors  and  actuators  can  be  easily
integrated. LENO-800 interfaces are available for European, U.S. and Japanese frequency

bands. Data point configurations for the EnOcean technology are built using EnOcean device
templates. The actual assignment of physical devices is done later in the teach-in process
over the Web UI. For more information on the EnOcean technology please refer to EnOcean
Chapter of the LOYTEC Device User Manual [1].

SNMP

For accessing vital operational data in standard IT equipment, L-INX and L-GATE devices
offer an SNMP management base (MIB). All system registers and OPC-exposed data points
are available in that MIB. The MIB file can be downloaded from the device and imported in
the SNMP management tool. Alarms on the device can be exposed as SNMP traps. For more
information  on  configuring  and  using  SNMP  with  a  LOYTEC  device  please  refer  to  the
LOYTEC Device User Manual [1].

Online Commissioning

The  Web  interface  of  the  device  now  provides  an  online  commissioning  tool  for  the
respective networking technologies. Using this tool, data point configurations can be created
based on placeholder devices, which are  marked to be commissioned later. The necessary
addressing information can be assigned later on the Web interface by scanning for devices
online  or  be  entered  manually.  Device  replacement  is  also  possible  in  the  commissioning
Web  interface  without  the  need  to  edit  devices  in  the  data  point  configuration.  For  more
information on the commissioning Web UI please refer to the LOYTEC Device User Manual
[1].

Favorites

Enhancements for using favorites include engineering units, active/inactive texts, multi-state
texts and value persistency for unlinked favorites. A new feature are structured favorites. For
example, the structure of a SNVT_switch may now be created as a favorite. The top-level
part  of  a  structured  favorite  can  be  linked  to  a  structured  data  point  of  the  same  type.
Alternatively, the individual member elements of a structured favorite can be linked to other,
individual data points. This way, one is able to create a structured favorite, that can be linked
directly to a matching SNVT or to separate BACnet objects..

Web Interface

The Web interface of the device offers a number of new features:

  A new device info page provides a quick overview of all relevant operational parameters,

such as CPU load, active protocols, time synchronization and many more.

  The  trend  log  configuration  on  the  Web  UI  now  also  provides  a  preview  tab,  which
shows a chart of the trend log data. The trend chart allows zoom, scrolling and hiding
specific data curves, as shown in Figure 36.

Figure 36: New trend chart on the Web UI

Scheduler

The scheduler objects have been extended by the following new features:

  Color  support  in  BACnet  and  generic  schedulers  allows  consistent  assignment  and

display of preset colors in L-WEB, L-VIS and the Configurator scheduler UIs.

  Event  auto-prune  removes  passed  events,  if  the  capacity  of  exception  events  in  a

scheduler gets low.

  The scheduler default for LONMARK and generic schedulers is extended by a  “silent”
mode. In this mode the scheduler becomes inactive as soon as the last event is withdrawn.
This mode can be used in event-driven scheduler models.

  Generic  schedulers  allow  specifying  an  existing  value  preset  as  the  schedule  default.
LONMARK  and  BACnet  schedulers  try  identifying  a  matching  preset  name  from  the
schedule default value.

5000 BACnet Client Maps and Dynamic Polling

The number of BACnet client mappings on the L-INX has been increased to 5000. This has
become possible with the use of strict on-demand dynamic polling on the device. This means
any data point configured for polling (client mappings, external NVs, Modbus, etc.) will start
polling only when it is actually used, i.e. displayed on L-WEB, the data point Web interface
or used by a trend log. This reduces the required network bandwidth.

1000 Trended Data Points in LINX-12x/15x/22x/LGATE-95x

The  bigger  L-INX  and  L-GATE  devices  now  allow  a  total  of  1000  trended  data  points
distributed among the 512 trend logs. This limit can be exploited when trending two or more
data points in a generic trend log.

Alarm Server Ack-All Data Point

Alarm servers now provide a special ackAll property data point. When writing TRUE on that
data point all currently active alarms on the alarm server are acknowledged.

Format Strings in E-Mails

Data  point  variables  used  in  e-mail  templates  can  now  use  format  strings  to  specify  their
numeric appearance in the e-mail text.

Output NVs with Integrated Feedback

Output network variables (NVs) are used to send updates to remote nodes. In order to poll
back the actual value of the remote variable, a feedback data point had to be created for the
output  NV.  Now  changing  the  direction  on  the  NV  from  output  to  value,  an  integrated
feedback  function  is  activated  without  the  need  for  an  extra  data  point.  This  becomes
especially useful in data point templates.

Modbus and M-Bus Templates

Modbus and M-Bus device templates offer some new features that boost productivity:

  Templates can now contain definitions of pollgroups and other type resources used by

Modbus data points.

  Templates can now store a folder hierarchy.

4.14  New in L-INX/L-GATE 5.0.0

This section describes the major changes and new features. For a full list of changes refer to
the Readme file.

Generic Scheduler

Generic schedulers – like generic trends and alarms – can now be created, that are neither
CEA-709 nor BACnet objects. Generic schedulers appear next to the generic alarm folder
and are ready-to-use on any device. This is beneficial for creating technology-independent
applications. Generic schedulers can write to any technology as well as data point favorites
and  are  the  ideal  solution,  if  configured  via  LWEB-900  only.  For  more  information  on
creating generic schedulers refer to the LINX Configurator User Manual [2].

Optimum Start for Schedulers

Up to now, optimum start was limited to using a SNVT_tod_event in a CEA-709 scheduler.
Now  all  schedulers  (including  BACnet  and  generic  schedulers)  support  timeToNext  and
nextState data points for implementing optimum start algorithms also for those technologies.
Schedulers  are  extended  by  property  relations,  which  offer  the  time  to  the  next  state  in
minutes  and  the  next  state  in  data  points.  Also,  the  enable,  enableFb  (feedback),  and
presetName information is available as property relations.

The BACnet scheduler object also has custom properties that expose time to next state and
next state to BACnet. If standard BACnet objects are required, the property relations can be
linked  to  any  matching  BACnet  server  object  as  shown  in  Figure  37  (BV_nextState,
AV_timeToNext).

Figure 37: BACnet scheduler with next state data points.

Favorites

Favorites have been vastly extended to be compatible with all uses that were previously only
possible for regular data points. Favorites can now be trended, can have an alarm condition
(reporting  to  a  generic  alarm  server),  and  be  scheduled.  Historic  filters  can  be  applied  to
favorites. Favorites can also be used in e-mail templates, math objects and connections like
any other data point. Furthermore, it is possible to link favorites to property relations and
vice versa, e.g. link a favorite directly to a historic filter data point.

Historic Filters

Historic filters have been extended by a generic delta calculation between any of the defined
filter items or the current value. This way, it is no longer necessary to create a separate math
object to calculate the consumption of the previous month. Also, a definition for “last day of
month” has been added to the monthly period.

256 Trend Logs on LINX-10x/11x/20x/21x/LGATE-900

The smaller L-INX and L-GATE devices are now extended from 100 trend logs to 256 trend
logs at a total of 256 trended data points. This is beneficial for native BACnet trend logs,
which  allow  only  one  data  point  per  trend  log  object.  The  increase  comes  at  the  cost  of
available log rate, which is reduced from 121,050 to 60,525 records per hour, once more than
100 trend log objects are created. This is, however, still sufficient for 256 energy trends at 1
minute log interval each.

Web Interface

The Web interface of the device offers a number of new features:

  Live  update  of  values  in  the  data  point  list.  This  allows  monitoring  values  without
repeated pressing of reload. Data point structures can be expanded or collapsed for better
overview.

  Breadcrumb navigation has been added to the data point list. This gives faster access to

sub-folders.

  A  new  firmware  upgrade  menu  on  the  Web  interface  allows  online  checking  for
firmware updates and upgrading by selecting a local firmware file. All this is possible
without starting the Configurator.

  The trend overview page displays current trend log states and provides controls for easy

trend data upload in CSV format.

Data Point Polling

The receive timeout on input and value data points has been generalized. A receive timeout
can now be defined on all technologies for input and value data points. Writing updates to
those data points from any source (e.g. a global connection) resets the receive timeout.

data points even if no pollcycle or dynamic polling has been activated on those data points..

OPC UA Server

The OPC server on the devices, which support security, has been extended by an OPC UA
server. This supports the OPC UA binary protocol and exposes the same OPC tags as the
well-known OPC XML-DA server. In addition OPC UA offers superior security features as
well as slimmer data transfers. For more information on the OPC UA server please refer to
the LOYTEC Device User Manual [1].

BACnet

All previously extended BACnet features and new features have been BTL-certified in the
5.X firmware series. New features include:



Intrinsic alarming for the Accumulator object.

  Option to keep OWS settings in BACnet properties also after a new configuration has

been downloaded.

  BACnet naming rules can now freely define how data point names are constructed out

of scanned BACnet information.

Conversion to Value Data Points

Firmware  versions  since  4.9.0  support  value  data  points.  The  default  behavior  of  the
Configurator can be controlled in the project settings. This defines whether new value data
points  or  the  old  “_Read/_Write”  data  point  combinations  shall  be  created.  When  using
templates  in  L-WEB  or  L-VIS  it  is  often  an  all-or-nothing  approach,  a  mixture  is  not
practical.

For making the transition in old projects to value data points, the Configurator now offers a
conversion tool. Multi-select old read/write data points and choose the item Convert to value
from the data point context menu. This converts the selected data points to the new value data
points, leaving the IDs, default values and data point usages intact.

Application Objects

Application  objects  such  as  math  objects,  e-mail  templates,  and  alarm  logs  can  now  be
organized in folders. Copy and paste of application objects between Configurators has been
improved. Math objects now allow single constants and single variable assignments, such as
“=5” or “=v1”. Input variables can be configured to trigger a new calculation or not.

Configurator Usability

The folder tree of the data point manager has been brought to state-of-the-art user concepts
such as multi-select, drag-and-drop of folders, moving folders, deleting multiple folders and
their contents. A name filter can be applied to quickly find folders in the folder tree.

The property tab has been extended by a property name filter. This makes it easy to find the
desired property by typing a sub-string of its name in the filter. For a detailed description on
the data point properties refer to the LINX Configurator User Manual [2].

Data point link navigation has been made easy by using a Go to data point context menu
and speed button everywhere data point references are displayed. A data point usage report
dialog shows all references to the selected data point and allows jumping to selected objects.

The  new  PLC  conflicts  tab  shows  all  PLC  write  conflicts  with  other  write  usage  of  data
points such as math objects, connection receivers, etc., while editing the project. This allows

finding problems prior to the configuration download. The conflicts tab also provides easy
navigation to data points listed as problematic. For more information refer to Section 8.4.7.

Modbus and M-Bus Templates

Modbus and M-Bus device templates offer some new features that boost productivity:

  Allow setting the device name when storing the template in a file.

  Naming rules for created data points when used on device.

  Configure  naming  rules  for  the  automatic  naming  of  Modbus  devices  (e.g.  with  or

without device address).

  Templates include all OPC and PLC settings.



Imported device templates are also stored in the device configuration. They are now also
available after loading a configuration out of the device, not only from the disk file.

5.6  Getting started with L-STUDIO

L-STUDIO is the LOYTEC solution for integrated development of PLC programming, data
point configuration, visualization and cross-device communication between resources in the
runtime.  L-STUDIO is  used to engineer the entire system,  not only single controllers. To

Version 8.2

LOYTEC

fully  support  integrated  cross-cmmunication,  the  L-STUDIO  runtime  requires  IP-based
communication.

For  developing  IEC61131  programs  with  L-STUDIO  the  following  components  must  be
installed:

1.  L-STUDIO  setup  package.  This  package  installs  the  L-STUDIO  software,  which  is

needed to design PLC programs for the L-INX device.

2.  L-INX Configurator. This software is required to configure the L-INX device to provide

the necessary data points to the PLC and integrate the device into the network.

3.  L-VIS Configurator. This software is required to create graphics for the CAT (composite
automation  type).  The  CAT  combines  data  points,  PLC  logic,  and  graphics  in  one
component.

4.  L-STUDIO runtime  license  installed on the  LOYTEC controller device. Most L-INX

devices come with a pre-installed license (see Section 1.12).

The basic components in an L-STUDIO 61131 solution are:





61131  program  CAT:  This  contains  the  functions  blocks,  data  points  and  sub-
function blocks that implement the PLC logic. Logic in the 61131 program CATs is
executed on a cyclic basis.
61499 CAT: This composite block instantiates one ore more 61131 program CATs
and creates the cyclic trigger signal for those blocks.

  Device CAT: This represents a type for the controller equipment on which 61499
CATs can be instantiated. On the device CAT, L-IOB I/Os can be links to favorites
that have been generated out of the 61131 CATs.

  Device Resource: This is the physical representation of the controller equipment.

This quick-start guide walks you through the basic steps to create a first simple PLC program
in L-STUDIO 61131. For a thorough discussion of the components needed in an L-STUDIO
61131 application the  LTRAIN-LSTUDIO training course  must be attended.  The training
material goes into more detail on how to use LOYTEC library components and instantiate
CATs for visualization.

To Start an L-STUDIO Project with a 61131 program

1.  After installing the necessary software components start the L-STUDIO application from

the Windows start menu.

2.  Create a new solution in menu File  New  Solution… and enter a name as shown

If the CEA-709 device receives a wink command on any of its network ports, it shows a blink
pattern on the CNIP and the CEA-709 activity LEDs. The CEA-709 activity and the CNIP
LED turn green/orange/red (each 0.15 s). This pattern is repeated six times. After that, the
CNIP LED flashes orange six times if the wink command was received on the IP channel or
the CEA-709 activity LED flashes orange six times if the wink command was received on
the CEA-709 channel. After that the device’s LEDs resume their normal behavior.

6.4.11  Network Diagnostics

The CEA-709 device provides simple network diagnostics via its CEA-709 activity LED:

If the LED does not light up at all, this port is not connected to any network segment or the
connected network segment currently shows no traffic.

If the LED is flashing green, the network segment connected to this port is ok.

If the LED is flashing red, a potential problem exists on the network segment connected to
this port. This state is referred to as overload condition.

A port overload condition occurs if





the average bandwidth utilization of this port was higher than 70 %, or

the collision rate was higher than 5 %, or

  more than 15 % CRC errors have occurred on a port with a power-line transceiver, or

more than 5 % on a port with a transceiver other than power-line, or



the device was not able to process all available messages.

For a deeper analysis of the reason for the overload condition, it is recommended to use a
protocol analyzer (e.g., LOYTEC’s LPA) or a similar tool. The exact reason of the overload
condition can also be determined with the LSD Tool.

7 Concepts

7.1  Universal Gateway

The  operating  principle  of  a  universal  gateway  is  to  connect  data  points  of  one  network
technology to data points of another technology. This is the primary function of the L-GATE
product family. Gateway function are, however, also available in the L-INX family.

Data points in the CEA-709 network are known as network variables (NVs). Data points in
the BACnet technology are known as BACnet server objects. They have a specific type (e.g.
analog input or binary output) and a set of properties, which describe the data point more
closely.  The  actual  value  is  stored  in  the  “Present_Value”.  For  more  information  on  the
mentioned technologies refer to the LINX Configurator User Manual [2].

The typical task in configuring the universal gateway consists of the following steps:

1.  Selecting  the  data  points  of  the  network  to  be  mapped  (e.g.,  select  the  NVs  in  the

CEA-709 network nodes or create new NVs)

2.  Select  or  create  matching  counterparts  of  the  other  technology  (e.g.,  create  matching

BACnet objects)

3.  Create connections between the data points (e.g. connect NVs and BACnet objects).

The connection is the central part of the gateway functionality. It defines, which data points
are mapped to which data points. Refer to the Connections Section in the LINX Configurator
User Manual [2] for more information.

7.2  Data Point Configuration

Data points are part of the fundamental device concept to model process data. A data point
is the basic input/output element on the device. Each data point has a value, a data type, a
direction, and a set of meta-data describing the value in a semantic context. Each data point
also has a name and a description. The entire set of data points is organized in a hierarchy
using  a  folder  structure.  Folders  can  be  created  as  needed  and  have  a  folder  name  and
description.

The direction of a data point is defined as the “network view” of the data flow. This means,
an input data  point obtains data  from the  network.  An output data  point sends data  to the
network. This is an important convention to remember as different technologies may define
other direction semantics. If a data point can both receive and send data on the network, its
direction is set to value, indicating no explicit network data flow.

The  device  provides  a Web  interface  for  displaying  and  modifying  data  point  values  (see
Figure 77). Data points that are structures contain their structure members as sub-data points
beneath them. Data point values are typically written by the controller or by the network. For
testing  purposes  the  values  can  also  be  manually  overridden  (Set  Override).  More
information  on  the  data  point  Web  interface  can  be  found  in  the  LOYTEC  Device  User

LOYTEC

Manual [1]. For a comprehensive description of the data point configuration on the device
please refer to the LINX Configurator User Manual [2].

Figure 77: Data points on the Web interface.

7.3  IEC61131 Variables

IEC61131 variables are dedicated data points used to exchange data with the L-LOGICAD
IEC61131 program. These variables are represented in the data point configuration as register
data points and can be connected to other data points, e.g. to CEA-709 NV points, via data
point connections.

Another way to use data points in a 61131 program is to set the PLC in and PLC out flags on
the respective data points.

In contrast to CEA-709 or BACnet variables, IEC61131 variables are always represented as
single data point. In case of scalar values (representing CEA-709 scalar or enumeration types)
one of the following basic data types might be used:

  Double: A register of base type  double is represented by an  analog data point. It can

hold any scalar value. No specific scaling factors apply.

  Signed Integer:  A register of base type signed integer is represented by a multi-state
data point. This register can hold a set of discrete states, each identified by a signed stats
ID.

  Boolean:  A  register  of  base  type  boolean  is  represented  by  a  binary  data  point.  This

register can hold a Boolean value.

Structured  IEC61131  variables,  representing  for  example  structured  NVs,  or  customer
defined IEC61131 structures, are stored as user type:

  User: A user data point contains un-interpreted, user-defined data. The data is stored as
a byte array. A user data point does not include any other meta-data. This type of data
point also serves as a container for otherwise structured data points and represents the
entire data structure. User data points can only be connected to other user data points of
the same data length.

8 IEC 61131 – L-LOGICAD

To  design  the  IEC61131  program  which  should  run  on  the  L-INX  device,  the  graphical
programming tool logiCAD is required. The tool allows creating IEC61131 programs using
various  IEC61131  programming  languages.  It  offers  additional  features  downloading  and
debugging of the created program.

In addition to logiCAD, the L-INX Configurator necessary to create an appropriate data point
configuration in the automation server. The usage of logiCAD itself is beyond the scope of
this manual. Please refer to the logiCAD online help in case of additional questions.

8.1  Overview

The  PLC  in  the  L-INX  device  is  intended  to  perform  IEC61131  programs  operating  on
IEC61131 data points. The operating principle is to connect IEC61131 data points to data
points derived from CEA-709, BACnet or LIOB network. Figure 78 depicts the usage of data
points for IEC61131 programs at the example of using CEA-709 network variables.

Figure 78 Usage of data points.

Alternatively, data points can also be directly exposed as IEC61131 variables. The data points
provide a PLC check box for this purpose. In this use case, not special IEC61131 data points
are created and no connections are necessary.

In order to run a logiCAD PLC program on a L-INX controller, the L-LOGICAD license
must be installed on the controller device. Note, that for newer devices as of production week
50/2023  (A64  models)  the  L-LOGICAD  license  is  no  longer  available.  The  following
sections on logiCAD are therefore describing a legacy technology for L-INX controllers. For
new projects, PLC programs need to be migrated to the L-STUDIO 61131 run-time.

8.2  Installing logiCAD

For  developing  IEC61131  programs  with  logiCAD  the  following  components  must  be
installed:

1.  L-logiCAD setup package. This package installs the logiCAD software, which is needed

to design PLC programs for the L-INX device.

2.  L-INX Configurator. This software is required to configure the L-INX device to provide

the necessary data points to the PLC and integrate the device into the network.

logiCAD license for using logiCAD  on the  PC. The  license  is available as a softlock
version or as a hardlock version with a USB dongle. On virtual machines it is mandatory
to  use  the  hardlock  license.  How  to  obtain  and  install  the  license  is  described  in  this
Section.

The L-logiCAD installer installs the IEC61131 programming environment logiCAD and all
L-INX related software packages. These packages include the template project for the LINX,
the  required  software  to  build  IEC61131  programs  for  the  L-INX  device,  and  required
extensions to interface to CEA-709 networks. Follow the instructions of the installer to install
logiCAD for the L-INX.

The  language  for  the  logiCAD  user  interfaces  can  be  set  to  German  or  English  using  the
administration  folder  of  the  logiCAD  control  center.  The  logiCAD  control  center  can  be
started from the Windows start menu.

8.2.1  Softlock License

The license to run a copy of logiCAD on any PC is based on a softlock license. In case the
original softlock license file was generated for an older L-logiCAD version, the software will
request an update signature key for the new L-logiCAD installation. This signature key can
be found in the file ‘logicad_Readme.txt’ that is located in the installation directory of the L-
logiCAD software.

To obtain and install a new license start logiCAD. The product activation dialog will appear
as shown in Figure 79. In this dialog press the button Download Softlock License.

Important!

When using Windows7 start logiCAD as administrator in order to allow the script read the
computer number code. If there are x's in the code, the code was not read by the script.

Figure 79: logiCAD Product Activation

Enter the license data provided with the product information on the Web site form as shown
in  Figure  80.  Fill  in  the  SL-number  and  Licensing  Code  from  your  L-LOGICAD
registration form and click on Download License File. Save the license file on your computer

8.2.2  Hardlock License

The hardlock license is needed to run a copy of logiCAD in a virtual machine on the PC. It
needs to be puchased separately as L-LODICAD-USB and is distributed as a USB hardlock
key of type ‘CodeMeter’. If no driver for this type of hardlock is already installed on the PC,
install the hardlock driver provided on the LOYTEC website. It can be found in Support 

Download  and  the  product  selection  for  L-LOGICAD.  After  the  driver  installation  has
completed, plug in the USB key. It must be recognized as a mass storage device (the details
on  it  show  the  location  ‘CodeMeter-Stick’).  When  starting  logiCAD  it  recognizes  the
hardlock automatically.

If the driver installation failed, or the USB key was not detected or connected, the window
shown in Figure 82 will be shown when logiCAD is started. In this case plug in the hardlock
stick, wait for Windows to recognize it and then click Find Dongle.

Figure 82: logiCAD Product Activation with Hardlock

Note:

logiCAD checks frequently if the USB key is present. When unplugging the USB key, even if
logiCAD was successfully started, all major features are automatically disabled. But there is
no additional message for the user!

8.3  IEC61131 Project Files

In the L-INX Configurator select the LogiCAD Files tab to attach an IEC61131 program and
a logiCAD project to the L-INX project. The tab is shown in Figure 83.

If there is an IEC61131 program attached to the project, every time a new configuration is
downloaded to the device, the L-INX Configurator asks, if the attached program should be
downloaded as  well. This  way, no logiCAD is required to download a suitable IEC61131
program  in  a  separate  step.  The  project  designed  in  the  L-INX  Configurator  can  hold  all
necessary information to set up a running device:



IEC61131 data point configuration,

  Data point configuration in the LINX,

  Required connections,



IEC61131 program.

The logiCAD project directory can also be attached to the L-INX configuration file, in order
to include the logiCAD project sources from which the program was compiled.

Every time a logiCAD project is successfully compiled, the file MBRTCode.so, the compiled
IEC61131 program, is copied to the  public directory of the device  resource for which the
program was compiled. Select this file to attach it to the project of the Configurator. Note
that the time and date of the file indicates the time of the last code generation. If logiCAD is
not able to build a new program, the old file will not be deleted.

The project will be scanned for device resources and the available devices will be listed in
the  dropdown  box  called  Device  Config.  Select  the  desired  device  and  press  the  button
Attach Program to automatically attach the correct MBRTCode.so file.

8.4  Working with logiCAD

This  section  provides  all  necessary  background  information  how  to  use  the  L-INX  with
logiCAD. For using the L-INX with logiCAD, a predefined project template for the L-INX
must be used. Hence, when creating a new project, select the project template “Project for
LINX-110”,  see  Figure  84.  For  additional  information  how  to  create,  delete  and  manage
projects please refer to the logiCAD online help.

Figure 84: L-INX specific extensions

Figure 84 shows the standard project for the L-INX including all LINX-specific extensions
for  logiCAD.  It  shows  the  structure  window  showing  the  project  structure  on  the  left,  an
empty working area top right and the Error-state viewer on the bottom right side.

The structure window offers interfaces to the following features:

1.  The folder Functionplans holds all the program types created within logiCAD. ‘Plan_1’

is the default plan to start with.

2.  The folder LOYTEC/LINX-110 represents the LINX-110 device. The folder LOYTEC
represents  a  configuration  containing  one  LINX-110  resource;  please  refer  to  the
logiCAD online help for details. To run a program, located in the folder Functionplans,
a program instance of the corresponding function plan must be created. In the standard
LINX-110 template a program instance of the ‘Plan_1’ is already defined. To be able to
transfer IEC61131 variables from the L-INX device to the IEC61131 program a global
variables object within the LINX-110 folder is required, see Section 8.4.1 for details.

3.  LogiCAD operates on variable types standardized in the IEC61131 standard. Look for
“Elementary  and  Generic  Data  Types”  within  the  logiCAD  online  help  to  get
information about the available data types. For those L-INX devices, which are intended
to  operate  on  structured  NVs,  appropriate  type  definitions  for  the  NVs  are  required.
These  definitions  are  inside  the  folder  CEA-709_Types.  Additional  NVs  must  be
converted  to  data  types  that  can  be  processed  by  logiCAD.  Therefore  Technology
Converters  are  supplied  with  the  L-INX  project,  which  perform  this  conversion.  See
Section 8.4.3 for details.

4.  For designing programs that support the force update functionality (see Section 8.6.1),
or  designing  user-defined  Technology  Mapper  (see  Section  8.6.2)  additional  function
blocks are required. These blocks are located within the Loytec_Support directory.

All LINX-specific add-ons are provided using function blocks. Hence, in the following, all
samples are based on designs using function blocks.

8.4.1  Managing Variables

On a function plan, three basic types of variables may be created using the tabs shown below
the function plan sheet:

  VAR: Variables created on this tab  will be  visible only to the logic designed on this
group of sheets. It will not be accessible to any other programs or to any function blocks
which are used in this program. It is similar to a ‘static’ variable declaration in a C code
function.

  VAR  GLOBAL:  Variables  declared  here  will  be  accessible  to  the  entire  program,
including any function blocks which are called by the program. Function blocks which
need to reference this variable need to have a suitable declaration of an external variable
(see next point). This declaration is similar to a ‘static’ declaration of a C variable outside
a function, which will be visible to all functions inside the C code module, but not visible
to other modules.

  VAR EXTERNAL: Variables declared in this list will be treated as open references to
a  global  variable  which  exists  somewhere  in  the  scope  of  the  device  on  which  the
program will be executed. This means that a global variable needs to be declared on the
device resource, which will be available to all programs running on the device. If the
physical address parameter of the variable is set to %I, %O, or %M, the variable will be
handed  down  to  the  I/O  driver  of  the  L-INX  for  processing.  If  a  suitable  IEC61131
variable exists in the data point configuration of the device, its value will be forwarded
by the I/O driver between the PLC variable and the data point. If no physical address is
set, the variable will only be visible to the PLC programs but not to the I/O driver, which
may be used to exchange data between PLC tasks.

The basic data flow between the CEA709 network (or BACnet and other technologies) and
the PLC program is depicted in Figure 85.

Figure 85: Connecting IEC61131 variables

The place where global variables are created on the device is shown in Figure 86.

Figure 86: Global Variables Object

When starting a new project, no global variables object is available; it must be created before
compiling the IEC61131 application. The global variables object is created automatically by
the LINX Configurator when exporting variables to logiCAD.

Figure 87: Variables defined in global variables object

Figure 87 shows the contents of a sample global variables object. As shown a global variable
is defined by the fields name, declaration and phys.addr.:

  Name: The name of a global variable must be unique. The name is used from the IO
driver to identify the global variable and from the L-INX Configurator to generate the
corresponding IEC61131 data points.

  Declaration: Here the type of the global variable is defined.

  Phys.Addr.: The IO driver needs to know the data flow direction to be able to update
variables. The direction is defined by adding %I for an input variable, %O for an output
variable and %M for a marker (input and output). If the address is empty, the I/O driver
will not handle the variable, but it may still be used by the tasks running on the device.

Important:

Only ASCII characters can be used for naming the global variables.

8.4.2  Build and Download the IEC61131 Program

IEC61131 programs, designed using logiCAD, must be cross compiled in order to run on the
L-INX device. The prerequisite to compile an IEC61131 program are as follows:

  A program instance with associated program type

  A corresponding global variables object

Right click on the LINX-110 resource, see  Figure 86, and select Code Generation. Please
refer to the logiCAD online help for the meaning of the options. Take care about the option
breakpoint support, see section 8.4.5 for details.

After successfully finished code generation, the IEC61131 application can be downloaded to
the LINX-110. Right click on the LINX-110 resource and select download.

The IEC61131 program can be downloaded to the LINX-110 device via TCP/IP, CEA-709
and RS232:

  TCP/IP:  Enter  the  IP  address  of  the  LINX-110  device.  Do  not  change  the  default
communication port (2048). This is the easiest and fastest way to connect to the device.

  CEA-709: Select the network interface to use and fill out all other fields, see Figure 88.
Alternatively, select the network interface and press Auto-detect via Service-Pin. Then
press the service pin on the LINX-110 device. Note that this connection method requires
an installed LOYTEC network interface.

Figure 88: Connect via CEA-709

Important:

To be able to communicate with the LINX-110 device via CEA709 the LINX-110 must be
commissioned.

  RS232:  To  connect  via  RS232  select  LOYTEC  RS232  as  Driver  and  LOYTEC  as

transmission protocol. All other values are set correctly per default.

8.4.3  Usage of NVs, Technology Converters

To used CEA-709 variables the content of the NVs must be converted to IEC61131 compliant
data types. Look for “Elementary and Generic Data Types” within the logiCAD online help
to get information about the available data types. Technology Converters are used to perform
the  transformation  from  CEA-709  data  types  to  IEC61131  data  types.  All  Technology
Converters  are  summarized  in  the  subfolder  CEA709_Conv  located  in  the  StandardLibs
folder.

Depending  on  the  type  of  the  NV  there  are  three  different  ways  to  use  the  NV  within
IEC61131 programs:

  Simple NVs that hold only one scalar value, e.g. SNVT_amp:

Those kinds on NVs are represented as IEC61131 REAL values within logiCAD.
There is no additional conversion necessary. Figure 100 shows an example program
for scalar data types.

  Simple NVs based on an enumeration, e.g. SNVT_date_day:

The  active  identifier  of  the  enumeration  is  represented  as  Boolean  value.  When
using NVs based on enumerations, Enumeration Converters are used to identify the
current  state.  There  are  two  kinds  of  Enumeration  Converters.  First,  the
Enumeration  Converters  that  convert  the  enumeration  types  to  Boolean  types,
grouped in the folder  Convert from CEA709_Enums. Second, the Enumeration
Converters that converts several Boolean inputs to an enumeration type, grouped in
the folder Convert to CEA709_Enums.

  Structured NVs that consists of a number of fields, e.g. SNVT_switch:

On  structured  NVs  two  tasks  must  be  performed  by  the  Technology  Converters.
First the structure of the NV is mapped to IEC61131 conform data types. Second, if
necessary scaling factors are applied. Similar to the  Enumeration Converters, the
Technology  Converters  are  split  up  into  two  subfolders.  The  first  one,  which

Version 8.2

LOYTEC electronics GmbH

L-INX/L-GATE User Manual

95

LOYTEC

converts  the  NV  into  IEC61131  compliant  data  types,  is  located  in  the  folder
From_CEA709_Types. Technology Converters to set up NVs based on IEC61131
data types are grouped in the folder To_CEA709_Types.

Figure 89 shows the three possibilities how to use NVs within an IEC61131 program.

Figure 89: Usage of NVs

If a structured NV comprises enumerations types, these enumerations are not split up by the
Technology  Converter.  To  get  the  value  of  the  enumeration,  connect  an  Enumeration
Converter to the corresponding output of the Technology Converter.

For  every  Technology  Converter  and  Enumeration  Converter  an  online  help  window,
displaying the interface description is available. Select the Technology Converter and press
F1 to get the interface description.

8.4.4  IEC61131 Program Cycle Time

IEC61131  programs  are  performed  in  a  periodical  manner.  IEC61131  tasks  are  used  do
control the execution of an IEC61131 program. As shown in Figure 86 several default tasks
are defined within the template project. Right click on the clock symbol and select properties
to change the cycle time of the task.

As described in section 8.4 a program instance is required to execute the IEC61131 program.
The cycle time of the IEC61131 program is controlled by the task assigned to the program
instance. In order to change the cycle time right click on  the program instance and select
properties. In the upcoming window the task assignment for the selected program type can
be changed, see Figure 90.

Figure 90: Task assignment

Please take care when defining names for the tasks. The names displayed in the project view
are symbolic names, they do not correspond to the settings for the cycle time, even if the
L-INX template project use the configured cycle time as task name.

8.4.5  CPU Overload

Several conditions affect the CPU utilization of the IEC61131 program. As a result it is not
possible  to  predict  the  system  load  caused  by  the  IEC61131  program.  E.g.  the  following
parameters are of particular importance when designing IEC61131 programs:

  Number of inputs and outputs handled by the I/O driver.

  Complexity of the logic in the running IEC61131 program.

  Number of simultaneously running program instances on one L-INX.

  Cycle time of IEC61131 programs.



logiCAD breakpoint support and force-able code enabled or disabled

The developer of the IEC61131 program is able to check the current system load within the
Web UI. To get a rough estimate of the CPU load investigate the PLC-LED. Every time, the
system load increases 80% for a certain period of time, the PLC-LED switches to red until
the system load goes below 80%.

In case of CPU overload, the IEC61131 program may not be able to finish its work within
the defined cycle  time. Adapt the program in order to reduce the total system load below
80%. Here are a few tips to keep the CPU load down:



Increase the cycle time, so that the task may finish in time before the next cycle start
is scheduled. The PLC kernel will always schedule the next run at an absolute time,
no  matter  how  long  the  previous  run  took,  in  order  to  compensate  for  irregular
execution times and keep a steady cycle time if possible.

  Reduce the number of I/O variables, to reduce the load caused by exchanging data

between the PLC program and the data points of the automation server.

  Reduce the number of independent tasks and try to place as much functionality as
possible into one task. Every running task will call the I/O driver for new inputs and
outputs independently, therefore two tasks running at a 1s cycle time each will cause
twice the I/O load of one task running at 1s cycle time.

  Take special care about the complexity of function blocks which are used a lot. Bad
performance of one such block may dramatically increase CPU load if it needs to
be calculated several hundred times in one cycle.

  Try to disable breakpoint support and force-able code when generating code for the

target, to get the most efficient PLC code out of your logic.

  For complex designs, it may be possible to add a state machine using SFC elements

and enable/disable large parts of the logic based on the current state of operation.

  Whenever  a  function  does  not  need  to  calculate  new  output  values  under  certain
conditions,  use  the  built-in  EN  input  of  the  block  to  disable  execution  and  thus
reduce the required CPU time, instead of adding  your own ‘Enable’ input  which
causes the logic to ‘behave’ as if it would be disabled, while it is actually calculated
every  cycle.  This  is  similar  to  power  saving  methods  used  in  modern  electronic
devices.  Parts  which  are  not  required  are  put  into  a  low  power  mode  instead  of
keeping them running in an unproductive state.

8.4.6  I/O Driver Settings

Before starting the IEC61131 program, the device  performs a check on all defined global
variables,  which  are  marked  %I,  %O,  or  %M  in  the  physical  address  parameter.  For  all

Version 8.2

LOYTEC electronics GmbH

L-INX/L-GATE User Manual

97

LOYTEC

variables, which cannot be loaded, because the corresponding data points cannot be located
on the device, the I/O driver reports a warning in the system log and shows a listing on the
Web interface.

Since IEC61131 program and the data point configuration are downloaded separately, it may
be  possible  that  the  IEC61131  program  does  not  match  the  currently  active  data  point
interface. In this case it could be dangerous to write values onto those potentially wrong data
points. The fact that there are any variables that could not be loaded is taken as an indication
for a configuration mismatch. The I/O Check feature disables the I/O driver of the IEC61131
kernel  automatically  in  this  situation.  This  setting  is  enabled  by  default  in  a  new
configuration. In the rare case that it is intended to have missing data points, this feature can
be disabled in the Configurator. In the system settings de-select the I/O check (see Figure
91). If the I/O driver is disabled, it can be temporarily enabled again on the Web interface
until the next reboot.

Figure 91: System settings for logiCAD I/O settings.

The  project  setting  Enforce  cyclic  output  update  enables  a  cyclic  update  of  output  data
points, which will ensure that those output data points will contain the calculated value after
each cycle. This is the default setting. It can be  disabled, if the output data  point shall be
written  only  if  the  calculated  value  changes.  In  this  mode  the  output  data  point  can  be
modified over the Web UI for debugging reasons until the IEC61131 program calculates a
new value. This mode can also be used to implement an event-style output operation.

8.4.7  PLC Conflicts

PLC output variables are cyclically updating the respective data points, which are configured
as PLC out. If those data points are also written to by other objects (e.g. output of a math
object, receiver in a connection) this will not have the desired effect. Also favorites that are
PLC out and linked to a PLC out data point will result in two different PLC output variables
writing to one and the same data point.

The PLC Conflicts tab provides information for detecting such write conflicts on PLC out
data points. The tab shows a list of PLC write conflicts and the writing objects, which are in
conflict with a PLC out data point. Each reported conflict line can be selected. By clicking
the Go to data point button

 the Configurator navigates to the conflicting object.

Figure 92: PLC conflicts tab.

An example is shown in Figure 92. The user register ‘HeatExchangeON_Write’ is written to
by  the  PLC,  because  it  is  PLC  out.  But  the  register  is  also  an  output  in  the  math  object
‘VE01_HeatExchange’.  To  resolve  the  conflict,  either  remove  the  register  from  the  math
object or remove the PLC out check box from the user register. For doing the latter, select

the conflict line reporting the register and select Go to data point. Then uncheck PLC out
on the data point.

8.5  Workflows for the L-INX

8.5.1  Starting with Data Points

This workflow is based on defining data points used for the IEC61131 program in the L-INX
Configurator and then export them  to logiCAD.  Figure  93 presents the  basic steps of this
workflow. To follow the steps refer to the quick-start description of Section 5.7.  Refer to the
LINX Configurator User Manual [2] about additional information how to gather information
from the network.

Figure 93: Start with network based information

It is assumed  that there are already network data  points (CEA-709, BACnet,  L-IOB, etc.)
available. Clicking the Export variables to logiCAD button in the Configurator creates the
IEC61131 variables in logiCAD. The following rules are applied in this process:

  The name of the global variables object is derived from the technology base folder
(e.g. CEA709, User Registers, etc.). If there is no matching global variables object

one  is  created.  If  there  is  already  a  suitable  global  variables  object,  the  existing
variables are saved.

  There is already a suitable global variables object: If there is an old and new variable
with identical name, the type of the variable is checked. In case of a type mismatch
of the old and new variable, the old one is discarded and the new one is imported.
Additional a warning is printed on the Error-state viewer.

  The name of the global variables object represents the folder name in the L-INX

Configurator.

After  exporting  the  data  points  as  global  variables  to  logiCAD,  they  can  be  used  in  the
Functionplan ‘Plan_1’. To open the respective global variables folder double-click on it. To
use  the  imported  variables  simply  drag  and  drop  the  required  global  variable  on  to  the
Functionplan,  see  Figure  94.  The  external  variables  (see  Section  8.5.2)  are  automatically
created when adding the global variable to the Functionplan.

Figure 94: Adding global variables to Functionplans

After adding function blocks that perform the expected work, the IEC61131 program is ready
to compile and download (see Section 8.4.2).

8.5.2  Starting with logiCAD

This section introduces a workflow how to develop a new IEC61131 program from scratch
using logiCAD. Figure 95 shows the necessary steps to perform. For starting a new logiCAD
project refer to the quick-start of Section 5.7.

After creating a new project for a L-INX resource and opening the Functionplan Plan_1 an
empty input area is shown, similar to Figure 96.

The  dark  grey  areas  on  the  left  and  right  side  are  intended  to  place  the  input  and  output
variables, the light grey area is used to place the functional blocks.

As  described  above,  global  variables  are  used  to  interface  IEC61131  data  points  on  the
LINX-110  device.  As  assumed  for  the  current  workflow,  the  IEC61131  data  points  are
created  on  information  based  on  the  global  variables  exported  from  logiCAD.  Hence,  for
designing the program, external variables are used during the design phase. To create a new

Figure 100: Use external variables

The Functionplan ‘Plan_1’ represents now a simple program. It adds a defined value to the
value of the input variable and sends the result to the output variable.

Add all expected functionality to the ‘Plan_1’ or use different Functionplans to split up the
expected functionality into smaller pieces. But take care about the name and type declaration
of external variables when using more than one Functionplan. All external variables with the
same name refer to the same global variable.

After  adding  all  functionality,  global  variables  matching  the  requirements  of  the  defined
external  variables,  must  be  generated.  A  tool  automatically  performs  the  process  of
generating the global variables object and the required global variables.

Figure 101: Auto-create global variables

To start the creation of global variables, based on external variables, Save all changes, then
right click the L-INX device and select Global Variables  Generate. Then the selected
L-INX resource is parsed and every program instance found is checked for external variables.
In  Figure  101  the  type  instance  Plan_1  refers  to  the  Functionplan  ‘Plan_1’,  as  defined  in
Figure 100. If there are more Functionplans than the predefined ‘Plan_1’ appropriate program
instances for these plans must be added to the resource before creating the global variables.
Anyway, only Functionplans referred from program instances are executed.

Figure 102: Created global variables object

Now there is a global variables object called IEC61131 Variables available, containing all
global  representations  of  the  external  variables  defined  before.  The  Error-state  viewer
reports all processed program instances and added variables, see Figure 102 for details.

The global variables are crated based on the following rules:

  The direction of the variable is determined based on the graphical representation,

shown in Figure 103.

Figure 103: Direction of global variables

Every  external  variable  connected  on  the  right  terminal  results  in  a  global  input
variable. External variables connected on the left terminal or on both sides results
in a global output variable. Variables connected on both sides can either be used for
the force update feature (see section 8.6.1) or as marker (see section 8.6.4). As the
tool can not distinguish between these two possibilities, per default a global output
variable is created.





If there is already a global variables object, only new variables are added. In case of
external variables using the same name as an already existing global variable, the
new definition is used and a warning is printed in the Error-state viewer.

In case of two Functionplans, each referring to a global variable with the same name
but a different type, the creation process is stopped and an  error is printed in the
Error-state viewer.

Now  the  IEC61131 program  is  ready  to  compile  and  download,  refer  to  section  8.4.2  for
details.

Based on the above created global variables corresponding IEC61131 data points are created
on  the  L-INX.  For  doing  so,  start  the  L-INX  Configurator  and  click  the  speed  button
Import variables from logiCAD. Data points are created in the IEC61131 Variables folder.

The Configurator reports the results of the import. For the import process the following rules
are applied:

  New variables are added

  Variables with same name and type are ignored



If there are variables with the same name but different type or direction, the variable
to import is ignored and a warning is added to the import log.

The name of the folder to import the new variables corresponds to the name of the global
variables object. Figure 104 shows the result of the import process.

Figure 104: Connect IEC61131 variables

To create the appropriate network data points for all imported IEC61131 variables select the
IEC61131  Variables  folder  and  press  the  button  Generate  and  Connect  Network  <->
IEC61131 variable from folder. Check the log output for errors and finally download the
configuration to the L-INX device.

After rebooting the L-INX device the IEC61131 program is up and running. Check the PLC
LED for potential overload.

8.5.3  Pre-compiled IEC61131 Program

In opposite to the last two chapters it is assumed that there are already some components
finished, hence starting up from scratch is not suitable. Second, there is the possibility to have
an already defined IEC61131 program or an already fixed network interface.

Starting  with an already precompiled IEC61131 program results in a similar  workflow  as
presented in Section 8.5.1. The difference is that all logiCAD related tasks are missing. As
the IEC61131 program is compiled, the name of the IEC61131 data points is already fixed.
The definitions for the data points must be available either in form of a CSV file to import to
the L-INX Configurator or as part of a L-INX Configurator project. If the network interface
for the L-INX was not already defined, the L-INX Configurator can be used to generate and
connect the needed data points.

Version 8.2

LOYTEC electronics GmbH

L-INX/L-GATE User Manual

106

LOYTEC

Additionally, there is the possibility that also the network data points are already fixed or that
a given, user-defined interface is necessary. Then the developer has to connect the IEC61131
data points to the corresponding network data points by himself.

Finally,  after  downloading  the  configuration  and  rebooting  the  L-INX,  the  IEC61131
program can be downloaded to the L-INX via the Web UI or the L-INX Configurator. After
a final reboot the L-INX loads and executes the IEC61131 program.

8.6  Additional Features

8.6.1  Force Update Functionality

Per  default  the  IEC61131  program  only  sends  updates  on  changed  output  values.  Every
program  cycle  the  input  values  are  fetched,  the  IEC61131  program  is  executed  and  the
calculated values are sent to the output driver. If the old values are identically with the new
one no  updates are  sent to the IEC61131 data  points. As a result no  update  is sent to  the
network.

For some applications, e.g. for a scene controller, it is necessary to send an update on request.
E.g.  every  time  the  input  value  is  updated,  the  output  value  is  forwarded  to  the  network,
regardless if the value of the output value was changed or not.

For implementing this  feature, special vendor blocks are  available. First it is  necessary  to
check if there was an update on a selected input within the last execution cycle of the running
IEC61131  program.  That  functionality  is  offered  by  the  function  block  Update  Notify
located in the StandardLibsLoytec_Support folder. Second, an output must be forced to
send an update even if the value was not changed. The function block Force Update is used
for that functionality, it is located in the StandardLibsLoytec_Support.

Figure 105: Force update

Figure  105  depicts  how  to  use  the  force  update  functionality.  Besides  of  the  part  of  the
IEC61131  program  that  defines  the  calculations  to  perform  (lower  half  of  Figure  105),
additional logic for the force update functionality is required. The global input variable that
is monitored for changes is connected to the Update Notification function block. As a result,
the  Boolean  output  ‘Updated’  is  set  to  TRUE  for  one  program  cycle,  if  the  value  of  the
connected variable has been updated since the last cycle start. To force the I/O driver send
out an update, the global output variable, which shall be updated, is connected to ‘Output’ of
the Force Update block. Hence, every time the ‘Update’ input of the Force Update block is
TRUE, the connected global output variable sends out an update at the end of the program
cycle.

Important:

Every global variable connected to the update notification or force update block must be
connected via the right-hand side terminal!

8.6.2  Using UNVT variables

Similar to the predefined CEA709 data types and the technology converter functions, user-
defined  network  variable  data  types  can  be  used.  The  L-INX  Configurator  supports  the
developer  to  generate  the  type  definitions  needed  for  UNVTs  and  enumerations  based  on
resources files. LONMARK

To generate type definitionf for UNVTs in logiCAD

1.  Start the L-INX Configurator.

2.  Select the menu Tools  Export NV Resource File….

3.  Select the resource file to be exported. Select structured text as format and export the file

to a location of your choice by clicking Export Selected.

4.  To import the created type definition file into logiCAD, add a new library to the project.
Right-click on the created library and select Export/Import  Start ST-Import.

5.  Select the file to be imported and check the  Error-state viewer for the results of the

import process.

Using  the  newly  created  data  types,  suitable  technology  converter  function  blocks  can  be
created.  For  each  UNVT  type,  create  a  normal  function  block  to  convert  an  input  of  the
UNVT type to a number of standard IEC61131 data types and vice versa. You may look at
the technology converter blocks  for SNVT types  which are  provided by LOYTEC, to get
ideas how to implement your own converter functions.

8.6.3  Create Your Own Data Type

For special applications, custom IEC61131 compliant data types may be created by the user,
which do not correspond to any CEA709 network type but should still be available as a data
point on the L-INX automation server, in order to access the data point value from the Web
interface or over XML as a parameter. Further, such data points can also be made persistent,
which makes variables of such custom data types persistent.

Most  of  the  IEC61131  data  types  may  be  used  as  global  variables  on  the  device  and  the
L-INX Configurator will be able to create a suitable register data point for the IEC61131 data
type. Supported data types include custom enumeration types (a multi-state register with the
required states will be created automatically), strings (a string data point with a maximum
length of 128 characters will be built), structures and simple arrays.

If such structured variables shall be mapped to a data point, which shall only be persistent to
store the structure but no access to its elements are required in the data point interface  create
a suitable register data point during the IEC61131 variable import. In this case the data size
of custom structures cannot be determined automatically, so the L-INX Configurator does
not know  how  to create a suitable user data  point.  As a  workaround, the type  name  must
contain the desired size of the data point in bytes, for example: MyStructuredType(UT16)
will tell the L-INX Configurator to create an IEC61131 register of type ‘user’ with a length
of 16 bytes, to hold the data for the IEC61131 structure defined in the logiCAD program.

As an alternative, structures and arrays the logiCAD type definitions can be exported to the
Configurator  using  structured  text.  The  Configurator  builds  custom  structured  data  point
types in the logiCAD category out of the structured text definitions. In this case, the exact
data size of a user register is determined by the structured data type. Structure members of
the logiCAD types are represented as a tree of sub-data points. logiCAD arrays (like ARRAY
[1..16]  OF  INT)  are  represented  as  a  series  of  single  data  points  where  each  data  point
represents one array element. Note, that the array in logiCAD can still be access by index.

8.6.4  Using Persistent Data Points and Markers

Persistent data points are data points on the device that hold their value even after power loss.
In the IEC61131 program there is no difference in handling global variables connected to
persistent data points or to non-persistent data points. When using global variables on the
device resource that shall retain their values after a reboot, the respective data points need to
be configured with the persistent flag in the L-INX Configurator.

Global input variables marked as persistent, supply the IEC61131 program every time with
the  last  received,  valid  data,  even  after  a  power  failure.  To  enable  this  behavior,  set  the
respective input data points persistent in the L-INX Configurator and download the data point
configuration to the device.

Global variables declared as marker can be used as input and output variable in IEC61131
programs. LogiCAD is not able to distinguish markers from global output variables used in
combination with the force update feature, see  Figure 105. As a result it is not possible to
create a global variables object holding markers automatically. The procedure as described
in Section 8.5.1 is not able to decide when to create an output variable or a marker. Markers
must  be  created  manually  by  adding  them  to  the  global  variables  object  and  setting  the
physical address to %M.

8.6.5  Using Retain Variables

Retain variables can be used to maintain certain states or parameters of a program over  a
reboot  in  those  variables,  which  cannot  be  kept  in  persistent  data  points.  Typically,  input
variables (%I) will be marked as retain variables. For doing so check the RETAIN attribute
in the variable declaration when creating or editing a variable as shown in Figure 107.

Version 8.2

LOYTEC electronics GmbH

L-INX/L-GATE User Manual

110

LOYTEC

Figure 107: Declaring a retain variable.

The retain attribute should be used in global variables and local variables on function plan
only. Global variables on the device resource are managed by the I/O driver and must not use
the retain attribute. Instead data point persistency (see Section 8.6.4) must be used for those
variables. Furthermore, it is not recommended to mark local variables in function blocks as
retain variables.

The  contents  of  retain  variables  are  written  to  Flash  storage  every  5  minutes  and  when
shutting  down  the  device.  This  provides  good  compromise  between  write  granularity  for
normal operation and ensuring Flash life-time. If the contents shall be written explicitly at a
defined  time,  use  the  RetainCtl  function  block  located  in  the  logi.library/Data  folder.
Connect the store input (S) and set this input TRUE for one cycle to trigger writing retain
data. Make sure to set the input back to FALSE after this cycle to avoid multiple consecutive
writes.

8.6.6  L-INX System Registers, System Time

L-INX  system  registers,  such  as  the  system  time  or  the  CPU  load,  can  be  used  within
IEC61131 programs. Therefore, for each system input  variable, a global input  variable of
type  UDINT  may  be  created  within  the  IEC61131  program.  Then,  connections  to  the
appropriate system registers are created manually with the L-INX Configurator.

To use the system time within the IEC61131 program, connect the AtoDT converter (located
in the StandardLibs->IEC61131-3_ (EXT) folder) to the global input variable that receives
the system time.

8.6.7  Code Protection

There are 4 data points used for code protection. These data points, in combination with an
adapted  IEC61131  program,  can  be  used  to  protect  your  61131-Program  Intellectual
Property. Please contact LOYTEC sales for further information.

8.6.8  Using Structured Data Point Members

Some network technologies provide  structured data  points. Their types are defined by the
network technology and are available in the Configurator. Those structure types can either

Version 8.2

LOYTEC electronics GmbH

L-INX/L-GATE User Manual

111

LOYTEC

be  used  in  logiCAD  by  implementing  a  technology  converter  (see  Section  8.4.3)  or  by
exposing the sub-data points of the respective structures.

To Use Sub-Data Points in logiCAD

1.

In the Configurator, expand the structured data point and expose the desired sub-data
points of its structure members to the PLC.

2.  Export the variables to logiCAD. The exposed structure members appear for example as

‘/UR/mod1_Read.byte_0’ in the ‘User Registers’ global variables block.

3.  Export  the  types  for  the  respective  type  category  in  the  menu  Tools    Manage

Structured Types… . This opens the structured types management dialog.

4.  Choose the type Category, e.g. ‘Modbus’.

5.  Click the speed button Save to disk

.

6.

In  the  dialog  Export  Type  to  Disk  choose  a  Disk  Repository  Path  and  select  the
extension ‘.ST’ for structured text.

7.  Copy all listed types to the disk repository by clicking

. Alternatively select specific

types and click

. Then click Save and exit the dialog.

8.

In logiCAD create a new library folder, e.g. ‘modbus_types’.

9.  Right-click on that new library and select Export/Import  Start ST Import. In the

file dialog choose the previously exported structured text file.

10.  The type definitions are now available in the new library.

8.6.9  BACnet Server Objects

BACnet  server  objects  provide  additional  functionality  compared  to  other  network
technologies. The most important tasks in an IEC61131 program are:

  Reading sensor data from BACnet input objects,

  writing to commandable BACnet objects with a priority,





revoking values from commandable BACnet objects,

handling objects when out of service.

The default data flow direction for a commandable BACnet object (e.g. AO) is input to the
PLC  (%I).  This  means  its  value  is  commanded  over  the  BACnet  network  and  the  logic

Version 8.2

LOYTEC electronics GmbH

L-INX/L-GATE User Manual

112

LOYTEC

processes the resulting value. The default for non-commandable BACnet objects (e.g. AI) is
output (%O). This means the logic writes the value, which is read out of the object over the
BACnet network. With this type of variables the BACnet objects are treated as variables of
the IEC61131 program.

When exposing local I/O to BACnet server objects, the  BACnet  objects represent the I/O
values and the IEC61131 program behaves like a user from the network on those objects.
Typically sensor values are connected to BACnet input objects (e.g. AI). To read the sensor
value  the  PLC  needs  an  input  variable.  Since  the  default  data  point  direction  is  output,  a
separate access data point for the PLC must be created. For doing so, use the Add/Remove
BACnet properties option from the context menu of the data point list and create a read data
point for the Present_Value.  Figure 108 shows an example, where the PLC uses the input
‘/BAC/AI2.Present_Value_Read’ to get the sensor values from AI2.

Figure 108: PLC with BACnet objects.

BACnet output objects (e.g. AO) are connected to actuator I/Os. On those BACnet objects
the PLC behaves like a user from the network and needs to write and revoke values at certain
priority slots. For writing with a certain priority to a commandable object, a priority write
data  point needs to be created (see LINX Configurator User Manual [2], Section BACnet
Configuration, Write and Read with Priority). This data point is configured with a BACnet
write priority in the Configurator and used as an output in the PLC. The example in Figure
108 writes with priority ‘4’ to AO1 over ‘/BAC/AO1_pri4’.

To revoke values in commandable server objects, the SetValueState function block must be
used. It is located in the Loytec_Support/Service folder. The I/O variable of the controlled
BACnet object is connected to the Variable input of the function block. A Boolean signal
needs to be connected to the Invalid input. When this input changes to TRUE, the value is
revoked at the respective priority slot. When it remains TRUE in the next cycle the service
function  block  is  idle.  Figure  108  shows  an  example,  how  to  revoke  a  value  in  ‘AO1’  at
priority slot ‘4’.

With the out-of-service feature BACnet server objects can be decoupled from the senor and
actuator I/O equipment. When taken out of service, the I/O variables of the PLC are then
decoupled  from  the  network.  The  input  variable  Present_Value_Read  of  an  AI  no  longer
tracks the sensor value but reflects the value set in the AI from a BACnet OWS. This holds
true for all non-commandable BACnet objects. Writing to the priority output variable of an
AO only updates the priority array but no longer drives the actuator. This holds true for all
commandable BACnet objects.

The  out-of-service  state  is  reflected  in  the  data  point  status  and  can  be  accessed  with  the
ValueState function block. This function block reads the value state and is used in a similar
fashion as the SetValueState function block.

8.6.10  Custom Serial Protocols

A logiCAD program can implement simple custom serial protocols using the SerialComm
function block. The logic program assigns the Baud rate settings for the protocol as well as a
logical bus number. This bus number can be selected on the port configuration Web UI in
order to activate the custom serial protocol on that port.

Custom serial protocols with the following communication properties can be supported:

Version 8.2

LOYTEC electronics GmbH

L-INX/L-GATE User Manual

113

LOYTEC

  ASCII protocol: The serial communication block works with strings that are transmitted

and received.

  Line-Oriented:  Each  command  and  reply  is  modeled  as  a  text  line.  The  line  can  be

terminated by any combination of CR and LF.

  Start/End Character: If not line-oriented, a start and end character can be specified to
detect start and end of a frame. The end character must be escaped in the frame content.

  Master/Slave: The serial communication block is a master, which sends requests over
the serial port and expects slave(s) to respond. The serial communication block can also
implement a slave, which receives requests and creates responses.

  Addressing Information: If the serial protocol has more than one slave, each request must
have  address  information,  which  selects  a  specific  slave.  Especially  for  RS-485  bus
communication address information is required. Since frames sent out are also received,
they need to be filtered out by address.

To start the implementation of a custom serial protocol use the function block SerialComm
located  in  the  StandardLibsLoytec_SupportService  folder.  Add  a  bus  number  and
communication  settings  as  a  string  (e.g.,  „38400-8N1-X“)  as  shown  in  Figure  109.  Best
practice for an implementation is to use an SFC-based state machine. All necessary input and
output signals are available on this function block. The minimum number of states is Idle,
Rx, Tx. For a full specification of this block use the F1 help.

Figure 109: Example for the SerialComm block.

String  processing  may  build  commands  from  data  point  values  and  extract  data  from
responses, which are written to data points. The data points should be user registers that are
organized into a separate sub-folder for the custom serial protocol.

9 Firmware Update

The L-INX and L-GATE firmware support remote upgrade over the network and the serial
console.

To guarantee that the device is not destroyed due to a failed firmware update, the firmware
consists of two images:

1.  The fallback image,

2.

the primary image.

The fallback image cannot be changed. Thus, if the update of the primary image fails or the
image is destroyed by some other means, the fallback image is booted and allows reinstalling
a valid primary image. When the device boots up with the fallback image, the all port LEDs
are flashing red.

Newer devices do not have a dedicated fallback image anymore. Instead, they keep the last
working  firmware  image  as  a  backup.  If  a  firmware  upgrade  fails  or  renders  the  device
unsuable in any other way, the last working firmware image is re-installed.

The firmware image is distributed in a firmware ZIP archive that applies to all L-INX and L-
GATE models.

9.1  Firmware Update via the Configurator

The  primary  image  can  be  updated  using  the  Configurator.  For  this  purpose,  it  is
recommended  to  have  the  device  connected  to  the  Ethernet  and  to  have  a  valid  IP
configuration (see Section 5.2). The Configurator must be installed as described in the LINX
Configurator User Manual [2].

To Update the Firmware using the Configurator

1.  Start the Configurator from the Windows Start menu: Start  Programs  LOYTEC

LINX Configurator  LOYTEC LINX Configurator.

2.  Select the menu: Connection  Connect to device. This opens the device connection

dialog as shown in Figure 110.

In the connection dialog, enter the IP address of the device as well as the admin user’s
password. The password can be changed via the Web interface.

If the device uses other port settings than the standard settings or the device is operated
behind a NAT router, adapt the HTTP(S) port accordingly.

5.  Click on Connect.

Note:

Alternatively, one can also connect  via LNS. A firmware upgrade over an FT-10 channel,
however, needs a lot more time to complete than over IP.

6.  Optionally, check for updates by selecting the menu  Help   Check for updates ….

This function checks for new firmware and Configurator versions.

7.  Select the menu: Firmware  Update …

8.  This opens the Firmware Update dialog as shown in Figure 111. Click on the button

12.5  Upgrade Key Strength

The secure services (HTTPS, SSH) rely on certificates to authenticate the device against the
connecting client. This is key to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. The device comes with
pre-installed server certificates. It is recommended to upgrade the pre-installed certificate to
an individual server-certificate and use stronger key length.

  Server  certificate  (for  HTTPS,  OPC  UA):  Follow  the  instructions  in  the  LOYTEC
Device User Manual [1] Section 3.2.29 Certificate Management on how to upgrade the
pre-installed X.509 server certificate to a custom, self-signed or CA-signed certificate
with stronger key length.

  SSH key upgrade: If SSH is enabled it is recommended to upgrade the SSH key length.
Refer to the LOYTEC Device User Manual [1] Section 3.2.28 SSH Server Config on

12.6  Logging and Auditing

The device contains a log file, which can be read out over SSH or the Web server. This log
contains information when the device started and when crucial communication errors occur.
Other information such user log-on are not logged as they are not part of the primary services
of this device.

Logged events:

  Time of the last power-on reset of the L-INX/L-GATE device.

  Time and version of the last firmware upgrade.

  Time when the device configuration has been cleared or the device was reset to factory

defaults.

  Commission of the CEA-709 node/router.

  Static errors in the device and data point configuration.

  System overload situations as one-time log messages since last power-on.

  Crucial communication errors as they occur.

  Logins and login failures.

12.7  Network Access

Network access can be protected by using 802.1X port authentication (as of firmware 7.4.0)
using EAP-TLS, PEAP, or TTLS. Unused Ethernet ports can be disabled.

12.8  Password Protection

Devices  provide  separate  administrative  (admin)  and  operative  (operator)  user  accounts.
Passwords are stored using a strong cryptographic  hash (salted  SHA256). Device  login is
protected by a login trap that blocks logins for 10 seconds after ten consecutive failed login
attempts to protect against brute-force password attacks. Initial password setting is enforced.

To protect usage of the admin password, the admin user can create additional user accounts
with an admin role. Those additional user accounts can be disabled as needed.

administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,

      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

# Ten Unpatched Vulnerabilities in Building Automation Products Identified by TXOne Networks

Dec 07, 2023

![Blog: “Ten Unpatched Vulnerabilities in Building Automation Products Identified by TXOne Networks”](https://media.txone.com/prod/uploads/2023/12/Blog-Unpatched-Vulnerabilities-in-Building-Automation-Products.jpg)

#### Background

A building automation system (BAS) is a system that allows the centralized control and monitoring of various building systems, such as heating, ventilation, air conditioning, lighting, security, and fire alarms. A BAS can improve the performance, efficiency, comfort, and security of a building by collecting and analyzing data from sensors, devices, and services, and using artificial intelligence and machine learning to make the building programmable and responsive to the needs of the users and the building manager. A BAS can also use Power over Ethernet (PoE) to power and connect different devices through a single network infrastructure. A BAS can offer many benefits, such as lower operational and energy costs, greater flexibility, higher resale value, and automated maintenance. However, a BAS also faces some challenges, such as privacy and data issues, capital investment, and persistent internet connections.

LOYTEC is a company that specializes in innovative building automation products and solutions. LOYTEC offers a range of products, such as building management systems, room automation systems, automation servers, I/O controllers, gateways, touch panels, lighting control systems, routers, interfaces, and software tools.

Emerging Threat Research team in TXOne Networks found 10 vulnerabilities on Loytec products in 2021 and contacted the vendor through Trend Micro ZDI (Zero Day Initiative) and ICS-CERT; However, there was no response from the vendor, so we decided to disclose these findings after two years. We really hope that the vendor will soon provide fixes or alternative solutions.

#### Affected Products

The TXOne Threat Research team has discovered several security vulnerabilities that affect a range of devices used in building automation. These vulnerabilities are present in devices like the LINX-212, LINX-151, and LIOB-586. These are programmable automation workstations specifically designed to manage various building applications. Additionally, the vulnerabilities also impact the LVIS-3ME12-A1 touch panel, the LWEB-802 visualization tool, and the L-INX Configurator configuration tool. It’s important for users of these devices to be aware of these security issues, as they could lead to the deactivation of the building’s safety systems and alarms, potentially compromising the security and safety of the premises:

* L-INX Automation Servers: These are programmable automation stations that offer various functions, such as alarming, scheduling, trending, e-mail notification, IEC 61131-3 programmable logic, and OPC server. They can also integrate various building systems and protocols, such as CEA-709 (LonMark), BACnet, KNX, Modbus, M-Bus, and DALI.
* L-IOB I/O Controllers and Modules: These are programmable automation stations and modules that extend LOYTEC devices with physical inputs and outputs. They can be used for various applications, such as HVAC, lighting, shading, security, and fire alarms. They also support various open protocols and standards, such as CEA-709 (LonMark), BACnet, KNX, Modbus, and DALI.
* L-WEB Building Management: This is a powerful software for running distributed building automation systems. It allows the user to visualize, operate, monitor, and optimize the building performance and energy consumption. It also supports various web services and interfaces, such as OPC UA, BACnet/WS, RESTful API, and MQTT.
* L-INX Configurator: This is a software tool that allows the user to configure and program various LOYTEC devices, such as L-INX Automation Servers, L-IOB I/O Controllers and Modules, L-DALI Controllers, L-GATE Universal Gateways, LIOB-AIR Controllers, and L-ROC Room Controllers. The user can use the L-INX Configurator to create and edit network variables, data points, schedules, alarms, trends, logic programs, and web pages for the LOYTEC devices.

#### Vulnerability Descriptions

Our research indicates that vulnerabilities like CVE-2023-46380, CVE-2023-46382, CVE-2023-46383, and CVE-2023-46385 allow for the reading of sensitive data, such as cleartext password. However, exploiting these vulnerabilities requires conducting a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack on the network. CVE-2023-46382 is particularly noteworthy because it can be exploited without any technical skills. If the web user interface of the pre-installed LWEB-802 is exposed online, it can be easily accessed and controlled by anyone. We have found that some of these interfaces are publicly accessible online.

For CVE-2023-46387 and CVE-2023-46389, once attackers gain administrator-level access, they can easily retrieve files containing SMTP client credentials, which are used for alarm and reporting functions.

CVE-2023-46384 presents a different scenario, as it requires local access to a computer with the LINX Configurator installed. Anyone with local access to such a computer could potentially steal passwords.

The detailed descriptions of the vulnerabilities are as follows:

[CVE-2023-46380](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-46380): Insecure Permissions

Password change request on the web interface on LOYTEC devices is sent in clear text over HTTP, and this allows information theft and account takeover via network sniffing.

[CVE-2023-46381](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-46381): Improper Access Control

Authentication is missing on the web user interface for the preinstalled version of LWEB-802. If there is a project on a device, an unauthenticated user could create a new project on a web and access/control a graphical interface. An unauthenticated user also could edit or delete a current web project, change settings and delete system logs etc…

http://{IP}:{port}/lweb802\_pre/

[CVE-2023-46382](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-46382) : Insecure Permissions

The web user interface on Loytec devices requires login credentials for critical information (Data, Commission, Config, etc…); however, username and password information is sent in clear text over HTTP. If anyone sniff network traffic, they could easily steal credentials.

[CVE-2023-46383](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-46383) : Insecure Permissions

Loytec LINX Configurator could be connected to Loytec devices with an administrator credential, and it could configure device settings. Since it uses HTTP Basic Authentication, which transmits usernames and passwords in base64-encoded cleartext, so anyone could easily steal credentials if they sniff network traffics. Once obtaining the admin password, attackers could connect and control Loytec devices via LINX configurator.

[CVE-2023-46384](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-46384) :  Insecure Permissions

Following registry key contains hard-coded clear text admin password for recently connected Loytec device. (password cache) If an attacker succeeds in getting this registry key value, attackers could connect and control Loytec devices via LINX configurator.

Key: Computer\HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\SOFTWARE\LOYTEC\LOYTEC LINX Configurator\OhioIni

Value name: ftp\_pass

Value dada: <admin password>

[CVE-2023-46385](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-46385) : Insecure Permissions

When Loytec LINX Configurator connects to a device, it sends HTTP GET request to login. Since cleartext password is passed as an URL parameter, “password” without sufficient protection, anyone could easily steal credentials if they sniff network traffics. Once obtaining the admin password, attackers could connect and control Loytec devices via LINX configurator.    http://{IP}:{port}/webui/config/system?username=admin&password=<admin password>&login=Login

[CVE-2023-46386](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-46386) : Insecure Permissions

‘registry.xml’ file contains hard-coded clear text credentials for SMTP client account. If an attacker succeeds in getting registry.xml file, the email account could be compromised. Password should be encrypted.

[CVE-2023-46387](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-46387) : Improper Access Control

‘/var/lib/lgtw/dpal\_config.zml’ file is accessible via file download API. ‘dpal\_config.wbx’ which is extracted from ‘dpal\_config.zml’ includes sensitive configuration information such as SMTP client information. Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.

http://{IP}:{port}/DT?filename=/var/lib/lgtw/dpal\_config.zml

[CVE-2023-46388](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-46388) : Insecure Permissions

‘dpal\_config.wbx’ file contains hard-coded clear text credentials for SMTP client account. If an attacker succeeds in getting dpal\_config.zml file, the email account could be compromised. Password should be encrypted.

[CVE-2023-46389](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-46389) : Improper Access Control

‘/tmp/registry.xml’ file is accessible via file download API. ‘registry.xml’ includes device configuration information which includes sensitive information such as SMTP client information. Authentication isrequired to exploit this vulnerability.

http://{IP}:{port}/DT?filename=/tmp/registry.xml
