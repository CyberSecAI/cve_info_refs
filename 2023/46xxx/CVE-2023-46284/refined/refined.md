The provided content is related to CVE-2023-46284.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds write past the end of an allocated buffer. This occurs when the application handles specific requests on ports 4002/tcp and 4004/tcp.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-120:** Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow'). The application does not properly validate the size of input data before copying it into a buffer, leading to the buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause the application to crash. The affected service will automatically restart after the crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by sending specific requests to the affected application via network ports 4002/tcp and 4004/tcp.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable application on ports 4002/tcp and 4004/tcp. No authentication or user interaction is required.

**Affected Products:**
The following products are affected by the vulnerability:

-   Opcenter Execution Foundation (all versions < V2407)
-   Opcenter Quality (all versions < V2312)
-   SIMATIC PCS neo (all versions < V4.1)
-   SINEC NMS (all versions < V2.0 SP1)
-   Totally Integrated Automation Portal (TIA Portal) V14 (all versions)
-   Totally Integrated Automation Portal (TIA Portal) V15.1 (all versions)
-   Totally Integrated Automation Portal (TIA Portal) V16 (all versions)
-   Totally Integrated Automation Portal (TIA Portal) V17 (all versions < V17 Update 8)
-  Totally Integrated Automation Portal (TIA Portal) V18 (all versions < V18 Update 3)

**Mitigation:**
Siemens recommends the following mitigations:
- If only one UMC server is used, block access to port 4002/tcp e.g. with an external firewall
- If only one RT server is used, block access to port 4004/tcp e.g. with an external firewall. If the deployment contains no RT-Servers, block the port in the local firewall.
- Update to the latest versions of the affected products where fixes are available.
