Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
*   The vulnerability is due to a "broken access control issue," meaning there's a lack of proper authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks in a function. This allows unprivileged users to perform actions they shouldn't be able to.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Broken Access Control:** The plugin fails to properly restrict access to certain functions, allowing unauthorized users to execute privileged actions. Specifically missing authorization, authentication or nonce token check.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An unprivileged user, such as a 'contributor', could potentially execute higher-privileged actions, leading to unintended changes or access within the WordPress site. The specific impact of this is said to vary on a case-by-case basis.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through the plugin itself, exploiting the vulnerable functions that lack proper access control.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be a user with "Contributor" privileges, which is a relatively low-level access within WordPress. This indicates the vulnerability can be exploited by a user that doesn't have admin privileges.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is classified as having a "Low" severity and a CVSS score of 5.4.
*   A virtual patch is available from Patchstack to mitigate this vulnerability, and the fixed version of the plugin is 2.0.16.
*   The vulnerable plugin is the "Draw Attention" WordPress plugin, versions <= 2.0.15.
*   The vulnerability was reported by "thiennv".
