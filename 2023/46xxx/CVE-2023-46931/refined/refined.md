Based on the provided information, this issue describes a heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability in the GPAC MP4Box tool.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `ffdmx_parse_side_data` function within the `ff_dmx.c` file of the GPAC library.
- The issue is a heap-buffer-overflow which occurs when parsing side data, specifically a read of size 4 at address `0x602000008f2c`. This address is located 4 bytes to the left of a 16-byte region previously allocated.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow: The program attempts to read data beyond the allocated buffer, leading to memory corruption.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Crash: The heap-buffer-overflow leads to program termination due to the AddressSanitizer (ASAN) detecting the issue and aborting the execution. This can result in a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a specially crafted input file to the `MP4Box` tool, specifically when using the `-dash` option. The provided proof-of-concept (`poc4gpac`) demonstrates this.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted input file to the MP4Box tool. This likely means the attacker needs the ability to execute the MP4Box tool with user-provided input data.

**Additional details:**
- The ASAN log clearly indicates the location of the overflow and provides a call stack, including the function `ffdmx_parse_side_data` where the overflow is triggered.
- The issue was reported by user Frank-Z7, who provided a complete reproduction method, ASAN logs, and the vulnerable file for analysis.
- The issue was fixed by a commit `671976fccc971b3dff8d3dcf6ebd600472ca64bf`.
