**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Splunk Add-on Builder writes sensitive information to internal log files when editing custom app and add-on properties.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-532:**  Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File. The application logs sensitive values used by custom apps and add-ons, specifically:
    - Proxy credentials
    - Global Account credentials
    - User-defined password fields under Data Input Parameters
    - User-defined password fields under Add-on Setup Parameters

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Impact:** High - Exposure of sensitive credentials and passwords.
- **Integrity and Availability Impact:** Potentially unknown, depends on the permissions of the exposed credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** Attackers with local access to the server's log files can read the sensitive information directly.
- **Administrative Access:** Attackers with administrative access to Splunk's internal indexes can query the logs and extract the sensitive information.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **High Privileges:** The attacker needs either local file system access or administrative privileges within the Splunk environment.
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of the location of the log files or the means to search the internal indexes.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability lies within the Splunk Add-on Builder, not the add-ons generated by the tool.
- The provided solution involves upgrading the Splunk Add-on Builder, deleting the relevant log files, clearing log events, restarting Splunk, and rotating sensitive information stored in the configurations.
-  The CVSS score of 8.2 (High) reflects the significant confidentiality risk.
