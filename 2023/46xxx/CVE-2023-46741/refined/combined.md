# CubeFS leaks magic secret key when starting Blobstore access service

Moderate

published
GHSA-8h2x-gr2c-c275
Jan 3, 2024

## Package

gomod

github.com/cubefs/cubefs
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

< v3.3.1

## Patched versions

v3.3.1

## Description

A vulnerability was found in CubeFS that could allow users to read sensitive data from the logs which could allow them escalate privileges.

CubeFS leaks configuration keys in plaintext format in the logs. These keys could allow anyone to carry out operations on blobs that they otherwise do not have permissions for. For example, an attacker that has succesfully retrieved a secret key from the logs can delete blogs from the blob store.

The attacker can either be an internal user with limited privileges to read the log, or it can be an external user who has escalated privileges sufficiently to access the logs. There is no evidence of this vulnerability being exploited in the wild. It was found during an ongoing security audit carried out by [Ada Logics](https://adalogics.com/) in collaboration with [OSTIF](https://ostif.org/) and the [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/).

The vulnerability has been patched in v3.3.1. There is no other mitigated than upgrading.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
