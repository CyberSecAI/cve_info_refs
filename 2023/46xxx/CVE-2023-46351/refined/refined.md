Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-46351:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from improper neutralization of SQL parameters in the `mib::getManufacturersByCategory()` method of the "mib" module for PrestaShop, specifically in the `id_category` parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The module's code constructs SQL queries by directly concatenating user-supplied input (`$category`) without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to several severe consequences:
    - **Obtain admin access:** Attackers can potentially manipulate queries to gain administrative privileges.
    - **Data Removal:** Attackers can execute SQL commands to delete or alter data within the PrestaShop database.
    - **Data Exposure:** Attackers can extract sensitive data from the database, including tokens and other credentials, and expose them via the front end of the website. This data can be used to unlock admin's ajax scripts
    - **Hijacking emails:** Attackers could rewrite SMTP settings to intercept emails.
    
**Attack vectors:**

- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network via HTTP requests.
- The attack is carried out via a crafted HTTP request, specifically to the `/` path using a POST method. The payload may be concealed and therefore not visible in frontend logs.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **No authentication required:** The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users (guests).
- **Low complexity:** Exploitation is relatively straightforward with a low attack complexity.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable server

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is triggered if the "Activate categories filter" option is enabled, which is not a default setting of the module.
- The vulnerability was fixed in module version 1.6.1 by casting the category parameter to an integer `(int) $category` before using it in the SQL query.
- It's important to note that even though the upgrade to the latest PrestaShop version disables multiquery executions, it **does not protect** against all SQL injection attacks (those that use UNION clause).
