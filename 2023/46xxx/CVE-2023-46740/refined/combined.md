# Insecure random string generator used for sensitive data

Moderate

[leonrayang](/leonrayang)
published
GHSA-4248-p65p-hcrm
Jan 3, 2024

## Package

gomod

github.com/cubefs/cubefs
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

< v3.3.0

## Patched versions

None

## Description

CubeFS used an insecure random string generator to generate user-specific, sensitive keys used to authenticate users in a CubeFS deployment. This could allow an attacker to predict and/or guess the generated string and impersonate a user thereby obtaining higher privileges.

When CubeFS creates new users, it creates a piece of sensitive information for the user called the “accessKey”. To create the "accesKey", CubeFS uses an insecure string generator which makes it easy to guess and thereby impersonate the created user.

An attacker could leverage the predictable random string generator and guess a users access key and impersonate the user to obtain higher privileges.

There is no evidence of this vulnerability being exploited in the wild. It was found during a security audit carried out by [Ada Logics](https://adalogics.com/) in collaboration with [OSTIF](https://ostif.org/) and the [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/).

The issue has been fixed in v3.3.1. There is no other mitigation than to upgrade.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L
