If the UDM is utilizing a Go version that is earlier than 1.19, it may compute the shared secret using an uncompressed public key that is not validated. This absence of validation creates an opportunity for an attacker to exploit the vulnerability and calculate

the private key by sending arbitrary SUCIs to the UDM, which will then attempt to decrypt them using both its own private key and the attacker's public key. Therefore, reference to go 1.19, we check if the keys are operating on valid curve points before compute the shared secret.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Introduction

In a mobile network, each subscriber has a unique identifier called an International Mobile
Subscriber Identity (IMSI). It was first introduced in 2G systems and is still used in 3G and 4G
systems. The use of IMSIs in clear text over the radio link allows subscribers to be identified and
tracked, leading to serious privacy implications. To address this issue, temporary identifiers have
been introduced. These identifiers are randomly selected and frequently changed and are
intended to be used in place of the IMSI. However, in certain situations the use of the IMSI
instead of the TMSI is unavoidable. These situations can be exploited by malicious actors who
can use an attack known as IMSI catching to force subscribers to reveal their IMSI. This renders
the use of the TMSI obsolete.

With the introduction of 5G, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has decided to take
a new approach to address this privacy issue by encrypting the IMSI in cases where the use of
the TMSI is unavoidable. In 5G, the SUPI is the new IMSI, a globally unique identifier assigned
to each subscriber. While the Subscription Concealed Identifier (SUCI) is the privacy-preserving
identifier that contains the concealed SUPI1.

Technical Background

SUPI

There are different types of SUPIs defined in the 5G specification2. In the following, we only look
at the IMSI-based one, which is equivalent to the previously mentioned IMSI. This type is a
number containing up to 15 digits. The foremost three digits represent the Mobile Country Code
(MCC). The next two or three digits define the Mobile Network Code (MNC) identifying the
network operator. The remaining digits represent the individual subscriber of that particular
operator, also known as the Mobile Subscriber Identification Number (MSIN)3. The following
figure shows the structure of IMSI-based SUPIs using a fictional example.

Composition of IMSI

SUCI

A subscriber sends his SUPI concealed as a SUCI to the network as part of the authentication
step. This identifier consists of six parts. The first part specifies the type of the containing SUPI.
The second part specifies the Home Network Identifier. In the case of IMSI-based SUPIs, these
are MCC and MNC. Next is the Routing Indicator, which the network uses for internal routing.

The last three parts are relevant to the Invalid Curve attack presented later. The Protection
Scheme Id indicates which scheme was used by the subscriber to create the scheme output.
The Home Network Public Key Id indicates which of the network operator public keys was used.
The last part of the SUCI is the output of the selected Protection Scheme. The following figure
shows the SUCI structure.

Since the MNC and MCC of the SUPI are directly included in the SUCI, only the MSIN is used
as input for the selected Protection Scheme. Besides the fact that subscribers can still
authenticate to the network by sending their MSIN in plaintext using the null-scheme4, the
novelty of 5G is its encrypted transmission. For this purpose, one of the two predefined Elliptic
Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme (ECIES) profiles can be used5. These profiles (Profile A
and Profile B) differ in their elliptic curve parameters; their main difference is the type of elliptic
curve they use.

ECC

Before we look at the two ECIES profiles in detail, it is helpful to look at essential parts of elliptic
curves and the Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)6 built on them. As a representation of elliptic
curves used in ECC over the finite field Fp, the short Weierstrass equation can be used7:

y² ≡ x³ + ax + b mod p

All pairs (x, y) that satisfy the above equation are points that lie on the given curve and belong
to the same abelian group with a point O at infinity as the identity element. The operations
addition, doubling, negation, and scalar multiplication can be performed with these points8,
where the multiplication is just repeated addition, and all operations are calculated modulo p.

Addition:

Doubling:

Negation:

P1 + P2 = (x1, y1) + (x2, y2) = (x3, y3) = P3
x3 = (y2 - y1)2 / (x2 - x1)2 - x1 - x2
y3 = (2 * x1 + x2) * (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) - (y2 - y1)3 / (x2 - x1)3 - y1

2 * P1 = 2 * (x1, y1) = (x2, y2) = P2
x2 = (3 * x1
y2 = (2 * x1 + x1) * (3 * x1

2 + a)2 / (2 * y1)2 - x1 - x1

2 + a) / (2 * y1) - (3 * x1

2 + a)3 / (2 * y1)3 - y1

-P1 = -(x1, y1) = (x2, y2) = P2
x2 = x1
y2 = -y1

Multiplication: n * P = P + … + P = Q

The difficulty to determine the n for two given points, P and Q (aka discrete logarithm problem of
elliptic curves), is used to determine the private and public key pair for public key cryptography.
A private key is a random number n, which leads to the public key Q by multiplication with a
publicly known base point G:

n * G = Q

A key agreement between two parties is reached by multiplying their private key (nA, nB) with the
other party's public key (QA, QB). The resulting point S is the shared secret between both
parties.

nA * QB = nA * (nB * G) = nB * (nA * G) = nB * QA = S

Depending on the coefficients a, b, and the modulus p, not all curve points can be generated by
multiplication with the base point. The reason for this is the existence of non-overlapping
subgroups of points generated by different base points. The number of unique points that a
base point can generate for any n is called order and those with a small order are called small
order points. The security of subgroups generated by small order base points is weak, leading
to "small-subgroup" attacks9.

ECIES

The ECIES is an encryption method based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) that can be
used, for example, "to transmit a confidential message of arbitrary length."10 The following figure
visualizes the ECIES flow in the 5G context from a subscriber perspective.

The network operator has stored its public key in the SIM card of its subscribers. When a
subscriber authenticates himself to a network, he generates an ephemeral key pair [1]. He then
uses the operator's public key and his fresh private key to compute a shared secret by using
elliptic curve scalar multiplication [2]. Only the x coordinate of the secret is used as input to the
ANSI-X9.63-KDF, which returns an Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) key and a Message
Authentication Code (MAC) key [3]. With the AES key, the subscriber encrypts the MSIN of his
SUPI [4]. In addition, he computes the MAC of the ciphertext via HMAC-SHA-256 using the
MAC key [5]11.

Combining the subscriber's public key, the ciphertext, and the MAC results in the Scheme
Output of the SUCI mentioned above, which is sent to the network. After receiving the SUCI, the
network can calculate the shared secret using the included public key and its private key. After
deriving the AES key from the secret, the MSIN can be decrypted. In addition, the integrity of
the ciphertext is checked using the MAC.

Oracle for successful decryption

Before moving on to the attack, we need a tool to determine if the network can adequately
decrypt the sent SUCI. For this purpose, we consider the successful protocol flow, simplified in
the following figure.

Since the 5G specification describes the implementation, it is not the subscriber who is
considered the communication party but the user equipment (UE) that carries out the
implementation. In addition, the network is divided into individual services with different tasks.

The SUCI included in the Registration Request sent by the UE is relayed via the AMF/SEAF
and AUSF services to the subscription identifier de-concealing function (SIDF) of the Unified
Data Management (UDM) service12. This function decrypts the encrypted MSIN part of the SUCI
according to the chosen ECIES profile and returns the SUPI13.

After processing the respective responses by the intermediate services, the UE receives an
Authentication Request14. This only happens if the de-concealment of the SUCI is successful. In
all other cases, an error (e.g., MAC failure) can be assumed. This different behavior results in a
successful decryption oracle.

It should also be noted that the same oracle is given by sending requests directly to the UDM
from within the network. Instead of an Authentication Request, the HTTP status code 200 is
used as an indicator for successful decryption.

Invalid Curve Attack

An ECIES implementation can be vulnerable to an invalid curve attack if the check of whether a
received public key is on the curve (aka public key validation) is not performed correctly. In
particular, validating uncompressed public keys15 is necessary because both coordinates (x, y)
are specified. These can be used directly in calculating the shared secret without determining y
beforehand.

The public key validation is not necessary for certain curves, and Curve25519 of Profile A is one
of them. It uses only the x coordinate of a point to calculate the multiplication16, which leads to
the fact that public keys consist of only one coordinate, and only this coordinate is used during a
transmission. In addition, the curve is designed to ensure all possible public keys lie on it17.

Since these characteristics do not apply to the secp256r1 curve used in Profile B, it is a
potentially vulnerable curve. For this curve, also known as P-256 or prime256v1, the parameters
a, b, p, and G are defined as follows18:

a = 0xffffffff00000001000000000000000000000000fffffffffffffffffffffffc
b = 0x5ac635d8aa3a93e7b3ebbd55769886bc651d06b0cc53b0f63bce3c3e27d2604b
p = 0xffffffff00000001000000000000000000000000ffffffffffffffffffffffff
G = (0x6b17d1f2e12c4247f8bce6e563a440f277037d812deb33a0f4a13945d898c296,
0x4fe342e2fe1a7f9b8ee7eb4a7c0f9e162bce33576b315ececbb6406837bf51f5)

As the b parameter does not influence the formulas of the operations listed above, they apply
analogously for all curves with the same parameters except b. Based on this characteristic, all
curves with a different b are called invalid curves to secp256r1, and points lying on one of these
invalid curves are called invalid points.

By sending an invalid point as an uncompressed public key to the network, it is possible to force
the shared secret calculation using an invalid curve. If the invalid point is a small order point, the
scalar multiplication with the network's private key results in only a few possible values, as well
as for the AES key derived from it. Due to the limited possibility of AES keys, brute force can be
used to determine which shared secret the network has calculated.

For this purpose, an attacker creates a SUCI for every possible ciphertext and sends it to the
network. The encrypted MSIN can only be successfully decrypted if the correct AES key is used.
As an indicator for this, the oracle listed above is used, and after successfully finding the shared
secret, a simple congruent equation can be constructed. The following figure shows the process
described above.

The attacker repeats this process with more invalid small order points resulting in several more
equations. The entire private key can be calculated using the Chinese Remainder Theorem
(CRT) using only relative prime orders19.

The following algorithm shows the steps to recover a private key n of Profile B if the public key
validation is not correctly implemented:

u = 1
p = 0xffffffff00000001000000000000000000000000ffffffffffffffffffffffff
equation_set = {}

1. Choose an invalid point Q with known small order o, relatively prime to previous

successful orders.
for x in [1, o-1]

2.

a. Generate a SUCI by using Q as the attacker's public key and x as the private key

of the network and send it to the network.
If the decryption fails (no Auth. Req. received), go to 2.
If the decryption is successful (Auth. Req. received), go to 3.

b.
c.

3. Every x failed, go to 1.
4. Add n² ≡ x² mod o to equation_set and update u = u * o.

19 https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Chinese_Remainder_Theorem

8

If u ≤ p², go to 1.

5.
6. n = sqrt(CRT(equation_set))

A malicious actor can gain every private key for Profile B from a network with the given
algorithm. If a SUCI was generated by using the public key of one of those private keys, it could
be easily decrypted. For example, the attacker only needs to eavesdrop on the initial
Registration Request of the subscriber and use the gained private key to decrypt the transmitted
SUCI.

Since the success of this attack is explicitly dependent on the implementation, for example,
depending on how the public key validation is performed, the algorithm may need to be adapted
for a specific implementation.

free5GC

We examined three open-source 5G implementations (OpenAir CN 5G20, Open5GS21,
free5GC22) to evaluate how practical such an invalid curve attack would be. The first two had no
implementation of the ECIES profiles at the time of the investigation.

The third implementation was vulnerable to the invalid curve attack described above because
both the function profileB23 and the used Go library crypto/elliptic (< go1.1924) do not validate
uncompressed public keys before calculating the shared secret. The following screenshot
shows the vulnerable profileB function reduced to the essential lines of code.

24 https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.19#minor_library_changes, crypto/elliptic

9

To exploit the vulnerability, we used SAGE25 to precompute points on arbitrary invalid curves
with small prime order and UERANSIM26 to simulate a subscriber’s UE and the radio link.

Our proof of concept makes it possible to recover a private key via a non-optimized attack within
~4 hours. Thereby ~6000 Registration Requests and ~70 small order points are used.

Mitigations

In general, an attack on Profile B can be prevented by using Profile A exclusively. Since both
profiles must be implemented according to the 5G specification27, deactivating one of the ECIES
profiles would not comply with the specification and possibly reduce backward compatibility.

In detail, it is necessary to validate whether the (uncompressed) public key sent by the
subscriber lies on the secp256r1 curve. In addition, monitoring can detect a possible attack if
many MAC failures occur. Test cases should be created for the implementation to verify the
public key validation in the long term.

Regarding the free5GC implementation, either a public key validation for uncompress points
should be implemented, or the required go version should be upgraded from go1.14 to at least
go1.19.

Conclusion

The invalid curve attack on the 5G SUCI privacy feature highlights the need for robust and
secure implementation practices for 5G networks. While 3GPP's approach to encrypting the
IMSI in 5G is a step towards enhancing subscriber privacy, this research shows that the scheme
introduces new vulnerabilities that can be exploited by malicious actors to subvert the scheme.
To ensure the effectiveness of the SUCI privacy feature, network operators and vendors must
prioritize the proper implementation of their UDM. By addressing these issues, the 5G
ecosystem can continue to evolve and deliver on its promise of improved connectivity and
security for its subscribers.
