{
  "CVE-2023-46604": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Java OpenWire protocol marshaller does not validate the provided throwable class type during unmarshalling.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Deserialization of Untrusted Data (CWE-502) leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE).",
    "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker with network access to a broker can run arbitrary shell commands by manipulating serialized class types in the OpenWire protocol to cause the broker to instantiate any class on the classpath. This can lead to full system compromise.",
     "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker with network access to either a Java-based OpenWire broker or client can send manipulated serialized class types in the OpenWire protocol.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Network access to the vulnerable ActiveMQ broker or client."
