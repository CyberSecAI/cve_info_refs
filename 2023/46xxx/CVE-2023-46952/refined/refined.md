The provided content describes a blind cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in ABO.CMS.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of the `Referer` header by the ABO.CMS application. Specifically, the application embeds the content of the `Referer` header directly into the administrator panel without proper sanitization or escaping.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Blind XSS vulnerability: The injected malicious script is executed in the context of the administrator's browser, without their direct interaction with the injected payload.
- Improper sanitization/escaping of user-controlled input: The application fails to properly sanitize or encode the `Referer` header before embedding it into the admin panel.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the administrator's browser.
- This allows an attacker to perform malicious actions such as:
    - Steal session cookies, leading to account takeover.
    - Modify content on the page, potentially defacing the admin panel.
    - Redirect the administrator to a malicious website.
    - Perform administrative actions on behalf of the administrator.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted HTTP request with a malicious `Referer` header when submitting a form on a target website using ABO.CMS.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to submit forms on a website using the vulnerable ABO.CMS
- Ability to modify the `Referer` header of the HTTP request
