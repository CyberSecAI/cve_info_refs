- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin lacks proper authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks in a function. This allows unprivileged users to execute actions that should be restricted to higher-privileged users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control. The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user could execute higher-privileged actions. The specific impact varies based on the function being accessed without proper authorization.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by sending requests to functions that lack proper authorization checks, making it accessible to unauthenticated users.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the affected plugin. The vulnerability is exploitable by unauthenticated users.
