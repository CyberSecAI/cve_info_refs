# SQUID-2023:5 Denial of Service in FTP

High

[yadij](/yadij)
published
GHSA-2g3c-pg7q-g59w
Oct 21, 2023

## Package

squid

## Affected versions

5.0.3-5.9, 6.0-6.3

## Patched versions

6.4

## Description

Due to an Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types

bug Squid is vulnerable to a Denial of Service

attack against FTP Native Relay input validation.

Due to an Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types

bug Squid is vulnerable to a Denial of Service

attack against ftp:// URL validation and access control.

---

### Severity:

This problem allows a remote client to perform Denial of Service

when sending ftp:// URLs in HTTP Request messages or constructing

ftp:// URLs from FTP Native input.

This issue is triggered during access control security checks,

meaning clients may not have been permitted to use the proxy yet.

FTP support is always enabled and cannot be disabled completely.

CVSS Score of 8.6

<https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H&version=3.1>

---

### Updated Packages:

#### This bug is fixed by Squid version 6.4.

In addition, patches addressing this problem for the stable

releases can be found in our patch archives:

#### Squid 5:

<http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v5/SQUID-2023_5.patch>

#### Squid 6:

<http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v6/SQUID-2023_5.patch>

If you are using a prepackaged version of Squid then please refer

to the package vendor for availability information on updated

packages.

---

### Determining if your version is vulnerable:

Squid older than 5.0.3 are not vulnerable.

All Squid-5.0.4 up to and including 5.6 are vulnerable.

All Squid-6.x up to and including 6.3 are vulnerable.

---

### Workaround:

* The FTP Native Relay input validation vector can be secured by

  removing all ftp\_port directives from squid.conf.
* There are no workarounds to avoid the ftp:// URL validation and

  access control vector.

---

### Contact details for the Squid project:

For installation / upgrade support on binary packaged versions

of Squid: Your first point of contact should be your binary

package vendor.

If you install and build Squid from the original Squid sources

then the squid-users@lists.squid-cache.org mailing list is your

primary support point. For subscription details see

<http://www.squid-cache.org/Support/mailing-lists.html>.

For reporting of non-security bugs in the latest STABLE release

the squid bugzilla database should be used

<https://bugs.squid-cache.org/>.

For reporting of security sensitive bugs send an email to the

squid-bugs@lists.squid-cache.org mailing list. It's a closed

list (though anyone can post) and security related bug reports

are treated in confidence until the impact has been established.

### Credits:

This vulnerability was discovered by Joshua Rogers of Opera

Software.

Fixed by The Measurement Factory.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H
