The provided content relates to CVE-2023-46495.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to improper neutralization of input during web page generation. Specifically, the EverShop web application does not handle multiple "sortBy" parameters correctly.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The application reflects the second "sortBy" parameter in the page's code without proper sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious code into the web page by providing a crafted "sortBy" parameter, leading to:
    - Account takeover
    - Sensitive data exfiltration

**Attack vectors:** Network. Attackers exploit the vulnerability by adding a second "sortBy" parameter in the URL request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker does not require any privileges and only needs to send a crafted HTTP request.
    - User interaction is required to trigger the XSS vulnerability.
