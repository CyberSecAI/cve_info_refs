Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-46953

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the "Documents" module of ABO.CMS, specifically in how the application processes the 'd' parameter, which is intended for transmitting date values.  The application fails to properly sanitize or parameterize this input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper input validation and sanitization of the `d` parameter in the `Documents` module, allowing for the injection of arbitrary SQL code.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability is accessible to unauthenticated users, meaning an attacker doesn't need credentials to exploit it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can use SQL injection to retrieve unauthorized data from the database, potentially including sensitive information.
*   **Data Modification/Deletion:** While not explicitly stated, SQL injection can potentially lead to modification or deletion of data, depending on the attacker's payloads.
*   **Server Compromise:** Although not detailed, there is a potential for escalating the attack to compromise the underlying server.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request, specifically by manipulating the `d` parameter within the URL.
*   **Specifically:** The vulnerable parameter is `d` in the following URL pattern `/support/docs/?action=assortment&paretn=&c=test&d=[INJECTED_SQL]`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker only needs network access to the vulnerable application. No prior authentication or specialized access within the system is necessary.
*   **Basic Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL syntax and SQL injection techniques.

**Technical Details and Exploitation Examples:**

The content provided an example of how to trigger the SQL injection using boolean based technique and indicated the use of SQL comment `--`

*   **Demo-1 (Error Trigger):**  `http://demo.target.ru/support/docs/?action=assortment&paretn=&c=test&d=14.10.2023%27` This demonstrates the vulnerability by showing how a single quote breaks the SQL query, resulting in a 500 error.
*   **Demo-2 (Payload):** `http://demo.target.ru/support/docs/?action=assortment&parent=&c=test&d=14.10.2023%27%20OR%20NOT%20ORD%28MID%28%28SELECT%20IFNULL%28CAST%28COUNT%28%2A%29%20AS%20NCHAR%29%2C0x20%29%20FROM%20core_users%29%2C1%2C1%29%29%3E51%20OR%20%27Fjig%27%3D%27RbUH` This is an example of a boolean-based SQL injection payload, which attempts to enumerate data from the `core_users` table.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in all editions of ABO.CMS, as per the exploit details.
*   The provided link to Portswigger's SQL Injection page highlights that SQL injection is a well-known vulnerability.
*   The exploit was tested on ABO.CMS version 5.9.3, but the description suggests other versions may also be vulnerable.
