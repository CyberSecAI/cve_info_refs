# SQL injection

In this section, we explain:

* What SQL injection (SQLi) is.
* How to find and exploit different types of SQLi vulnerabilities.
* How to prevent SQLi.

![SQL injection](/web-security/images/sql-injection.svg)
#### Labs

If you're familiar with the basic concepts behind SQLi vulnerabilities and want to practice exploiting them on some realistic, deliberately vulnerable targets, you can access labs in this topic from the link below.

* [View all SQL injection labs](/web-security/all-labs#sql-injection)
## What is SQL injection (SQLi)?

SQL injection (SQLi) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database. This can allow an attacker to view data that they are not normally able to retrieve. This might include data that belongs to other users, or any other data that the application can access. In many cases, an attacker can modify or delete this data, causing persistent changes to the application's content or behavior.

In some situations, an attacker can escalate a SQL injection attack to compromise the underlying server or other back-end infrastructure. It can also enable them to perform denial-of-service attacks.

## What is the impact of a successful SQL injection attack?

A successful SQL injection attack can result in unauthorized access to sensitive data, such as:

* Passwords.
* Credit card details.
* Personal user information.

SQL injection attacks have been used in many high-profile data breaches over the years. These have caused reputational damage and regulatory fines. In some cases, an attacker can obtain a persistent backdoor into an organization's systems, leading to a long-term compromise that can go unnoticed for an extended period.

## How to detect SQL injection vulnerabilities

You can detect SQL injection manually using a systematic set of tests against every entry point in the application. To do this, you would typically submit:

* The single quote character `'` and look for errors or other anomalies.
* Some SQL-specific syntax that evaluates to the base (original) value of the entry point, and to a different value, and look for systematic differences in the application responses.
* Boolean conditions such as `OR 1=1` and `OR 1=2`, and look for differences in the application's responses.
* Payloads designed to trigger time delays when executed within a SQL query, and look for differences in the time taken to respond.
* OAST payloads designed to trigger an out-of-band network interaction when executed within a SQL query, and monitor any resulting interactions.

Alternatively, you can find the majority of SQL injection vulnerabilities quickly and reliably using Burp Scanner.

## SQL injection in different parts of the query

Most SQL injection vulnerabilities occur within the `WHERE` clause of a `SELECT` query. Most experienced testers are familiar with this type of SQL injection.

However, SQL injection vulnerabilities can occur at any location within the query, and within different query types. Some other common locations where SQL injection arises are:

* In `UPDATE` statements, within the updated values or the `WHERE` clause.
* In `INSERT` statements, within the inserted values.
* In `SELECT` statements, within the table or column name.
* In `SELECT` statements, within the `ORDER BY` clause.

## SQL injection examples

There are lots of SQL injection vulnerabilities, attacks, and techniques, that occur in different situations. Some common SQL injection examples include:

* [Retrieving hidden data](/web-security/sql-injection#retrieving-hidden-data), where you can modify a SQL query to return additional results.
* [Subverting application logic](/web-security/sql-injection#subverting-application-logic), where you can change a query to interfere with the application's logic.
* [UNION attacks](/web-security/sql-injection/union-attacks), where you can retrieve data from different database tables.
* [Blind SQL injection](/web-security/sql-injection/blind), where the results of a query you control are not returned in the application's responses.

## Retrieving hidden data

Imagine a shopping application that displays products in different categories. When the user clicks on the **Gifts** category, their browser requests the URL:

`https://insecure-website.com/products?category=Gifts`

This causes the application to make a SQL query to retrieve details of the relevant products from the database:

`SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1`

This SQL query asks the database to return:

* all details (`*`)
* from the `products` table
* where the `category` is `Gifts`
* and `released` is `1`.

The restriction `released = 1` is being used to hide products that are not released. We could assume for unreleased products, `released = 0`.

The application doesn't implement any defenses against SQL injection attacks. This means an attacker can construct the following attack, for example:

`https://insecure-website.com/products?category=Gifts'--`

This results in the SQL query:

`SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts'--' AND released = 1`

Crucially, note that `--` is a comment indicator in SQL. This means that the rest of the query is interpreted as a comment, effectively removing it. In this example, this means the query no longer includes `AND released = 1`. As a result, all products are displayed, including those that are not yet released.

You can use a similar attack to cause the application to display all the products in any category, including categories that they don't know about:

`https://insecure-website.com/products?category=Gifts'+OR+1=1--`

This results in the SQL query:

`SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' OR 1=1--' AND released = 1`

The modified query returns all items where either the `category` is `Gifts`, or `1` is equal to `1`. As `1=1` is always true, the query returns all items.

#### Warning

Take care when injecting the condition `OR 1=1` into a SQL query. Even if it appears to be harmless in the context you're injecting into, it's common for applications to use data from a single request in multiple different queries. If your condition reaches an `UPDATE` or `DELETE` statement, for example, it can result in an accidental loss of data.

APPRENTICE
[SQL injection vulnerability in WHERE clause allowing retrieval of hidden data](/web-security/sql-injection/lab-retrieve-hidden-data)

## Subverting application logic

Imagine an application that lets users log in with a username and password. If a user submits the username `wiener` and the password `bluecheese`, the application checks the credentials by performing the following SQL query:

`SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'wiener' AND password = 'bluecheese'`

If the query returns the details of a user, then the login is successful. Otherwise, it is rejected.

In this case, an attacker can log in as any user without the need for a password. They can do this using the SQL comment sequence `--` to remove the password check from the `WHERE` clause of the query. For example, submitting the username `administrator'--` and a blank password results in the following query:

`SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'administrator'--' AND password = ''`

This query returns the user whose `username` is `administrator` and successfully logs the attacker in as that user.

## Retrieving data from other database tables

In cases where the application responds with the results of a SQL query, an attacker can use a SQL injection vulnerability to retrieve data from other tables within the database. You can use the `UNION` keyword to execute an additional `SELECT` query and append the results to the original query.

For example, if an application executes the following query containing the user input `Gifts`:

`SELECT name, description FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts'`

An attacker can submit the input:

`' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users--`

This causes the application to return all usernames and passwords along with the names and descriptions of products.

## Blind SQL injection vulnerabilities

Many instances of SQL injection are blind vulnerabilities. This means that the application does not return the results of the SQL query or the details of any database errors within its responses. Blind vulnerabilities can still be exploited to access unauthorized data, but the techniques involved are generally more complicated and difficult to perform.

The following techniques can be used to exploit blind SQL injection vulnerabilities, depending on the nature of the vulnerability and the database involved:

* You can change the logic of the query to trigger a detectable difference in the application's response depending on the truth of a single condition. This might involve injecting a new condition into some Boolean logic, or conditionally triggering an error such as a divide-by-zero.
* You can conditionally trigger a time delay in the processing of the query. This enables you to infer the truth of the condition based on the time that the application takes to respond.
* You can trigger an out-of-band network interaction, using OAST techniques. This technique is extremely powerful and works in situations where the other techniques do not. Often, you can directly exfiltrate data via the out-of-band channel. For example, you can place the data into a DNS lookup for a domain that you control.

* [Blind SQL injection](/web-security/sql-injection/blind)
## Second-order SQL injection

First-order SQL injection occurs when the application processes user input from an HTTP request and incorporates the input into a SQL query in an unsafe way.

Second-order SQL injection occurs when the application takes user input from an HTTP request and stores it for future use. This is usually done by placing the input into a database, but no vulnerability occurs at the point where the data is stored. Later, when handling a different HTTP request, the application retrieves the stored data and incorporates it into a SQL query in an unsafe way. For this reason, second-order SQL injection is also known as stored SQL injection.

![Second-order SQL injection](/web-security/images/second-order-sql-injection.svg)

Second-order SQL injection often occurs in situations where developers are aware of SQL injection vulnerabilities, and so safely handle the initial placement of the input into the database. When the data is later processed, it is deemed to be safe, since it was previously placed into the database safely. At this point, the data is handled in an unsafe way, because the developer wrongly deems it to be trusted.

## Examining the database

Some core features of the SQL language are implemented in the same way across popular database platforms, and so many ways of detecting and exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities work identically on different types of database.

However, there are also many differences between common databases. These mean that some techniques for detecting and exploiting SQL injection work differently on different platforms. For example:

* Syntax for string concatenation.
* Comments.
* Batched (or stacked) queries.
* Platform-specific APIs.
* Error messages.

[SQL injection cheat sheet](/web-security/sql-injection/cheat-sheet)

After you identify a SQL injection vulnerability, it's often useful to obtain information about the database. This information can help you to exploit the vulnerability.

You can query the version details for the database. Different methods work for different database types. This means that if you find a particular method that works, you can infer the database type. For example, on Oracle you can execute:

`SELECT * FROM v$version`

You can also identify what database tables exist, and the columns they contain. For example, on most databases you can execute the following query to list the tables:

`SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables`

## SQL injection in different contexts

In the previous labs, you used the query string to inject your malicious SQL payload. However, you can perform SQL injection attacks using any controllable input that is processed as a SQL query by the application. For example, some websites take input in JSON or XML format and use this to query the database.

These different formats may provide different ways for you to [obfuscate attacks](/web-security/essential-skills/obfuscating-attacks-using-encodings#obfuscation-via-xml-encoding) that are otherwise blocked due to WAFs and other defense mechanisms. Weak implementations often look for common SQL injection keywords within the request, so you may be able to bypass these filters by encoding or escaping characters in the prohibited keywords. For example, the following XML-based SQL injection uses an XML escape sequence to encode the `S` character in `SELECT`:

`<stockCheck>
<productId>123</productId>
<storeId>999 &#x53;ELECT * FROM information_schema.tables</storeId>
</stockCheck>`

This will be decoded server-side before being passed to the SQL interpreter.

## How to prevent SQL injection

You can prevent most instances of SQL injection using parameterized queries instead of string concatenation within the query. These parameterized queries are also know as "prepared statements".

The following code is vulnerable to SQL injection because the user input is concatenated directly into the query:

`String query = "SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = '"+ input + "'";
Statement statement = connection.createStatement();
ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery(query);`

You can rewrite this code in a way that prevents the user input from interfering with the query structure:

`PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement("SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = ?");
statement.setString(1, input);
ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery();`

You can use parameterized queries for any situation where untrusted input appears as data within the query, including the `WHERE` clause and values in an `INSERT` or `UPDATE` statement. They can't be used to handle untrusted input in other parts of the query, such as table or column names, or the `ORDER BY` clause. Application functionality that places untrusted data into these parts of the query needs to take a different approach, such as:

* Whitelisting permitted input values.
* Using different logic to deliver the required behavior.

For a parameterized query to be effective in preventing SQL injection, the string that is used in the query must always be a hard-coded constant. It must never contain any variable data from any origin. Do not be tempted to decide case-by-case whether an item of data is trusted, and continue using string concatenation within the query for cases that are considered safe. It's easy to make mistakes about the possible origin of data, or for changes in other code to taint trusted data.

About World Laboratory of Bugtraq 2** **([WLB2](http://cxsecurity.org/ "World Laboratory of Bugtraq 2"))** *World Laboratory of Bugtraq* is a huge collection of information on data communications safety. Its main objective is to inform about errors in various applications. The **WLB** tolerance does not exclude information on errors in a configuration or other entries of this kind of dangerous operations character. One of the basic foundations of "World Laboratory of Bugtraq" is interaction with users. Each safety note, can be reported, and then verified by the **CXSecurity**. The second version of the database **WLB2**, introduces many changes from the previous version **WLB1**, acting on pages *securityreason.com*. Adding value for CVE CWE CVSS-defined entries in the database or add a new status of 'exploit' is not the only innovations in the next version of *World Laboratory of Bugtraq* **(WLB2)**. We wish you a good time. I do not believe in democracy ...CXSECURITY Team == **One** person!Support an independent blog.Let our enemy will be your enemy.Peace and respect for all.  ---   **1. Identification of safety notes** Determining the entry number in the WLB base is performed on the basis of assigning an individual number to every entry, according to the following pattern | **WLB-YYYYMMNNNN** | *where:*:  | *YYYY* | - the year in which the given data were entered into the base | | --- | --- | | *MM* | - analogically, the month | | *NNNN* | - the number which identifies a given entry in the base | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |   An example number **WLB** | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |   **WLB-2000111234** which proves that a given entry was added to the base in November, 2000. The last numbers denote the ID number the given vulnerability in the given year and month. In order to refer to a WLB number, one is allowed to use the following syntax: *https://cxsecurity.com/issue/[the number WLB]* or use a search engine [*https://cxsecurity.com/search/*](/search/)  ---   **2. Adding entries** A WLB list has no limitations concerning information on data communications safety. Everyone is allowed to send a proposal of a note to the list. Just use this form or email *submit@cxsecurity.com* Safety notes can be added automatically by moderators. ---   **3. Description specification of the note details**  | ***Topic*** | defines the topic of an vulnerability, containing general information about the software and the kind of an error. | | --- | --- | | ***Date*** | defines the year, the month, the day. The aim of this value is to inform the user when a given entry was officially made accessible. It is analogical with the Updated field, with a small difference referring to the last accepted change in a given note. | | ***Credit*** | defines the person who is the author of the given vulnerability as presented and described in the WLB safety note. | | ***Risk*** | is a variable defining the total threat which can result from a given item of information. The criterion marking one of three levels, it is possible to use that information as well as the number of machines with the defective code. | | ***Remote/Local*** | define the manner of the vulnerability utilization as each machine can be attacked form the outside or from the internal level. These are quite important parameters since they tell us about the tactical utilization of the given information. | | ***History*** | defines which changes were made into a given note, by whom and when. The dates define the time when that happened. | | ***References*** | is a field containing references to further information on a given vulnerability. One is permitted to enter references leading to the authors' web sites. | | ***Status*** | defines a part of the given information. The classification occurs on four levels:  | ***Bug*** | this informs that a note refers to the vulnerability present in a given application. Each item of information with this status states that a given vulnerability has taken place or is taking place at present. | | --- | --- | | ***Bogus*** | each item of information with this status has a task to negate the existence of the false information. The use of this status is permitted in the case of a mistake or in order to countercheck the expansion of unnecessary panic. | | ***Trick*** | all information with this status are of the character which proves a lack of cohesion among programmers, a possibility of an attack because of a bad configuration, a presentation of a new aspect of avoiding protections or (unnecessary) philosophical disputes on the theory of machine safety. | | ***Exploits*** | this informs that a note refers to the *exploit* or *PoC (Proof of Concept)* present in a given application. | | | ***CVE*** | are unique, common identifiers for publicly known information security vulnerabilities. | | ***CWE*** | is a formal list of software weakness types created to serve as a common language for describing software security weaknesses in architecture, design, or code. |   ---   **4. Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)** A list of standardized names for vulnerabilities and other information security exposures - CVE aims to standardize the names for all publicly known vulnerabilities and security exposures. **CVE is:**    **-** One standardized name for each vulnerability or exposure    **-** The way to interoperability and better security coverage    **-** A basis for evaluation among tools and databases    **-** Industry-endorsed via the CVE Editorial Board and CVE-compatible products and services   **-** Free to the public on the CVE Web site The CVE ID of a vulnerability, if available, is displayed in the "Details" tab of the WLB2 Database. Users can search the entire vulnerability database for vulnerability records matching a particular CVE Identifiers:[http://cxsecurity.com/cve/](https://cxsecurity.com/cve/) In order to refer to a CVE number, one is allowed to use the following syntax:[http://cxsecurity.com/cve/[CVE-YYYY-NNNN]](https://cxsecurity.com/cve/) To see only security alerts related with CVE:[http://cxsecurity.com/cvelist/](https://cxsecurity.com/cvelist/) [CVE COMP](https://cxsecurity.com/images/MITRE/cxsecurity_cve_certificate_of_compatibility.jpg "CXSECURITY and CVE") ---   **5. Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)** *Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)* is a formal list of software weakness types created to **-** Serve as a common language for describing software security weaknesses in architecture, design, or code.   **-** Serve as a standard measuring stick for software security tools targeting these weaknesses.   **-** Provide a common baseline standard for weakness identification, mitigation, and prevention efforts.  | ***[CWE-89](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html "CWE-89")*** | SQL injection attacks are another instantiation of injection attack, in which SQL commands are injected into data-plane input in order to effect the execution of predefined SQL commands. [See examples...](https://cxsecurity.com/cwe/CWE-89 "CWE-89 examples") | | --- | --- | | ***[CWE-79](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html "CWE-79")*** | Cross-site scripting (XSS) weakness occurs when dynamically generated web pages display input, such as login information, that is not properly validated, allowing an attacker to embed malicious scripts into the generated page and then execute the script on the machine of any user that views the site. If successful, Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities can be exploited to manipulate or steal cookies, create requests that can be mistaken for those of a valid user, compromise confidential information, or execute malicious code on the end user systems for a variety of nefarious purposes. [See examples...](https://cxsecurity.com/cwe/CWE-79 "CWE-79 examples") | | ***[CWE-119](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119.html "CWE-119")*** | A buffer overflow condition exists when a program attempts to put more data in a buffer than it can hold or when a program attempts to put data in a memory area past a buffer. In this case, a buffer is a sequential section of memory allocated to contain anything from a character string to an array of integers. [See examples...](https://cxsecurity.com/cwe/CWE-119 "CWE-119 examples") | | ***[CWE-98](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/98.html "CWE-98")*** | A PHP product uses "require" or "include" statements, or equivalent statements, that use attacker-controlled data to identify code or HTML to be directly processed by the PHP interpreter before inclusion in the script. [See examples...](https://cxsecurity.com/cwe/CWE-98 "CWE-98 examples") | | ***[CWE-548](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/548.html "CWE-548")*** | A directory listing is innapropriately exposed yielding potentially sensitive information to attackers. [See examples...](https://cxsecurity.com/cwe/CWE-548 "CWE-548 examples") | | ***[CWE-352](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/352.html "CWE-352")*** | The web product does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request. CSRF is multi-channel: 1. Attacker-to-victim (injection; external or internal channel) 2. Victim-to-server (activation; internal channel) [See examples...](https://cxsecurity.com/cwe/CWE-352 "CWE-352 examples") |   In order to refer to a CWE number, one is allowed to use the following syntax:[http://cxsecurity.com/cwe/[CWE-NNN]](https://cxsecurity.com/cwe/) CWE Dictionary is available at:[http://cxsecurity.com/allcwe/](https://cxsecurity.com/allcwe/) To see only security alerts related with CWE:[http://cxsecurity.com/cwelist/](https://cxsecurity.com/cwelist/) To find CWE, use search engine:[http://cxsecurity.com/search/](https://cxsecurity.com/search/) [CVE COMP](https://cxsecurity.com/images/MITRE/cxsecurity_cwe_certificate_of_compatibility.jpg "CXSECURITY and CWE")    --- |
