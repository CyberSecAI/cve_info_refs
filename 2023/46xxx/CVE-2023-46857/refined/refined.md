Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause of the vulnerability is an insufficient SVG asset filtering mechanism in Squidex CMS. The filtering logic fails to properly sanitize SVG files, allowing for the injection of malicious JavaScript code through specific HTML elements.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS flaw, caused by inadequate sanitization of user-supplied SVG content.
*   **Insufficient Filtering:** The SVG validation logic only checks for `<script>` tags and attributes starting with "on", but fails to consider other attack vectors such as `<iframe>` tags with "javascript:" URLs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim user's browser within the Squidex CMS site.
*   **Session Hijacking:** Attackers can steal the victim's session token from browser local storage, leading to unauthorized access and account takeover.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Authenticated users with the "assets.create" permission can upload malicious SVGs to escalate privileges.
*   **Data Theft/Manipulation:** Execution of malicious JavaScript can lead to data theft or modification within the CMS.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SVG File Upload:** Attackers upload a malicious SVG file containing a JavaScript payload through the "Upload Asset" functionality.
*   **In-Browser Rendering:** When a victim user attempts to view the uploaded SVG asset, the malicious code embedded within the SVG is executed in their browser.
*   **Exploitation Payload:** The attacker injects an `<iframe>` element with the `src` attribute set to a `javascript:` URI.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Squidex CMS web application.
*   **"assets.create" Permission:** The attacker requires the "assets.create" permission, to be able to upload assets.
*   **Knowledge of SVG and XSS:** The attacker needs knowledge of SVG structure and XSS vulnerabilities.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects all versions of Squidex prior to 7.9.0.
*   Squidex versions after 7.9.0 implement a Content Security Policy to prevent execution of JavaScript within SVG previews, mitigating this vulnerability.
*   A proof-of-concept SVG file using an iframe tag with javascript: URI has been provided.
