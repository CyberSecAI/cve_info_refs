{
  "CVE-2023-46246": {
    "Description": "The get_list_range() function, used to parse numbers for the :history and :clist command internally uses long variables to store the numbers. However function arguments are integer pointers, which can then overflow. Check that the return value from the vim_str2nr() function is not larger than INT_MAX and if yes, bail out with an error.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `get_list_range()` function uses `long` variables internally, but its arguments are integer pointers. This mismatch allows for an integer overflow when parsing numbers from the command line.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Integer Overflow"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A successful exploit can cause a denial of service (DoS).",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by using the `:history` command with an argument that causes an integer overflow.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to execute the `:history` command, typically through a local shell or by crafting a malicious script.",
    "Additional Information": "The vulnerability exists in Vim version 9.0.2067 and was fixed in version 9.0.2068. It is considered a moderate severity vulnerability with a CVSS score of 5.5. The vulnerability can lead to a heap-use-after-free."
