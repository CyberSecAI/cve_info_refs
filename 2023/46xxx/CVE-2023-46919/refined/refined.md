The provided content details a vulnerability in the "Simple HTTP Server" and "Simple HTTP Server PLUS" applications, specifically related to the use of a hard-coded cryptographic key.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the use of the hard-coded AES encryption key `aKySWb2jjrr4dzkYXczKRt7K` directly within the application's source code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Hard-coded cryptographic key: The application uses a static, hard-coded key for AES encryption. This violates the principle of using securely generated and managed keys.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data Compromise**: An attacker can decrypt data encrypted with this key.
- **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks**: Attackers can intercept and potentially modify encrypted traffic.
- **Loss of Confidentiality**: Encrypted data, whether stored or in transit, can be compromised.
- **Physical Access Risk:** An attacker with physical access to the device can potentially use app backups to extract the hardcoded key.

**Attack vectors:**
- Physical access to the application's source code or binary (e.g., through reverse engineering the APK file).
- Interception of network traffic if the key is used for encrypting data in transit.
- Extraction of the key via backup of the app.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to access and analyze the application's code or binary.
- Ability to intercept encrypted network traffic.
- Physical access to the device to perform a data backup and extract the key.

The content provides additional details beyond the standard CVE description, including code references and images. It also specifies that both the free and paid versions of the app are affected.
