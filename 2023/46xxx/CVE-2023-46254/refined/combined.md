## Description

### Summary

A bug in the RoleBinding reflector used by `capsule-proxy` gives ServiceAccount tenant owners the right to list Namespaces of other tenants backed by the same owner kind and name.

### Details

* Tenant `solar`, owned by a ServiceAccount named `tenant-owner` in the Namespace `solar`
* Tenant `wind`, owned by a ServiceAccount named `tenant-owner` in the Namespace `wind`

> Please, notice the same ServiceAccount name, although in different namespaces.

The Tenant owner `solar` would be able to list the namespaces of the Tenant `wind` and vice-versa, although this is not correct.

The bug introduces an exfiltration vulnerability since allows the listing of Namespace resources of other Tenants, although just in some specific conditions:

1. `capsule-proxy` runs with the `--disable-caching=false` (default value: `false`)
2. Tenant owners are ServiceAccount, with the same resource name, but in different Namespaces.

The CVE doesn't allow any privilege escalation on the outer tenant Namespace-scoped resources, since the Kubernetes RBAC is enforcing this.

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2023-46254

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
