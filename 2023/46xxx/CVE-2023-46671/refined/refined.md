Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** Sensitive information, including account credentials for the `kibana_system` user, API keys, and Kibana end-user credentials, may be included in Kibana logs when an error is returned from an Elasticsearch cluster. This occurs specifically when there is user interaction and the cluster is unhealthy (e.g., circuit breaker or no shard exceptions).
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The vulnerability stems from the logging mechanism in Kibana, which, under specific error conditions, can expose sensitive data within log messages.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Exposure of sensitive information like credentials and API keys can lead to unauthorized access to the Kibana system, Elasticsearch clusters, and potentially other connected resources. Attackers could use this information to perform malicious actions, including data theft, modification, or denial of service.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves triggering error conditions in Kibana through user interaction while the Elasticsearch cluster is unhealthy. The error response then causes the sensitive information to be logged.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker would need to interact with the Kibana instance to generate an error while the Elasticsearch cluster is in an unhealthy state. The attacker would require access to the Kibana logs to extract the leaked credentials.  A privileged position would not be needed to trigger the error, but it would be required to access the logs.

**Additional Information:**

*   The issue is infrequent and is most likely to occur with an unhealthy Elasticsearch cluster.
*   The vulnerability affects Kibana versions 8.0.0 to 8.11.0.
*   Kibana versions 7.x are not affected.
*   The severity of the vulnerability is rated as High with a CVSS score of 8.0 (AV:A/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).
*   The fix involves upgrading to Kibana 8.11.1.
*   Mitigation strategies include reviewing and purging existing logs, rotating credentials, and implementing a redaction pipeline to prevent future exposure in logs if the upgrade cannot be immediately performed.
