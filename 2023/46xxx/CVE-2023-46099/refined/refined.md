- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the Administration Console of SIMATIC PCS neo. This is due to the application not properly neutralizing input during web page generation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (CWE-79).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject JavaScript code into the application, which is later executed by another legitimate user. This could lead to the compromise of user sessions, data theft, or other malicious activities, with limited impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- **Attack vectors:** An adjacent attacker with high privileges can inject malicious Javascript code into the Administration Console. The attack requires user interaction (UI:R), where a legitimate user must trigger the execution of the injected code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs high privileges within the application and adjacent network access to inject the malicious Javascript code.
