GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to configure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by
Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SIMATIC PCS neo is a distributed control system (DCS).

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classification has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.first.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is specific to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually defined by the customer to accomplish final scoring.

An additional classification has been performed using the CWE classification, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identification, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2023-46096

The PUD Manager of affected products does not properly authenticate users in the PUD Manager
web service. This could allow an unauthenticated adjacent attacker to generate a privileged token and
upload additional documents.

CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function

Vulnerability CVE-2023-46097

The PUD Manager of affected products does not properly neutralize user provided inputs. This could
allow an authenticated adjacent attacker to execute SQL statements in the underlying database.

CWE

6.3
CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:L/E:P/RL:O/RC:C
CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an
SQL Command (’SQL Injection’)

Vulnerability CVE-2023-46098

When accessing the Information Server from affected products, the products use an overly permissive
CORS policy. This could allow an attacker to trick a legitimate user to trigger unwanted behavior.

CWE-942: Permissive Cross-domain Policy with Untrusted Domains

Vulnerability CVE-2023-46099

There is a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability in the Administration Console of the affected product,
that could allow an attacker with high privileges to inject Javascript code into the application that is
later executed by another legitimate user.
