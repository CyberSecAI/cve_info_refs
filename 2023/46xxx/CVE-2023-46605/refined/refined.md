Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Broken Access Control

**Root Cause:** The plugin lacks proper authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks in a function. This allows unprivileged users to execute actions that should require higher privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Broken Access Control:** The core issue is the absence of necessary access controls, which is categorized as an OWASP A5 vulnerability.
*   **Missing Authorization/Authentication:** Specific functions within the plugin are not correctly verifying user permissions before allowing actions to be performed.
*   **Lack of Nonce Token Check:** The absence of nonce tokens could make the plugin susceptible to CSRF attacks, although the primary concern is the broken access control.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An unprivileged user can execute higher privileged actions, which could lead to various impacts including, but not limited to, data modification, data deletion, or potentially complete site compromise.
*   The specific impact varies depending on the vulnerable function and what actions can be performed by a non-authorized user.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through the plugin's functionality. A malicious actor could send crafted requests to the vulnerable functions, circumventing the missing access controls.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not require any special privileges or prior authentication, meaning the vulnerability is exploitable by any visitor to the website running the vulnerable plugin.

**Additional Information**
*   The vulnerability is categorized as "Low" severity with a CVSS score of 5.3.
*   The vulnerable versions are <= 2.5 and the vulnerability is fixed in version 2.6
*   Patchstack provides a virtual patch to mitigate the issue until the plugin is updated.
