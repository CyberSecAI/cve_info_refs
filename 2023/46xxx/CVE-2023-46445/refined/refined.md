  "CVE-2023-46445": {
    "description": "An issue in AsyncSSH v2.14.0 and earlier allows attackers to control the extension info message (RFC 8308) via a man-in-the-middle attack.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a flaw in the AsyncSSH implementation that allows the injection of an attacker-chosen extension info message while deleting the original message. The injected message is accepted due to flaws in AsyncSSH.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-345",
      "CWE-349",
       "CWE-354"
    ],
    "impact": "The attacker can downgrade the algorithm used for client authentication by meddling with the value of `server-sig-algs` (e.g. use of SHA-1 instead of SHA-2). This can lead to weaker security during user authentication.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Man-in-the-middle attack at the network layer (TCP/IP)"
      ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to intercept and modify the connection's traffic."
