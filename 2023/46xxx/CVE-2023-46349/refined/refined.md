- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `productsUpdateModel::getExportIds()` method in the "Product Catalog (CSV, Excel) Export/Update" module for PrestaShop has sensitive SQL calls that can be exploited to perform SQL injection. The vulnerability lies in the improper neutralization of SQL parameters. Specifically, the code uses `pSQL()` to sanitize the input, but this is insufficient to prevent SQL injection when the input is a comma-separated list of IDs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection vulnerability (CWE-89)
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Obtain admin access
    - Remove data from the associated PrestaShop
    - Copy/paste data from sensitive tables to FRONT to expose tokens and unlock adminsâ€™s ajax scripts
    - Rewrite SMTP settings to hijack emails
- **Attack vectors:** Network
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No privileges or user interaction is required to exploit the vulnerability. An attacker can send a specially crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable endpoint.
