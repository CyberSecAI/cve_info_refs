- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `StUrls::hookActionDispatcher` and `StUrls::getInstanceId` methods in the "Urls" (sturls) module for PrestaShop contain SQL calls vulnerable to SQL injection due to improper neutralization of SQL parameters.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection (CWE-89). The module fails to properly sanitize user-provided input used within SQL queries.

- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to:
    - Obtain admin access.
    - Remove data from the associated PrestaShop database.
    - Expose sensitive data by copying it to the frontend, including tokens and admin AJAX scripts.
    - Rewrite SMTP settings to hijack emails.

- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks via HTTP requests. Specifically, a crafted request to the hook dispatcher is used. The vulnerability can be exploited with a trivial HTTP call by forging parameters.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs no privileges and no user interaction is required to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending a malicious crafted POST request.
