- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper neutralization of input during web page generation, specifically in the "Product Name" and "SKU" input fields in the Admin Panel when searching for products.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input, allowing malicious JavaScript to be injected.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute unauthorized JavaScript code in the browser of users accessing the Admin Panel. This can lead to account takeover and sensitive data exfiltration.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks by injecting malicious code into the input fields within the admin panel through a web browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the admin panel of the web application. No specific privileges are needed to exploit the vulnerability other than being a valid user. User interaction is required to trigger the exploit.
