Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `gf_avc_change_vui` function within `src/media_tools/av_parsers.c`. Specifically, the code attempts to access memory at address 0x000000000008, which is within the zero page. This occurs due to a missing null check before dereferencing the `avcc` pointer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Null Pointer Dereference:** The code does not check if the `avcc` pointer is NULL before accessing its members, leading to a null pointer dereference when a crafted or invalid bitstream is processed by `gf_avc_change_vui` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Crash (Segmentation Fault):** The null pointer dereference results in a segmentation fault (SEGV), causing the application (MP4Box) to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Input:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted media file (e.g. the provided "poc2gpac") that results in `avcc` being NULL. This file is passed to the MP4Box tool as an input.
- **File processing:** This is related to processing media files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Provide Input:** An attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious media file as input to the MP4Box tool.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided commit `4248def5d24325aeb0e35cacde3d56c9411816a6` addresses this vulnerability by adding a null check for `avcc` in the `gf_avc_change_vui` function.
- The vulnerability was identified using AddressSanitizer.
- The issue is tracked under issue number #2662
- The vulnerability was found via fuzzing and is reproducible on Ubuntu 20.04
- A PoC is available that can be used to trigger the vulnerability.

This commit addresses the issue by adding the following check at the beginning of `gf_avc_change_vui` function:

```c
if (!avcc)
    return GF_NON_COMPLIANT_BITSTREAM;
```

This check ensures that the function returns if `avcc` is NULL, preventing the null pointer dereference.
