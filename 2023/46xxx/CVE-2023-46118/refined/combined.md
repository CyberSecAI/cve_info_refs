# Denial of Service by publishing large messages over the HTTP API

Moderate

[michaelklishin](/michaelklishin)
published
GHSA-w6cq-9cf4-gqpg
Oct 23, 2023

## Package

erlang

RabbitMQ
([Erlang](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Aerlang))

## Affected versions

< 3.12.6

## Patched versions

3.12.7, 3.11.24

## Description

### Summary

Responsibly disclosed by [@NSEcho](https://github.com/NSEcho).

HTTP API did not enforce an HTTP request body limit, making it vulnerable for DoS attacks with very large messages.

### Details

An authenticated user with sufficient credentials can publish a very large messages over the HTTP API

and cause target node to be terminated by an "out-of-memory killer"-like mechanism.

A PoC was provided to Team RabbitMQ privately.

### Impact

Denial of Service

### Severity

Moderate

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
