- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The module "CSV Feeds PRO" (csvfeeds) for PrestaShop has overly permissive access control on its feeds, not requiring a password for access.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Insufficient access control allows unauthenticated users (guests) to download exported data containing personal information. Specifically, the module does not enforce password protection on feeds, allowing anyone to access CSV exports. The vulnerability is classified as CWE-359 (Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to personal information, including names, surnames, email addresses, phone numbers, and postal addresses, from the `ps_customer` and `ps_order` tables. This leads to a violation of GDPR.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker does not need any privileges or user interaction to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker only needs to be able to access the relevant URL.
