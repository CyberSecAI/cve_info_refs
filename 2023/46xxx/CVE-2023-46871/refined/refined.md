Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-46871

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a memory leak in the `NewSFDouble` function within `scenegraph/vrml_tools.c` at line 300 in GPAC. Specifically, the issue is related to how memory is allocated and potentially not freed when handling certain VRML scene graph data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Leak:** The `NewSFDouble` function allocates memory but fails to free it under certain conditions. This leads to a memory leak each time the vulnerable code path is executed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The initial report suggested that the memory leak could lead to a DoS. However, further discussion on the GitHub issue indicates that a leak of just 8 bytes is unlikely to lead to a DoS. While technically it is a resource exhaustion issue, it's likely not exploitable in a way to cause a DoS
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Repeated execution of the vulnerable code can cause a gradual increase in memory usage.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when processing a specially crafted MP4 file that causes the vulnerable code path in `scenegraph/vrml_tools.c` to be executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious MP4 file to a user who processes it with the vulnerable version of GPAC's MP4Box. This could involve social engineering, distributing malicious files, or hosting them on a website that users might access.

**Technical Details:**
- The memory leak occurs at `scenegraph/vrml_tools.c:300` within the `NewSFDouble` function, and the issue is also present in the `gf_sg_vrml_field_pointer_new` function at line 558 of the same file.
- The issue is triggered during the parsing of a crafted MP4 file that includes VRML data.
- The specific allocation that is leaked is an 8-byte memory region.
- The ASAN (AddressSanitizer) output shows the exact allocation points, indicating the call stack leading to the leak.
- Example command line: `./MP4Box -bt $poc`, where `$poc` is a path to a crafted MP4 file.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 2023-10-23, and they confirmed and fixed the issue on the same day.
- The fix was committed to the repository on 2023-10-23.
- The issue was initially reported as having a DoS impact, but further clarification indicated that it is unlikely a serious DoS risk due to the small memory leak.
- The vulnerability is present in GPAC version 2.3-DEV-rev602-ged8424300-master and earlier versions.
- The fix involves addressing the memory leak in the `NewSFDouble` function, so upgrading to a newer version will address the vulnerability.
