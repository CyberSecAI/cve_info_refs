| [@ReturnHere](https://github.com/ReturnHere) I'm sorry but leaking 8 bytes doesn't lead to a Denial of Service : [GHSA-84cp-p2p2-jfjr](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-84cp-p2p2-jfjr "GHSA-84cp-p2p2-jfjr") . That was a small memory leak that happens in a rare (if not improbable) scenario. Thanks for reporting anyway. |
