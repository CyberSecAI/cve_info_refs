Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-46998:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the improper neutralization of input during web page generation in the `bootbox.js` library. Specifically, the `alert()`, `confirm()`, and `prompt()` functions of the library use jQuery's `.html()` function (or similar methods that handle HTML), which adds content to HTML elements without sanitizing it first.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The library is vulnerable to XSS because it directly uses user-provided input to generate HTML content without sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious HTML and JavaScript code into the dialog boxes displayed by `bootbox.js`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will execute in the user's browser context.
*   **Account Takeover:** If an attacker can inject code that steals cookies or session tokens, they can potentially take over the user's account.
*   **Sensitive Data Exfiltration:** Malicious code can be used to exfiltrate sensitive data from the user's browser to a remote server.
*   **Defacement:** An attacker can modify the content of the web page by injecting arbitrary HTML.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is through the network, which means an attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low Attack Complexity:** Exploiting the vulnerability is relatively straightforward, requiring minimal effort.
*   **No Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need any special privileges or credentials to carry out the attack.
*   **User Interaction Required:** The user has to interact with the dialog box where the malicious code has been injected.
*   **Scope Changed:** The scope of the attack changes, meaning an attacker can potentially impact other parts of the application beyond the initial vulnerable component.
*   **Low Confidentiality Impact:** Impact of successful exploitation has a low impact on confidentiality.
*   **Low Integrity Impact:** Impact of successful exploitation has a low impact on integrity.
*   **No Availability Impact:** Impact of successful exploitation does not affect the availability.

**More Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability occurs because `bootbox.js` uses jQuery's `.html()` method (or similar methods) to add content to the dialog elements. This method evaluates the content, meaning that any included `<script>` tags will be executed.
*   The issue is that the message and title options of the bootbox functions (alert, confirm, prompt) accept HTML. If user-supplied data is used in these options it can lead to XSS.
*   The developers of the library have acknowledged the issue, but have chosen not to implement a fix that would sanitize the input by default, since it would be a breaking change. Instead, they recommend that developers sanitize any user-provided data before passing it to the library, and may consider adding an option to allow a sanitizer to be passed in.
*   The issue is tracked in the GitHub issue #661.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is present in `bootbox.js` versions 3.2.0 through 6.0.0.
*   There is an active discussion about this vulnerability in the GitHub repository for the project.
*   The vulnerability has been reported by multiple sources, including Snyk and Checkmarx.
