{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the OpenVPN client file upload functionality, where a crafted filename can be used to inject arbitrary shell commands.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of filenames during OpenVPN client configuration upload."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation leads to remote code execution on the affected device.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attacker uploads a malicious OpenVPN configuration file with a crafted filename via a POST request to '/api/ovpn/client/upload'.",
      "The crafted filename contains embedded shell commands, which are executed when the device processes the configuration file."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have administrative access to the GL.iNet router's web interface, specifically requiring a valid authentication token. The attacker also needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router."
  },
  "affected_products": [
    "GL.iNet GL-AR300M routers with firmware v3.216"
  ],
  "exploit_code": "The provided python script demonstrates the exploit by crafting a malicious OpenVPN configuration file where the filename itself includes a command to execute a reverse shell. It leverages the vulnerability in the file upload API, adds a new OpenVPN client with the malicious file, then connects to it to trigger the command execution."
