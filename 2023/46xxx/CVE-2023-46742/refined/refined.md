Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-46742:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The CubeFS system was logging user's secret keys and access keys when creating new users. This occurred in multiple components.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Information Exposure through log files (CWE-532):** Sensitive user credentials (secret keys and access keys) were being written to log files.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Confidentiality Breach:** A lower-privileged user who has access to the logs could retrieve the leaked secret keys and access keys.
- **Privilege Escalation / Impersonation:** With the leaked credentials, an attacker can impersonate other users, potentially gaining higher privileges than they should have.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Local Access:** An attacker needs access to the log files generated by CubeFS components, typically on the same machine or within the same system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Access to Log Files:** The attacker must have some level of access to the system and its logs where the CubeFS components log their activities.
- **Lower-Privileged User:** The attacker can be a lower-privileged user than the user whose keys are being exposed.
