Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2023-46471:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The ScriptViewer component in Yamcs does not sanitize user-provided script content for HTML tags.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the ScriptViewer.
- Lack of input sanitization for HTML tags in the script content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can embed malicious JavaScript code within a script file. When a user loads or reloads the script, the browser will execute the malicious code instead of displaying it. This can lead to various attacks, such as:
    - Stealing cookies
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim
    - Redirecting the user to a malicious website

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker can create a malicious script containing JavaScript code (e.g., an image tag with an `onerror` attribute).
- The attacker can load the malicious script file into Yamcs via ScriptViewer, or the user might save and reload the script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to upload or modify scripts within the Yamcs system.
- They also require the victim to load or reload the malicious script within the ScriptViewer.
