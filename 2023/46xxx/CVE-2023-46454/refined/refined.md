Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2023-46454:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the ability to inject arbitrary shell commands through a crafted package name within the package information functionality of GL.iNet routers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote Command Execution:** The core issue is that user-supplied input, specifically a crafted package name, is not properly sanitized and is directly incorporated into a shell command that is executed by the device.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Full System Compromise:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands on the affected router. This can lead to a full system compromise, including control of the device, data exfiltration, and manipulation of network traffic.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based attack:** The vulnerability is accessible via the network. An attacker can send crafted requests to the vulnerable API endpoint.
- **Specifically through the `get_package_info` function.**

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the GL.iNet router.
- **Authentication:** The attacker requires a valid authentication token to access the API endpoint.
- **Knowledge of API endpoint:** Attacker must know which api endpoint to send the malicious request.
