# Timing attack can leak user passwords

Moderate

## Package

github.com/cubefs/cubefs
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

< v3.3.1

## Patched versions

v3.3.1

## Description

A vulnerability was found during in the CubeFS master component that could allow an untrusted attacker to steal user passwords by carrying out a timing attack. The root case of the vulnerability was that CubeFS used raw string comparison of passwords.

The vulnerable part of CubeFS was the UserService of the master component. The UserService gets instantiated when starting the server of the master component.

CubeFS has not seen any evidence of this being exploited in the wild. The vulnerability was found during a security audit conducted by [Ada Logics](https://adalogics.com/) in collaboration with [OSTIF](https://ostif.org/) and the [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/).

The issue has been patched in v3.3.1. For impacted users, there is no other way to mitigate the issue besides upgrading.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L
