- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `server.js` file in `etcd-browser` does not validate the path for files requested via HTTP GET requests.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Directory traversal vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can retrieve local operating system files from the remote system by sending a crafted GET request. This can lead to information disclosure. If running in a Docker container, the files accessible would be those within the container.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending an HTTP GET request to the vulnerable server, including a directory traversal sequence (`/../`) in the URL path.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the remote server on the port specified during setup. No authentication or special privileges are needed.
