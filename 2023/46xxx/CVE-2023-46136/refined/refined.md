Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-46136:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content from multiple sources clearly relates to CVE-2023-46136. The NetApp advisory specifically mentions "CVE-2023-46136 Werkzeug Vulnerability in NetApp Products" and provides details about the vulnerability. The GitHub commit also references the fix for the same vulnerability.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the inefficient implementation of the multipart data parser in Werkzeug. Specifically, the code that looks for a partial boundary at the end of a data chunk is not optimized. When a large multipart part starts with a newline character (CR or LF) and contains significant data afterwards without newlines, the parser will perform a search for boundary on a continuously growing buffer, leading to excessive resource consumption.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

The vulnerability stems from the inefficient parsing logic within the `_parse_data` function in `werkzeug/sansio/multipart.py`. This allows for a slow boundary search.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation can lead to a Denial-of-Service (DoS) condition. The excessive CPU and memory consumption during the inefficient parsing can:

- Block worker processes from handling legitimate requests.
- Trigger an out-of-memory (OOM) error, potentially killing the affected process.
- Exhaust all available workers when many requests are sent concurrently.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

The attack vector is network-based. An attacker can send specially crafted multipart/form-data requests to a vulnerable endpoint. The malicious data will contain a large part starting with CR or LF character and a long sequence of data without newline characters.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

The attacker does not require any authentication or special privileges. An attacker needs to have the capability to send HTTP requests to a system running a vulnerable version of Werkzeug. The attacker can be remote as indicated by CVSS vector `AV:N`.

**Additional Technical Details (from GitHub commit):**

- The vulnerability is located in the `_parse_data` function in `src/werkzeug/sansio/multipart.py`.
- The fix involves modifying the boundary search logic, specifically the handling of newline characters and the check for partial boundaries.
- The GitHub commit message describes the issue: "Fix slow multipart parsing for large parts potentially enabling DoS attacks."
- The specific lines of code changed address the inefficient partial boundary search:
