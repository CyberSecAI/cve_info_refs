Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability** in the password change functionality of the Sourcecodester Free and Open Source inventory management system v1.0.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Incorrect Access Control:** The system does not properly validate if a user has the right to change the password of another user.
*   **Lack of Authorization Check:** The password change function allows modification of another user's password by manipulating the user ID parameter in the request, indicating missing authorization checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Account Takeover:** An attacker can change the password of an arbitrary user and gain complete control of their account.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Once the attacker gains control of the account, they can access sensitive information, modify settings, and perform actions on behalf of the victim.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The attack can be performed remotely.
*   **Manipulated HTTP Request:** The attacker manipulates the user ID parameter within the password change HTTP request.
*   **Burp Suite or Similar:** Tools like Burp Suite can be used to intercept and modify the HTTP requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to the application:** The attacker needs to be able to login to the application with any valid user account.
*   **Ability to intercept HTTP requests:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify HTTP requests using a tool such as Burp Suite.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerable functionality:** The attacker needs to know the password change functionality and that it is vulnerable to IDOR.
*   **Victim User ID:** The attacker needs to know the user ID of the target user whose password they intend to change which is easily enumerable.

**More Details than CVE Description:**

*   The provided text gives a practical step-by-step guide to reproduce the exploit, including the exact process of using Burp Suite to intercept and modify the HTTP requests.
*   It includes a video demonstration that further clarifies the vulnerability.
*   It describes the IDOR attack vector and how it's used in the context of this password change functionality.
