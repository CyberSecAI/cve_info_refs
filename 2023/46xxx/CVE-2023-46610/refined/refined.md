- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function, allowing unprivileged users to execute higher-privileged actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control, specifically missing authorization checks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user can execute actions that should be restricted to higher privileged users.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is in the WordPress plugin "Quill Forms". It is likely exploitable via HTTP requests to vulnerable functions within the plugin due to missing authorization checks. 
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a "Subscriber" (a user with minimal privileges) on the WordPress site, suggesting that they do not require any special network access or elevated privileges prior to exploitation.
