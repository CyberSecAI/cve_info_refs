Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function within the WordPress DX Delete Attached Media plugin. This allows unprivileged users to execute actions that require higher privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Broken Access Control:** The core issue is a failure to properly restrict access to specific functions or actions based on user roles or permissions. This falls under the OWASP Top 10 category of "Broken Access Control."

**Impact of Exploitation:**  The impact is described as moderately dangerous.  The specific impact of the vulnerability will vary depending on the function that is being improperly accessed, but it allows an unprivileged user to perform privileged actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability can be exploited by unprivileged users (specifically, subscribers).
* The attack vector involves directly accessing the vulnerable functions that lack proper authorization or nonce checks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be a registered user with the "subscriber" role on the WordPress website.
* No other specific capabilities or prior knowledge is mentioned beyond normal user access.

**Additional Notes:**
* The plugin is considered abandoned as it has not been updated in over a year.
* A virtual patch is available from Patchstack to mitigate the vulnerability.
* The fix is included in version 2.0.6 of the plugin.
* The vulnerability was reported by Abdi Pranata.
