Based on the provided content, here's the analysis for CVE-2023-46308:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to potential prototype pollution in plot API calls.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Prototype pollution vulnerability exists in the plot API calls of the plotly.js library. This type of vulnerability arises when an attacker can manipulate the properties of an object's prototype, potentially affecting all objects that inherit from that prototype.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could lead to a variety of impacts, potentially including denial of service, unexpected behavior, or even remote code execution depending on how the application utilizes the polluted prototype. The specific impact would depend on how the library is used in the application and what properties are manipulated.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves manipulating plot API calls, suggesting that a user-controlled input to these API calls could trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need to be able to influence the parameters passed to plot API calls in order to inject malicious data that can cause the prototype pollution.
- This could be possible through malicious input to a web application that uses plotly.js.
- The attacker would likely need to be able to control the properties being set in these API calls.

**Additional Notes:**

- The fix was implemented in pull requests #6703 and #6704.
- The information is more detailed than the standard CVE description. The CVE description mentions prototype pollution without detailing where it exists.
