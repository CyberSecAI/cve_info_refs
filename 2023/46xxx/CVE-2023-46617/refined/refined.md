- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress AdFoxly plugin, in versions 1.8.5 and earlier, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin lacks sufficient CSRF protection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force higher privileged users to perform unwanted actions while they are authenticated.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted request triggered by a victim user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in, higher-privileged user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious page that triggers the forged request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
