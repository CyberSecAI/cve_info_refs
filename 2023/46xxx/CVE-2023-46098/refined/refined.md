- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The affected products use an overly permissive CORS policy when accessing the Information Server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: An overly permissive CORS policy.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can trick a legitimate user to trigger unwanted behavior, potentially leading to a compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to be adjacent to the target network and trick a user to trigger the unwanted behavior, possibly through a malicious website or application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be adjacent to the target network, and they require the ability to trick a user to interact with a malicious resource. The user needs to perform an action (user interaction is required).
