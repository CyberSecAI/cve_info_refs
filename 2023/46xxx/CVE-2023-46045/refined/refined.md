Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-46045:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read in Graphviz, specifically within the `gvplugin_install` function. This function is called with an invalid API value (-1), which leads to the out-of-bounds read and crash.
- The invalid API value is a result of parsing a crafted `config6a` file, causing `gvplugin_api` to return -1. This return value isn't correctly handled leading to an access outside the bounds of the `api` array.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Out-of-bounds Read:** The core weakness is that the `gvplugin_install` function doesn't validate its `api` parameter, leading to an out-of-bounds read when called with an invalid API value, specifically -1 which is returned by `gvplugin_api`.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The parsing logic for the `config6a` file allows for invalid data that results in the invalid `api` value.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The immediate impact of the vulnerability is a segmentation fault (SEGV) which crashes the Graphviz application `osage` as well as `dot` preventing its normal operation.
- The initial report suggested a potential for remote code execution, but that was later corrected to an out-of-bounds read resulting in a crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Crafted config6a file:** An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted `config6a` file that, when parsed, triggers the out-of-bounds read in `gvplugin_install`. This `config6a` is generally a root owned file.
- The vulnerability is triggered when a Graphviz tool like `osage` is run and it loads the crafted config file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to modify or replace the `config6a` file on the target system which is typically owned by root. This is not considered "hard to exploit" but does require elevated permissions to modify a system file.
- The attacker also needs to have the ability to execute a graphviz tool such as `osage` or `dot`.

**Additional details:**

- The issue was introduced in Graphviz 2.36 and fixed in 10.0.1. Affected versions are [2.36, 10.0.1).
- The initial CVE description was inaccurate, mentioning a buffer overflow when the issue was an out-of-bounds read.
- The CVE was created without consulting the graphviz maintainers and they are not planning to contest the CVE itself but may contest the inaccuracies.
