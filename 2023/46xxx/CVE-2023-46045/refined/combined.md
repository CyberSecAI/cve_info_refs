More specifically, this issue is an out-of-bounds read.

AFAICT the issue was actually introduced in Graphviz 2.36. It was fixed
in commit a95f977f5d809915ec4b14836d2b5b7f5e74881e (essentially
reverting cf95714837f06f684929b54659523c2c9b1fc19f that introduced the
issue), but there has been no release yet since then. The next release
will be 10.0.0. So affected versions would be [2.36, 10.0.0).
```

```
To exploit this issue, you need to modify a typically-root-owned file. I
am not suggesting it is hard to exploit, but see my remarks below.

Why was this issue gifted a CVE? If you want an out-of-bounds access in
Graphviz, there is much lower hanging fruit.
```

```
As Alan Coopersmith has noted in a separate thread,¹ this stream of
issues seems to have been bulk-created without much analysis. The CVE
details still appear to be RESERVED in NVD. The Graphviz maintainers do
not intend to contest this CVE, but I expect the details to be
inaccurate when released as I’ve noted above.

The CVE in question is CVE-2023-46045. MITRE still shows it as RESERVED
but many downstream trackers already have the details.

Whether this has a security impact or not is environment specific. So
I’m inclined to be conservative and leave it. Though the affected
versions are wrong, which is going to impact downstream triage, so we’ll
have to contest that.

The Graphviz project doesn’t generally request CVEs. Though sometimes
third parties request CVEs against Graphviz. We’re usually fine with
that; if someone wants a CVE to track, OK. These third parties rarely
(never?) consult with us before requesting. So Graphviz commit messages
and changelogs almost never mention CVEs, because we’re not aware of
them at the time.

The fix for this ended up landing in Graphviz 10.0.1, available at
<https://graphviz.org/download/>.
```

```
Details of this CVE (CVE-2023-46045) are now published, but the CPEs are
incomplete. For those who track such things, the affected range is
[2.36.0, 10.0.1).

# Possible SEGV (buffer overflow) in libgvc

## Steps to reproduce

1. Replace `config6a` with the attached (corrupted) version: [config6a](/-/project/4207231/uploads/3507e16e0e02fb528b2e7b9501843aa4/config6a)
2. Run `osage`

## Expected Behaviour

Graceful exit or recovery.

## Actual Behaviour

Segmentation Fault.

## OS Version

`Linux Ubuntu 23.04.`

## Graphviz Version

`dot - graphviz version 2.43.0 (0)`

## Additional info

The problem appears to occur [here](https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/blob/d7cf5938729d1167922d464f15ed02503a1dc1a8/lib/gvc/gvconfig.c#L193):

```
	    api = token(&nest, &s);
	    gv_api = gvplugin_api(api);               // If api is invalid then gv_api=-1
	    do {
                    ...
                    // This function does not expect -1 and will crash (buffer overflow):
		    bool rc = gvplugin_install(gvc, gv_api, type, quality, package, NULL);
                    ...
