```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the filepath parameter when downloading attachments.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Arbitrary File Download: The application allows the user to specify the file path when downloading attachments, without proper validation, allowing for directory traversal using `../../` sequences.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can download arbitrary files from the server, potentially exposing sensitive information such as configuration files, source code, or system files.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the attachment management functionality where a user can upload a file and then use a modified filepath parameter during the download to access any file on the server's filesystem that the application has access to. This can be done by intercepting the download request with a proxy such as Burp Suite and changing the filepath parameter to point to the desired location.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to access the attachment management functionality and to be able to intercept the HTTP request, this could mean they have authenticated access to the web application or that the vulnerable component is exposed without authentication."
