Due to inadequate code logic, a previously unauthenticated threat actor could potentially obtain a local Windows OS user token through the FactoryTalk® Services Platform web service and then use the token to log in into FactoryTalk® Services Platform . This vulnerability can only be exploited if the authorized user did not previously log in into the FactoryTalk® Services Platform web service.
