{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Heap-buffer-overflow in the `str2ulong` function within the `avilib.c` file.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The `str2ulong` function does not properly handle long strings, leading to a heap-buffer-overflow when parsing an input file with a crafted string."
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability can cause crashes and potential code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafted input files containing long strings that trigger the overflow in `str2ulong` through the `avi_parse_input_file` function. This function is called when opening an AVI file."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted input file to the `MP4Box` tool."
