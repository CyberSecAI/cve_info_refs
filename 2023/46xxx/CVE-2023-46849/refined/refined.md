{
  "CVE-2023-46849": {
    "Description": "The OpenVPN 2.6 codebase, used in OpenVPN Access Server, has a vulnerability where the `--fragment` option can lead to a division by zero error.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Use of the --fragment option in OpenVPN can lead to a division by zero error.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Division by zero error"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "The vulnerability can cause the `openvpn` daemon to crash or segfault.",
    "Attack vectors": "Exploiting the vulnerability requires using the `--fragment` option, which can potentially be triggered under certain circumstances.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to influence OpenVPN configurations to enable the `--fragment` option, and the specific circumstances that trigger the division by zero error.",
    "Additional details": "The vulnerability is not easily exploitable on OpenVPN Access Server by default because it does not include the `--fragment` option in its default configurations, and the control channel security makes it harder to exploit."
  },
  "CVE-2023-46850": {
    "Description": "The OpenVPN 2.6 codebase, used in OpenVPN Access Server, has a vulnerability involving incorrect use of the send buffer which can cause memory to be sent to a peer.",
     "Root cause of vulnerability": "Incorrect use of the send buffer in OpenVPN 2.6",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Use-after-free memory security issue",
       "Potential memory disclosure"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "The vulnerability has the potential for leaking sensitive information from memory.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is related to how the send buffer is used, although specific details on how to trigger this is not provided in the text.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to trigger the use of the send buffer in a way that causes the memory disclosure.",
     "Additional details": "This vulnerability is considered more serious because it could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information."
