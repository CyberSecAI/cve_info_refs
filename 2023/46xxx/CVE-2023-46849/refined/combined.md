FAQs

A few of the most common questions we're asked.

What are connections and how are they different than users?

A company has 100 employees, each with one work laptop. 50% are remote on a given day and 50% come to the office per a hybrid work model.

In this case, some of our competitors will charge this company for 100 users.

However, with Access Server this company would only need to purchase a 50-connection subscription because only 50% of the workforce will need a connection at a specific time.

Do I need a credit card to try OpenVPN Products?

No. We do not ask for credit card information when you try our products for free with up to three connections\*. [Create an account](https://openvpn.net/product-select).

Is there a limit to the number of devices or users?

You can add as many devices and users as you like, but only the subscribed number of concurrent connections can be in use at any point in time.

Can I purchase between 2 and 10 connections?

Yes, we now offer a 5-connection subscription plan.

What if I don’t know how many concurrent connections my company needs?

No problem. Our billing system allows you to scale the number of connections up or down, on demand, and changes are effective immediately.

I need more than 500 connections. Who should I contact?

We offer custom connection packages of 500 and above. To discuss your options, please contact us at sales@openvpn.net.

How do I cancel a subscription?

You can cancel your subscription at any time and unused funds will be credited to your account for future usage. For refunds, contact sales@openvpn.net.

Does OpenVPN have a referral program?

Yes! Earn $50 when you purchase your first subscription using a friend's referral link. Better yet, [sign up for the Referral Program](https://affiliate.openvpn.com/signup/27008) in seconds and earn $50 every time you refer a friend with your unique link.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2023-e4df33666c
2023-11-29 01:27:58.698482
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : openvpn
Product : Fedora 38
Version : 2.6.8
Release : 1.fc38
URL : <https://community.openvpn.net/>
Summary : A full-featured TLS VPN solution (beta release)
Description :
OpenVPN is a robust and highly flexible tunneling application that uses all
of the encryption, authentication, and certification features of the
OpenSSL library to securely tunnel IP networks over a single UDP or TCP
port. It can use the Marcus Franz Xaver Johannes Oberhumers LZO library
for compression.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

This is an extended update of the OpenVPN 2.6.7 release which contains security
fixes for CVE-2023-46849 and CVE-2023-46850. That release had a regression
causing the `openvpn` daemon to segfault frequently; which is why the 2.6.7
release was pulled. This 2.6.8 release contains a fix for the regression issue
as well.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ChangeLog:

\* Mon Nov 20 2023 David Sommerseth davids@openvpn.net - 2.6.8-1
- Update to upstream OpenPVN 2.6.7
- Fixes a regression from 2.6.7 resulting in a SIGSEGV (GitHub#449)
\* Thu Nov 9 2023 David Sommerseth davids@openvpn.net - 2.6.7-1
- Update to upstream OpenVPN 2.6.7
- Fixes CVE-2023-46849, CVE-2023-46850
- Fix false exit status on pre runtime scriptlet (Elkhan Mammadli elkhan@almalinux.org, RHBZ#2239722)
- Fix regression of systemctl scriptlet globbing issues (RHBZ#1887984); reintroduced in openvpn-2.6.0-1

Add additional security

### Customize the authentication of your OpenVPN Access Server

You can add additional authentication criteria when users connect to your VPN server with custom code in the Python programming language. These can be used for one-time password systems, group mapping, and adding additional security checks by registering hardware devices.

[Duo 2FA](https://openvpn.net/as-docs/duo-2fa.html) Integrate your server with Duo’s two-factor authentication solution
[SAML Group Mapping](https://openvpn.net/as-docs/saml-group-mapping.html) Make automatic group assignments based on identity provider (IdP) configuration
[LDAP Group Mapping](https://openvpn.net/as-docs/ldap-group-mapping.html) Assign users in particular LDAP groups to groups in OpenVPN Access Server automatically
[RADIUS Group Mapping](https://openvpn.net/as-docs/radius-group-mapping.html) Translate RADIUS groups into Access Server groups to automatically apply access control settings
[Hardware Address Registration](https://openvpn.net/as-docs/hardware-address-registration.html) Create an additional security check by registering MAC addresses and UUID when devices connect
[Custom Authentication System](https://openvpn.net/as-docs/custom-authentication-system.html) Integrate Access Server with your custom authentication system completely by starting with our script outline
[LastPass 2FA](https://openvpn.net/as-docs/lastpass-2fa.html) Integrate your server with LastPass’s two-factor authentication solution

## Strengthen the security of your VPN server

FEDORA-2023-d9d55a0bfc
2023-11-23 01:22:58.936150
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : openvpn
Product : Fedora 39
Version : 2.6.8
Release : 1.fc39
URL : <https://community.openvpn.net/>
Summary : A full-featured TLS VPN solution (beta release)
Description :
OpenVPN is a robust and highly flexible tunneling application that uses all
of the encryption, authentication, and certification features of the
OpenSSL library to securely tunnel IP networks over a single UDP or TCP
port. It can use the Marcus Franz Xaver Johannes Oberhumers LZO library
for compression.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

This is an extended update of the OpenVPN 2.6.7 release which contains security
fixes for CVE-2023-46849 and CVE-2023-46850. That release had a regression
causing the `openvpn` daemon to segfault frequently; which is why the 2.6.7
release was pulled. This 2.6.8 release contains a fix for the regression issue
as well.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\* Mon Nov 20 2023 David Sommerseth davids@openvpn.net - 2.6.8-1
- Update to upstream OpenPVN 2.6.7
- Fixes a regression from 2.6.7 resulting in a SIGSEGV (GitHub#449)
\* Thu Nov 9 2023 David Sommerseth davids@openvpn.net - 2.6.7-1
- Update to upstream OpenVPN 2.6.7
- Fixes CVE-2023-46849, CVE-2023-46850

# Tutorial: Update Your Access Server Version

Abstract

How to keep Access Server updated to the latest version. We recommend running the latest version for best security practices.

## Overview

This tutorial provides detailed information on updating and upgrading Access Server.

The Access Server software is distributed via our software repository, which is used in all our containers, virtual machines, cloud images, etc. Using a software repository allows the operating system's native software package management tools to handle installation and upgrades of programs such as Access Server.

The official OpenVPN software repository enhances the user experience for installing and upgrading Access Server. The following will give you instructions for adding the repository to a new installation, adding it to an existing server to upgrade, using Linux to automatically update Access Server, updating Access Server without updating all other Linux packages, and preventing Access Server from automatically updating.

This tutorial steps you through the most common situation: Updating Access Server with the install script on the [Access Server Portal](https://as-portal.openvpn.com/instructions).

Refer to the optional sections below if you have a different situation.

For a related resource, we have a video that shows you [how to update Access Server to the latest version](/as-docs/videos/video--update-as.html).

[## Before you begin](#before-you-begin-115518_body)[### Backup your settings](#backup-your-settings_body)

Use [these backup commands on the command line](tutorial--configuration-backup.html "Tutorial: How to Back Up Access Server Configuration") to completely back up your settings without stopping your server. The information stored in Access Server (e.g., server and client certificates) is unique and cannot be replaced. If you haven't already done so, we recommend setting up automated backup tasks.

[### Check server compatibility](#check-server-compatibility_body)

The current version of Access Server is very compatible with past versions. You can update versions as described here back to 1.7.1. If needed, Access Server leaves a copy of old data in this directory whenever you upgrade: **/usr/local/openvpn\_as/etc/backup**.

[### Check client compatibility](#check-client-compatibility_body)

Some cases may exist where older client software can't connect to a modern Access Server. To fix this, simply update to a more recent client software version. If that isn't possible, you may lower Access Server's security requirements. It may be that an upgraded Access Server has the minimum required TLS security level set to a higher version, causing an issue with older clients. You can change this for your server:

1. Sign in to the Admin Web UI.
2. Click **Configuration > TLS Settings**.
3. Set the **OpenVPN daemons** to TLS 1.0.
4. Click **Save Settings** and **Update Running Server**.
[### Understand Amazon AWS tiered instance licensing](#understand-amazon-aws-tiered-instance-licensing_body)

If you have an Amazon AWS tiered instance pre-licensed with âxx connected devices,â you donât need to worry about licenses. Amazonâs licensing and billing systems take care of them internally. Simply upgrade the Access Server package itself.

[## Step 1: Copy the install script](#step-1--copy-the-install-script_body)

1. Sign in to the [Access Server Portal](https://as-portal.openvpn.com/).
2. Click **Install Access Server**.
3. Copy the bash install command.
[## Step 2: Update the openvpn-as package](#step-2--update-the-openvpn-as-package_body)

We recommend keeping your Linux operating system updated. The built-in package manager program makes it easy to retrieve and install updates.

### Tip

We recommend regularly updating your Linux operating system and software.

1. Connect to your Access Server console how you prefer: bash, SSH, PuTTY, etc.
2. Gain root privileges. For example:

   ```
   sudo su
   ```
3. Paste the bash command and run it.

   * "Welcome to the OpenVPN Access Server Installation Script!" displays and starts the installation.
   * The script detects your Linux distribution and Access Server version.
   * If the current installation is pinned, the script temporarily ignores that and upgrades anyway. After this, the **openvpn-as** package is pinned again
   * After the **openvpn-as** package upgrades, the script checks for [OpenVPN DCO](/as-docs/openvpn-data-channel-offload.html) and installs or upgrades as necessary.

     ### Tip

     Refer to [Tutorial: Turn on OpenVPN DCO](tutorial--turn-on-openvpn-dco.html "Tutorial: Turn on OpenVPN DCO") for more about performance improvements with OpenVPN DCO.
4. Reboot the server:

   ```
   reboot
   ```
   * If all went well, your Access Server and your Linux system are now up to date.
### Tip

We provide detailed installation guides for the different platforms available. Refer to these [installation guides](/as-docs/installation.html) for steps.

[## Option: Add the repository and upgrade an existing Access Server](#option--add-the-repository-and-upgrade-an-existing-access-server_body)

If you don't want to use our official installation script, you can install Access Server using our official repository:

1. Sign in to the [Access Server portal](https://myaccount.openvpn.com/signin?explicitProductSelect=true&product=as) on our site.
2. Click **Install Access Server**.
3. Click **More information and troubleshooting**.

   ![more-information-and-troubleshooting.png](/as-docs/tutorials/image/uuid-294e0e90-8700-f6e1-31f7-672b61d23d79.png)
4. Open **Situation: I don't want to use your Linux installation script; how can I install it manually?**
5. Select your Linux OS.
6. Copy the commands to add the repository and install the **openvpn-as** package.
7. Run the commands on your server.

We provide detailed [installation guides](/as-docs/installation.html) for the different platforms available. Refer to these installation guides for steps.

[## Upgrading an existing Access Server](#upgrading-an-existing-access-server_body)

Access Server is compatible with these 64-bit Linux operating systems:

| Ubuntu\* | 24.04 LTS (x86\_64 and ARM64)  22.04 LTS (x86\_64 and ARM64)  20.04 LTS (x86\_64 and ARM64) |
| --- | --- |
| Debian | 12  11 |
| Red Hat Enterprise Linux | 9  8 |

### Note

\*For Ubuntu, we only support long-term support (LTS) releases.

If your operating system is listed above, you can upgrade your existing Access Server with our installation script. If not possible, you can use our official repository.

### Note

If your operating system is older than those we have listed, you may need to consider updating your whole system or migrating to an updated system and installing Access Server using our installation script. Installing Access Server on an older platform than it was designed for will result in failure.

[## Updating Access Server with Linux OS updates](#updating-access-server-with-linux-os-updates_body)

We recommend keeping your Linux operating system updated. With the built-in package manager program, itâs easy to retrieve updates and install them. We recommend doing this regularly to keep up with security fixes. To do so, run these commands when logged on to the Access Server as a root user:

**Ubuntu and Debian**

```
apt update
apt upgrade
```

**RedHat**

```
yum check-update
yum update
```

These commands update packages within the version of your operating system. If your Access Server uses our software repository, it will also upgrade the Access Server and bundled OpenVPN Connect apps if there are newer versions.

These commands will not upgrade your Linux OS, such as from Ubuntu 18.04 LTS to Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. Such a large upgrade is called a distribution upgrade. Refer to [Tutorial: How to Migrate an Access Server Installation](tutorial--migrating-access-server.html "Tutorial: How to Migrate an Access Server Installation").

If you use a fixed license key, a distribution upgrade could break it. [Contact us for help](https://support.openvpn.com/).

[## Updating Access Server if you're already using the repository](#updating-access-server-if-you-re-already-using-the-repository_body)

If you have Access Server 2.7.5 or higher, itâs likely you are using our repository. When we release a new version of Access Server on our website and to the repository, you should be able to install it easily.

1. Update and upgrade packages when you update your operating system with these commands:

   **Ubuntu and Debian:**

   ```
   apt update
   apt upgrade
   ```

   **RedHat**

   ```
   yum check-update
   yum update
   ```
2. After the updates are complete, reboot the server:

   ```
   reboot
   ```
   * If all went well, your Access Server and your Linux system are now up to date.
### Important

If you are running an instance of Access Server on a cloud image (AWS, Google, DigitalOcean, or Azure), we have pinned the openvpn-as package, which prevents your Ubuntu server from including it in updates with the commands above.

[## Preventing Access Server updates](#preventing-access-server-updates_body)

Once you have added the Access Server software repository to your system, any time you run the commands to update your operating system, it will also pull in the new Access Server release and bundled connect clients, if there are any. For cloud images (Google, Azure,Â AWS, and DigitalOcean), ESXi, and HyperV appliances, we have pinned the **openvpn-as** package so that the Access Server program doesn't update when you install operating system updates.

We have done this to avoid a sudden change in process. Past versions of Access Server stayed at their currently installed version number when people ran operating system updates. We did not want to surprise a system administrator with a new Access Server version just by performing security updates.

You can change that by unpinning it, and repin if youâd like with these commands.

1. Unpin the **openvpn-as** package:

   ```
   apt-mark unhold openvpn-as
   ```
2. Repin the **openvpn-as** package:

   ```
   apt-mark hold openvpn-as
   ```

If you use our official installation script to perform an update of the Access Server, the script will detect if the **openvpn-as** package is on hold or not:

* If the package is marked **hold**, the script will unpin it and proceed with the update. Once the update is finished, it will put the **openvpn-as** package on **hold** again.
* If the package is marked **unhold**, the script will proceed with the update. Once the update is finished, it will put the **openvpn-as** package on **hold**.
[## Option: Use the package installer files to upgrade](#option--use-the-package-installer-files-to-upgrade_body)

Linux programs are installed as packages from a software repository or a separately downloaded and installed file. We recommend using our official repository. We also continue to support Access Server as software package files that can be downloaded and installed separately.

Beginning with Access Server 2.7.5, we have split the program into two pieces:

1. Access Server bundled OpenVPN Connect software for Windows and macOS.
2. The Access Server program itself.

You must install both packages. You can find manual installation steps in this troubleshooting guide:

* [Troubleshooting an Access Server Installation](/as-docs/installation-troubleshooting.html)
[## Option: Upgrade Access Servers in a cluster setup](#option--upgrade-access-servers-in-a-cluster-setup_body)

An Access Server cluster relies on a central database system to store user, certificate, and configuration information. Some settings, like which interface to listen on and how to connect to the central database, remain locally on each cluster node. This section walks you through upgrading an Access Server cluster while minimizing downtime and disruptions.

### Before you begin

1. Back up your data, both the central and local databases:

   1. Use the `mysqldump` tool to create a backup of the data stored in the cluster's central database. This ensures you have a copy of critical data if something goes wrong during the upgrade.
   2. After backing up the central database, refer to the [Tutorial: How to Back Up Access Server Configuration](tutorial--configuration-backup.html "Tutorial: How to Back Up Access Server Configuration") for details on backing up the local configuration stored in the **config\_local.db** file on each node.
2. Ensure version consistency. All nodes must run on the same version. It's important that as you upgrade, all nodes eventually match the same new version.
### Steps for a rolling upgrade

These steps walk you through upgrading nodes one at a time.

1. Begin upgrading your Access Server nodes one by one. This is called a **rolling upgrade**, and it ensures the entire cluster is never fully down.
2. Take the first node down for maintenance and upgrade it to the new version.

   * During this process, clients connected to the node being upgraded may experience temporary disconnects but should automatically reconnect to the next available node.
3. Repeat this process for each node in your cluster.

   * Verify that all nodes are correctly upgraded and functioning as expected.
### Test connectivity

* Verify that the cluster functions as expected and clients can connect and use services without issues.
[### Example cluster upgrade procedure](#example-cluster-upgrade-procedure_body)

Let's assume we have two nodes in our cluster:

1. Stop services on both nodes with the below command:

   ```
   service openvpnas stop
   ```
2. Upgrade Node1. Use the installation script or the official repository.

   * The **openvpnas** services will be started automatically.
3. Upgrade Node2. Use the installation script or the official repository.

   * No need to start the services here. After the upgrade, the services will be started automatically.
4. Following this order will allow migrating DB (changing its structure) properly with an upgrade.
[## Option: Upgrade a failover setup](#option--upgrade-a-failover-setup_body)
### Warning

Before you begin, ensure that you backup the main node in the master state. Use these [backup commands on the command line](tutorial--configuration-backup.html "Tutorial: How to Back Up Access Server Configuration").

Access Server has a built-in failover mode you can deploy on your local LAN network. It allows one primary node to handle all tasks, with a secondary standby node. The secondary node comes online automatically, taking over all tasks if your primary node fails. This is done using a method called UCARP, which uses VRRP heartbeat network packets. For more details, refer to [Tutorial: How To Set Up Failover Mode](tutorial--failover.html "Tutorial: How To Set Up Failover Mode").

### Important

Keep both Access Server nodes updated with the same versions. We also recommend following a specific upgrade procedure to avoid triggering the failover unnecessarily. This should also ensure that you can easily restore connectivity if anything goes wrong with the upgrade.

1. Use the following command to determine the active node for making a backup:

   ```
   grep "Switching to state:" /var/log/openvpnas.log |tail -n1
   ```
   * If you see`Â [WARNING] Switching to state: MASTER`Â â you are on the active node. Make your backup here.
   * If you seeÂ `[WARNING] Switching to state: BACKUP`Â â you are on the standby node. Go to the other node and re-check if it's active.

     ### Note

     In our example, the primary node is MASTER and the secondary node is BACKUP.
2. Shut down the (virtual) machine that is acting as BACKUP. In our case, this is the secondary node.
3. Stop the primary node's Access Server service:

   ```
   service openvpnas stop
   ```
4. Upgrade the software on the primary node.

   * To upgrade using our installation script, follow the steps under ???.
   * To upgrade using the repository, follow the steps under [Updating Access Server if you're already using the repository](tutorial--update-access-server.html#updating-access-server-if-you-re-already-using-the-repository "Updating Access Server if you're already using the repository").
   * To upgrade using the package installer, follow the steps under ???.
5. Validate everything works on your updated primary node. Access Server should have started automatically after the upgrade, but if it didn't, run `service openvpnas start`.
6. After testing the primary node, bring the failover node online and perform the same upgrade steps.

   ### Note

   The failover node won't actually do anything while the primary node is online, so you can now safely upgrade it to the latest version.
7. After completing the failover node upgrade, wait ten minutes for a configuration update from your primary node before testing the failover functionality.

   * At a reasonable time, we recommend testing to see if the failover system is working correctly. To do this, take the primary node down and check to see that your connections and Admin Web UI work as expected.
### Tip

If something goes wrong with the upgrade process of the primary node, we recommend you gather log file information andÂ contact us with our support ticket system. Then, take the primary node offline. Once it is offline, bring the failover node online. It should start up as the old system it was and take over and handle connections. This keeps your clients up and running while you look into the problem on the primary node. Once issues are diagnosed and resolved, you can bring the primary node back up, take the failover node offline, and perform the upgrade steps outlined above.

[## Option: Rolling back to a previous version](#option--rolling-back-to-a-previous-version_body)
### Important

We recommend [contacting support](https://support.openvpn.com/hc/en-us) if you need to roll back due to difficulties. We can help out.

When Access Server detects an older version of its databases, it may automatically update them during startup. In cluster setups, this also affects the central databases. These updates occasionally cause incompatibilities with older Access Server versions if you need to roll back.

### Steps to roll back and restore databases:

### Important

Use the steps below for SQLite 3 as the database backend.

If you're using MySQL, only the last step â using a backup tool like `mysqldump` â applies to you.

1. Always create a [backup](tutorial--downgrade.html#step-1--create-a-backup-of-your-current-configuration "Step 1: Create a backup of your current configuration") of the local and central databases before upgrading.
2. If you roll back to an older version of Access Server, [restore the databases](tutorial--downgrade.html#step-3--restore-the-configuration-backup "Step 3: Restore the configuration backup") from the backup created before the upgrade.
3. Use your backup tools (such as `mysqldump`) to restore the central and local databases to their pre-upgrade state.
### Downgrade Access Server

We recommend running the latest version, but if you need to downgrade to an older version, refer to this tutorial:

* [Tutorial: Downgrade Access Server](tutorial--downgrade.html "Tutorial: Downgrade Access Server")
[## Option: Replace the entire appliance or cloud image](#option--replace-the-entire-appliance-or-cloud-image_body)

If your appliance or cloud image is outdated or your system runs on an unsupported operating system, we recommend installing a fresh Access Server version. Here's how you can perform the migration or reinstallation:

1. Follow the [Tutorial: How to Migrate an Access Server Installation](tutorial--migrating-access-server.html "Tutorial: How to Migrate an Access Server Installation") to back up your system and configuration files, including all settings and your subscription license.
2. Install a new Linux OS and Access Server on a separate system while keeping your old system running.
3. Once the new system is set up, [restore](tutorial--recover-with-backup-files.html#UUID-6f9890f1-3e61-b5b9-64a0-4ea15e9338dd_UUID-def726f8-b959-0cc1-baf0-9f23f5e6a4e7) your configuration, data, and subscription license from the backup to the new Access Server.
4. Before switching to the new server, test it out.
5. Finally, switch to the new system and decommission the old server.
[## Service Notice: Perpetual license keys](#service-notice--perpetual-license-keys_body)

If you have a perpetual license key purchased prior to 2013, you must purchase a new subscription to upgrade your Access Server instance. All Access Server license keys purchased since 2013 are standard license keys, not perpetual.

OpenVPN strictly adheres to the original terms under which we sold perpetual licenses. One of those terms was that neither support nor upgrades were allowed when the license keyâs support term expired. A perpetual license key will not work on an Access Server higher than version 1.8.4.

## Description:

OpenVPN Access Server uses the OpenVPN 2 codebase at its core for VPN connections. OpenVPN Access Server versions 2.11.0, 2.11.1, 2.11.2, 2.11.3, 2.12.0, and 2.12.1 contain a copy of OpenVPN 2.6 that has two vulnerabilities in it. The first is a division by zero crash, the second a use after free memory security issue.

The division by zero crash is not very easily exploitable on Access Server because the default configuration that it comes with does not include the âfragment option, and control channel security helps to make it harder to exploit. It is however possible that people use the âfragment option, and under certain circumstances it is still possible to trigger this crash. The use after free memory security issue is a more serious one as there is the potential for leaking sensitive information from memory.

We therefore strongly recommend that if you use OpenVPN Access Server 2.11.0, 2.11.1, 2.11.2, 2.11.3, 2.12.0, or 2.12.1, that you upgrade to the latest version of Access Server to address these vulnerabilities. Version 2.12.2 and newer contain the fix for these vulnerabilities.

## Resolution:

Update your OpenVPN Access Server to the latest version as soon as possible, which contains the fixes for these vulnerabilities. Version 2.12.2 and newer contain the fix for these vulnerabilities. The procedure on how to upgrade Access Server can be found here: [Keeping OpenVPN Access Server Updated](https://openvpn.net/vpn-server-resources/keeping-openvpn-access-server-updated/). The CVEs we published for this are [CVE-2023-46849](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-46849) and [CVE-2023-46850](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-46850).

## Frequently asked questions

### How do I connect to OpenVPN?

In order to connect to the VPN server or service, you need to obtain a file that contains the specifics needed for the connection. Such a configuration file is called a profile and has an .ovpn file extension.

If your business is using Access Server or CloudConnexa and your IT department has provided you a URL, you can directly import the profile by entering the URL.

![](https://openvpn.net/wp-content/themes/openvpn/assets/images/client-import-url@2x.jpg)

However, if you have received the profile as a file from your IT department or from some other OpenVPN compatible service, you can import the profile by selecting the file.

### How do I connect if the OpenVPN client is integrated into my router?

In order to connect to the VPN server or service, you need to obtain a file that contains the specifics needed for the connection. Such a configuration file is called a profile and has an .ovpn file extension.

After receiving the .ovpn file from you IT department, you need to follow instructions specific to the router to extract specific information from the file and use it for configuration. We have made guides for some of the common firmware used in hardware routers and for pfSense:

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.
