- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The module "Manufacturer or supplier alphabetical search" (idxrmanufacturer) for PrestaShop contains SQL injection vulnerabilities due to improper neutralization of SQL parameters in the `IdxrmanufacturerFunctions::getCornersLink`, `IdxrmanufacturerFunctions::getManufacturersLike` and `IdxrmanufacturerFunctions::getSuppliersLike` methods. These methods make sensitive SQL calls that can be exploited with a trivial HTTP call.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection (CWE-89)
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Obtain admin access
    - Remove data from the associated PrestaShop
    - Copy/paste data from sensitive tables to the front end to expose tokens and unlock admin's ajax scripts
    - Rewrite SMTP settings to hijack emails
- **Attack vectors**: Network
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No privileges or user interaction are required. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability via a trivial HTTP call. The module controller's path can be concealed during the exploit, making it difficult to detect via conventional frontend logs.
