- **Root cause of vulnerability:**  The vulnerability is due to unauthorized access in ZStack Cloud versions prior to 3.10.38. Specifically, an unauthorized request to `/calls/uuids` endpoint.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The vulnerability allows unauthorized access. The specific weakness is not described in detail beyond the ability to access the `/calls/uuids` endpoint.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access, impacting confidentiality and potentially availability.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based (AV:N).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable server. The attacker only requires low privileges (PR:L), meaning they may not need to authenticate or have minimal access. No user interaction is required for the exploit (UI:N).
