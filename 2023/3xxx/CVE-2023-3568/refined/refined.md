Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the potential vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The commit introduces a function `check_event_permissions` which is used to authorize users before they can manage appointments, unavailabilities, or delete appointments/unavailabilities. Before this commit, these functions were not properly checking if the user had permission to modify or delete them.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Missing Authorization Checks:** The vulnerability lies in the absence of proper authorization checks before performing actions on calendar events (appointments and unavailabilities). Specifically, before the commit, users could potentially modify or delete appointments and unavailabilities even if they were not the owner or had permission.
- **Insufficient Role-Based Access Control:** The commit implements role-based access control where it now checks if the logged-in user is either a 'secretary' or a 'provider'. If they are a secretary they are checked against allowed providers, or the user is a provider they must match the `id_users_provider` in the event being modified. This highlights that before the change any user could modify events as the check wasn't done.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Data Modification:** An attacker (or unauthorized user) could modify or delete appointment or unavailability data without proper authorization. This could lead to:
    - Schedule disruptions.
    - Service unavailability.
    - Data integrity issues.
    - Potential denial of service by deleting a large number of records.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Direct Request Manipulation:** An attacker could directly craft and send HTTP requests to the affected endpoints (e.g., `save_appointment`, `delete_appointment`, `save_unavailability`, `delete_unavailability`) with modified data and IDs, without being checked for permissions.
- **Bypass UI Controls:** An attacker could bypass UI-based restrictions (if any) by directly interacting with the backend, if it did not perform authorisation checks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authenticated User:**  An attacker needs to be an authenticated user with some role on the system.
- **Knowledge of API Endpoints:** The attacker would need to know the API endpoints for managing calendar events to craft the malicious requests.
- **Access to User IDs**: The attacker would need some knowledge of valid provider IDs to target specific calendar events.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided code diff shows the `check_event_permissions` function being added and called at the start of the relevant functions.
- This commit fixes the authorization issues and mitigates the vulnerability.
- The commit message provides the following summary "Only allow authorized users to manage appointments from the calendar page".
- This commit was in response to issue #1387.
