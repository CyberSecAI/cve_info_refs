- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the plugin settings, which will then be executed in the browsers of users who access the affected pages, potentially leading to account compromise or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with high privileges (e.g., admin) can add a new item in the plugin settings and insert a malicious payload (e.g., javascript:alert(/XSS/);) in the "Link" field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have high privileges such as an administrator within the WordPress site.
