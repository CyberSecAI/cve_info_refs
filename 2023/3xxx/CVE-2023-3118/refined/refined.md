- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize or escape user-supplied parameters (`starting-point` and `ending-point`) before outputting them in the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into a page viewed by an administrator. This can lead to the attacker performing actions on behalf of the administrator, including potentially gaining full control of the WordPress site.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker crafts a malicious URL with the vulnerable parameters and tricks an admin into accessing it while logged in. This is achieved by an HTML form submission in the provided PoC.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft the malicious URL and trick an administrator into opening it while being logged in to the affected WordPress site.
