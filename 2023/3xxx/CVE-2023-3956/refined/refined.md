Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-3956

**Vulnerability Description:**

The InstaWP Connect plugin, versions 0.0.9.18 and earlier, has a critical missing authorization vulnerability in the `events_receiver` function. This vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to perform various actions, including:

- Adding, modifying, and deleting posts, taxonomies, and users (including admin accounts).
- Changing customizer settings
- Installing, activating, and deactivating plugins.

**Root Cause:**
The `events_receiver` function lacks proper capability checks, meaning that anyone, regardless of authentication status or permissions, can access and trigger the function.

**Weaknesses:**
- Missing authorization checks in the `events_receiver` function.
- Insecure handling of incoming data within the `events_receiver` function allowing arbitrary modification of data.
- Lack of input validation, which allows attackers to craft malicious requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Full Site Compromise:** Attackers can gain full control over the WordPress site by creating administrator accounts, modifying themes/plugins, and injecting malicious code, causing complete site compromise.
- **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can manipulate website content, including posts, taxonomies, media, and customizer settings, leading to defacement or misinformation.
- **Data Loss:** The ability to delete content, including posts, taxonomies, and even users, can cause data loss.
- **Plugin Manipulation:** Attackers can install malicious plugins, activate or deactivate existing ones. This poses severe security risks to the targeted website.
- **Account Takeover:** Attackers can create new administrative users and gain full control of the site.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerability is triggered via a REST API endpoint `instawp-connect/v1/sync` accessible to unauthenticated users.
- The attacker sends POST requests with malicious JSON payloads via the vulnerable REST API endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker does not require any authentication or specific privileges
- No user interaction is required.
- The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint.
