Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The Simple Author Box plugin fails to properly verify the user ID before outputting user information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The plugin directly uses the `author_ID` parameter from the request without proper authorization checks. This allows a user to access information of any other user by simply changing the ID in the request.
*   **Broken Access Control:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of access control, where a contributor role user can access information they are not authorized to view.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary User Information Disclosure:** An attacker can obtain sensitive information about any user on the WordPress site, including their hashed password.
    
**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack can be performed by creating a new post as a "Contributor" user.
*   The attacker needs to add the "Simple Author Box" block.
*   The attacker intercepts the request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` and modifies the `author_ID` parameter to the ID of the targeted user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have at least a "Contributor" role on the WordPress site.
*   The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify HTTP requests.
