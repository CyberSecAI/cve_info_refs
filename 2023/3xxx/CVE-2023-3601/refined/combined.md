## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Simple Author Box < 2.52 - Contributor+ Arbitrary User Information Disclosure via IDOR

### Description

The plugin does not verify a user ID before outputting information about that user, leading to arbitrary user information disclosure to users with a role as low as Contributor.

### Proof of Concept

1. Create a new Post as a Contributor user.
2. Add the "Simple Author Box" block.
3. Intercept the request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` upon addition of the block. Change the `author\_ID` parameter to an ID of a user of your choosing.
4. Inspect the response to see all of the information about that user, including the hashed password.
