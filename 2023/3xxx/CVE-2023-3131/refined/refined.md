- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin's AJAX actions lack proper security measures such as privilege checks and nonce checks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing authorization, broken access control. Specifically, the plugin doesn't verify if the user has the correct privileges to perform certain actions. This allows subscriber-level users to update sensitive settings via AJAX requests.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker with subscriber-level privileges can modify various plugin settings, including: product limits, Firebase server keys, new order titles and messages, and status order titles and messages.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending specifically crafted AJAX requests to the server via HTTP GET requests.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have a subscriber-level account on the target WordPress site.
