- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them in a page/post, where the shortcode is embedded.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into a page/post, which are then executed when a user views the page, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** By inserting malicious code within the attributes of the `lana_button`, `lana_icon`, or `lana_label` shortcodes.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have at least a Contributor role on the WordPress site to be able to insert the malicious shortcodes into a page or post.
