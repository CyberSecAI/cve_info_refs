Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-3053

**Vulnerability:** Missing Authorization to Post Creation

*   **Root Cause:** The `azh_add_post` function in the 'Page Builder by AZEXO' plugin lacks proper authorization checks. This allows any authenticated user (with a minimum level of 'subscriber' on WordPress) to call this function.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Missing capability check:** The plugin does not verify if the user has the necessary capabilities to create posts before executing the `azh_add_post` function.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can create posts of any post type (e.g., pages, posts, custom post types) with any status (e.g., publish, draft), potentially leading to:
    *   **Content injection:**  Attackers can inject malicious content on the site.
    *   **Denial of service:**  Attackers could create numerous posts, consuming resources.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited through a direct request to the WordPress AJAX endpoint (`wp-admin/admin-ajax.php`) using the `azh_add_post` action.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must be an authenticated user on the WordPress site, with a minimum role of 'subscriber'.
    *   They need to craft a specific AJAX request containing parameters used by the vulnerable function.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability exists in versions up to and including 1.27.133 of the Page Builder by AZEXO plugin.
*   There is no known patch available for this vulnerability.
*   The Wordfence analysis recommends that users uninstall the plugin due to the missing authorization check.
*  The provided code snippets show the vulnerable `azh_add_post` function, but do not include any capability check.
