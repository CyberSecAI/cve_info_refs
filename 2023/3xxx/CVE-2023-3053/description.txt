The Page Builder by AZEXO plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'azh_add_post' function in versions up to, and including, 1.27.133. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers to create a post with any post type and post status.
