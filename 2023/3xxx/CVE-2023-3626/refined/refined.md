Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of file type validation in the `UpLoadFloodPlanFile.ashx` module of the SunCreate Technology Co., LTD's mountain flood disaster prevention monitoring and warning system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Unrestricted File Upload:** The system allows uploading files without proper filtering or validation of their type.
- **Lack of Sanitization:** The system doesn't sanitize the file path, potentially leading to directory traversal issues.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading a malicious ASPX file, an attacker can achieve remote code execution on the server. The provided POC demonstrates this by uploading an ASPX file that can be used to execute arbitrary code.
- **Webshell Access:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to gain a webshell, enabling further malicious activities on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `/Duty/AjaxHandle/UpLoadFloodPlanFile.ashx` with a malicious file.
- **Multipart Form Data:** The request uses multipart/form-data to upload the file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable system.
- **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker must know the specific path `/Duty/AjaxHandle/UpLoadFloodPlanFile.ashx` to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Ability to Craft HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to craft and send HTTP POST requests with the correct multipart form data.

**Additional Details from Content:**
- **Vulnerable Component:** `Duty UpLoadFloodPlanFile` module of mountain flood disaster prevention monitoring and warning system by Suncreate Technology Co., LTD
- **Vulnerable Endpoint:** `/Duty/AjaxHandle/UpLoadFloodPlanFile.ashx`
- **File location:** After upload, files are placed in `/location/UploadFile/yyyyMMddHHmmssfff`.
- **POC Included:** The content provides a Proof of Concept (POC) HTTP request that can be used to exploit the vulnerability, demonstrating the steps needed to upload a malicious ASPX file for remote code execution.
