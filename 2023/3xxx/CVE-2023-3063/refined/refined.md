Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) within the SP Project & Document Manager plugin. The plugin allows user-controlled access to objects, which bypasses authorization checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The core vulnerability is that the plugin doesn't properly validate user authorization when accessing or modifying user data. An attacker can manipulate user IDs to target other users.
*   **Authorization Bypass:** Authenticated users (with "subscriber" privileges or higher) can bypass authorization checks to perform actions they shouldn't be allowed to do.
*   **Lack of Input Validation/Sanitization:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper authorization checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary User Password Change:** Attackers can change the passwords of any user on the WordPress site, including administrators.
*   **Account Takeover:** Successful password changes can lead to complete account takeover of other users. This includes administrator accounts, potentially leading to full site compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack occurs over the network by sending malicious requests to the vulnerable plugin.
*   **Direct Requests:** The attack vector involves direct interaction with the plugin via HTTP requests that manipulate user IDs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user with "subscriber" privileges or higher.
*   **Knowledge of User IDs:** The attacker needs to know or be able to guess the user IDs of target accounts. This information could potentially be obtained from other public data or through user enumeration.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability exists in versions of the SP Project & Document Manager plugin up to and including 4.67.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by István Márton of Wordfence.
*   The patched version is 4.68.
*   The provided code snippet (ajax.php) highlights the lack of authorization checks, specifically in functions that handle user password changes.
