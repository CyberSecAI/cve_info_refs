  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2023-3446",
    "description": "The DH_check() function in OpenSSL checks various aspects of the key or parameters supplied, including the modulus size. While OpenSSL normally does not generate or derive keys with a modulus over 10,000 bits, the DH_check() function would perform validity tests on a large modulus even if it exceeds this limit, potentially leading to a denial-of-service attack. This can happen if an application calls DH_check(), DH_check_ex(), or EVP_PKEY_param_check() with key material from an untrusted source.",
    "affected_versions": [
      "OpenSSL 3.1",
      "OpenSSL 3.0",
      "OpenSSL 1.1.1",
      "OpenSSL 1.0.2"
    ],
    "patched_versions": [
      "Openssl 3.1 (commit fc9867c1)",
        "Openssl 3.0 (commit 1fa20cf2)",
        "Openssl 1.1.1 (commit 8780a896)",
         "Openssl 1.0.2 (commit 9a0a4d3c)"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The DH_check() function performs checks on the modulus parameter of a DH key. Some checks use the modulus even if it's excessively large, leading to a performance issue. The vulnerability arises because the `DH_check` function continues to perform validity tests on an excessively large modulus parameter, even when OpenSSL would not normally use a modulus of that size, resulting in a time-consuming process.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Denial of Service (DoS) due to excessive time spent in checking DH keys and parameters with an over-sized modulus."
    ],
    "impact": "Applications that use the functions DH_check(), DH_check_ex() or EVP_PKEY_param_check() to check a DH key or DH parameters may experience long delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
        "An application using the DH_check(), DH_check_ex(), or EVP_PKEY_param_check() functions with key material from an untrusted source, specially with oversized modulus parameter."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to supply a DH key or parameters with an excessively large modulus to the vulnerable function.",
        "notes": "The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation and FIPS providers are not affected by this issue. Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL dhparam and pkeyparam command line applications when using the '-check' option. OSSfuzz first detected and automatically reported this issue."
