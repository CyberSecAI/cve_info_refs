A memory leak flaw was found in Libtiff's tiffcrop utility. This issue occurs when tiffcrop operates on a TIFF image file, allowing an attacker to pass a crafted TIFF image file to tiffcrop utility, which causes this memory leak issue, resulting an application crash, eventually leading to a denial of service.
