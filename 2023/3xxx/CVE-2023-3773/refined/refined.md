Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2023-3773:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is a missing `nla_policy` description for the `XFRMA_MTIMER_THRESH` attribute in `xfrma_policy` (`net/xfrm/xfrm_user.c`). This oversight occurred after the attribute was added in commit `4e484b3e969b` to handle SA mapping rate-limiting. The attribute's type was defined in `compat_policy` but not in `xfrma_policy`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Out-of-bounds read:** Due to the missing policy, a malicious user can send a netlink message with a faked (empty, 0-byte) `XFRMA_MTIMER_THRESH` attribute value, which is actually expected to be a 4-byte `NLA_U32` value. When parsing the netlink attributes, the code reads 4 bytes beyond the provided attribute data, triggering an out-of-bounds read.
- **Heap information leak:** The 4-byte out-of-bounds read can leak heap data into the `x->mapping_maxage` field of the `xfrm_state` struct (via the `xfrm_update_ae_params` function) which is later leaked to userspace via `copy_to_user_state_extra`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information leak:** A successful exploit can lead to the leakage of potentially sensitive heap memory to userspace.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Netlink message manipulation:** A malicious user with `CAP_NET_ADMIN` privilege can craft a specific netlink message with a malformed `XFRMA_MTIMER_THRESH` attribute. This message is then sent to the kernel via netlink sockets.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **`CAP_NET_ADMIN` Privilege:** An attacker needs the `CAP_NET_ADMIN` capability to trigger the vulnerable code path. This can be achieved by creating a network namespace in most vendor kernels, even if the user isn't traditionally root.
- **Ability to create netlink messages:** The attacker needs the ability to craft and send netlink messages to the kernel.
- **Ability to spray SLUB objects:** The attacker needs to have control over how the heap is allocated such that a 4-byte out-of-bounds read will cause leakage of useful information.

**Additional Details:**

- The out-of-bounds read is not detected by KASan because the buffer `skb` has a `skb_shared_info` struct of 0x140 bytes allocated immediately following it, which absorbs the out of bounds read.
- The fix involves adding the missing `nla_policy` entry for `XFRMA_MTIMER_THRESH` in `xfrma_policy` within the file `net/xfrm/xfrm_user.c`. This enforces a length check, preventing the out-of-bounds read.
- This vulnerability exists in Linux Kernel versions before the fix.
