{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A race condition exists in the Linux kernel's MCTP (Management Component Transport Protocol) implementation. When a network device is detached, the `mctp_unregister()` function reclaims the device's resources. However, if another thread is simultaneously using the device through `mctp_sendmsg()`, a use-after-free vulnerability occurs due to the premature freeing of the `mdev->addrs` object.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free",
      "Race condition"
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit can lead to a denial of service (DoS) due to a kernel crash. The vulnerability could be triggered by a malicious user who can create and close a fake MCTP device.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A local attacker with `CAP_NET_ADMIN` capabilities can create a malicious MCTP device, and trigger the use-after-free via `sendmsg` syscalls during device detachment."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs `CAP_NET_ADMIN` privileges to create and manipulate network devices, particularly MCTP devices. They can utilize the `mtcpserial` driver with a pseudo-terminal (pty) to simulate device detachment and userfaultfd to increase the likelihood of the race condition occurring."
