{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The password reset process lacks proper verification, allowing direct access to the password modification page.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Insecure password reset mechanism",
    "Lack of verification in the password reset process",
    "Direct access to password modification page",
    "Insufficient input sanitization in resetPassword.php"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can reset any user's password, gaining unauthorized access to the system.",
  "Attack vectors": "Directly accessing the resetPassword.php page with a user ID via a GET request, bypassing normal password reset procedures.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to know or guess a valid user ID. No prior authentication is required. They need to be able to send HTTP requests to the server."
