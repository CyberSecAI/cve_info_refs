- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
    - Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthenticated attackers can modify plugin settings and inject malicious web scripts.
- **Attack vectors**: A forged request to the `ajax_store_save()` function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a site administrator into performing an action, such as clicking a malicious link.
