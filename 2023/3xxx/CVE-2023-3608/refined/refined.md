Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization in the Ruijie BCR810W router's web interface. Specifically, it appears that user-supplied input is directly passed to a system command without proper validation or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a command injection flaw. The router's web interface allows users to input data that is then directly used in the execution of a system command on the underlying operating system.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The web interface does not properly sanitize or validate user inputs, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the router's operating system with the privileges of the web server or application user.
- **Full System Compromise:** Depending on the permissions of the vulnerable service and the system configuration, the attacker could potentially gain full control of the device.
- **Data Breach/Manipulation:** An attacker can potentially extract sensitive data such as configuration files or user credentials, and/or modify system settings and configurations.
- **Denial of Service:** Malicious commands could also lead to a denial of service for the router.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The primary attack vector is the router's web interface. An attacker can gain access to the web interface of the router, and then inject malicious commands.
- **Network Access:** This vulnerability can be exploited by any attacker who can reach the web interface of the affected router, which could potentially include anyone on the same local network, or potentially remote attackers if the web interface is exposed to the internet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs to be able to reach the router's web interface.
- **Basic HTTP knowledge:** The attacker would need to understand how the web interface interacts with user input.
- **Command Injection knowledge:** The attacker must have a basic understanding of command injection techniques.
- **Authentication:** The provided images imply the attacker is logged in, but it is unclear if the attack can be performed pre-authentication.

**Technical Details:**

1. The vulnerability is triggered by submitting a crafted input string into a field on the web interface.
2. The provided example demonstrates the injection of `127.0.0.1; "cat /etc/passwd"`. This input is likely used in a command that would normally use `127.0.0.1` as an IP address or similar argument.
3. By adding the semicolon `;` followed by `cat /etc/passwd`, the attacker creates a command injection and executes the `cat /etc/passwd` command in the underlying shell.

**Additional Notes:**

- The screenshots provided in the content show successful login to the router web interface, and also show the command injection payload and resulting output of `cat /etc/passwd`.
- The specific vulnerable field is not specified in the document.
- This vulnerability is specific to Ruijie BCR810W routers.
