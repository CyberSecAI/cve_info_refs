Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-3869

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check in the `voteOnComment` function of the wpDiscuz plugin. This allows unauthenticated users to manipulate comment ratings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The vulnerability allows direct access to comment objects without proper authorization checks. Specifically, the `commentId` is taken from user input without validation of the user's right to modify the object.
- **Authorization Bypass:** The lack of authorization check on the `voteOnComment` function enables unauthenticated users to perform actions they should not be able to perform.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Comment Rating Manipulation:** Unauthenticated attackers can increase or decrease the rating of any comment. This can be used to artificially inflate or deflate the perceived value of comments, leading to a skewed view of the discussion.
- **Potential for Disruption:** This vulnerability can be used to disrupt discussions by manipulating comment scores, making it harder to identify valuable comments.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct HTTP Requests:** Attackers can send direct HTTP requests to the server, targeting the `wpdVoteOnComment` AJAX action with a crafted `commentId` and `voteType`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated access:** No user authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the `wpdVoteOnComment` AJAX action endpoint, which can be easily discovered from the plugin's code.
- **Ability to send HTTP requests:** Attackers need the ability to send HTTP requests to the targeted WordPress site.
- **Knowledge of comment IDs:** The attacker needs valid comment IDs to target specific comments.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects wpDiscuz versions up to and including 7.6.3.
- The vulnerability was discovered by RE-ALTER.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 7.6.4.
