   - **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted GET request with malicious SQL code in the `id` parameter.
   - **Required Capabilities:** Ability to send HTTP requests to the server.

**8. SQL Injection in `admin/categories/manage_category.php`**
    - **Root Cause:** Unsanitized user input (`$_GET['id']`) is directly embedded in a SQL query.
    - **Vulnerability:** SQL Injection
   - **Impact:** Allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or unauthorized access.
   - **Attack Vector:**  Sending a crafted GET request with malicious SQL code in the `id` parameter.
   - **Required Capabilities:** Ability to send HTTP requests to the server.

**9. SQL Injection in `classes/Users.php` (POST request to registration function)**
   - **Root Cause:** Unsanitized user input (`$username`) is directly embedded in a SQL query.
   - **Vulnerability:** SQL Injection
