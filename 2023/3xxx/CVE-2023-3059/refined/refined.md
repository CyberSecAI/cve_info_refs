{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists due to unsanitized user-supplied input in the 'id' GET parameter, which is directly incorporated into a SQL query.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection vulnerability.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can manipulate SQL queries to extract sensitive information, modify data, or potentially gain unauthorized access to the database. Specifically, the attacker can use UNION queries to extract data and time-based blind injection to infer information.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the 'id' GET parameter in the URL.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable script ( `/examformsubmission/admin/update_s6.php` ) and manipulate the 'id' parameter."
