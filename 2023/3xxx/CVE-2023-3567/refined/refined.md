      "content": "The core issue is a use-after-free vulnerability in the vcs_read function within the drivers/tty/vt/vc_screen.c file of the Linux kernel. This vulnerability occurs due to a race condition where the vc_data structure can be deallocated while the vcs_read function attempts to access it after console_unlock(), specifically in vcs_size().\n\n- Root cause of vulnerability: A race condition in the vcs_read function after the console is unlocked.\n- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Use-after-free due to a race condition.\n- Impact of exploitation: A local user can cause a system crash, leading to a denial of service or potentially leak kernel information.\n- Attack vectors: Local user access.\n- Required attacker capabilities/position: A local user who can trigger the race condition in the vcs_read function during device detachment.\n\nSpecific technical details include:\n\n1.  The `flower_stats_timer` can schedule `flower_stats_work`, which can also rearm the timer.  When the `cxgb4` device is detaching, the timer and workqueue could still be rearmed.  As a result, a possible use-after-free bug could happen. (This detail is from a related bug report about a similar UAF in the `cxgb4` driver,  Bug 2221702).\n2. The `vcs_read` function loads the `vc_data` struct pointer then proceeds to call `vcs_size()` after unlocking the console, potentially leading to a use-after-free if `vc_data` is freed in another context in the meanwhile (This detail is from a patch added to fix the UAF issue).",

      "content": "A use-after-free flaw was found in `vcs_read` in `drivers/tty/vt/vc_screen.c` in `vc_screen` in the Linux Kernel. In this flaw an attacker with local user access may lead to a system crash or a leak of internal kernel information. This issue may occur due to a race condition during device detachment, where a timer and a workqueue might still be rearmed, leading to a use-after-free in `ch_flower_stats_cb()`. The fix involves moving the load of the struct vc_data pointer within a while loop to prevent use-after-free during console unlock. This was fixed in kernel version 6.3 and is present in RHSA-2024:0412\n\nRoot cause of vulnerability: Race condition during device detachment and timer rearming.\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Use-after-free vulnerability.\nImpact of exploitation: System crash, potential leak of internal kernel information, denial of service condition.\nAttack vectors: Local user access.\nRequired attacker capabilities/position: Local user with ability to trigger device detachment and manipulate the workqueue/timer.",
