Technical Details & Description:
================================
Multiple html injection web vulnerabilities has been discovered in the official Active Super Shop Multi-vendor CMS v2.5
web-application.
The web vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject own html codes with persistent vector to manipulate application
content.

The persistent html injection web vulnerabilities are located in the name, phone and address parameters of the manage
profile and products branding module.
Remote attackers with privileged accountant access are able to inject own malicious script code in the name parameter
to provoke a persistent execution on
profile view or products preview listing. There are 3 different privileges that are allowed to access the backend like
the accountant (low privileges), the
manager (medium privileges) or the admin (high privileges). Accountants are able to attack the higher privileged access
roles of admins and manager on preview
of the elements in the backend to compromise the application. The request method to inject is post and the attack
vector is persistent located on the application-side.

Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities results in session hijacking, persistent phishing attacks, persistent
external redirects to malicious source and
persistent manipulation of affected application modules.

Request Method(s):
[+] POST

Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] Manage Details

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
[+] name
[+] phone
[+] address

Affected Module(s):
[+] manage profile
[+] products branding

Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The html injection web vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers with privileged accountant access and with
low user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the persistent cross site web vulnerability follow the provided information
and steps below to continue.

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
Disallow inseration of html code for input fields like name, adress and phone. Sanitize the content to secure deliver.

Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the html injection web vulnerabilities in the shopping web-application are estimated as medium.
