Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper input sanitization in the Active Super Shop CMS v2.5 web application. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize the `name`, `phone`, and `address` parameters when processing user input, allowing for the injection of HTML code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **HTML Injection:** The primary vulnerability is HTML injection. Attackers can insert arbitrary HTML code into the vulnerable parameters.
*   **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Because the injected HTML is stored and displayed back to users, this leads to a persistent XSS vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Session Hijacking:** Attackers can potentially inject malicious scripts to steal user session cookies.
*   **Persistent Phishing Attacks:** By injecting malicious HTML, attackers can create persistent phishing pages within the legitimate application.
*   **Persistent External Redirects:** Attackers can redirect users to external malicious websites.
*   **Manipulation of Application Modules:** Attackers can manipulate the content of affected application modules, leading to defacement or other malicious activity.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote:** The vulnerabilities are remotely exploitable.
*   **POST Request:** The injection occurs through POST requests to the `manage_admin/update_profile` endpoint.
*   **Vulnerable Parameters:** The vulnerable parameters are `name`, `phone`, and `address` within the manage profile and product branding modules.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Accountant Access (Low Privileges):** Attackers require at least "accountant" level access within the application. This level of access is considered a low privileged role.
*   **Low User Interaction:** The exploit requires low user interaction, meaning the attacker doesn't need a victim to actively click on something to trigger the vulnerability.

**More Details than CVE:**
The provided content offers significantly more detail than a typical CVE description. It includes:
*   Specific vulnerable parameters (`name`, `phone`, `address`).
*   Vulnerable modules (`manage profile`, `products branding`).
*   Proof of Concept (PoC) with a sample payload.
*   Detailed request and response logs.
*   A clear description of the attack vector and required attacker privileges.
*   Information on the impact of a successful exploit including session hijacking, persistent phishing, and external redirects.

The content also indicates a timeline of responsible disclosure, which is useful to understand the overall context.
