{
  "cveId": "CVE-2023-3171",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    {
      "rootCause": "The application permits deserialization of certain classes, specifically HashMap and HashTable, without proper checks on the resources consumed during the instantiation of these classes.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption",
        "Insecure Deserialization"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can submit malicious requests using these vulnerable classes, leading to heap exhaustion and ultimately resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS).",
      "attackVectors": [
         "Malicious requests containing serialized HashMap or HashTable objects"
      ],
      "requiredCapabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to submit malicious requests to the vulnerable application, implying network access is required."
