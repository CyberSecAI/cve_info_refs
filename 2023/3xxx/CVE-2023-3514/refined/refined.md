**Verification:**
The content from `starlabs.sg_4243b777_20250114_215228.html` directly references CVE-2023-3514 and provides details about the vulnerability, confirming its relevance.

**Summary:**
- **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from improper handling of named pipe permissions within the `RazerCentralService.exe` service. Specifically, the service does not properly sanitize input when handling the `AddModule` and `UninstallModules` commands, which accept XML formatted data.
- **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    - **Unsafe Named Pipe Permissions:** The `RazerCentralService` uses a named pipe for inter-process communication, but the permissions are not adequately restricted, allowing lower-privileged processes to communicate with it.
    - **Improper Input Sanitization:** The `AddModule` and `UninstallModules` commands, which are accessible via the named pipe, accept XML formatted data but do not sanitize this input, allowing for command injection and privilege escalation.
- **Impact of Exploitation:**
    - **Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability to gain `SYSTEM` level privileges, allowing them to execute arbitrary code with the highest level of access on the target system.
- **Attack Vectors:**
    - **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the target system, with the ability to execute code and communicate with the named pipe of the `RazerCentralService.exe`.
- **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    - **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs only low-level user privileges on the system where the vulnerable `RazerCentralService` is installed.
    - **Code Execution:** The attacker needs the ability to execute a script or program on the local system.
    - **Named Pipe Access:** The attacker needs the ability to connect to and send commands to the named pipe used by `RazerCentralService`.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable service is `RazerCentralService.exe`.
- The communication happens via a named pipe, with the following format `\\.\pipe\{FC828A97-C116-453D-BD88-AD471496E03C}`.
- The `UpdateManager` service within the `RazerCentralService.exe` is vulnerable.
- The commands `AddModule` and `UninstallModules` are used to exploit the vulnerability, by sending malicious XML data.
- A proof-of-concept python script was provided to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects `Razer Central 7.11.0.558` and below.
- STAR Labs SG discovered and reported the vulnerability.
- The exploit is related to providing a crafted XML payload to the vulnerable service.
- The vulnerability can be triggered within minutes after logging in.
