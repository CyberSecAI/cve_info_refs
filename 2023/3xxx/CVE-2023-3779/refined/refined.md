**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Unauthenticated Access:** Attackers do not need to log in or have any special privileges to retrieve the API key.
-   **Web Page Source Code:** The API key was available by simply viewing the page source code of any page using the MailChimp block.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   The attacker needs to be able to access the webpage where the MailChimp block is used. No special skills, other than basic web browsing and page source code inspection are needed.

**Additional Information:**
-   The vulnerability affects versions of the plugin up to and including 5.8.1.
-   The vulnerability is specific to the premium version of the plugin when using the Mailchimp block.
-   The recommended remediation is to update to version 5.8.2 or later. It is also advised to reset the MailChimp API key as it may have been compromised.
