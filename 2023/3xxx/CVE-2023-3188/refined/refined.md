Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed by the commit:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the application's handling of HTTP redirects when fetching resources from external URLs. Specifically, the `activitypub/webfinger` and `auth/indieauth` components were susceptible to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) due to their default behavior of following redirects.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery):** The application, when handling webfinger and indieauth requests, was configured to follow redirects. This allowed a malicious actor to potentially redirect the application to an internal server or an arbitrary URL, potentially exposing internal network resources or causing unintended actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially leverage the redirect functionality to perform SSRF attacks.
- By redirecting the application to an internal server, the attacker might gain access to sensitive resources or execute commands on the internal network.
- The attacker could potentially use this vulnerability to probe internal infrastructure, bypass firewalls, and gather information about the network layout.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through manipulation of the URL provided to the webfinger and indieauth functionality. If an attacker can craft a malicious URL that redirects to an internal resource, they could potentially exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to be able to supply a crafted URL, potentially through an API or other means, that the application uses in webfinger or indieauth requests.
- The attacker does not necessarily require any prior authentication and could potentially exploit the vulnerability by targeting the relevant endpoints with malicious URLs.

**Technical Details:**
- The fix involves modifying the `http.Client` configuration in `activitypub/webfinger/webfinger.go` and `auth/indieauth/client.go` to prevent following redirects by setting the `CheckRedirect` field to return `http.ErrUseLastResponse`. This explicitly disables redirect handling during HTTP requests, mitigating the SSRF vulnerability.

```go
  client := &http.Client{
      CheckRedirect: func(req *http.Request, via []*http.Request) error {
          return http.ErrUseLastResponse
      },
  }
```
