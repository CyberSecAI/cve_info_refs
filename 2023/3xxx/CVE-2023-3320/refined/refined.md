  "CVE-2023-3320": {
    "description": "The WP Sticky Social plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.1. This is due to missing nonce validation in the ~/admin/views/admin.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugin's settings and inject malicious web scripts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",

    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",

    ],
    "impact": "An unauthenticated attacker can modify plugin settings and inject malicious web scripts.",
    "attack_vectors": "Forged HTTP requests.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link to trigger the forged request."
