Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the identified vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The `VIP-video-analysis` system, specifically the `admin/admincore.php` file, is vulnerable to XSS due to insufficient sanitization or encoding of user-supplied input. The vulnerability lies in the `aik[gonggao]` variable which is not properly handled before being displayed on the web page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application does not sanitize user-provided input, specifically the `gonggao` parameter, before including it in the HTML output. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.
*   **Reflected XSS:** The injected script is reflected back to the user through the application's response, making it a reflected XSS vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser.
*   This could lead to:
    *   Session hijacking, where an attacker gains access to a user's account.
    *   Defacement of the website, where the attacker can alter the appearance or content of the web page.
    *   Redirection of users to malicious websites.
    *   Theft of sensitive information, like cookies or session tokens.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP POST request to the vulnerable endpoint (`admin/admincore.php`).
*   **Payload in Request Data:** The malicious JavaScript payload is injected into the `aik[gonggao]` parameter within the POST data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted HTTP request to the server.
*   No specific user privileges are mentioned, but this vulnerability can likely be exploited by any user who can access the vulnerable endpoint.
*   The attacker needs to know the vulnerable parameter name and the URL.

**Additional Details:**
*   The provided images show the vulnerable code snippet, a sample POST request with the malicious payload, and the resulting output with the injected JavaScript.
*   The targeted software is the `VIP-video-analysis system 1.0`.
