The provided content details multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in the Service Provider Management System.

**Vulnerabilities:**
- Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities are present.
- The application is vulnerable to SQL injection in `view.php`, `manage_user.php`, `view_service.php` and `view_inquiry.php`.

**Root cause:**
- The root cause is improper sanitization of user input within the SQL queries.
- The application directly includes the GET parameter `id` into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can inject arbitrary SQL queries leading to unauthorized access to the database.
- Attackers can bypass authentication, read, modify, or delete sensitive data.
- The attacker can potentially gain full control of the application's database.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests by manipulating the `id` parameter in the URLs.
    - `http://php-spms.com/?page=services/view&id=[SQL Injection Payload]`
    - `http://php-spms.com/admin/?page=user/manage_user&id=[SQL Injection Payload]`
    - `http://php-spms.com/admin/?page=services/view_service&id=[SQL Injection Payload]`
    - `http://php-spms.com/admin/?page=inquiries/view_inquiry&id=[SQL Injection Payload]`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application.
- No authentication is required to exploit the SQL injection vulnerabilities in `view.php`.
- The SQL injection vulnerabilities in `manage_user.php`, `view_service.php` and `view_inquiry.php` are located in the admin panel. An attacker would need access to the admin panel in order to exploit these vulnerabilities.
