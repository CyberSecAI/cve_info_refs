- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper checks on user input allow an attacker to inject HTML payloads.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** HTML Injection. The application does not sanitize user input, specifically when creating a new user.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML, leading to potential site defacement, redirection to malicious sites, or other attacks by using the compromised web application as an attack surface.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the user input field when creating a new user. By injecting HTML code, the attacker can manipulate the appearance and behavior of the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to create a new user in the application.
