Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `dashboard/approval/del` route in the IBOS office OA software. Specifically, data passed to the `model()->deleteApproval()` method is not sanitized, leading to the execution of a malicious SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Unsanitized user input.
- Direct use of user-provided data in SQL queries.
- Lack of input validation/parameterization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can manipulate SQL queries to perform unauthorized actions, including:
  - Data exfiltration: Accessing sensitive information stored in the database.
  - Data manipulation: Modifying or deleting data in the database.
  - Privilege escalation: Potentially gaining elevated privileges on the database server.
  - Application compromise: Possibly leading to broader application compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is the `dashboard/approval/del` route within the IBOS office OA application. An attacker would need to inject malicious SQL code into parameters used in this route.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to make requests to the vulnerable endpoint with specifically crafted payloads. This suggests the attacker would need to be an authenticated user (since this is an "office OA" system) or able to bypass any authentication controls to access the vulnerable route.
- Basic understanding of SQL syntax and injection techniques to craft malicious payloads.
- Network access to the vulnerable application.

**Technical Details:**
- The exploit is triggered when the application receives a request to the `/dashboard/approval/del` route.
- The application calls the `actionDel()` method, which then calls `model()->deleteApproval()`.
- This method constructs an SQL query using user-supplied data without proper sanitization/parameterization.
- The crafted SQL query is executed by using the `createCommand()->update()->execute()` methods
- The vulnerable software is IBOS Office OA, specifically version v4.5.5.
