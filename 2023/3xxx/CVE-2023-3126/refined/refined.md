Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-3126:

**1. Verification:**

The content from `blog.nintechnet.com` and `www.wordfence.com` directly refers to CVE-2023-3126 and describes the vulnerability, confirming its relevance. The changelog from `woocommerce-b2b-plugin.com` also mentions a fix for the vulnerability in version 4.6.20

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a missing capability check on the `b2bkingdownloadpricelist` function and the `b2bking_save_price_import` function within the B2BKing plugin. These functions are accessible via the WordPress AJAX API and admin_post hook, respectively, and lack proper authorization checks.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Broken Access Control:** The primary weakness is the lack of authorization checks in the `b2bkingdownloadpricelist` and `b2bking_save_price_import` functions. These functions are intended for use by administrators or shop managers, but are accessible to any authenticated user.
    *   **Nonce Leakage:** The nonce (`b2bking_security_nonce`) used for security is exposed in the page source, further enabling unauthorized access.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can retrieve a CSV file containing all product prices.
     *   **Price Manipulation:** Authenticated users, including customers, can modify product prices by re-uploading a tampered CSV file.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Network:** The attack is performed over the network via HTTP requests.
    *   **AJAX API:** The `b2bkingdownloadpricelist` function is accessed via the WordPress AJAX API.
    *   **admin_post hook:** The `b2bking_save_price_import` function is accessed via the admin_post hook

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have a valid user account (subscriber or customer-level permissions) on the affected WordPress site.

**Additional Details:**

*   The `b2bkingdownloadpricelist` function downloads a CSV of all products and prices, which is intended for administrative use.
*   The `b2bking_save_price_import` function processes the uploaded CSV, allowing users to overwrite product prices.
*   The leaked nonce is used as the only safeguard for the `b2bkingdownloadpricelist` function, which is insufficient.

**Timeline:**

*   The vulnerability was reported on May 11, 2023.
*   A patched version (4.6.20) was released on May 27, 2023.

In summary, this CVE describes a broken access control vulnerability that allows authenticated users to download a price list and, more critically, modify product prices due to insufficient authorization checks and a leaked nonce.
