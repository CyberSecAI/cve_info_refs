Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation and sanitization of user-provided input, specifically the `dir` and `names` parameters in the `com.ujcms.cms.core.web.backendapi.AbstractWebFileController#downloadZip` method. The application allows arbitrary directory traversal using the `dir` parameter, combined with the lack of restrictions on the `names` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** The `checkId` method does not properly restrict accessible directories, enabling attackers to use `..` sequences in the `dir` parameter to navigate to arbitrary directories outside the intended web root.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The `checkName` method only checks for empty filenames or illegal characters, but does not prevent attackers from specifying sensitive file or directory names, as long as the basic checks pass.
*   **Sensitive File Exposure:** By manipulating the `dir` and `names` parameters, an attacker can download zip files containing sensitive source code and configuration files, like those in the `WEB-INF/classes` directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to sensitive information like source code, configuration files, and potentially database credentials.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** Leaked information can enable further attacks such as reverse engineering the application logic to identify more vulnerabilities, unauthorized modification of sensitive configurations, or lateral movement within the network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP request to the application's backend API, specifically the `/downloadZip` endpoint, by modifying the `dir` and `names` parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the application's backend API.
*   **Understanding of API Endpoints:** The attacker must know the specific endpoint used for downloading ZIP files and the parameters it accepts, specifically the vulnerable `dir` and `names`.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to deployments where Tomcat is used.
*   The vulnerability is present in version 6.0.2 of Ujcms.
