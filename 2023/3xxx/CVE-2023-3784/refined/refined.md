Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause:**
*   The root cause is the lack of proper input validation in the Dooblou WiFi File Explorer application. Specifically, the `search`, `order`, `download`, and `mode` parameters within GET requests are not sanitized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to non-persistent XSS attacks. Malicious JavaScript code can be injected into the vulnerable parameters.
*   **Input Validation Issues:** The application fails to properly validate and sanitize user-supplied inputs, allowing injection of arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Session Hijacking:** Attackers can potentially hijack user sessions.
*   **Non-persistent Phishing:** Attackers can redirect users to malicious websites or display phishing pages.
*   **External Redirects:** Attackers can redirect users to external, malicious sources.
*   **Non-persistent Manipulation:** Attackers can manipulate affected application modules by injecting malicious code, altering the behavior of the web interface.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely.
*   **GET Request Parameter Injection:** Attackers inject malicious code into the `search`, `order`, `download`, and `mode` parameters of GET requests.
*   **Malformed Uploads:** Attack vectors can be included in malformed uploads which can trigger the injection when viewed in the application interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **No Authentication Required:** Attackers do not need to be authenticated to exploit these vulnerabilities, making it easier to conduct attacks.
*   **Low User Interaction:** The exploitation requires minimal user interaction, often just needing the user to view a crafted URL or page.

**Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerability is non-persistent, meaning the injected scripts are not stored by the server.
*   The vulnerability can be triggered using a GET request method.
*   The PoC examples show how to inject JavaScript code into the URL parameters, which then gets executed by the victim's browser when viewing the content. The injected code is designed to execute javascript `alert(document.domain)` which demonstrates the vulnerability.  The injected script tag  `<a href="<https://evil.source">; onmouseover=alert(document.domain)>` is designed to trigger when the mouse moves over the link.
