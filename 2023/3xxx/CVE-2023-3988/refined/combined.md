```
A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the Cafe Billing System index.php has Sqlinjection has Sqlinjection   The basic introduction  of the vulnerability is that SQL injection means that the web application does not strictly judge or filter the validity  of user input data.   An attacker can add additional SQL statements to the end of a predefined query statement in a web  application, and perform illegal operations without the knowledge of the administrator.   In this way,  the database server can be tricked into performing any unauthorized query and obtaining the corresponding data  information.
