- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape some of its settings, allowing for the injection of malicious code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with administrative privileges can inject malicious scripts into the plugin settings. This script will then be executed in the browsers of other users accessing the affected page. This can lead to a variety of malicious actions, such as stealing cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or performing actions on behalf of the victim.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the plugin's settings page, specifically in the "Floating Button" option's text field, where user-supplied input is not properly sanitized.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have administrative privileges (or other high-privilege user roles) to access and modify the plugin's settings.
