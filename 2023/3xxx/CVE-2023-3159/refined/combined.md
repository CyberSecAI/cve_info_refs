firewire: fix potential uaf in outbound\_phy\_packet\_callback()

```
&e->event and e point to the same address, and &e->event could
be freed in queue_event. So there is a potential uaf issue if
we dereference e after calling queue_event(). Fix this by adding
a temporary variable to maintain e->client in advance, this can
avoid the potential uaf issue.
