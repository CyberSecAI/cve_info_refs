  "CVE-2023-3338": {
    "description": "Multiple NetApp products incorporate Linux kernel. Linux kernel versions prior to 6.5-rc1 are susceptible to a vulnerability which when successfully exploited could lead to Denial of Service (DoS).",
    "root_cause": "A flaw in the DECnet protocol implementation which could lead to a null pointer dereference or use-after-free.  The vulnerability is caused by incorrect initialization of the dst reference counter in the `dst_alloc` function, leading to a NULL pointer dereference in the `dn_nsp_send` function when trying to send a DECnet packet.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect initialization of a reference counter",
      "Missing NULL pointer check",
      "Use-after-free vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to Denial of Service (DoS), crash or memory corruption, and probably for privilege escalation.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local user sending a crafted DECnet 'Hello' message to a local socket"
    ],
   "required_capabilities": "Local user on a system with the vulnerable DECnet protocol implementation enabled (CONFIG_DECNET=y). The attacker needs to be able to create and bind a DECnet socket.",
     "additional_details": "The DECnet subsystem has been officially removed from all longterm and stable kernel series, starting from 4.14.319, 4.19.287, 5.4.248, 5.10.185 and 5.15.118. The vulnerability was mitigated by removing the DECnet protocol implementation in affected products.  The advisory indicates that NetApp is aware of public discussion of this vulnerability."
