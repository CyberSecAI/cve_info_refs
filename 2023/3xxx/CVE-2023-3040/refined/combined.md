The read of `reverse_nesting_order` was unconditional regardless of whether the object was really a composite object or not.

# Out of Bounds Access Leading to Undefined Behavior

Low

[mskowroncf](/mskowroncf)
published
GHSA-h8rp-9622-83pg
Jun 14, 2023

## Package

lua-resty-json
(C)

## Affected versions

Up to commit 3ef9492bd3a44d9e51301d6adc3cd1789c8f534a

## Patched versions

3ef9492bd3a44d9e51301d6adc3cd1789c8f534a

## Description

### Impact

A debug function in the lua-resty-json package, up to commit id [3ef9492](https://github.com/cloudflare/lua-resty-json/commit/3ef9492bd3a44d9e51301d6adc3cd1789c8f534a) (merged in PR [#14](https://github.com/cloudflare/lua-resty-json/pull/14)) contained an out of bounds access bug that could have allowed an attacker to launch a DoS if the function was used to parse untrusted input data. It is important to note that because this debug function was only used in tests and demos, it was not exploitable in a normal environment.

### Patches

This vulnerability has been patched on [#14](https://github.com/cloudflare/lua-resty-json/pull/14)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L
