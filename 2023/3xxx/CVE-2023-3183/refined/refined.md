Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `addproduct.php` script. Specifically, the `prodname` parameter from the POST request is directly stored and displayed without any form of encoding or sanitization which allows for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS vulnerability. The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code through the `prodname` parameter in the `addproduct.php` form. This injected script is then stored in the application's database or similar storage and executed when the data is displayed on the `product.php` page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript into the application.
- **Cookie theft:** The provided example payload `<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>` demonstrates that an attacker could steal user cookies.
- **Session hijacking:**  By stealing cookies, the attacker can potentially hijack a user's session.
- **Malicious redirects:** Attackers could redirect users to phishing sites.
- **Defacement:**  The attacker can alter the appearance of the webpage.
- **Other malicious activities:**  The attacker could potentially perform a wide array of other malicious actions as if they were the legitimate user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST request:**  The attacker sends a crafted POST request to the `/opils/admin/addproduct.php` endpoint.
- **Multipart Form Data:** The POST request uses `multipart/form-data` to send various parameters including `prodname` which is used to inject the XSS payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to the vulnerable form:** The attacker needs to be able to access and submit the form on `/opils/admin/addproduct.php`. Typically this form might require administrative privileges, depending on the application setup.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerable parameter:**  The attacker must know that the `prodname` parameter is vulnerable to XSS.
- **Ability to craft a malicious payload:**  The attacker must be able to create a valid JavaScript payload.
- **Victim interaction:** A victim must visit the page (`product.php` in this case) where the injected script is displayed to trigger the XSS vulnerability.
