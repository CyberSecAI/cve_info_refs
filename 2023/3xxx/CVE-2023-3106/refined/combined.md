xfrm: fix crash in XFRM\_MSG\_GETSA netlink handler

```
If we hit any of the error conditions inside xfrm_dump_sa(), then
xfrm_state_walk_init() never gets called. However, we still call
xfrm_state_walk_done() from xfrm_dump_sa_done(), which will crash
because the state walk was never initialized properly.

We can fix this by setting cb->args[0] only after we've processed the
first element and checking this before calling xfrm_state_walk_done().

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2221501#c0)  Alex    2023-07-09 14:55:38 UTC  ``` A flaw in the Linux Kernel found in netlink_dump. When the Netlink socket receives the message(sendmsg), for the XFRM_MSG_GETSA, XFRM_MSG_GETPOLICY type message and the DUMP flag is set, it will enter the netlink_dump function for processing. When sending data to the socket multiple times, it will make sk->sk_rmem_alloc continues to accumulate, and eventually atomic_read(&sk->sk_rmem_alloc) >= sk->sk_rcvbuf will be judged as True, skipping the initialization of netlink_callback->args.  Reference: <https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/1ba5bf993c6a3142e18e68ea6452b347f9cb5635>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2221501#c4)  Alex    2023-07-12 07:04:02 UTC  ``` Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2222176](show_bug.cgi?id=2222176 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2023-3106 kernel: Netlink socket crash (null pointer deref) in netlink_dump function [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=2221501#c6)  Product Security DevOps Team    2023-07-12 11:39:38 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.
