Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-3656:

**CVE Description:**
The provided text states: "This report summarizes our findings about vulnerabilities in cashIT!, a cash register system implementing the Austrian cash registers security regulation (RKSV). Besides lack of encryption, outdated software components and low-entropy passwords, these weaknesses include a bypass of origin checks (CVE-2023-3654), unauthenticated remote database exfiltration (CVE-2023-3655), and **unauthenticated remote code with administrative privileges on the cash register host machines (CVE-2023-3656).**"

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of authentication on a component of the cashIT! system, allowing for remote code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to execute arbitrary code on the cash register host machines without authentication.
*   **Lack of Authentication:** The system lacks proper authentication mechanisms for certain functions, allowing unauthorized access and control.
*   **Administrative Privileges:** The remote code execution vulnerability allows the attacker to gain administrative privileges on the target machines.
*  **Outdated Software Components:** The report mentions outdated software components as an issue, which could introduce additional vulnerabilities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Full System Compromise:** Successful exploitation grants the attacker administrative privileges, enabling them to take complete control of the affected cash register systems.
*   **Data Breach:**  While not the primary impact of this specific CVE,  the compromised systems could expose sensitive data like sales data, user account information (including employee data), customer contact information, credentials for the online signature creation unit, and credentials to the backend system of a card payment processor.
*   **System Disruption:** Attackers could disable the cash register system, disrupting business operations for the affected restaurants.
*   **Malware Installation:** Attackers can install malware on the compromised systems, leading to further malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over the network.
*   **Unauthenticated Requests:**  The attacker can send unauthenticated requests to the affected component to achieve remote code execution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the cash register system. The report states that over 200 cash register installations in Austrian restaurants are accessible over the Internet, making it feasible for attackers to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Technical Skills:** The attacker requires technical skills to craft the necessary requests and exploit the remote code execution vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The report indicates that the vulnerability affects over 200 cash register installations that are accessible over the Internet.
*   Daily cloud backups of numerous cash register installations are also vulnerable, which includes detailed sales data, user account info, and other sensitive information.
*   The associated website for the company cashit.at advertises the product as RKSV compliant and provides online updates/backup functionality, which may be how this vulnerability was introduced.
