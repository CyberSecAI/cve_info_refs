| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2217926#c0)  Dhananjay Arunesh    2023-06-27 13:45:35 UTC  ``` The REST endpoint to retrieve cache configurations doesn't check for ADMIN permissions: GET /rest/v2/caches/{cacheName}?action=config GET /rest/v2/caches The cache configuration may contain information about filesystem paths and allowed security roles which should not be viewable by non-administrators. The first method should return a 403 in case the user doesn't have appropriate permissions. The second method should omit the full cache configuration from the response (it returns other, non-security sensitive information). The methods require authentication, but once authenticated, any user can invoke them successfully.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=2217926#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2023-09-28 11:55:39 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Data Grid 8.4.4  Via RHSA-2023:5396 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:5396](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023%3A5396)   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2240036#c0)  Chess Hazlett    2023-09-21 12:57:46 UTC  ``` Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor vulnerability in Apache Software Foundation Apache MINA. In SFTP servers implemented using Apache MINA SSHD that use a RootedFileSystem, logged users may be able to discover "exists/does not exist" information about items outside the rooted tree via paths including parent navigation ("..") beyond the root, or involving symlinks. This issue affects Apache MINA: from 1.0 before 2.10.
