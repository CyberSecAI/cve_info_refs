**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from the fact that even when the "Package Registry" feature is disabled for a project, the underlying API endpoints for accessing Composer packages are still available to unauthorized users. This allows them to retrieve package metadata and download packages, bypassing the intended access restrictions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Inconsistent access control between the UI setting and the API endpoints.
- Lack of proper authorization checks on the API endpoints for retrieving package information, allowing unauthorized users to access and download packages.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized users can disclose, download, and use Composer packages that are intended to be private or inaccessible even when the "Package Registry" feature is disabled.
- This could lead to potential security risks, such as exposing proprietary code or intellectual property, or unauthorized use of internal packages.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the GitLab API using the `curl` command.
- The attacker crafts specific API requests to retrieve the package hash, package name, package version, and then download the package.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to know the group ID of the victim's project.
- The attacker needs a GitLab account to perform API requests.
- The attacker does not need to be a member of the group or project to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs a personal access token to interact with the API.
