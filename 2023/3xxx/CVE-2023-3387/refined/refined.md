Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-3387

**Root Cause:** Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the `lana_text_to_image` and `lana_text_to_img` shortcodes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-provided input, specifically within the shortcode attributes. This allows attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code into pages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript that will execute in the browsers of users who view the page containing the vulnerable shortcode.
*   **Account Takeover:** Exploitation of the XSS vulnerability could lead to session hijacking or account compromise.
*   **Malicious Redirects:** Attackers could redirect users to malicious websites.
*   **Data Theft:** An attacker could steal sensitive information displayed on the page or stored in the user's browser.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Shortcode Injection:** Attackers inject malicious code through the `text`, `class`, or `alt` attributes of the `lana_text_to_image` or `lana_text_to_img` shortcodes.
*   **Page/Post Insertion:** Vulnerable shortcodes are inserted into WordPress pages or posts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have at least Contributor-level permissions within the WordPress site, allowing them to create or edit pages and posts.

**Technical Details:**

* The vulnerability exists in the `lana_text_to_image_shortcode` function within the `lana-text-to-image.php` file.
*   The plugin uses `htmlspecialchars_decode()` on the shortcode `text` attribute, which is insufficient and doesn't prevent XSS.
*   The plugin utilizes `sprintf` to output the image HTML tag, which, when combined with the lack of proper sanitization, allows for XSS injection through the `alt` attribute
*  The fix involves using `esc_attr()` on the attributes to prevent XSS.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was patched in version 1.1.0 of the Lana Text to Image plugin.
*   The Wordfence vulnerability database entry for CVE-2023-3387 provides a more detailed explanation of the vulnerability along with remediation steps.
*   The patch includes using `esc_attr()` on the base64 encoded image data and the classes string before outputting to the HTML `img` tag.
*  The `add_action` for the TinyMCE button was changed from `init` to `admin_init`.
