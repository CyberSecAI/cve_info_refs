Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The `failures` action in `Import::GithubController` does not perform authorization checks, allowing any authenticated user to access import errors of any project imported via GitHub.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Inadequate Authorization:** The endpoint lacks proper authorization, failing to verify if the user is the owner of the project before exposing import error details. This constitutes an authorization bypass.
- **Information Exposure:** The endpoint exposes sensitive information about GitHub import failures, including details of the failures, the imported project, and user information that could be present in import error messages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** A malicious user can gain insight into the import process of other projects, which can include details of why the import failed (e.g., authentication errors, etc.), which could give them insight to potentially exploit a different attack vector.
- **Privacy Violation:** An unauthorized user can see import error details that should be private to the project owner, resulting in a privacy breach.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a GET request to the `/import/github/failures` endpoint with a `project_id` parameter.
    - `https://gitlab.com/import/github/failures?project_id=PROJECT_ID`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the GitLab instance.
- The attacker does not need to be a member or have any privileges on the target project. They only need the `project_id` of the imported project to see its import errors.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided patch restricts access to only users that created the project (`created_by(current_user)`).
- The `Import::GithubController#cancel_all` action does perform the correct authorization.
- The information exposed includes `created_at`, `exception_class`, `message`, `full_message`, and `source`.
- The description links to the exact lines of code where the vulnerability exists.
