## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# All-in-one Floating Contact Form < 2.1.2 - Admin+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

1. In the plugin settings, open an element and navigate to the 2nd step.
2. Select a custom channel and add the payload `javascript:alert(document.cookie);` to the "Link" field and save.
3. When visiting the website, clicking on the link will result in XSS.
