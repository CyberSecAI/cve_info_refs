{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user-supplied input in the `sidx` and `sord` parameters of the `/RoadFlowCore/Log/Query` endpoint.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL injection vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database, potentially leading to:\n  - Data exfiltration (e.g., extracting sensitive information using `extractvalue`)\n  - Data modification/deletion\n  - Denial of service (e.g., by using `sleep` function to delay responses)\n  - Full database compromise.",
    "attack_vectors": "HTTP POST request to the `/RoadFlowCore/Log/Query` endpoint. The attacker can manipulate the values of the `sidx` and `sord` parameters within the request body.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker must have access to the application and be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint. No authentication is explicitly required for this exploit based on the provided information as the requests include existing session cookies."
