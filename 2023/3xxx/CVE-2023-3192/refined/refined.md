Based on the provided commit diff, the vulnerability relates to session fixation.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of session IDs when a user switches accounts or logs in within the Froxlor application. The session ID is not regenerated in certain scenarios which could allow an attacker to hijack the user's session.

**Weaknesses:**
- Session ID is not being regenerated upon user switch (admin_customers.php).
- Session ID is not being regenerated when switching back to admin (admin_index.php).
- Session ID is not being regenerated upon successful login (index.php).

**Impact:**
- Session hijacking: An attacker could potentially use a previously captured session ID to impersonate a user.
- Privilege escalation: An attacker might be able to gain access to an administrative session by using a valid session ID from a lower privileged user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker can obtain a session ID through various means, like eavesdropping on network traffic or if the session id is exposed via javascript.
- Then, the attacker attempts to access the application using this obtained session ID.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to obtain a valid session ID. This could happen if an attacker is on the same network as the user or if they can intercept the user's network traffic.
- An attacker must have a way to inject a previously captured session id into the victim's browser.
