## Description

OCSInventory allow stored email template with special
characters that lead to a Stored cross-site Scripting.

## Vulnerability

A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been identified
in OCSInventory-ocsreports, which could potentially allow an
attacker to steal sensitive data such as session cookies.
It is also possible to steal the password hash if the attacker
changes the server state to debug, this due to the server in
debug mode displaying the hash.This could be exploited if
the target is an administrator with a current login session.

## Exploitation

ocsreports -> Configuration -> Notification -> Customize
Template and Upload a HTML file with our payload:

## specifics of solution

### Inventory management

Since 2001, **OCS Inventory** has been looking to make hardware and software inventory of computers more efficient. OCS Inventory queries its **agents** to know the **soft and hard composition** of each machine, each server. OCS Inventory also queries the network to discover the active elements that cannot receive an agent. Since version 2.0, OCS Inventory integrates the functionality of **SNMP scans**.

The main purpose of this integration is to complement the data collected by **ipdiscover.** Using SNMP scans will allow you to insert a lot of information about your network hardware: printers, switches, computers (which do not have an OCS agent installed), etc. SNMP scans will be performed by OCS agents based on IP addresses collected by ipdiscover.

### The remote deployment

**OCS Inventory** includes the **package deployment** feature, in order not to control, but to ensure uniformity of the software environments present on the network. From the central management server, you can upload the packets that will be downloaded using HTTP/HTTPS and launched by the **agent** on the client computer. OCS remote deployment is configurable so that sent packets impact the network’s quality of service as little as possible. OCS is used as a deployment tool on parks with **more than 150 000 machines**.
