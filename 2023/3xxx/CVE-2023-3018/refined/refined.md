- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application lacks proper session validation and authorization checks, allowing a staff user to access administrative functionalities via force browsing.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken Access Control (specifically, Insecure Direct Object Reference - IDOR).
- **Impact of exploitation:** A staff user can change the username and password of any user, including the admin user, leading to potential account takeover.
- **Attack vectors:** Force browsing to admin-only URLs using an authenticated staff user session.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated staff user.
