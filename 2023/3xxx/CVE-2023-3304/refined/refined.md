Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed by the commit:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the message deletion logic within the `messages.php` file. Initially, the code attempts to delete a message and only checks if the deletion was successful ( `$returnCode`). If it fails, it proceeds to check if the user attempting the deletion is the sender of the message (`$delMessage->getValue('msg_usr_id_sender') === $gCurrentUserId`). However, the initial deletion attempt does not check user permissions which allows any user with a valid message uuid to delete the message without checking if they are the sender

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate Authorization Check:** The code attempts to delete a message before verifying if the user has the rights to delete it. This leads to an authorization bypass, where a user can delete messages they did not send.
*   **Logic Error:** The logic dictates that if the first deletion fails, the script will then perform the user check and try to delete the message again, which will be successful if the user is indeed the sender. However, if the first deletion attempt had been successful, it would skip the user check altogether, allowing a non sender to delete the message.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Message Deletion:** Attackers can delete messages sent by other users, leading to data loss and disruption of communication.
*   **Potential Data Manipulation:** Deleting messages could alter the context of conversations, potentially leading to misunderstandings or manipulation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Request Manipulation:** An attacker could directly call the message deletion functionality with the UUID of a message, bypassing the intended authorization check.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Admidio platform.
*   **Message UUID Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know the UUID of the message they want to delete.

**Code Snippet Explanation:**
```php
// Function to delete message
$returnCode = $delMessage->delete(); // attempts deletion without checking if the user is the sender

if ($returnCode) {
    echo 'done';
} else {
    echo 'delete not OK';
    // only delete messages of the current user is allowed
    if ($delMessage->getValue('msg_usr_id_sender') === $gCurrentUserId) { //user check after the initial deletion attempt
        $returnCode = $delMessage->delete();

        if ($returnCode) {
            echo 'done';
            exit();
        }
    }
}
```

This commit fixes the issue by adding the user check *before* the first attempt at deleting the message, as seen in the diff.

This ensures that only the sender of a message can delete it, preventing unauthorized deletions.
