      "root_cause": "The Framebuffer Console (fbcon) in the Linux Kernel lacks checks when providing a `font->width` and `font->height` greater than 32 to the `fbcon_set_font` function, leading to a shift-out-of-bounds.",

The specific mechanisms will vary based on the context but generally would require either a root or privileged user or the ability to influence the kernel's command line parameters.",
