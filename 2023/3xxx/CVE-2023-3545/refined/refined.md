CVE-2023-3545
```

The provided content describes a security vulnerability, CVE-2023-3545, in Chamilo LMS versions up to v1.11.20, specifically affecting Windows and Apache installations.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper sanitization in the `htaccess2txt()` function within `main/inc/lib/fileUpload.lib.php`. This function performs a case-sensitive replacement of ".htaccess" and ".HTACCESS" with "htaccess.txt". Windows file systems are case-insensitive, allowing attackers to bypass this protection by using variations like ".Htaccess" or ".HTAccess".
- **Weakness:** CWE-178: Improper Handling of Case Sensitivity.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE). An attacker can upload a specially crafted `.htaccess` file to inject PHP code through other file uploads.
- **Attack Vectors:**
  - Unauthenticated attackers can chain this vulnerability with unauthenticated arbitrary file write vulnerabilities such as CVE-2023-3533 to achieve RCE.
  - Authenticated attackers with Trainer role or above can exploit the vulnerability directly.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
  - For unauthenticated RCE: Ability to exploit an arbitrary file write vulnerability (e.g., CVE-2023-3533) in addition to this case sensitivity issue.
  - For authenticated RCE: A user account with at least Trainer role privileges.
- **Exploit Conditions:**
  - Target system must be running on Windows with an Apache web server.
