Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-3051

**Vulnerability Description:**

The vulnerability is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue found in the "Page Builder by AZEXO" WordPress plugin, specifically in versions up to and including 1.27.133. It stems from insufficient sanitization of user input and lack of output escaping when handling the `azh_post` shortcode.

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is the plugin's failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input and escape output when processing the `azh_post` shortcode. This allows malicious script injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin allows the injection of arbitrary web scripts that are stored within the WordPress database, resulting in persistent XSS.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin does not properly sanitize user input that is used in the `azh_post` shortcode.
*   **Lack of Output Escaping:** The plugin fails to properly escape the output of the `azh_post` shortcode, leading to script execution in the browser when a page using the shortcode is rendered.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the browsers of users who access a page containing the malicious shortcode.
*   **Account Hijacking**: The injected JavaScript could be used to steal cookies and potentially hijack user accounts.
*   **Website Defacement**: Attackers could alter the content and appearance of the website.
*  **Malware Distribution:** Malicious scripts could redirect users to malicious sites or trigger malware downloads.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Shortcode Injection:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code within the `azh_post` shortcode attributes. The `azh_post` shortcode is used to display the content of another post/page. 

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Contributor or higher:** An attacker needs to have at least contributor-level privileges to create or edit posts/pages, where the malicious shortcode can be inserted.

**Additional Information**
* The vulnerable code can be found in the `azexo_html.php` file at lines 2845 and 2856.
*  The plugin does not appear to have a patch available for this vulnerability.

In summary, this plugin has an XSS vulnerability due to the way it handles user-supplied content within the `azh_post` shortcode. An attacker with contributor privileges can inject malicious scripts that will be executed whenever a user visits a page containing the injected shortcode.
