Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the plugin's failure to sanitize and escape a parameter before outputting it back into the page. This lack of proper input validation and output encoding leads to a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Reflected XSS:** The primary vulnerability is a Reflected XSS, meaning the malicious script is injected through the URL and reflected back to the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser.
- This can lead to various malicious activities such as:
    - Stealing cookies and session tokens, potentially leading to account hijacking.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Displaying phishing pages or other manipulated content.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.
    - Admin users are particularly vulnerable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the XSS payload.
- The victim, typically a logged-in admin, is tricked into opening the malicious URL. This could be achieved through social engineering tactics or by embedding the malicious link on another website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to craft and distribute a malicious URL.
- The attacker must be able to entice a victim, especially a high-privilege user (admin), to click the malicious link.
- No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability but a logged-in user is required to make the exploit successful.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerable parameter is `deletePostStatus`.
- The vulnerability affects versions of Blog2Social plugin prior to 7.2.1.
- The vulnerability is classified as CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation).
- The CVSS score is 7.1, indicating a High severity vulnerability.
