**CVE-2023-3526**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to improper neutralization of input during web page generation, specifically a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the license viewer page.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of a user's browser, potentially stealing cookies or performing other malicious actions.
*   **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be triggered using a crafted GET request to the license viewer page (e.g., `https://$IP/cgi-bin/p/license?pkg=netsnmp&txt=15"><script>alert("document.cookie")</script>`). A malicious link can be embedded on a page controlled by the attacker. When a victim opens the page with the link, the script executes in their browser.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker can be unauthenticated and remote, needing to trick a user into accessing a malicious link.
