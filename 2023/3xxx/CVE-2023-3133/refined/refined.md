### CVE-2023-3133
The provided content relates to CVE-2023-3133.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The Tutor LMS plugin does not implement adequate permission checks for REST API endpoints.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) and Broken Access Control. The plugin exposes REST API endpoints that allow unauthenticated access to lesson resources.

**Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker can access sensitive lesson data that should only be available to logged-in users. This can lead to unauthorized information disclosure.

**Attack vectors:** By crafting specific HTTP requests to the exposed REST API endpoints, an attacker can retrieve lesson data.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker only needs network access to the vulnerable WordPress site and no authentication is required. They need to be able to send HTTP requests.

**More Details:**
The proof of concept provided demonstrates the vulnerability by showing how to retrieve course, topic, and lesson IDs using the REST API and then how to access lesson data using the obtained IDs, without being logged in. The vulnerable endpoints are:
- `/wp-json/tutor/v1/courses`
- `/wp-json/tutor/v1/course-topic/<course-id>`
- `/wp-json/tutor/v1/lesson/<topic-id>`
The vulnerability is fixed in version 2.2.1 of the plugin.
