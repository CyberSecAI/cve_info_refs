{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input being directly used in an SQL query.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database server, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion, and in some cases, complete system compromise. The provided examples cause a time-based blind SQL injection, confirming the vulnerability's existence.",
    "attack_vectors": "HTTP POST request to `/chat/ajax.php?action=read_msg` with a crafted `convo_id` parameter.",
      "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to send an HTTP POST request to the vulnerable endpoint and the ability to intercept or monitor the response time."
