    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a use-after-free error in the `av1_svc_check_reset_layer_rc` function within the libaom library. The function uses the `svc->number_temporal_layers` to calculate a layer index. By manipulating the video encoder configuration through JavaScript code, an attacker can force the value of `svc->number_temporal_layers` to zero, which results in a negative index. This negative index leads to out-of-bounds heap memory access.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Use-after-free",
         "Out-of-bounds heap memory access"
      ],
      "impact": "Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to a heap use-after-free or heap overflow. This can lead to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure.",
      "attack_vector": "The attack vector is a specially crafted webpage containing malicious JavaScript code. This JavaScript code forces Chrome to reconfigure the video encoder multiple times with different configurations, ultimately leading to the vulnerable code path in the libaom library.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to serve a malicious HTML page to the victim. The attacker does not need any special permissions or prior access to the victim's machine. The attack relies on the victim opening the crafted web page with a vulnerable version of Chrome.",
        "additional_details": "The vulnerability is triggered by continuously reconfiguring the video encoder through JavaScript. The `SetUpAomConfig` function is called to set up the video encoder configuration, which includes the SVC parameters. The attacker can exploit a flaw in how the number of temporal layers is handled during reconfiguration. By creating a video encoder with the scalabilityMode set first and then reconfiguring it without that option,  `svc_params.number_temporal_layers` is not initialized, which leads to `av1_svc_check_reset_layer_rc` being called with a zero value for `svc->number_temporal_layers`. This results in a negative index access when the macro `LAYER_IDS_TO_IDX` is used, leading to the out-of-bounds access."
