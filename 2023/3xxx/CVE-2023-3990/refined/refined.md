Based on the provided content, here's the analysis:

**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `content_title` and `style` parameters within the `/mcms/search.do` endpoint. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that executes in the victim's browser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Unvalidated user input: The application directly uses the values provided in the POST request without sanitization or encoding, leading to XSS vulnerability.
- Lack of output encoding: The application doesn't encode or escape the user-supplied data before outputting it into the HTML context.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript execution in the victim's browser.
- This could lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Cookie theft
    - Defacement of the website
    - Redirecting the victim to malicious websites
    - Other malicious actions depending on the attacker's injected script.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP POST request to `/mcms/search.do` with malicious JavaScript code injected into the `content_title` and `style` parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to send HTTP POST requests to the target server.
- No authentication seems to be required to trigger the vulnerability from the provided request.

**Technical Details:**

The attacker sends a POST request like the following:
```
POST /mcms/search.do HTTP/1.1
Host: ip:port
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; rv:78.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/78.0
Content-Length: 59
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.7
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Cookie: SHRIOSESSIONID-GOV=4b791a23-fd28-468c-8f24-9d303aebc88f
Origin: http://ip:port

Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
Accept-Encoding: gzip
content_title=1&style=%3CScRiPt%3Ealert(123)%3C%2FScRiPt%3E
```
The `style` parameter contains the payload `%3CScRiPt%3Ealert(123)%3C%2FScRiPt%3E` which is URL-encoded `<script>alert(123)</script>`.
When this request is processed, the injected JavaScript code is rendered into the HTML response, leading to the execution of the alert.

The report also indicates that the issue has been resolved in the production environment, but no details of the fix is provided.
