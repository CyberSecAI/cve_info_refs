**Root cause of vulnerability:** External Control of File Name or Path (CWE-73)

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   The Advantech R-SeeNet application allows low-level users to access and load the content of local files. This suggests that the application does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input when constructing file paths, allowing users to access arbitrary files within the system.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to access files on the system. This could lead to information disclosure, allowing an attacker to steal sensitive data, potentially leading to a complete compromise of the system and further network penetration.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is exploitable remotely.
*   Attack complexity is low.
*   Requires a low-level user account to exploit.
*   No user interaction required for exploitation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to have a low-level user account within the Advantech R-SeeNet application to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker also requires network access to the application.

**Additional details:**
*   The vulnerability affects Advantech R-SeeNet versions 2.4.22 and prior.
*   The vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 with the vector string (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).
