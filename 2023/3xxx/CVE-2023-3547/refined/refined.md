- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly check nonce values in several actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can force an administrator to perform unintended actions, such as rejecting quotes in the database.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL and tricks an authenticated administrator into visiting it, which then triggers the vulnerable action.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick an administrator into visiting a malicious URL. They do not need to be authenticated themselves.
