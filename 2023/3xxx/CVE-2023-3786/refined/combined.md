Product & Service Introduction:
===============================
KOMET is an interactive, multifunctional kiosk and specially designed for the fast food industry. Available as a
wall-mounted or
freestanding model, its design is especially adapted to foodservice such as take-aways or fast food in system catering.
The kiosk
features a 27 YUNO touch system in portrait mode, an ODP 444 thermal receipt printer, a payment terminal and a 2D
barcode scanner.
With a click, the customer selects, books, orders, purchases and pays directly at the kiosk. The system offers the
possibility to
manage customer cards and promotions. Queue management can also be optimized.

Technical Details & Description:
================================
A kiosk mode escalation vulnerability has been discovered in the operating system of the Aures Komet Booking & POS
Terminal
(Windows 10 IoT Enterprise) used by the german company immergrün franchise gmbh. The security vulnerability allows
local attackers
to bypass the kiosk mode to compromise the local file system and applications.

It is possible for local attackers to escalate out of the kiosk mode in the aures komet booking & pos terminal. Local
attackers are
able to use the touch functionalities in the aures komet booking & pos terminal system to escalate with higher
privileges. The security
vulnerability is located in the context menu function of the extended menu on touch interaction. Attackers with
restricted low local
privileged access to the booking service front display are able to execute files, can unrestricted download contents or
exfiltrate
local file-system information of the compromised windows based operating system.

No keyboard or connections are required to manipulate the service booking and payment terminal. The booking and payment
terminal system
vulnerability requires no user user interaction to become exploited and can only be triggered by local physical device
access.

Vulnerable Operating System(s):
[+] Windows 10 (IoT Enterprise)

Affected Component(s):
[+] Context Menu

Affected Function(s):
[+] Web Search
[+] Share (Teilen)

Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The local vulnerability can be exploited by local attackers with physical device access without user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to
continue.

PoC: Sheet
Touch Display => Select Food Item => Highlight Text
=> Open Context Menu => Extend Context Menu => Web-Search
=> Browser => Local File System => Compromised!

Manual steps to reproduce the vulnerability ...
01.  First touch the monitor display to move on from standby
02.  Select an food item from the menu of immergrün (we recomment the cesar wraps)
03.  Push the information button of the selected food item
04.  Push twice via touch to mark the selected food item text
05.  Press a third time after you have marked the context by holding it down on the touch display
06.  Now the function context menu of the operating system for highlighted text appears
07.  On the context menu appearing 3 dots to extend the visible function menu
08.  Select the web-search or share function for the highlighted content in the context menu
09.  The browser of the operating system opens on the main front screen
10.1 By now you are able to download an execute executables using the browser without any blacklisting (Unrestricted
Web Access - Download of Files)
10.2 Attackers can open websites on the fron display to manipulate the visible content (Scam & Spam - Web Messages &
Web Context)
10.3 Attackers are able to manipulate via browser debugger the web content displayed from immergrün (Phishing - Formular
& Banking Information)
10.4 Attackers are able to access the local file system and compromise it by reconfiguration with privileged user
account (Local File-System - Privilege Escaltion)
10.5 Attackers are able to infect the local operating system with ransomware or other malicious programs and scripts
(Malware - Ransomware, Keylogger, Trojan-Banking & Co.)
10.6 Attackers are able to exfiltrate data from the local computer system using web connecting and available protocols
10.7 Attackers are able to perform man in the middle attacks from the local computer system
11.0 Successful reproduce of the security vulnerability!

- 4.png (Awareness)

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The security vulnerabilities can be patched by following steps:
1.  Disable the content menu to extend
2.  Disable the context menu
3.  Disable web-search
4.  Disable to mark text inputs & texts
5.  Disallow to open not white listed websites
6.  Disable to download files
7.  Restrict the web-browser access
8.  Disallow the file browser
9.  Disable the browser debug modus
10. Reconfigure the local firewall to allow and disallow connections
11. Change the access permission to prevent exfiltration

Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the vulnerability in the local booking and payment terminal system is considered high.
The issue can be easily exploited by local attackers with simple interaction via the touch display.
Once compromised, the attackers can fully manipulate the computer's operating system and use it misuse
it for further simple or more complex attack scenarios.
