### Description

The Elementor Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized data modification due to a missing capability check on the update\_page\_option function in versions up to, and including, 3.11.6. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber-level capabilities to update arbitrary site options, which can lead to privilege escalation.

Wordfence blocked **82 attacks** targeting this vulnerability in the past 24 hours.

# High severity vulnerability fixed in WordPress Elementor Pro plugin.

* by [Jerome Bruandet](https://blog.nintechnet.com/author/bruandet/)
* Posted on [March 28, 2023 - 12:17pm [+0700]March 28, 2023 - 12:25pm [+0700]](https://blog.nintechnet.com/high-severity-vulnerability-fixed-in-wordpress-elementor-pro-plugin/)

Elementor Pro, a popular page builder plugin for WordPress, fixed a broken access control vulnerability affecting versions <=3.11.6 that could allow full site takeover.

### Authenticated Arbitrary WordPress Options Change

CVSS v3.1: [8.8 (High)](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

> Note: The vulnerability affects the premium version of the plugin, not the free one available at wordpress.org.

When Elementor Pro is installed on a site that has WooCommerce activated, it loads its “elementor-pro/modules/woocommerce/module.php” component, which registers a couple of AJAX actions:

```
/**
 * Register Ajax Actions.
 *
 * Registers ajax action used by the Editor js.
 *
 * @since 3.5.0
 *
 * @param Ajax $ajax
 */
public function register_ajax_actions( Ajax $ajax ) {
   // `woocommerce_update_page_option` is called in the editor save-show-modal.js.
   $ajax->register_ajax_action( 'pro_woocommerce_update_page_option', [ $this, 'update_page_option' ] );
   $ajax->register_ajax_action( 'pro_woocommerce_mock_notices', [ $this, 'woocommerce_mock_notices' ] );
}
```

One of them is `pro_woocommerce_update_page_option`, which is used by Elementor’s built-in editor. It calls `update_option`, a function that can be used to modify WordPress options in the database, with two user-submitted input:

```
/**
 * Update Page Option.
 *
 * Ajax action can be used to update any WooCommerce option.
 *
 * @since 3.5.0
 *
 * @param array $data
 */
public function update_page_option( $data ) {
   update_option( $data['option_name'], $data['editor_post_id'] );
}

```

This function is supposed to allow the Administrator or the Shop Manager to update some specific WooCommercerce options, but user input aren’t validated and the function lacks a capability check to restrict its access to a high privileged user only.

Elementor uses its own AJAX handler to manage most of its AJAX actions, including `pro_woocommerce_update_page_option`, with the global `elementor_ajax` action. It is located in the “elementor/core/common/modules/ajax/module.php” script of the free version (which is required to run Elementor Pro) :

```
/**
 * Handle ajax request.
 *
 * Verify ajax nonce, and run all the registered actions for this request.
 *
 * Fired by `wp_ajax_elementor_ajax` action.
 *
 * @since 2.0.0
 * @access public
 */
public function handle_ajax_request() {
   if ( ! $this->verify_request_nonce() ) {
      $this->add_response_data( false, esc_html__( 'Token Expired.', 'elementor' ) )
         ->send_error( Exceptions::UNAUTHORIZED );
   }
   ...

```

We can see that it includes a nonce check that could potentially prevent bad actors from exploiting the vulnerability. But the nonce and all JS code related to it is loaded via the `admin_enqueue_scripts` hook in “elementor/core/common/app.php”:

```
add_action( 'admin_enqueue_scripts', [ $this, 'register_scripts' ] );

```

It therefore leaks in the source of the page to all logged in users:

![](/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/elementor-3.11.6-vulnerability-01.png)

An authenticated attacker can leverage the vulnerability to create an administrator account by enabling registration (`users_can_register`) and setting the default role (`default_role`) to “administrator”, change the administrator email address (`admin_email`) or, as shown below, redirect all traffic to an external malicious website by changing `siteurl` among many other possibilities:

```
MariaDB [example]> SELECT * FROM `wp_options` WHERE `option_name`='siteurl';
+-----------+-------------+------------------+----------+
| option_id | option_name | option_value     | autoload |
+-----------+-------------+------------------+----------+
|         1 | siteurl     | https://evil.com | yes      |
+-----------+-------------+------------------+----------+
1 row in set (0.001 sec)
```

Because the vulnerable component requires WooCommerce to be installed, an unauthenticated user can create a WooCommerce customer account, log in and exploit the vulnerability too (WooCommerce customers can access the back-end by adding `wc-ajax=1` to the query, e.g., `https://example.com/wp-admin/?wc-ajax=1`).

### Timeline

The vulnerability was discovered and reported to the authors on March 18, 2023, and a new version 3.11.7 was released on March 22, 2023.
