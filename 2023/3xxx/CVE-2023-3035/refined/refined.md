Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the identified vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input within the "schedule content" and "schedule detailed description" fields of the calendar feature. This allows attackers to inject malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application does not properly encode or sanitize user inputs before rendering them on the page.
*   **Vulnerable Fields:** The "schedule content" and "schedule detailed description" fields are vulnerable to XSS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
*   **Account Takeover:** Attackers could potentially steal session cookies or other sensitive information.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could modify the content of the page or redirect the user to a malicious site.
*   **Phishing:** Attackers could inject login forms into the page and steal user credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious Input:** An attacker inserts malicious JavaScript code into the vulnerable "schedule content" and "schedule detailed description" fields when creating or modifying a calendar event.
*   **View Event:** When a user views the compromised calendar event, the malicious script is executed within their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:**  The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to create or modify schedule events.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable fields to insert the malicious code.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by a team from Shandong University.
*   The provided issue report includes screenshots demonstrating the XSS payload being executed in the application.
*   There is a comment suggesting that this vulnerability might be less important because it requires an authenticated user, but this is not accurate, as XSS can still cause significant harm even with authenticated users.
*   The issue was closed in the repository, so it should be remediated.
