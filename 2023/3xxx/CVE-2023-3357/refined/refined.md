The provided content is a patch for the Linux kernel that addresses a potential NULL pointer dereference vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `dma_alloc_coherent` function, which is used to allocate DMA-coherent memory, may return a NULL pointer if allocation fails. The original code did not check for this failure, leading to a potential NULL pointer dereference if the allocation failed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing NULL pointer check after a call to `dma_alloc_coherent`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- If the memory allocation fails and the return value is not checked, the program proceeds to use this NULL pointer, leading to a kernel crash or other undefined behavior, potentially causing a denial-of-service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Triggering a condition where `dma_alloc_coherent` fails.
- This could be achieved by exhausting memory resources or by other system-specific limitations related to DMA.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to influence or cause a situation in the kernel where a DMA memory allocation fails. This could involve an attacker with kernel-level privileges or a situation where a user-mode program could indirectly trigger such allocation within the kernel module.
