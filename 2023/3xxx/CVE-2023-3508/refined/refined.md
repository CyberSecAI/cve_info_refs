The provided content relates to CVE-2023-3508.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The WooCommerce Pre-Orders plugin has a flawed CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) check when processing its tab actions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  CSRF vulnerability: The plugin fails to properly validate the origin of requests for tab actions, allowing attackers to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can make a logged-in admin perform unauthorized actions, such as:
    - Emailing pre-order customers
    - Changing the release date of pre-orders
    - Marking all pre-orders of a specific product as complete
    - Canceling pre-orders

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page containing a form that submits a request to the vulnerable plugin's admin interface.
- The attacker lures a logged-in administrator into opening this malicious page in their browser.
- Upon the page load, the browser will automatically submit the form to the vulnerable plugin, executing the attacker's desired actions on behalf of the logged-in administrator.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create an HTML page and deliver it to a logged-in administrator.
- The attacker does not require any authentication to the WordPress site.
- The attack relies on social engineering, since it requires the administrator to open the malicious page.
