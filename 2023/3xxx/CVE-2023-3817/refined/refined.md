  "CVE-2023-3817": {
    "description": "Checking excessively long DH keys or parameters may be very slow. Applications that use the functions DH_check(), DH_check_ex() or EVP_PKEY_param_check() to check a DH key or DH parameters may experience long delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service.",
    "root_cause": "The function DH_check() performs various checks on DH parameters. A large q parameter value can trigger an overly long computation during some of these checks. A correct q value, if present, cannot be larger than the modulus p parameter, thus it is unnecessary to perform these checks if q is larger than p.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Denial of Service (DoS) due to excessive computation time in DH key or parameter checks"
    ],
    "impact": "Applications using DH_check(), DH_check_ex(), or EVP_PKEY_param_check() might experience long delays, leading to a potential Denial of Service if keys/parameters are from untrusted sources.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network access is needed to exploit this vulnerability"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to supply a DH key or parameters with an excessively large q value."
