Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-3080

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of email subjects within the WP Mail Catcher plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthenticated attackers can inject arbitrary web scripts into the plugin's admin pages.
- When a user accesses a page containing the injected script, the script will execute. This could allow an attacker to perform actions as the user, potentially leading to account compromise or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending an email with a malicious payload in the subject. The plugin stores the email data including the subject in the database. When the logged email information is displayed on the plugin's admin page, the stored XSS payload is executed in the user's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Unauthenticated attacker can send an email with a malicious payload in the subject.
- The attacker does not require any existing user privileges.

**Additional Details from the provided content:**
- The vulnerability was present in WP Mail Catcher versions up to and including 2.1.2.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.1.3 by improving XSS filtering and HTML detection.
- The fix involves sanitizing data with `wp_kses`, `htmlspecialchars`,  and removing potentially harmful tags.
- The plugin uses `GeneralHelper::filterHtml()` to sanitize input now instead of  `htmlspecialchars()` directly.
- The `sanitiseForQuery` function was renamed to `sanitiseForDbQuery`, and its usage was updated accordingly.
- The vulnerable `sanitiseInput` function, which was used by `BuddyPress.php` and `WpMail.php`, is removed and replaced with `GeneralHelper::filterHtml()`.
- The `MailAdminTable.php` class now uses the `runHtmlSpecialChars()` method instead of  `GeneralHelper::sanitiseHtmlspecialchars()`.
