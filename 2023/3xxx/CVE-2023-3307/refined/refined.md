The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in version 1.0.0 of the MINICAL application.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application fails to properly sanitize user input in the `search_query` parameter of the booking search functionality, leading to a SQL injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application directly incorporates user-supplied input into a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious SQL code, which can potentially lead to:
    - Data exfiltration: Gaining access to sensitive data stored in the database.
    - Data modification: Altering or deleting data within the database.
    - Privilege escalation: Potentially gaining unauthorized access to higher-level functionalities through database manipulation.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/booking/show_bookings/` endpoint with a malicious single quote in the `search_query` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the MINICAL application and able to access the booking search functionality.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
