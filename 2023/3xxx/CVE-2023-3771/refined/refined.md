Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to an open redirect in the `apply_redirection.php` file of the 't1' theme. The application takes user-controlled input in the `url_now` and `url_js` parameters without proper validation.
* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Unauthenticated open redirect vulnerability.
* **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can craft a malicious URL using the vulnerable parameters and trick users into visiting that URL. This can redirect users to an attacker-controlled website, potentially leading to phishing attacks, malware distribution, or other malicious activities.
* **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is a crafted URL that includes the vulnerable parameters (`url_now` and `url_js`) in the `apply_redirection.php` file.
* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker requires no authentication and can initiate the attack remotely by sending the crafted URL to the target. The user must click the malicious link to be redirected.
