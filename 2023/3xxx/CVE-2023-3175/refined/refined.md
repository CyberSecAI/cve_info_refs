- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in certain settings fields, specifically within the "multi" fields of the Language Center settings page. This lack of sanitization allows for the injection of malicious JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that executes in the victim's browser when they access the affected settings page. This allows the attacker to potentially perform actions such as redirecting the user, stealing cookies, or modifying the content of the page.
- **Attack vectors:** An authenticated user with administrative privileges (Admin+) can inject the malicious script through the plugin's settings page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have administrative access to the WordPress site. The attacker also needs to be able to navigate to WPBot Lite > Settings > Language Center within the WordPress admin dashboard. The attacker needs to input the malicious payload and save the settings for the XSS to trigger upon refocus of the field.
