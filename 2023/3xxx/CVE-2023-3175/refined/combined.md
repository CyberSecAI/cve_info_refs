## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# AI ChatBot < 4.6.1 - Admin+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not adequately escape some settings, allowing high-privilege users such as admin to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed.

### Proof of Concept

1. Visit WPBot Lite > Settings > Language Center.
2. Within any of the tabs ("General", "FAQ", or "ChatBot Keywords"), input the following string into one of the "multi" fields (with a red X button beside it).
POC: "onfocus=javascript:alert(document.domain) autofocus
3. Click "Save Settings"
4. Go back to the field which was updated with the above (you should now only see the text "POC" in the field) and click on it, giving the field focus. See the XSS alert.
