{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the `branch` POST parameter.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser when they visit the vulnerable page.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker sends a crafted HTTP POST request to `/paysystem/branch.php` with malicious JavaScript in the `branch` parameter. The payload is stored in the application and executed when a user visits the page.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send POST requests to the vulnerable application. The attacker does not need any special privileges. They need a user to visit the page to execute the attack."
