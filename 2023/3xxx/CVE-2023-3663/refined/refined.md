Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing integrity check within the CODESYS Development System when it receives notifications via HTTP. The system does not verify that the received messages have not been tampered with during transit.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity (CWE-345):** The primary weakness is the lack of an integrity check for HTTP notifications received by the CODESYS notification server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Manipulation of Notifications:** An attacker can manipulate the content of notifications sent to the CODESYS Development System.
*   **Potential Code Execution:** By manipulating the notification content, specifically the "Learn More" button, a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacker can achieve code execution when the user clicks the manipulated link.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network-based (HTTP):** The attack vector is over the network via HTTP, by intercepting and manipulating notification messages before they reach the CODESYS Development System.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM):**  A MITM position is required to intercept and modify network traffic containing the CODESYS notification server's messages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Unauthenticated Remote Access:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to perform the attack.
*   **MITM Position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept and modify HTTP traffic between the CODESYS notification server and the CODESYS Development System.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack requires the user to click the "Learn More" button within a manipulated notification to trigger code execution.

**Affected Versions:**
*   CODESYS Development System versions from 3.5.11.0 up to (but not including) 3.5.19.20 are affected.

**Solution:**
*   Update the CODESYS Development System to version 3.5.19.20 or later.

**Additional Information:**
* The vulnerability was discovered by Sina Kheirkhah (@SinSinology) of Summoning Team (@SummoningTeam) working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative.
* Coordination was done by CERT@VDE.
