Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-3958

**Description:** The WP Remote Users Sync plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via the `notify_ping_remote` AJAX function.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `notify_ping_remote` AJAX function in the `class-wprus-api-abstract.php` file. This function makes a remote request to a URL provided by the user, without proper sanitization or validation, allowing an attacker to send a crafted request to an arbitrary URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The plugin allows an attacker to control the destination URL of an outgoing request, which can be used to access internal resources or trigger actions on remote servers.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The plugin fails to properly validate or sanitize the URL provided to the `notify_ping_remote` function, allowing an attacker to inject a malicious URL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can use the vulnerable function to make requests to internal services or external resources to gather sensitive information.
*   **Internal Service Manipulation:** The attacker can modify information from internal services.
*   **Arbitrary Request Execution:** The attacker can trigger actions on remote services.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Authenticated Attackers:** This vulnerability is exploitable by authenticated users with at least subscriber-level permissions.
*   **AJAX Request:** The attack vector is an AJAX request to the vulnerable `notify_ping_remote` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have a valid WordPress account with at least subscriber-level privileges.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the WordPress website hosting the vulnerable plugin.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability was partially patched in version 1.2.12 and fully patched in version 1.2.13.
*   The patch in version 1.2.13 included the use of `wp_safe_remote_post` instead of `wp_remote_post` in the `fire_action` function ( in `class-wprus-api-abstract.php`). This function is used to execute the remote request to the arbitrary URL.
*   The `notify_ping_remote` function is called via the `wp_ajax_wprus_{endpoint}_notify_ping_remote` action hook.
*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by István Márton from Wordfence.
*   The `readme.txt` changes in version 1.2.12 mention that the plugin now uses `wp_safe_remote_post` instead of `wp_remote_post`.
*   The changesets for versions 1.2.12 and 1.2.13 show the modification to `wp_remote_post` and the addition of the nonce check in `notify_ping_remote` for version 1.2.13.
