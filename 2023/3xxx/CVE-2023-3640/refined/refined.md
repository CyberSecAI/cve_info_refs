Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2023-3640:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a per-CPU entry area leak in the Linux kernel's x86 memory management.
- The "Randomize per-cpu entry area" feature, implemented to mitigate similar issues (CVE-2023-0597), is still susceptible to leaks.
- Specifically, the `init_cea_offsets()` function, used when Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization (KASLR) is enabled, does not fully prevent information exposure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The per-cpu entry area, which contains exception stacks and other sensitive data for user-to-kernel transitions, is mapped to user space despite Kernel Page Table Isolation (KPTI) being enabled.
- The `prefetchnta` and `prefetcht2` instructions can be used to conduct time-based attacks, revealing the location of the per-cpu entry area in memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A local user can potentially guess the location of exception stacks and other important kernel data.
- This information could be used to escalate privileges on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Time-based attacks using `prefetchnta` and `prefetcht2` instructions.
- These instructions are effective within the address range of 0xfffffe0000000000 - 0xfffffefffffff000.
- The address offset range and step size (0x3b000) make it feasible to obtain the cpu entry area in a relatively short time (one or two minutes).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a local user on the system.
- The attacker must be able to execute code that can utilize the `prefetchnta` and `prefetcht2` instructions and measure execution times.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is described as a CPU-level address leak affecting mostly Intel CPUs, possibly AMD CPUs as well.
- The vulnerability is related to the issues introduced by KPTI not being fully resolved.
- The vulnerability leverages the mapping of the per-CPU entry area into the user space memory map.
