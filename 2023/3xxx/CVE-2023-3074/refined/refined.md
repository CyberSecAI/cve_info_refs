Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the security-related changes:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The code changes address a lack of sanitization of user inputs for first name, last name, and email fields. Before these changes, these fields were not being properly sanitized, potentially opening the application to injection attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Without sanitization, malicious JavaScript code could be injected into the first and last name fields, leading to XSS attacks.
- **Email Injection/Header Injection:** Without sanitization, email fields could be manipulated to inject malicious content or headers into email messages, potentially leading to spam or further attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **XSS:** Successful XSS attacks could allow attackers to steal user session cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform unauthorized actions on behalf of the victim.
- **Email Injection:** Email injection attacks can result in spam emails, phishing attacks, or disclosure of sensitive information through malicious email headers.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker could manipulate user profile information by entering malicious code in the first name, last name or email fields through the user interface or by crafting direct HTTP requests to the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to have a valid user account on the application to modify their user profile.
- The attacker would need the ability to edit user profile information including the first name, last name and email address.

**Details:**

The changes in `DetailViewAjax.php` and `Save.php` introduce the following sanitization:

-   `vtlib_purify()` is used for `first_name` and `last_name` to prevent XSS attacks.
-   `filter_var(..., FILTER_SANITIZE_EMAIL)` is used for `email1`, `email2`, and `secondaryemail` to remove invalid characters and prevent email injection.

These changes attempt to mitigate the risks of XSS and email injection vulnerabilities.
