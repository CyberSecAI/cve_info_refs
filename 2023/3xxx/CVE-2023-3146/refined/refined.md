Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities:

**Vulnerability 1: SQL Injection in `posts/view_post.php`**

*   **Root Cause:** The application directly incorporates user-supplied input from the `id` GET parameter into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.
*   **Weakness:** SQL Injection vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or other malicious activities.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted GET request with a malicious `id` parameter to `posts/view_post.php`.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**  The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server.

**Vulnerability 2: SQL Injection in `user/manage_user.php`**

*   **Root Cause:** Similar to vulnerability 1, the application uses the `id` GET parameter directly in an SQL query without sanitization.
*   **Weakness:** SQL Injection vulnerability.
*   **Impact:**  An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted GET request with a malicious `id` parameter to `user/manage_user.php`.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**  The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server.

**Vulnerability 3: SQL Injection in `posts/manage_post.php`**

*   **Root Cause:** The `id` GET parameter is directly inserted into an SQL query.
*   **Weakness:** SQL Injection vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can potentially manipulate data or access sensitive information.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted GET request with a malicious `id` parameter to `posts/manage_post.php`.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**  The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server.

**Vulnerability 4: SQL Injection in `admin/user/manage_user.php`**

*  **Root Cause**: The application uses the `id` GET parameter directly in an SQL query without sanitization.
*  **Weakness**: SQL Injection vulnerability
*  **Impact**:  An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries.
*  **Attack Vector**: Sending a crafted GET request with a malicious `id` parameter to `admin/user/manage_user.php`.
*  **Attacker Capabilities**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server.

**Vulnerability 5: SQL Injection in `admin/posts/view_post.php`**

*   **Root Cause:**  The `id` GET parameter is directly inserted into an SQL query without sanitization.
*   **Weakness:** SQL Injection vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted GET request with a malicious `id` parameter to `admin/posts/view_post.php`.
*  **Attacker Capabilities**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server.

**Vulnerability 6: SQL Injection in `admin/posts/manage_post.php`**

*   **Root Cause:** The `id` GET parameter is directly inserted into an SQL query without sanitization.
*   **Weakness:** SQL Injection vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted GET request with a malicious `id` parameter to `admin/posts/manage_post.php`.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**  The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server.

**Vulnerability 7: SQL Injection in `admin/categories/view_category.php`**

*   **Root Cause:** The `id` GET parameter is directly used in the SQL query.
*  **Weakness**: SQL Injection vulnerability
*   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted GET request with a malicious `id` parameter to `admin/categories/view_category.php`.
*  **Attacker Capabilities**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server.

**Vulnerability 8: SQL Injection in `admin/categories/manage_category.php`**

*   **Root Cause:** The `id` GET parameter is directly used in the SQL query.
*   **Weakness:** SQL Injection vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted GET request with a malicious `id` parameter to `admin/categories/manage_category.php`.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**  The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server.

**Vulnerability 9: SQL Injection in `classes/Users.php` (POST - registration)**

*   **Root Cause:** The `username` POST parameter is directly inserted into an SQL query.
*   **Weakness:** SQL Injection vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can manipulate user data during registration.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted POST request to `classes/Users.php` with the `f=registration` parameter, and a malicious `username`.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**  The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the server.

**Vulnerability 10: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in `admin/posts/manage_post.php` (title)**

*   **Root Cause:** The application does not properly sanitize the `title` input when creating or editing a post.
*   **Weakness:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of other users when they view the affected post.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted POST request with malicious JavaScript in the `title` parameter to `classes/Master.php?f=save_post`.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to create or edit a post.

**Vulnerability 11: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in `admin/posts/manage_post.php` (content)**

*   **Root Cause:** The application does not properly sanitize the `content` input when creating or editing a post.
*   **Weakness:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of other users when they view the affected post.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted POST request with malicious JavaScript in the `content` parameter to `classes/Master.php?f=save_post`.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to create or edit a post.

In summary, this analysis reveals multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities present in various parts of the application, and two stored XSS vulnerabilities related to post management. The lack of input sanitization in these locations allows attackers to potentially compromise the application and its users.
