Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-3998

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Missing authorization check in the `userRate` function of the wpDiscuz plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The vulnerability allows unauthorized modification of data due to the missing authorization check, which means that an attacker can directly manipulate the rating of a post by sending a request to the `userRate` function.
- **Authorization Bypass:** The lack of proper authorization checks on the `userRate` function allows unauthenticated users to interact with the function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Data Modification:** Unauthenticated attackers can manipulate the rating of any post. They can increase or decrease the rating, potentially influencing the perceived quality or popularity of content.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network.
- **Direct Request:** Attackers send a crafted request to the vulnerable `userRate` function to modify post ratings.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated Access:** Attackers do not need to be logged in or have any special privileges on the WordPress site. They can exploit the vulnerability without any prior authentication.
- **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint, which is the `userRate` function and how to interact with it, to send a crafted request containing the post ID and rating value.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in wpDiscuz plugin versions up to and including 7.6.3.
- The vulnerability was publicly disclosed on September 12, 2023.
- The vulnerability was patched in version 7.6.4
