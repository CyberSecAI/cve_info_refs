- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Lack of input parameter validation in the `gallery_edit` function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Arbitrary File Read and Delete vulnerability, allowing access to arbitrary resources on the server.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can read and delete arbitrary files on the server, potentially leading to information disclosure and denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted POST request to `/index.php` with specific parameters including the `task_list` containing the vulnerable `gallery_edit` action.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs administrator privileges to exploit this vulnerability, specifically a valid username and password for a WordPress admin account.
