    "related_CVE": "CVE-2023-3709",
    "summary": "The Royal Elementor Addons plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthenticated API key disclosure in versions up to, and including, 1.3.70 due to the plugin adding the API key to the source code of any page running the MailChimp block. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to obtain a site's MailChimp API key. We recommend resetting any MailChimp API keys if running a vulnerable version of this plugin with the MailChimp block enabled as the API key may have been compromised.",
    "root_cause": "The plugin adds the MailChimp API key directly into the HTML source code when the MailChimp block is used.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Unauthenticated MailChimp API Key Disclosure"
    ],
    "impact": "Unauthenticated attackers can obtain a site's MailChimp API key.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The MailChimp API key is exposed in the HTML source code of pages where the MailChimp block is used"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "The attacker does not need any special permissions or capabilities; simply viewing the page source code is enough."
