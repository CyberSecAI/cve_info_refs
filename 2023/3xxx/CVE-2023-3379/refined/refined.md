Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- Misconfiguration of access rights within the web-based management interface for a specific user. This allows the user to access a configuration tool that should be restricted.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Privilege Management (CWE-269):**  The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper access control, allowing a low-privileged user to perform actions (password reset) that should be restricted to higher-privileged accounts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** An authenticated attacker can exploit the misconfiguration to reset the passwords of other non-administrative users, enabling them to gain increased control over the system. This allows the attacker to change configuration and perform actions beyond the original user scope.
- **Unauthorized Access:** By changing passwords, an attacker can potentially gain access to other user accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the vulnerable WAGO device.
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to have valid credentials for a non-administrative user account on the web-based management interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Local User:** The attacker must have a valid user account with basic access to the web-based management.
- **Local network access**

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in the web-based management of multiple WAGO products, including Compact Controllers, Edge Controllers, PFC100/PFC200 controllers, and Touch Panels.
- The vulnerability is present in firmware versions up to and including those specified for each product in the provided tables.
- The vendor recommends updating the firmware to the specified versions to remediate the vulnerability.
- Mitigation steps include restricting network access to the device and not directly connecting the device to the internet.
