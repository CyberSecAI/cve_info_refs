{
  "CVE-2023-3977": {
    "description": "Multiple WordPress plugins by Inisev are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) due to a missing nonce check in the `handle_installation` function. This allows unauthenticated attackers to install plugins from a limited list via a forged request if they can trick an administrator into performing an action like clicking a link.",
    "root_cause": "The `handle_installation` function, which handles plugin installations via AJAX requests, lacks a nonce check to verify the authenticity of the request.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
      "Missing nonce check"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can install arbitrary WordPress plugins (from a predefined list) on a vulnerable site, potentially leading to further exploitation, backdoors, or other malicious activities.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited via a forged HTTP request sent to the WordPress site using the `wp_ajax_inisev_installation` action. The attacker would need to trick a logged-in administrator into initiating the request (e.g., via a malicious link).",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to convince a logged-in administrator to initiate the malicious request (e.g., via social engineering). The attacker does not need to be authenticated.",
