### Summary:
The provided content describes a vulnerability in the "Video Conferencing with Zoom" WordPress plugin, specifically a sensitive information exposure due to a hardcoded encryption key.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of a hardcoded encryption key within the `vczapi_encrypt_decrypt` function. This function is used to encrypt and decrypt meeting IDs and passwords, and the use of a static key allows unauthorized parties to decrypt this sensitive information.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Hardcoded Cryptographic Key:** The primary vulnerability is the use of a hardcoded secret key (`DPEN_X3!3#23121`) and initialization vector (IV) (`1231232133213221`) within the `vczapi_encrypt_decrypt` function.
- **Sensitive Information Exposure:** The use of a hardcoded key enables attackers to decrypt sensitive data like meeting IDs and passwords.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can gain access to meeting IDs and passwords, potentially allowing them to join private meetings without authorization.
- **Confidentiality Breach:** Sensitive meeting details are exposed, violating the confidentiality of meetings scheduled through the plugin.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based. An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability by intercepting encrypted meeting data and decrypting it using the known hardcoded key and IV.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Unauthenticated Access:** Attackers do not need to be authenticated or have any special privileges.
- **Network Access:** They need to be able to intercept the encrypted data being passed to/from the plugin.
- **Technical Knowledge:** They need to know the hardcoded key and IV, and be able to use them to decrypt the data.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerable function is located in `includes/helpers.php` file (and `includes/Helpers/Encryption.php` in later versions).
- The vulnerability affects plugin versions up to and including 4.2.1.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 4.2.2, which introduced a dynamically generated key.

The provided information is more detailed than the typical CVE description by outlining the specific vulnerable function, the hardcoded values, and how the vulnerability can be exploited.
