Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-3764:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from missing or inadequate nonce validation within the "Save" function of the WooCommerce PDF Invoice Builder plugin. Nonces are cryptographic tokens used to protect against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. The absence of proper nonce verification allows attackers to forge requests and potentially modify invoice settings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The core vulnerability is the lack of CSRF protection in the save function of the plugin.
- **Missing Nonce Validation:** Specifically, the plugin fails to validate a nonce before executing the save action.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Modification of Invoices:** An attacker can potentially make changes to invoice configurations if they successfully trick a logged-in administrator into clicking a malicious link or performing some other action that sends the forged request.
- **Data Integrity Issues:** Exploitation could lead to incorrect invoice data, potentially causing financial or administrative problems.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Social Engineering:** Attackers would typically use social engineering techniques, such as tricking an administrator to click a specially crafted link, which triggers a malicious POST request to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated Attacker:** The attacker does not need to be logged in to exploit this vulnerability.
- **User Interaction Required:** The attacker needs to trick an administrator into performing an action like clicking a crafted link.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the target website.

**Additional Notes:**
- The Wordfence article provides more details and context to the vulnerability than the initial CVE description, clarifying that the vulnerable save function is missing or has incorrect nonce validation.
- The provided patch diff shows the addition of a nonce check in the save function. Specifically, lines 906-909 add the nonce verification using `wp_verify_nonce` function.
- The vulnerability affects versions of the plugin up to and including 1.2.90.
- The fix is available in version 1.2.91 and newer.
