Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-3957

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient access control in the `apg_profile_update` function of the ACF Photo Gallery Field plugin. This function, intended for updating user metadata related to the photo gallery, lacked proper authorization checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Improper Authorization:** The `apg_profile_update` function allows any authenticated user, including those with subscriber-level permissions, to update arbitrary user metadata. This bypasses the intended access restrictions.
*   **Arbitrary User Meta Update:** The function directly uses user-supplied input to update user metadata without proper sanitization or validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Modification:** Attackers could modify arbitrary user metadata, potentially leading to unintended changes in user profiles or application behavior.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Although not directly mentioned, it is implied that by modifying specific user metadata, an attacker could potentially gain elevated privileges or access to unauthorized features or data within the WordPress application.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The attack can be performed remotely over the network.
*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending malicious POST requests to the WordPress application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have an active account on the WordPress site with at least subscriber-level permissions.
*   **Knowledge of Plugin:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable plugin and its functions.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code resided in the `includes/acf_photo_gallery_save.php` file in versions of the plugin up to and including 1.9.
*   The `apg_profile_update` function is hooked to the 'profile_update' action.
*   The function retrieves the `acf-photo-gallery-groups` parameter, which is expected to be an array of keys that represent the user meta to update.
*   For each key in `acf-photo-gallery-groups`, it takes the corresponding value from the POST request and updates the user meta using `update_user_meta()`.
*   The plugin's update to version 2.0 removes the vulnerable `apg_profile_update` function, disabling the exploit.
* The fix also removed support for using the field on user profiles

**Summary:**

The ACF Photo Gallery Field plugin, up to version 1.9, was vulnerable to an arbitrary usermeta update due to a lack of proper authorization in the `apg_profile_update` function. An authenticated attacker with subscriber privileges or higher could send a crafted request to modify any user's metadata, which can lead to various security risks. This vulnerability is resolved in version 2.0 by removing the vulnerable functionality and the support for using the field on user profiles.
