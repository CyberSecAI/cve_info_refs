{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A race condition exists in the `skcipher_recvmsg` function of the Linux kernel's crypto module. After waiting for data to arrive on the socket, the value passed to `af_alg_make_sg` is not correctly updated, potentially remaining zero.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Race condition in the `skcipher_recvmsg` function",
      "Incorrect handling of data availability after a wait operation",
      "Use of outdated context information when creating scatter-gather list."
    ],
    "impact": "A local user can cause a system crash due to the incorrect value passed to `af_alg_make_sg` leading to a crash in the subsequent `get_user_pages_fast` function call.",
    "attack_vectors": "Local access is required to exploit the vulnerability.",
    "required_capabilities": "A local user with the ability to send data to the affected socket interface is required to trigger this vulnerability."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The vulnerability was fixed by reverting to the original code for `af_alg_make_sg()` and `skcipher_recvmsg()`, correcting the issue where the 'npages' calculation was misinterpreting byte counts and the 'ctx->used' value was not re-read after waiting for it to become non-zero.",
