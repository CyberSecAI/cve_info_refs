Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the identified vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The BeipyVideoResolution system, specifically the `admin/admincore.php` module, fails to properly filter user-supplied input. This lack of input sanitization allows for the injection of malicious code.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary weakness is a **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** vulnerability. This type of XSS occurs when a malicious script is injected into the application's database and is then executed when a victim user accesses the affected page.

*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This could lead to:

    *   Account hijacking by stealing cookies or session tokens
    *   Defacement of the website
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites
    *   Phishing attacks
    *   Potentially other malicious activities, depending on the attacker's goal and the website's features.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attacker submits malicious JavaScript code within a POST request to the vulnerable endpoint, specifically targeting the 'gonggao' parameter. The injection point is within the `aik` array.
    *   The injected script is then stored on the server and executed when a user loads the affected page, which seems to be the website's homepage in this case.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to make POST requests to the `admin/admincore.php` endpoint. This implies the attacker would likely need to have access to an admin account, or have found a way to bypass authentication.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious JavaScript payloads that will be executed by the victim's browser.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided images demonstrate the steps of the attack:
    1.  The code snippet shows a vulnerable area in `admin/admincore.php` with a lack of filtering.
    2.  The second image shows the attacker making a POST request with a malicious payload. The response indicates success.
    3. The third image shows the successful execution of the payload on the homepage.

*   The vulnerability is present in BeipyVideoResolution system V2.6 and was tested on Windows Server 2008 R2 Enterprise with Apache.
