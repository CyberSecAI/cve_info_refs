- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress plugin "WP Shopping Pages" lacks CSRF checks in certain areas and does not sanitize or escape user inputs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to missing sanitization and escaping. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability because of missing CSRF checks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin's settings, which will be executed in the browser of a logged-in administrator, potentially leading to account compromise or other malicious actions within the WordPress site.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is performed through a CSRF attack, where a malicious HTML form is crafted to make a logged-in administrator submit data that includes an XSS payload, without their knowledge.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into accessing a malicious page or clicking a malicious link that contains the crafted form which submits to the vulnerable plugin's settings page.
