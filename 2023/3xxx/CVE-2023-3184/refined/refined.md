{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application does not sanitize user-supplied input in the `firstname`, `middlename`, `lastname`, and `username` fields.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious HTML/JavaScript code into the vulnerable fields. This code would be executed when other users, including administrators, view the affected content, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attacker submits a POST request with crafted HTML payloads within the form data, specifically in the `firstname`, `middlename`, `lastname`, and `username` fields.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have an account in the system or be able to submit data to the vulnerable endpoint via the web interface. In the provided example, an administrative login is required, but any account can create users with the vulnerable fields.",
     "additional_details": "The provided Burp Suite request demonstrates the injection of anchor tags (`<a href=//evil.com>...</a>`) into the vulnerable fields. The steps to reproduce outline how to log in, navigate to the user management page, create a new user, input the malicious payloads, and then observe the reflected XSS when the saved user data is displayed on the admin page."
