- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:**  High privilege users, such as admins, can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers, potentially leading to account compromise, data theft, or other malicious actions. This is possible even when the `unfiltered_html` capability is disallowed.
- **Attack vectors:**  An attacker with admin or other high privileges can insert malicious JavaScript code into the "Google Map API Key" setting within the plugin's settings page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have administrative or similarly high-level privileges within the WordPress site to access the plugin settings. They must also have the WP Job Manager plugin installed.
