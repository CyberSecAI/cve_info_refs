      "is_relevant": true,
      "details": {
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the way the `TablePhotos` class handles the `pho_locked` attribute. The original code used `(int) $this->getValue('pho_locked') === 1` to check if a photo album is locked, which implicitly assumes a value of 1 means true. However, the fix changes it to `$this->getValue('pho_locked')`, meaning any truthy value will be considered locked.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Incorrect type checking of the `pho_locked` field",
            "Potential bypass of access restrictions on locked albums due to non-strict boolean check"
        ],
        "impact": "Users could potentially access locked photo albums that they should not have access to if `pho_locked` value is not explicitly 1, but any truthy value",
        "attack_vectors": [
            "Accessing a locked photo album through the application's photo display mechanisms"
        ],
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker would need to have a valid account on the platform and be able to browse to a photo album that is marked as locked with a truthy value other than 1. The attacker should not have administrator permission"
