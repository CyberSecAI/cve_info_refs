The provided content is related to CVE-2023-3460.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Ultimate Member plugin uses a blocklist approach to prevent users from manipulating certain user metadata keys during registration. However, inconsistencies in how the plugin's blocklist logic and how WordPress handles metadata keys allowed attackers to bypass the restrictions. Specifically, attackers could manipulate the "wp_capabilities" metadata key, which determines a user's role and capabilities, to grant themselves administrative privileges.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure use of blocklists instead of allowlists for user metadata validation.
- Inconsistency between the plugin's blocklist implementation and WordPress's metadata handling, allowing bypasses.
- Privilege escalation vulnerability via manipulation of "wp_capabilities" metadata during user registration.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthenticated attackers can create new user accounts with administrative privileges.
- Attackers gain complete control over affected websites by creating administrator accounts.
- Attackers can upload malicious plugins and themes, modify website content, and potentially install backdoors.

**Attack vectors:**
- Unauthenticated user registration page of the Ultimate Member plugin
- Specifically, the `/register` endpoint is targeted via a POST request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need any prior authentication.
- They need to send a crafted POST request to the registration page of the vulnerable Ultimate Member plugin.
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests.
