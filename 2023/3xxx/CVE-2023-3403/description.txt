The ProfileGrid plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'pm_upload_csv' function in versions up to, and including, 5.5.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions or above to import new users and update existing users.
