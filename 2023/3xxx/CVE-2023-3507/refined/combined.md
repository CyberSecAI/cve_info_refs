## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WooCommerce Pre-Orders < 2.0.3 - Arbitrary Pre-Order Canceling via CSRF

### Description

The plugin has a flawed CSRF check when canceling pre-orders, which could allow attackers to make logged in admins cancel arbitrary pre-orders via a CSRF attack

### Proof of Concept

Make a logged in admin open the URL below (42 being a pre-order to be canceled)
https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wc\_pre\_orders&action=cancel\_pre\_order&order\_id=42

### Affects Plugins
