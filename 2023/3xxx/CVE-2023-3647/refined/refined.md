- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to sanitize and escape some of its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that execute in the browsers of other users who visit the affected pages, leading to potential data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with administrator privileges can insert malicious JavaScript payloads into the vulnerable plugin settings (Bubble Text, Header, Chat Text, Button Text).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be logged in as an administrator or another user with high enough privileges to modify the plugin settings.
