## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# IURNY by INDIGITALL < 3.2.3 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

1. Go to the plugin's settings.
2. Insert this payload in any of the vulnerable fields (Bubble Text, Header, Chat Text, Button Text): <svg/onload=alert(/XSS/)>
3. Save settings and enable the widget.
4. Browse the homepage and the alert will trigger.
