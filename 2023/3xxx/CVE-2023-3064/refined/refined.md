Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-3064:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of CVE-2023-3064 is the insecure transmission of user data before authentication in the Mobatime mobile application. Specifically, the application requests and receives a list of all existing users from the server before the user even attempts to log in. This list includes user IDs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary weakness is the disclosure of sensitive information (a list of all users, including their IDs) to an unauthenticated user.
*   **Lack of Proper Authentication Checks:** The application fails to restrict access to user data based on authentication status.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Exposure:** An attacker can obtain a list of all user IDs, which can be used to further exploit other vulnerabilities or to gain unauthorized access.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Traffic Interception:** The attack vector is network traffic interception using a tool like Burp Suite to capture the server's response containing the list of user IDs before authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept network traffic between the mobile application and the server. This could be achieved by being on the same network or by employing a man-in-the-middle attack.
*   **Tooling:** The attacker needs tools for intercepting and analyzing network traffic, such as Burp Suite.

**Additional Notes**

*   The disclosed user IDs from CVE-2023-3064 are used as a stepping stone for the subsequent CVE-2023-3065 and CVE-2023-3066 vulnerabilities in the same application. The attacker needs to know the user IDs to bypass authentication and perform IDOR.
*   The application saves the user ID from the previous session, and sends it with the next login request, even before the user is authenticated.
