Discovery Status:

Published

Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote

Severity Level:
===============
Medium

Authentication Type:
====================
Restricted Authentication (User Privileges)

User Interaction:
=================
Low User Interaction

Disclosure Type:
================
Responsible Disclosure

Technical Details & Description:
================================
A persistent input validation web vulnerability has been discovered in the official Tiva Events Calender v1.4
web-application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject own malicious script codes with persistent attack vector to
compromise browser
to web-application requests from the application-side.

The vulnerability is located in the name input field and name parameter. Remote attackers privileged user accounts are
able to inject
own malicious script codes as name. Thus results in a persistent execute of the script code in the backend on edit but
as well in the
frontend (index) were the event is being displayed after the submit (save) via post method request. In the same
direction it is possible
to inject malformed client-side executable script code in get request to trigger a non-persistent execution.

Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in session hijacking, persistent phishing attacks, persistent
external redirects
to malicious source and persistent manipulation of affected frontend / backend application modules.

Request Method(s):
[+] POST / GET

Vulnerable Input(s):
[+] Name

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
[+] name

Affected Module(s):
[+] index.php (Frontend on Event Preview)
[+] edit.php (Backend on Edit ID)

Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The persistent input validation web vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers with low privileged user account
and with low user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the persistent cross site web vulnerability follow the provided information
and steps below to continue.

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The vulnerability can be patched by the following steps ...
1. Encode and escape the name input field content on transmit via post method
2. Restrict the input field and disallow insert of special chars
3. Parse the output location on the index frontend via encode to sanitize and prevent the execute
4. Parse the output location on the edit id report backend via encode to sanitize and prevent the execute

Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the persistent input validation vulnerability in the web-application is estimated as medium.
