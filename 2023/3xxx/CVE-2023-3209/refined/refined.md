The provided content relates to CVE-2023-3209.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The MStore API WordPress plugin does not implement proper authorization checks for its AJAX actions. Specifically, it lacks privilege checks and nonce checks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing authorization checks: The plugin's AJAX actions are not secured, allowing unauthorized users (e.g., subscribers) to trigger them.
- Broken Access Control:  Due to the lack of authorization checks, users with lower privileges can modify plugin settings.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized settings updates: Attackers can modify various plugin settings by sending crafted requests to the vulnerable AJAX actions. This includes settings related to product limits, firebase server keys, order titles, and messages.
- The settings modification could lead to unexpected behavior of the plugin or manipulation of information displayed to the users.

**Attack vectors:**
-  Sending crafted HTTP GET requests to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint with specific `action` parameters and values for settings.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be logged in as a subscriber or any user with lower privilege than admin on the target WordPress site.
- No other special attacker capabilities or positions are required.
