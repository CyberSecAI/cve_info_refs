Merge branch 'expand-stack'This modifies our user mode stack expansion code to always take the
mmap\_lock for writing before modifying the VM layout.
It's actually something we always technically should have done, but
because we didn't strictly need it, we were being lazy ("opportunistic"
sounds so much better, doesn't it?) about things, and had this hack in
place where we would extend the stack vma in-place without doing the
proper locking.
And it worked fine. We just needed to change vm\_start (or, in the case
of grow-up stacks, vm\_end) and together with some special ad-hoc locking
using the anon\_vma lock and the mm->page\_table\_lock, it all was fairly
straightforward.
That is, it was all fine until Ruihan Li pointed out that now that the
vma layout uses the maple tree code, we \*really\* don't just change
vm\_start and vm\_end any more, and the locking really is broken. Oops.
It's not actually all \_that\_ horrible to fix this once and for all, and
do proper locking, but it's a bit painful. We have basically three
different cases of stack expansion, and they all work just a bit
differently:
- the common and obvious case is the page fault handling. It's actually
fairly simple and straightforward, except for the fact that we have
something like 24 different versions of it, and you end up in a maze
of twisty little passages, all alike.
- the simplest case is the execve() code that creates a new stack.
There are no real locking concerns because it's all in a private new
VM that hasn't been exposed to anybody, but lockdep still can end up
unhappy if you get it wrong.
- and finally, we have GUP and page pinning, which shouldn't really be
expanding the stack in the first place, but in addition to execve()
we also use it for ptrace(). And debuggers do want to possibly access
memory under the stack pointer and thus need to be able to expand the
stack as a special case.
None of these cases are exactly complicated, but the page fault case in
particular is just repeated slightly differently many many times. And
ia64 in particular has a fairly complicated situation where you can have
both a regular grow-down stack \_and\_ a special grow-up stack for the
register backing store.
So to make this slightly more manageable, the bulk of this series is to
first create a helper function for the most common page fault case, and
convert all the straightforward architectures to it.
Thus the new 'lock\_mm\_and\_find\_vma()' helper function, which ends up
being used by x86, arm, powerpc, mips, riscv, alpha, arc, csky, hexagon,
loongarch, nios2, sh, sparc32, and xtensa. So we not only convert more
than half the architectures, we now have more shared code and avoid some
of those twisty little passages.
And largely due to this common helper function, the full diffstat of
this series ends up deleting more lines than it adds.
That still leaves eight architectures (ia64, m68k, microblaze, openrisc,
parisc, s390, sparc64 and um) that end up doing 'expand\_stack()'
manually because they are doing something slightly different from the
normal pattern. Along with the couple of special cases in execve() and
GUP.
So there's a couple of patches that first create 'locked' helper
versions of the stack expansion functions, so that there's a obvious
path forward in the conversion. The execve() case is then actually
pretty simple, and is a nice cleanup from our old "grow-up stackls are
special, because at execve time even they grow down".
The #ifdef CONFIG\_STACK\_GROWSUP in that code just goes away, because
it's just more straightforward to write out the stack expansion there
manually, instead od having get\_user\_pages\_remote() do it for us in some
situations but not others and have to worry about locking rules for GUP.
And the final step is then to just convert the remaining odd cases to a
new world order where 'expand\_stack()' is called with the mmap\_lock held
for reading, but where it might drop it and upgrade it to a write, only
to return with it held for reading (in the success case) or with it
completely dropped (in the failure case).
In the process, we remove all the stack expansion from GUP (where
dropping the lock wouldn't be ok without special rules anyway), and add
it in manually to \_\_access\_remote\_vm() for ptrace().
Thanks to Adrian Glaubitz and Frank Scheiner who tested the ia64 cases.
Everything else here felt pretty straightforward, but the ia64 rules for
stack expansion are really quite odd and very different from everything
else. Also thanks to Vegard Nossum who caught me getting one of those
odd conditions entirely the wrong way around.
Anyway, I think I want to actually move all the stack expansion code to
a whole new file of its own, rather than have it split up between
mm/mmap.c and mm/memory.c, but since this will have to be backported to
the initial maple tree vma introduction anyway, I tried to keep the
patches \_fairly\_ minimal.
Also, while I don't think it's valid to expand the stack from GUP, the
final patch in here is a "warn if some crazy GUP user wants to try to
expand the stack" patch. That one will be reverted before the final
release, but it's left to catch any odd cases during the merge window
and release candidates.

Subject: Re: StackRot (CVE-2023-3269): Linux kernel privilege escalation
 vulnerability

Hi all,

The PoC code and exploit write-up of the StackRot vulnerability has been
published to [GitHub][gh]. I'm going to copy the write-up here, but I
recommend the GitHub version because there are some figures embedded.

 [gh]: <https://github.com/lrh2000/StackRot>

Besides, the exploit is verified by the GitHub CI. Therefore, the most
straightforward way to understand how this exploit operates without
having to set up a local environment is by reviewing the GitHub CI pass
procedure, which can be found [here][ci].

 [ci]: <https://github.com/lrh2000/StackRot/actions>

## Exploit

The exploit primarily focuses on the Google kCTF challenge, specifically when
neither CONFIG_PREEMPT nor CONFIG_SLAB_MERGE_DEFAULT is set. To exploit
StackRot, the most important task is to locate a VMA iteration that fulfills
the following criteria:
 1. The iteration's timing can be controlled. This control allows us to ensure
    that the RCU grace period concludes during the VMA iteration.
 2. The iteration retrieves specific information from the VMA structure, and
    returns the information to the userspace. This feature enables us to
    exploit the UAF vulnerability of the maple node to leak some kernel
    addresses.
 3. The iteration invokes certain function pointers in the VMA structure. This
    particular capability allows us to exploit the UAF of the maple node to
    control the kernel-mode program counter (PC).

The chosen VMA iteration is the iteration responsible for generating the
contents of `/proc/[pid]/maps`. The following sections will show how this
iteration satisfies the above criteria.

### Step 0: From UAFBR to UAF

During any VMA iteration, the reference to the root node of the VMA tree is
obtained, and the iteration proceeds through its slots. Thus, by triggering
stack expansion in another thread on a separate CPU during the VMA iteration,
the node replacement can be concurrently initiated. At this point, accessing
the old node is considered a use-after-free-by-RCU (UAFBR) situation. However,
actual issues arise only when the old node is truly freed, which occurs in the
RCU callback.

This presents two challenges: (i) determining when the old node is freed and
(ii) ensuring that the VMA iteration does not complete before the old node is
freed.

The first question is relatively straightforward. In the kernel, the
`synchronize_rcu()` function can be employed to wait until the RCU grace period
concludes, ensuring that all pre-existing RCU callbacks have been invoked. In
userspace, system calls that ultimately call `synchronize_rcu()` can be
utilized for the same purpose. Thus, when such system calls terminate, it is
known that the old node has been freed. Notably, there is a system call,
`membarrier(MEMBARRIER_CMD_GLOBAL, 0, -1)`, that solely invokes
`synchronize_rcu()`.

```c
SYSCALL_DEFINE3(membarrier, int, cmd, unsigned int, flags, int, cpu_id)
{
	// ...

	switch (cmd) {
	// ...
	case MEMBARRIER_CMD_GLOBAL:
		/* MEMBARRIER_CMD_GLOBAL is not compatible with nohz_full. */
		if (tick_nohz_full_enabled())
			return -EINVAL;
		if (num_online_cpus() > 1)
			synchronize_rcu();
		return 0;
	// ...
	}
}
```

The second question necessitates further consideration. Several potential
solutions are as follows:
 1. The iteration task gets preempted, the RCU grace period ends, and the
    iteration resumes execution. However, this approach is ineffective if
    CONFIG_PREEMPT is not set.
 2. The iteration task enters a sleep state (e.g., waiting for I/O), the RCU
    grace period ends, and the iteration continues. Currently, I am unaware of
    any VMA iteration that satisfies this requirement and can be exploited to
    leak kernel addresses and control the program counter (PC). It may exist,
    but a thorough investigation is required.
 3. The iteration task experiences an interruption (e.g., timer interrupt),
    during which the RCU grace period concludes. It is possible to employ
    timerfd to create multiple hardware timers that, upon timeout during the
    VMA iteration, can trigger a lengthy interrupt. However, this approach is
    not viable because the interrupt handler operates with interrupts disabled,
    and if a CPU cannot handle inter-processor interrupts (IPIs), the RCU grace
    period will not end.
 4. The iteration task is deliberately prolonged, allowing the RCU grace period
    to expire. This is the chosen solution. If the current RCU grace period
    surpasses RCU_TASK_IPI_DELAY (defaulting to 0.5 seconds), inter-processor
    interrupts (IPIs) are dispatched to all CPUs to verify that they are not in
    RCU critical sections. In the case of VMA iteration, the answer is
    negative, signifying that the RCU grace period concludes and the maple node
    is freed, effectively converting UAFBR into a genuine use-after-free (UAF)
    scenario.

One significant observation is that during VMA iteration for
`/proc/[pid]/maps`, it generates the entire file path for file-mapped memory
regions. Although the directory name is typically restricted to a maximum of
255 characters, there is no limitation on the directory depth. This means that
by creating a file with an exceedingly large directory depth and establishing a
memory mapping for this file, accessing `/proc/[pid]/maps` can take a
considerable amount of time during the VMA iteration. Consequently, this
extended duration enables the possibility of concluding the RCU grace period
and acquiring the UAF primitive.

```c
static void
show_map_vma(struct seq_file *m, struct vm_area_struct *vma)
{
	// ...

	/*
	 * Print the dentry name for named mappings, and a
	 * special [heap] marker for the heap:
	 */
	if (file) {
		seq_pad(m, ' ');
		/*
		 * If user named this anon shared memory via
		 * prctl(PR_SET_VMA ..., use the provided name.
		 */
		if (anon_name)
			seq_printf(m, "[anon_shmem:%s]", anon_name->name);
		else
			seq_file_path(m, file, "\n");
		goto done;
	}

	// ...
}
```

This step is illustrated in the following figure:

![Step 0: From UAFBR to UAF](<https://github.com/lrh2000/StackRot/raw/master/pic/nodes_free_and_use.png>)

### Step 1: From slab UAF to page UAF

Now that UAF is functioning within a slab. If CONFIG_SLAB_MERGE_DEFAULT is
enabled and the slab of maple nodes merges with kmalloc-256, the contents
within the old node can be controlled by allocating a new structure from
kmalloc-256 and populating it with userspace data. However, if
CONFIG_SLAB_MERGE_DEFAULT is not set, an alternative approach is required. In
this case, one needs to return the page of the freed node to the page
allocator, allowing the old node to be controlled by allocating a new page and
filling it accordingly.

Recall that the VMA tree will only contain one node. Hence, by utilizing
`fork()`/`clone()`, multiple VMA trees and an equal number of maple nodes are
generated. Assuming one slab encompasses M maple nodes, and one node per M
nodes is retained while all other nodes are freed via `exit()`, the remaining
nodes become the sole nodes within their respective slabs. Initially, these
slabs reside in the CPU's partial list. When the partial list reaches its
capacity, the slabs are flushed back to the partial list of the corresponding
NUMA node.

If the last maple node within a slab is freed, the slab becomes empty. If this
slab resides in the partial list of a NUMA node, and the partial list of that
particular NUMA node is already at maximum capacity, the page is immediately
returned to the page allocator. Consequently, the slab UAF transforms into a
page UAF scenario. The contents within the freed page can be manipulated by
sending some data via `msgsnd()`, which allocates elastic objects and directly
populates them with the provided user data.

```c
static void __slab_free(struct kmem_cache *s, struct slab *slab,
			void *head, void *tail, int cnt,
			unsigned long addr)

{
	// ...

	if (unlikely(!new.inuse && n->nr_partial >= s->min_partial))
		goto slab_empty;

	// ...
	return;

slab_empty:
	// ...
	discard_slab(s, slab);
}
```

The number of maple nodes per slab, M, depends on the number of CPUs. The
exploit implementation considers a situation with two CPUs and therefore
assumes 16 as the value of M, as illustrated in the following figure:

![Step 1: From slab UAF to page UAF](<https://github.com/lrh2000/StackRot/raw/master/pic/node_master_fengshui.png>)

### Step 2: From UAF to address leaking

Upon gaining control of the maple node, it becomes possible to manipulate the
addresses of subsequent VMAs that will be later iterated. As the targeted
iteration is aimed at generating `/proc/self/maps`, certain VMA information,
such as the start and end addresses, which reside within the VMA structure, are
returned to the user space.

However, a challenge arises: the address of a VMA structure in the maple node
can only be appropriately set if some addresses are already known. Fortunately,
CVE-2023-0597 directly serves this purpose. According to CVE-2023-0597, the
address of `cpu_entry_area` is not randomized. Although this vulnerability has
been patched in Linux 6.2, it has not been backported to earlier stable kernels
as of the time of writing. Consequently, by overwriting the address of the VMA
structure with that of the last IDT entry, the entry that contains the address
of `asm_sysvec_spurious_apic_interrupt` is directly leaked, thereby revealing
the base addresses of the kernel code and kernel data.

![Step 2: From UAF to address leaking (1)](<https://github.com/lrh2000/StackRot/raw/master/pic/node_master_code_leak.png>)

The previously discussed method can be used recurrently to incrementally expose
more addresses from the kernel data section. For instance, the
`init_task.tasks.prev` pointer within the data section directs to the
`task_struct` structure of the latest created task, which is without question
allocated on the heap.

![Step 2: From UAF to address leaking (2)](<https://github.com/lrh2000/StackRot/raw/master/pic/node_master_heap_leak.png>)

When all newly established tasks are terminated, their `task_struct` structures
will subsequently be deallocated. If the quantity of these tasks is large
enough, the corresponding pages can be surrendered back to the page allocator.
This allows for the possibility to reallocate these pages and fill them with
user data. However, keep in mind that the released pages generally belong to
the per-cpu page (PCP) list. For pages present in the PCP list, they can be
reallocated exclusively in the same page order. Consequently, solely mapping
new pages into the user space, which requires only order-0 pages from the page
allocator, won't fulfill the objectives.

Nonetheless, the msgsnd system call will solicit memory chunks via kmalloc and
populate these chunks with user-defined data. When the kmalloc cache is
exhausted, it will requisition pages from the page allocator at a specific
order. If the message size is accurately adjusted, the exact order will be
desired. Thus, the page whose address has been previously leaked will be
reallocated. As a result, it becomes possible to obtain a page with a known
address and user-manipulated data.

### Step 3: From UAF to root privileges

It is now possible to forge the VMA structure in the address-known page and
control the `vma->vm_ops->name` function pointer. The next step involves
finding suitable gadgets to escape containers and acquire root privileges.

```c
static void
show_map_vma(struct seq_file *m, struct vm_area_struct *vma)
{
	// ...

	if (vma->vm_ops && vma->vm_ops->name) {
		name = vma->vm_ops->name(vma);
		if (name)
			goto done;
	}

	// ...
}
```

![Step 3: From UAF to root privileges](<https://github.com/lrh2000/StackRot/raw/master/pic/node_master_kern_exec.png>)

The gadget constructions are as follows:
 1. Stack pivot: `movq %rbx, %rsi; movq %rbp, %rdi; call
    __x86_indirect_thunk_r13` -> `pushq %rsi; jmp 46(%rsi)` -> `popq %rsp; ret`
    -> `popq %rsp; ret`, where %rdi, %rbx, and %r13 _initially_ points to
    user-controllable data.
 2. Gain root privileges: `popq %rdi; ret` -> `prepare_kernel_cred` -> `popq
    %rdi; ret` -> `movq %rax, (%rdi); ret`, where %rdi _now_ points to the
    stack top; `popq %rdi; ret` -> `commit_creds`, effectively executing
    `commit_creds(prepare_kernel_cred(&init_task))`.
 3. Escape containers: `popq %rdi; ret` -> `find_task_by_vpid` -> `popq %rdi;
    ret` -> `movq %rax, (%rdi); ret`, where %rdi _now_ points to the stack top;
    `popq %rdi; ret` -> `popq %rsi; ret` -> `switch_task_namespaces`,
    effectively performing `switch_task_namespaces(find_task_by_vpid(1),
    &init_nsproxy)`.
 4. Unlock mm: `popq %rax; ret` -> `movq %rbp, %rdi; call
    __x86_indirect_thunk_rax`, where %rbp points to the original seq_file;
    `popq %rax; ret` -> `m_stop`, effectively executing `m_stop(seq_file, ..)`.
 5. Return to userspace: use `swapgs_restore_regs_and_return_to_usermode`, and
    call `execve()` to get the shell.

Finally, using `nsenter --mount=/proc/1/ns/mnt` to restore the mount namespace
and get the flag via `cat /flag/flag`.

Subject: linux-distros list policy and Linux kernel, again

Hi,

This is sort of continuation to a thread I started in here last year, at
the time focusing on allowing "embargoes" on publicly fixed Linux kernel
issues, which we ended up agreeing to:

<https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/05/15/1>

BTW, this recent thread on "Quality standards for embargoed code" is
relevant to that previous topic:

[https://lore.kernel.org/ksummit/2023081527-amendment-professed-0a42@gregkh/T/#t](https://lore.kernel.org/ksummit/2023081527-amendment-professed-0a42%40gregkh/T/#t)

(It's harder/worse to test code changes that are not yet public, which
is something we also recently discussed in context of and granted an
exception to the curl project.)

This time, there are at least two more points of contention to discuss.

Thank you Donald Buczek for bringing this to oss-security (and beating
me to it), with your specific needs explained:

<https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/08/25/1>
[https://lore.kernel.org/ksummit/nycvar.YFH.7.76.2308160014330.14207@cbobk.fhfr.pm/T/#t](https://lore.kernel.org/ksummit/nycvar.YFH.7.76.2308160014330.14207%40cbobk.fhfr.pm/T/#t)

Here I'd like to start a new thread just on oss-security (no cross-post,
but some people CC'ed) and with more context given.

For some years until recently, the Linux kernel's
Documentation/admin-guide/security-bugs.rst directed people to also
report "sensitive bugs, such as those that might lead to privilege
escalations" to linux-distros.  On one hand, that was great -
cooperation between Linux kernel upstream and Linux distros.  On the
other hand, the specific wording did not fully match linux-distros
policy, yet it bypassed a visit to the wiki page on linux-distros with
the instructions and policy on it by directly giving out the posting
address.  This resulted in people reporting issues to linux-distros
without having actually read and accepted the policy.

Last year, Vegard Nossum suggested edits (and then revised them this
year) to try and make things much clearer for reporters:

[https://lore.kernel.org/all/20230305220010.20895-1-vegard.nossum@oracle.com/](https://lore.kernel.org/all/20230305220010.20895-1-vegard.nossum%40oracle.com/)
<https://vegard.github.io/security-v3/Documentation/output/process/security-bugs.html>

As I recall, when Vegard offered this edited documentation (the second
URL above) to people who reported something to linux-distros but were
confused, they said that version of the documentation was indeed much
clearer.  However, the changes didn't get merged, which I speculate is
in part a result of them changing several things at once and thus making
it harder for all reviewers to agree on them.  Besides, I am not sure
this was the right direction: maybe rather than duplicate and explain
linux-distros policy aspects in Linux kernel documentation, it was
better to refer to linux-distros instructions and omit the linux-distros
posting address from the kernel documentation.

Then there was the recent lengthy linux-distros and s@k.o thread on the
StackRot (CVE-2023-3269) vulnerability, publicly disclosed here:

<https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/07/05/1>

In that private thread, two linux-distros policy aspects came up as
being inconsistent with s@k.o preferences:

1. For s@k.o, public disclosure is typically in up to 7 days since fix
is ready, but for linux-distros the deadline is 14 days max since
linux-distros is notified even if the fix is not ready.  Apparently,
this one makes Greg KH particularly unhappy about linux-distros.

2. _If_ the reporter shares PoCs/exploits with linux-distros, then per
current policy those should also be made public (within up to 7 days
more after the vulnerability is publicly disclosed as such).  Linus
Torvalds said that this must be up to the reporter only, and we should
not be imposing such policy.  In a sense, this is already up to the
reporter - if they disagree, they just shouldn't post PoCs/exploits to
linux-distros - can instead post an offer to share with individual
distros if they want to, or not share at all.  However, this is
problematic in practice because not everyone reads the rules before
posting and sometimes people change their mind during the embargo time
(or are required to "change their mind" by their employer, etc.)

I had already recognized both of these as problems - e.g., the latter
one also came up in Mathias Krause's disclosure of another Linux kernel
vulnerability in 2022:

<https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/02/03/1>

At the time, I thought that maybe increasing the maximum delay for
PoC/exploit publication from 7 to 30 days would be appropriate, but we
did not formally do it.  I effectively granted a similar exception to
Ruihan Li for StackRot this time, even though the full exploit wasn't
even shared with linux-distros and Ruihan was willing to publish the
PoCs that he did share on time.  I also informed Ruihan of this policy
aspect early enough, so we dodged that bullet that time, but at the same
time made Linus aware of this general issue, triggering his criticism.
(That's fine, it's good to have criticism.)

Overall, even though these issues were mostly avoided for StackRot in
particular, bringing them up in this thread ended up being the last
straw for the Linux kernel security folks to say they don't want to deal
with linux-distros anymore, resulting in this edit to the documentation:

<https://git.kernel.org/linus/4fee0915e649b>

This has a spiteful commit message and a calmer almost constructive
actual change.  Knowing that the status quo was problematic and not
having a better solution ready (other than Vegard's elaborate edits), I
actually approved of this edit as well.  It says:

---
The kernel security team strongly recommends that reporters of potential
security issues NEVER contact the "linux-distros" mailing list until
AFTER discussing it with the kernel security team.  Do not Cc: both
lists at once.  You may contact the linux-distros mailing list after a
fix has been agreed on and you fully understand the requirements that
doing so will impose on you and the kernel community.

The different lists have different goals and the linux-distros rules do
not contribute to actually fixing any potential security problems.
---

(I take issue with the second paragraph, as I explained in the message
Donald forwarded in here earlier today.)

So the kernel security team can, after having arrived at a fix, choose
to direct the reporter to also contact linux-distros.  I don't know
whether this would actually be happening or not.  Maybe some friendly
dialogue (which I hope this message can be a part of) and agreeing on
things could make that more likely.

I think the two linux-distros policy aspects above do not preclude such
cooperation.  However, I am willing to discuss possible policy changes
(or perhaps Linux kernel exceptions).

I recognize that 14 days might not always be enough to get a fix ready,
especially not for many of the CPU microarchitectural issues being
handled since mid-2017 and affecting many proprietary OSes as well (who
may be used to much longer disclosure timelines and would object to
Linux's earlier fix and disclosure).  I am glad that almost none of such
issues were brought to (linux-)distros, and never when it was still more
than 14 days until public disclosure.  We had a lot of luck there.
Linux kernel security team has its own mailing list (encrypted, so more
secure than s@k.o) for handling of those, which is great:

<https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/embargoed-hardware-issues.html>

I mean, this is "great" within the constraints of the rest of the
industry.  Of course, I'd very much like disclosure timelines for that
kind of issues to also become much shorter.  This is just not the case.

In terms of (linux-)distros list policy, what can we do here?  Accept up
to 7 days since fix is ready and thus accept arbitrarily long embargoes
and more likely have issues "requiring" such embargoes brought to the
list?  BTW, for CPU microarchitectural issues, that would probably need
to be for the full distros list, not limited to Linux, and from what I
know disclosure timelines for such issues may be 3 to 12+ months.

As to publishing PoCs/exploits, this is already mitigated by the Linux
kernel documentation edit making it less likely (but far from
impossible) that people would send stuff to linux-distros without being
aware of the policy.  We could further mitigate this issue by allowing
up to 30 days (but perhaps suggesting at most 7 days?)  As I recall, how
much time to allow here was first discussed in context of an Exim issue
that was expected to be so easy to independently come up with an exploit
for that even 7 days seemed excessive, so 24 hours was agreed upon for
that occasion:

<https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2019/06/05/4>

However, issues vary, and maybe 1 to 30 days on a case-by-case basis is
reasonable?

Another option is to completely remove this requirement (only for Linux
kernel issues or for all), but there are reasons to keep it:

1. To reduce the value of information staying in linux-distros members'
mailboxes/computers to potential attackers.

The issues with highly valuable information staying in there are that
such people/resources become more lucrative attack targets, and that
compromises/leaks might not be detected, in which case the situation is
worse than with full publication (only bad actors benefit).

2. To let the wider community benefit from those PoCs/exploits.

There are many uses for PoCs/exploits other than testing by upstream
developers or attacking systems in the wild.  Other uses include:
testing of (possibly different or backported) fixes by other distros
(not all of which are on linux-distros for a variety of reasons) and by
advanced users, reuses by other developers and security researchers to
better understand the problem and as templates for further PoC/exploit
development (such as in determining and demonstrating exploitability of
further related bugs), testing and improvement of (non-)effectiveness of
general security hardening mitigations and of security monitoring tools.

I'd appreciate any well-reasoned votes and constructive suggestions.
Maybe there are good ideas that didn't cross my mind yet.

Thanks,

Alexander

Subject: StackRot (CVE-2023-3269): Linux kernel privilege escalation
 vulnerability

Hi all,

**This serves as an "early" disclosure of the StackRot vulnerability, in
compliance with [the policy of the linux-distros list][po]. While all the
essential vulnerability details have been provided here, the complete exploit
code and a comprehensive write-up will be made publicly available no later than
the end of July. This oss-security thread will be notified, and any
updates will be reflected in [the GitHub repository][gh].**

 [po]: <https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/distros>
 [gh]: <https://github.com/lrh2000/StackRot>

A flaw was found in the handling of stack expansion in the Linux kernel 6.1
through 6.4, aka "Stack Rot". The maple tree, responsible for managing virtual
memory areas, can undergo node replacement without properly acquiring the MM
write lock, leading to use-after-free issues. An unprivileged local user could
use this flaw to compromise the kernel and escalate their privileges.

As StackRot is a Linux kernel vulnerability found in the memory management
subsystem, it affects almost all kernel configurations and requires minimal
capabilities to trigger. However, it should be noted that maple nodes are freed
using RCU callbacks, delaying the actual memory deallocation until after the
RCU grace period. Consequently, exploiting this vulnerability is considered
challenging.

To the best of my knowledge, there are currently no publicly available exploits
targeting use-after-free-by-RCU (UAFBR) bugs. This marks the first instance
where UAFBR bugs have been proven to be exploitable, even without the presence
of CONFIG_PREEMPT or CONFIG_SLAB_MERGE_DEFAULT settings. Notably, this exploit
has been successfully demonstrated in the environment provided by [Google kCTF
VRP][ctf] ([bzImage_upstream_6.1.25][img], [config][cfg]).

 [ctf]: <https://google.github.io/kctf/vrp.html>

 [cfg]: <https://storage.googleapis.com/kctf-vrp-public-files/bzImage_upstream_6.1.25_config>

The StackRot vulnerability has been present in the Linux kernel since version
6.1 when the VMA tree structure was [changed][ch] from red-black trees to maple
trees.

## Background

Whenever the `mmap()` system call is utilized to establish a memory mapping,
the kernel generates a structure called `vm_area_struct` to represent the
corresponding virtual memory area (VMA). This structure stores various
information including flags, properties, and other pertinent details related to
the mapping.

```c
struct vm_area_struct {
        long unsigned int          vm_start;             /*     0     8 */
        long unsigned int          vm_end;               /*     8     8 */
        struct mm_struct *         vm_mm;                /*    16     8 */
        pgprot_t                   vm_page_prot;         /*    24     8 */
        long unsigned int          vm_flags;             /*    32     8 */
        union {
                struct {
                        struct rb_node rb __attribute__((__aligned__(8))); /*    40    24 */
                        /* --- cacheline 1 boundary (64 bytes) --- */
                        long unsigned int rb_subtree_last; /*    64     8 */
                } __attribute__((__aligned__(8))) shared __attribute__((__aligned__(8))); /*    40    32 */
                struct anon_vma_name * anon_name;        /*    40     8 */
        } __attribute__((__aligned__(8)));               /*    40    32 */
        /* --- cacheline 1 boundary (64 bytes) was 8 bytes ago --- */
        struct list_head           anon_vma_chain;       /*    72    16 */
        struct anon_vma *          anon_vma;             /*    88     8 */
        const struct vm_operations_struct  * vm_ops;     /*    96     8 */
        long unsigned int          vm_pgoff;             /*   104     8 */
        struct file *              vm_file;              /*   112     8 */
        void *                     vm_private_data;      /*   120     8 */
        /* --- cacheline 2 boundary (128 bytes) --- */
        atomic_long_t              swap_readahead_info;  /*   128     8 */
        struct vm_userfaultfd_ctx  vm_userfaultfd_ctx;   /*   136     0 */

        /* size: 136, cachelines: 3, members: 14 */
        /* forced alignments: 1 */
        /* last cacheline: 8 bytes */
} __attribute__((__aligned__(8)));
```

Subsequently, when the kernel encounters page faults or other memory-related
system calls, it requires fast lookup of the VMA solely based on the address.
Previously, the VMAs were managed using red-black trees. However, starting from
Linux kernel version 6.1, the migration to maple trees took place. [Maple
trees][mt] are RCU-safe B-tree data structures optimized for storing
non-overlapping ranges. Nonetheless, their intricate nature adds complexity to
the codebase and introduces the StackRot vulnerability.

 [mt]: <https://docs.kernel.org/6.4/core-api/maple_tree.html>

In essence, the maple tree is composed of maple nodes. Throughout this article,
it is assumed that the maple tree has only a single root node, which can
contain a maximum of 16 intervals. Each interval can either represent a gap or
point to a VMA. Thus, no gaps are allowed between two intervals.

```c
struct maple_range_64 {
        struct maple_pnode *       parent;               /*     0     8 */
        long unsigned int          pivot[15];            /*     8   120 */
        /* --- cacheline 2 boundary (128 bytes) --- */
        union {
                void *             slot[16];             /*   128   128 */
                struct {
                        void *     pad[15];              /*   128   120 */
                        /* --- cacheline 3 boundary (192 bytes) was 56 bytes ago --- */
                        struct maple_metadata meta;      /*   248     2 */
                };                                       /*   128   128 */
        };                                               /*   128   128 */

        /* size: 256, cachelines: 4, members: 3 */
};
```

The structure `maple_range_64` represents a maple node in the following manner.
The pivots indicate the endpoints of 16 intervals, while the slots are used to
reference the VMA structure when the node is considered a leaf node. The layout
of pivots and slots can be visualized as shown below:

```
 Slots -> | 0 | 1 | 2 | ... | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 |
          ┬   ┬   ┬   ┬     ┬    ┬    ┬    ┬    ┬
          │   │   │   │     │    │    │    │    └─ Implied maximum
          │   │   │   │     │    │    │    └─ Pivot 14
          │   │   │   │     │    │    └─ Pivot 13
          │   │   │   │     │    └─ Pivot 12
          │   │   │   │     └─ Pivot 11
          │   │   │   └─ Pivot 2
          │   │   └─ Pivot 1
          │   └─ Pivot 0
          └─  Implied minimum
```

Regarding concurrent modification, the maple tree imposes restrictions,
requiring an exclusive lock to be held by writers. In the case of the VMA tree,
the exclusive lock corresponds to the MM write lock. As for readers, two
options are available. The first option involves holding the MM read lock,
which results in the writer being blocked by the MM read-write lock.
Alternatively, the second option is to enter the RCU critical section. By doing
so, the writer is not blocked, and readers can continue their operations since
the maple tree is RCU-safe. While most existing VMA accesses opt for the first
option, the second option is employed in a few performance-critical scenarios,
such as lockless page faults.

However, there is an additional aspect that requires particular attention,
which pertains to stack expansion. The stack represents a memory area that is
mapped with the MAP_GROWSDOWN flag, indicating automatic expansion when an
address below the region is accessed. In such cases, the start address of the
corresponding VMA is adjusted, as well as the associated interval within the
maple tree. Notably, these adjustments are made without holding the MM write
lock.

```c
static inline
void do_user_addr_fault(struct pt_regs *regs,
                        unsigned long error_code,
                        unsigned long address)
{
	// ...

	if (unlikely(!mmap_read_trylock(mm))) {
		// ...
	}
	// ...
	if (unlikely(expand_stack(vma, address))) {
		// ...
	}

	// ...
}
```

Typically, a gap exists between the stack VMA and its neighboring VMA, as the
kernel enforces a stack guard. In this scenario, when expanding the stack, only
the pivot value in the maple node needs updating, a process that can be
performed atomically. However, if the neighboring VMA also possesses the
MAP_GROWSDOWN flag, no stack guard is enforced. Consequently, the stack
expansion can eliminate the gap. In such situations, the gap interval within
the maple node must be removed. As the maple tree is RCU-safe, overwriting the
node in-place is not possible. Instead, a new node is created, triggering node
replacement, and the old node is subsequently destroyed using an RCU callback.

```c
int expand_downwards(struct vm_area_struct *vma, unsigned long address)
{
	// ...

	if (prev) {
		if (!(prev->vm_flags & VM_GROWSDOWN) &&
		    vma_is_accessible(prev) &&
		    (address - prev->vm_end < stack_guard_gap))
			return -ENOMEM;
	}

	// ...
}
```

The RCU callback is invoked only after all pre-existing RCU critical sections
have concluded. However, the issue arises when accessing VMAs, as only the MM
read lock is held, and it does not enter the RCU critical section.
Consequently, in theory, the callback could be invoked at any time, resulting
in the freeing of the old maple node. However, pointers to the old node may
have already been fetched, leading to a use-after-free bug when attempting
subsequent access to it.

The backtrace where use-after-free (UAF) occurs is shown below:

```

## Fix

I reported this vulnerability to the Linux kernel security team on June 15th.
Following that, the process of addressing this bug was led by Linus Torvalds.
Given its complexity, it took nearly two weeks to develop a set of patches that
received consensus.

On June 28th, during the merge window for Linux kernel 5.5, the fix was merged
into Linus' tree. Linus provided a [comprehensive merge message][fix] to
elucidate the patch series from a technical perspective.

 [fix]: <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=9471f1f2f50282b9e8f59198ec6bb738b4ccc009>

These patches were subsequently backported to stable kernels ([6.1.37][6.1],
[6.3.11][6.3], and [6.4.1][6.4]), effectively resolving the "Stack Rot" bug on
July 1st.

 [6.1]: [https://lore.kernel.org/stable/2023070133-create-stainless-9a8c@gregkh/T/](https://lore.kernel.org/stable/2023070133-create-stainless-9a8c%40gregkh/T/)
 [6.3]: [https://lore.kernel.org/stable/2023070146-endearing-bounding-d21a@gregkh/T/](https://lore.kernel.org/stable/2023070146-endearing-bounding-d21a%40gregkh/T/)
 [6.4]: [https://lore.kernel.org/stable/2023070140-eldercare-landlord-133c@gregkh/T/](https://lore.kernel.org/stable/2023070140-eldercare-landlord-133c%40gregkh/T/)

## Exploit

**The complete exploit code and a comprehensive write-up will be made publicly
available no later than the end of July.**

Subject: Re: Re: [MAINTAINERS SUMMIT] Handling of embargoed security issues --
 security@...g vs. linux-distros@

Hi, Alexander and all,

I was more or less waiting for a public discussion to start on oss-security or somewhere else, because I'd like to express how important the announcements of Linux kernel issues via linux-distros is to us.

We operate the IT infrastructure of a scientific research institute (456 users, 144 Linux servers, 98 Linux workstations, about 6 PB used storage). We are not using any distro, everything is build locally and we maintain the systems by continuous rolling upgrades.

All systems from workstations to cluster servers run the same (set of) kernels and identical userspace. The setting is rather unusual these days, all shared storage including homes is on software raid and available to the other systems via automounted nfs. We have a few public servers and a rather big computer cluster with a job scheduler. Everything is multi-user. We need to maintain separation between users and to defend the systems against attacks from the (possible abused) unprivileged user accounts.

Our scientist run software on cluster-servers which often take many, many days to complete because of the size of the input data. Other might, for example, experiment with Jupyter Notebooks and have a lot of in-memory state. We have long running remote login sessions round the clock. For efficiency, most things run natively on hardware and not in virtual machines. System reboots have a lot of negative impact for our users.

Even nowadays not everything is single-user or microservices. "All users of the X:X kernel series must upgrade" or "just run mainline" is not a helpful strategy for us, because there is the operational issue of booting into a new kernel. Also, because we have a rather unusual settings, it is not unusual that we run into bugs others haven't discovered before. That's why we rather test new releases and roll them out slowly. That may be a corner case, but these corner cases exist, too.

We heavily rely on the information about kernel security issues published to linux-distros, which we, of course, can only receive via oss-security after the embargo. We analyze each and every new topic on oss-security to decide, whether it is relevant to us and what we can do about it. Nearly all of the userspace issues are of no relevance to us, but many of the kernel issues are, if we happen to run affected kernel versions.

We go a long way to avoid rebooting. This might be as easy as disabling unused dynamic modules by just removing the .ko files from userspace, but sometimes we even convert an upstream fix into a loadable module which uses ftrace to replace or wrap the buggy functions in the running systems. A "reboot party" would only be a measure of last resort.

oss-security gives us the notifications and enough information or references so that we can deal with the problems. We can not just follow mainline (or a stable series) and analyze every patch ourself to identify, whether a security bug was silently fixed. We can not boot into a new kernel every few days, just in case.

Exploits are sometimes helpful, too, for example to quickly identify whether we run affected versions, which sometimes isn't that trivial to find out otherwise, or to verify that our mitigations are working as intended.

I would very much appreciate if a policy could be found with the kernel community that encourages to send information to linux-distros. If that requires that the rather strict procedures and deadlines of linux-distros are relaxed, I hope there is room for compromise.

Best

  Donald

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2215268#c0)  Rohit Keshri    2023-06-15 09:04:00 UTC  ``` A vulnerability exists in the memory management subsystem of the Linux kernel. The lock handling for accessing and updating virtual memory areas (VMAs) is incorrect, leading to use-after-free problems. This issue can be successfully exploited to execute arbitrary kernel code, escalate containers, and gain root privileges.   The BUG is introduced in conjunction with the introduction of the maple tree in kernel v6.1.  The maple tree, responsible for managing virtual memory areas, can undergo node replacement without properly acquiring the MM write lock, leading to use-after-free issues.  Upstream fix: <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=9471f1f2f50282b9e8f59198ec6bb738b4ccc009>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2215268#c1)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2023-07-05 18:35:25 UTC  ``` Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2219916](show_bug.cgi?id=2219916 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2023-3269 kernel: distros-[DirtyVMA] Privilege escalation via non-RCU-protected VMA traversal [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2215268#c2)  Product Security DevOps Team    2023-07-05 23:01:14 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed. Further updates for individual products will be reflected on the CVE page(s):  <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2023-3269>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2215268#c3)  Rohit Keshri    2023-07-07 15:30:52 UTC  ``` There was no shipped RHEL kernel seen affected with this problem.  The StackRot vulnerability has been present in the Linux kernel since version 6.1 when the VMA tree structure was changed from red-black trees to maple trees.   ``` |  |
