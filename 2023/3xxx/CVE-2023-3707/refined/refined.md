- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly check if post content to be displayed is public and belongs to the plugin, which allows an authenticated user to retrieve content from arbitrary posts through an IDOR vector.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR), Broken Access Control
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with subscriber-level access can retrieve the content of any post, including draft and private ones. Password-protected posts are not affected.
- **Attack vectors:** By sending a crafted POST request to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint with `action=parse-media-shortcode` and specific `shortcode` parameters (`ap_excerpt` or `ap_content`) along with the target post's `post_ID`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least subscriber-level privileges on the WordPress site.
