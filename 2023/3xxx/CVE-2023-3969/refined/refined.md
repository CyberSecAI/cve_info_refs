{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when editing booking promo codes, leading to stored XSS. Additionally, it lacks file type validation during image upload allowing for arbitrary file upload.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
    "Unrestricted File Upload"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation of the XSS vulnerability can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. The unrestricted file upload allows an attacker to upload malicious files (e.g., SVG with embedded scripts), which when accessed, can lead to further exploitation such as XSS.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "The XSS vulnerability is triggered by entering a crafted payload in the 'Promo code' field while editing a booking.",
    "The unrestricted file upload is triggered when uploading an SVG file with embedded Javascript."
 ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to access the booking edit page and the account settings page. They can be authenticated user to be able to perform these actions."
