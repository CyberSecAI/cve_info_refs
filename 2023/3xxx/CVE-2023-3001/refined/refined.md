Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is due to the **Deserialization of Untrusted Data (CWE-502)** in the Dashboard module of Schneider Electric's IGSS (Interactive Graphical SCADA System).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The Dashboard module is susceptible to the processing of malicious payload data.
*   Specifically, the vulnerability lies in how the module deserializes data, which allows for an attacker to inject malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation can lead to **remote code execution**.
*   This remote code execution could result in various issues, including **loss of control of the SCADA system** when IGSS is running in production mode.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack requires an attacker to get a user to open a malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious file containing the exploit.
*   The attacker needs to be able to get a user to open this malicious file (likely social engineering tactics).
