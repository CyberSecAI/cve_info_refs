Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the security-related changes:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The commit addresses a missing login failure restriction when entering a 2FA code. Previously, failed 2FA attempts were not being counted or limited like regular username/password login attempts, which could lead to a brute-force attack on the 2FA code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing rate limiting:** The primary vulnerability was the lack of rate limiting or lockout mechanism for failed 2FA code entries. This meant an attacker could repeatedly try different 2FA codes without being blocked or delayed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Bypass 2FA:** An attacker could potentially bypass 2FA if the 2FA secret is known but the current code is not, by using brute-force attacks.
- **Account takeover:** Successful bypass of 2FA could lead to unauthorized access to user accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Brute-force attack:** An attacker would need to target the login page, successfully authenticate with a valid username/password, and then try different 2FA codes until they find the correct one. This can be automated using tools and scripts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Valid username/password:** The attacker needs to have a valid username and password for an account that has 2FA enabled.
- **Access to the login page:** The attacker needs network access to the Froxlor login page.
- **Ability to make repeated requests:** The attacker needs the ability to send repeated requests to try different 2FA codes.

**Technical Details:**
- The commit introduces code to track failed 2FA attempts, similar to how failed password login attempts are tracked.
- It uses the `lastlogin_fail` and `loginfail_count` fields in the database to keep track of failed attempts.
- If the number of failed 2FA attempts exceeds the defined limit (`Settings::Get('login.maxloginattempts')`) within a certain time window (`Settings::Get('login.deactivatetime')`), the user is locked out and a log entry is created.

**Additional Notes:**
- The commit also includes updates to language files (`lng/de.lng.php` and `lng/en.lng.php`) to add an error message for incorrect 2FA codes.
- The template file `templates/Froxlor/login/enter2fa.html.twig` is also modified to display the error message.
- This commit hardens the security of the 2FA process by implementing brute-force protection.
