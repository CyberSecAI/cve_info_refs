- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin fails to sanitize and escape certain settings, allowing for the injection of malicious JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The plugin does not properly sanitize user-provided input in the settings.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that is executed when a user visits the affected page. This can lead to various attacks, including session hijacking, phishing, and defacement.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to be a high-privilege user (e.g., admin) and have access to the plugin settings page. The attacker injects malicious JavaScript into the "link field" of a custom channel within the plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be an administrator or another user with high privileges. The attacker must also be able to access and modify plugin settings.
