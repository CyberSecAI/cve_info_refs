Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the identified SSRF vulnerability:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Affected Software:** DedeCMS v5.7.109
*   **Vulnerability:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability exists within the `GetRssLinks()` function, specifically in how it processes the `rssurl` parameter. The application uses `parse_url()` function within the `PrivateInit()` which leads to SSRF.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   The application fails to properly sanitize or validate the `rssurl` parameter.
    *   The application directly uses the provided URL to make a request via `OpenUrl()` function.
*  **Attack Vector:** The attacker can control the `rssurl` parameter, injecting a malicious URL.
*  **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable application and modify the `rssurl` parameter.
*   **Impact:**
    *   An attacker can potentially make requests to internal resources that are not intended to be exposed to the outside world
    *  The attacker can potentially use the vulnerable application as a proxy to scan internal networks.
    *  The attacker could potentially read local files if the application is allowed to access local resources.

**Technical Details:**

1.  The vulnerability is triggered through the `rssurl` parameter.
2.  The `GetRssLinks()` function processes this parameter.
3.  The `OpenUrl()` function is used to make an external request using the provided URL, without proper validation.
4.  The `parse_url()` function within the `PrivateInit()` function is key to triggering the SSRF.
