Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2023-3373:

**Root Cause:**
* The vulnerability stems from the FTP server function on Mitsubishi Electric GOT2000 Series and GOT SIMPLE Series using easily guessable port numbers for data connections. Specifically, the port numbers are predictable based on previous values. This is due to Predictable Exact Value from Previous Values (CWE-342).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
* **Predictable Port Numbers:** The core weakness is that the port numbers used for FTP data connections are predictable, which allows attackers to anticipate the ports used for data transfers.
* **Lack of Randomization:** The system does not implement sufficient randomization or secure methods for assigning port numbers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can guess the data connection port and connect to it, preventing legitimate users from establishing data connections, thus leading to a denial-of-service condition.
* **Session Hijacking/Spoofing:**  An attacker can hijack existing data connections by connecting to the predictable port and potentially intercept or modify the data being transferred during the FTP session.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Network-based:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over the network, as the FTP server functionality is exposed on the network.
* **Passive Mode FTP:** The vulnerability exists when the FTP server is operating in passive mode, where the server listens on a port for the client to connect for data transfer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network or have network access to the device running the vulnerable FTP server.
* **Knowledge of the device:** The attacker needs to be able to predict the port number that the FTP server will use for a data connection.
* **Timing:** The attacker must connect to the data port at the right time to hijack a connection or cause a DoS. The attack requires some level of timing, specifically attempting connection to a data port soon after an expected FTP connection setup.
* **User Interaction:** User interaction is required to trigger a FTP session.

**Additional Details:**
* The affected products are Mitsubishi Electric GOT2000 Series (GT21 model) and GOT SIMPLE Series (GS21 model) with Base System Application versions 01.49.000 and prior.
* The vulnerability is fixed in Base System Application versions 01.50.000 or later, shipped with GT Designer3 Version1(GOT2000) Ver. 1.300 N or later.
* Mitigation includes restricting physical access, using VPN, blocking access from untrusted networks, using antivirus and IP filtering or disabling the FTP server if not required.
* The CVSS score is 5.9 (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:L).
