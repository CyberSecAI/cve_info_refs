Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-3090:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from missing initialization within the ipvlan networking implementation in the Linux kernel.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds write:  Lack of proper initialization leads to an out-of-bounds write when handling network packets via the `ipvlan` module. This occurs because the `skb->cb` is not cleared before calling `ip_local_out` or `ip6_local_out`. The `skb->cb` is used to store data used by the qdisc, and is later used by `__ip_options_echo`. If it has data from a previous usage, it is used as the source for a `memcpy`, leading to out-of-bounds write.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS): The out-of-bounds write can cause a system crash.
- Potential arbitrary code execution:  The out-of-bounds write could potentially be leveraged to execute arbitrary code, although the provided information does not explicitly detail the steps or likelihood of such an outcome.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local exploitation: A local attacker (user) can trigger the vulnerability via network operations using the `ipvlan` interface.
- The vulnerability is triggered when redirecting egress packets to ingress using the `ipvlan` feature.
- The specific conditions for triggering the vulnerability include specific networking configurations involving `ipvlan` with `IPVLAN_MODE_L3` and firewall rules using `iptables`.
- Triggering the vulnerability requires sending network packets via the vulnerable interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local access: The attacker needs to have local access to the system.
- Ability to configure network interfaces: The attacker needs to be able to configure `ipvlan` network interfaces and set firewall rules using `iptables`.
- No specific privileges are mentioned to exploit the vulnerability, besides being able to configure a network interface

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The fix involves zeroing out `skb->cb` before calling `ip_local_out` or `ip6_local_out` by adding `memset(IPCB(skb), 0, sizeof(*IPCB(skb)))` or `memset(IP6CB(skb), 0, sizeof(*IP6CB(skb)))` respectively.
- The vulnerability was reproduced with a KASAN kernel during testing on the stable-5.10 branch.

**Summary:**
CVE-2023-3090 is a vulnerability in the Linux kernel's `ipvlan` networking implementation.  It can be exploited by a local attacker who can configure network interfaces and set firewall rules using `iptables` to cause an out-of-bounds write. This can lead to a denial of service, and potentially arbitrary code execution. The fix involves clearing the `skb->cb` before using it in network operations.

The NetApp advisory indicates a CVSS score of 7.8 (HIGH) with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H. This confirms that it is exploitable with low effort and can lead to compromise of confidentiality, integrity and availability. However, only very specific products were affected.
