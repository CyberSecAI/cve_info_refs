Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2022-4269

    William Zhao discovered that a flaw in the Traffic Control (TC)
    subsystem when using a specific networking configuration
    (redirecting egress packets to ingress using TC action "mirred"),
    may allow a local unprivileged user to cause a denial of service
    (triggering a CPU soft lockup).

CVE-2022-39189

    Jann Horn discovered that TLB flush operations are mishandled in
    the KVM subsystem in certain KVM_VCPU_PREEMPTED situations, which
    may allow an unprivileged guest user to compromise the guest
    kernel.

CVE-2023-1206

    It was discovered that the networking stack permits attackers to
    force hash collisions in the IPv6 connection lookup table, which
    may result in denial of service (significant increase in the cost
    of lookups, increased CPU utilization).

CVE-2023-1380

    Jisoo Jang reported a heap out-of-bounds read in the brcmfmac
    Wi-Fi driver. On systems using this driver, a local user could
    exploit this to read sensitive information or to cause a denial of
    service.

CVE-2023-2002

    Ruiahn Li reported an incorrect permissions check in the Bluetooth
    subsystem. A local user could exploit this to reconfigure local
    Bluetooth interfaces, resulting in information leaks, spoofing, or
    denial of service (loss of connection).

CVE-2023-2007

    Lucas Leong and Reno Robert discovered a
    time-of-check-to-time-of-use flaw in the dpt_i2o SCSI controller
    driver. A local user with access to a SCSI device using this

                 CVE-2023-35828

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2023-1380

    Jisoo Jang reported a heap out-of-bounds read in the brcmfmac
    Wi-Fi driver.  On systems using this driver, a local user could
    exploit this to read sensitive information or to cause a denial of
    service (crash).

CVE-2023-2002

    Ruiahn Li reported an incorrect permissions check in the Bluetooth
    subsystem.  A local user could exploit this to reconfigure local
    Bluetooth interfaces, resulting in information leaks, spoofing, or
    denial of service (loss of connection).

CVE-2023-2007

    Lucas Leong (@_wmliang_) and Reno Robert of Trend Micro Zero Day
    Initiative discovered a time-of-check-to-time-of-use flaw in the
    dpt_i2o SCSI controller driver.  A local user with access to a
    SCSI device using this driver could exploit this for privilege
    escalation.

    This flaw has been mitigated by removing support for the I2OUSRCMD
    operation.

CVE-2023-2269

    Zheng Zhang reported that improper handling of locking in the
    device mapper implementation may result in denial of service.

CVE-2023-3090

    It was discovered that missing initialization in ipvlan networking
    may lead to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, resulting in
    denial of service or potentially the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2023-3111

    The TOTE Robot tool found a flaw in the Btrfs filesystem driver
    that can lead to a use-after-free.  It's unclear whether an
    unprivileged user can exploit this.

CVE-2023-3141

    A flaw was discovered in the r592 memstick driver that could lead
    to a use-after-free after the driver is removed or unbound from a
    device.  The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2023-3268

    It was discovered that an out-of-bounds memory access in relayfs
    could result in denial of service or an information leak.

CVE-2023-3338

    Ornaghi Davide discovered a flaw in the DECnet protocol
    implementation which could lead to a null pointer dereference or
    use-after-free.  A local user can exploit this to cause a denial
    of service (crash or memory corruption) and probably for privilege
    escalation.

    This flaw has been mitigated by removing the DECnet protocol
    implementation.

CVE-2023-20593

    Tavis Ormandy discovered that under specific microarchitectural
    circumstances, a vector register in AMD "Zen 2" CPUs may not be
    written to 0 correctly.  This flaw allows an attacker to leak
    sensitive information across concurrent processes, hyper threads
    and virtualized guests.

    For details please refer to
    <<https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/zenbleed.html>> and
    <<https://github.com/google/security-research/security/advisories/GHSA-v6wh-rxpg-cmm8>>.

    This issue can also be mitigated by a microcode update through the
    amd64-microcode package or a system firmware (BIOS/UEFI) update.
    However, the initial microcode release by AMD only provides
    updates for second generation EPYC CPUs.  Various Ryzen CPUs are
    also affected, but no updates are available yet.

CVE-2023-31084

    It was discovered that the DVB Core driver does not properly
    handle locking of certain events, allowing a local user to cause a
    denial of service.

CVE-2023-32233

    Patryk Sondej and Piotr Krysiuk discovered a use-after-free flaw
    in the Netfilter nf_tables implementation when processing batch
    requests, which may result in local privilege escalation for a
    user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any user or network
    namespace.

CVE-2023-34256

    The syzbot tool found a time-of-check-to-time-of-use flaw in the
    ext4 filesystem driver.  An attacker able to mount a disk image or
    device that they can also write to directly could exploit this to
    cause an out-of-bounds read, possibly resulting in a leak of
    sensitive information or denial of service (crash).

CVE-2023-35788

    Hangyu Hua discovered an out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the
    Flower classifier which may result in denial of service or the
    execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2023-35823

    A flaw was discovered in the saa7134 media driver that could lead
    to a use-after-free after the driver is removed or unbound from a
    device.  The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2023-35824

    A flaw was discovered in the dm1105 media driver that could lead
    to a use-after-free after the driver is removed or unbound from a
    device.  The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2023-35828

    A flaw was discovered in the renesas_udc USB device-mode driver
    that could lead to a use-after-free after the driver is removed or
    unbound from a device.  The security impact of this is unclear.

    This driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
4.19.289-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

ipvlan:Fix out-of-bounds caused by unclear skb->cbIf skb enqueue the qdisc, fq\_skb\_cb(skb)->time\_to\_send is changed which
is actually skb->cb, and IPCB(skb\_in)->opt will be used in
\_\_ip\_options\_echo. It is possible that memcpy is out of bounds and lead
to stack overflow.
We should clear skb->cb before ip\_local\_out or ip6\_local\_out.
v2:
1. clean the stack info
2. use IPCB/IP6CB instead of skb->cb
crash on stable-5.10(reproduce in kasan kernel).

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2023-2124

    Kyle Zeng, Akshay Ajayan and Fish Wang discovered that missing
    metadata validation may result in denial of service or potential
    privilege escalation if a corrupted XFS disk image is mounted.

CVE-2023-2156

    It was discovered that the IPv6 RPL protocol implementation in the
    Linux kernel did not properly handled user-supplied data, resulting
    in a triggerable assertion. An unauthenticated remote attacker can
    take advantage of this flaw for denial of service.

CVE-2023-2269

    Zheng Zhang reported that improper handling of locking in the device
    mapper implementation may result in denial of service.

CVE-2023-3090

    It was discovered that missing initialization in ipvlan networking
    may lead to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, resulting in
    denial of service or potentially the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2023-3212

    Yang Lan that missing validation in the GFS2 filesystem could result
    in denial of service via a NULL pointer dereference when mounting a
    malformed GFS2 filesystem.

CVE-2023-3268

    It was discovered that an out-of-bounds memory access in relayfs
    could result in denial of service or an information leak.

CVE-2023-3269

    Ruihan Li discovered that incorrect lock handling for accessing and
    updating virtual memory areas (VMAs) may result in privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2023-3390

    A use-after-free flaw in the netfilter subsystem caused by incorrect
    error path handling may result in denial of service or privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2023-31084

    It was discovered that the DVB Core driver does not properly handle
    locking of certain events, allowing a local user to cause a denial
    of service.

CVE-2023-32250 / CVE-2023-32254

    Quentin Minster discovered two race conditions in KSMBD, a kernel
    server which implements the SMB3 protocol, which could result in
    denial of service or potentially the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2023-35788

    Hangyu Hua discovered an out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the
    Flower classifier which may result in denial of service or the
    execution of arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (bookworm), these problems have been fixed in
version 6.1.37-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
