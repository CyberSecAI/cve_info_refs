Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-3355:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a missing check of the return value of `kmalloc()` in the `submit_lookup_cmds()` function within the `drivers/gpu/drm/msm/msm_gem_submit.c` file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **NULL Pointer Dereference:** If `kmalloc()` fails to allocate memory, it returns a NULL pointer. The code then proceeds to use this NULL pointer without checking for the allocation failure, leading to a NULL pointer dereference when attempting `copy_from_user()` with a NULL `relocs` pointer.
- **Missing Error Handling:** The absence of a check for the return value of `kmalloc()` before using the pointer is a fundamental flaw in the error-handling mechanism.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **System Crash:** A local user can trigger a system crash by causing a NULL pointer dereference, which leads to denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local User Exploitation:** A local user with the ability to interact with the GPU subsystem can trigger the vulnerable code path.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have a local user account on the system.
- The attacker must be able to trigger code that uses the vulnerable `submit_lookup_cmds()` function, typically by initiating graphics processing through the DRM/MSM (Direct Rendering Manager/Qualcomm MSM) driver.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was present in Linux kernel versions up to 6.1-rc8.
- The fix involves adding a check for the NULL pointer returned by `kmalloc()`.
- Red Hat indicates that Red Hat Enterprise Linux is not affected because the related kernel config parameter, `CONFIG_DRM_MSM` is enabled only for Fedora.
- The patch that resolves the issue is commit `d839f0811a31322c087a859c2b181e2383daa7be`.
- A related bug report is included in the bugzilla information.
- The vulnerability was found by Jiasheng Jiang, and reviewed by Dmitry Baryshkov.
- The issue is related to memory allocation and error handling in the Linux kernel.
- The `GFP_KERNEL` flag is used for the allocation.
