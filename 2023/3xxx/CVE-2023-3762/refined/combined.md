[00:50] said some days I feel like some
[00:52] days I want to quit and just be normal
[00:54] for a bit I don't understand why you
[00:56] have to always be gone I get along but
[00:58] the Crips always feel so long and I find
[01:01] myself trying to stay by the phone cause
[01:02] your voice always helps me then I feel
[01:04] so alone but I feel like an idiot
[01:06] working my day around the corner when I
[01:08] pick up I don't have much to say so I
[01:10] want you to know it's a little up
[01:12] that I'm stuck here waiting at times
[01:14] debating telling you that I've added

[01:59] way you can call me if you find it you
[02:01] have something to say and I'll tell you
[02:03] I want you to know it's a little
[02:05] up that I'm stuck here waiting at times
[02:07] the people telling you that I've had a
[02:09] review in your career
