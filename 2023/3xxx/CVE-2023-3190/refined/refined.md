    "weaknesses": [
      "XSS vulnerabilities in several text inputs"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the application, leading to various attacks such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirection.",

      "Manipulating input fields within the application to include malicious JavaScript code."

    ],
        "additional_details": "The commit introduces `simplePurifier` and `fieldDomPurifier` functions to sanitize user inputs, replacing character escaping with DOMPurify library. The `fieldDomPurifierLoop` function sanitizes multiple fields at once and triggers a warning message if XSS attempts are detected. The code updates multiple javascript files to use the new sanitization functions `fieldDomPurifierWithWarning` or  `fieldDomPurifierLoop` on text inputs."
