Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** The content does not explicitly mention a CVE ID, but based on the description, this is likely related to **CNVD-2021-91411**.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The root cause is a command injection vulnerability in the "Flying Fish" device. This vulnerability is triggered via the `/send_order.cgi` endpoint. The device directly uses the user-supplied "parameter" value without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is command injection, which allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the device's operating system.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The device does not sanitize the input passed through the `parameter` in the URL, making the command injection possible.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The exploit does not require authentication and allows a remote user to execute commands without logging in.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Device Reboot:** The provided exploit demonstrates how to reboot the device. However, a successful command injection could lead to complete device compromise.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the operating system of the device.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** Depending on the device and the attacker's skills, the attacker could potentially gain full control over the device, leading to data exfiltration, denial of service, or further malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP POST request to the `/send_order.cgi` endpoint.
*   **URL Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker injects a command into the `parameter` within the URL.
*   **Network Accessibility:** The attacker needs network access to the device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable device on port 8081,
*   **HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker should know how to make HTTP requests.
*   **Basic Understanding of Command Injection:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of command injection to craft the malicious payload.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content includes a Proof of Concept (POC) showing how to trigger a reboot of the device.
*   The vulnerable device is identified as "Flying Fish" version "VEC40G".
*   The official website for the product is provided as `http://www.adslr.com/`.
*   The vulnerability was assigned CNVD-2021-91411.
