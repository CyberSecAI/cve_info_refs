- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `X-Gitlab-Token` is included in the `log_data` JSON payload passed as an argument to the `WebHooks::LogExecutionWorker`, and this payload is not redacted when the Sidekiq log format is set to `default`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The webhook token is exposed in cleartext in the Sidekiq logs.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with access to the Sidekiq logs can obtain the webhook token, potentially allowing them to impersonate the webhook and trigger actions or access resources that are intended to be protected by the token.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker must have access to the Sidekiq logs to view the exposed tokens.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker needs access to the GitLab server's Sidekiq logs.
