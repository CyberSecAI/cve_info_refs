Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2021-44879

    Wenqing Liu reported a NULL pointer dereference in the f2fs
    implementation. An attacker able to mount a specially crafted image
    can take advantage of this flaw for denial of service.

CVE-2023-0590

    Dmitry Vyukov discovered a race condition in the network scheduler
    core that that can lead to a use-after-free.  A local user with
    the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any user or network namespace
    could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory
    corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2023-1077

    Pietro Borrello reported a type confusion flaw in the task
    scheduler.  A local user might be able to exploit this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2023-1206

    It was discovered that the networking stack permits attackers to
    force hash collisions in the IPv6 connection lookup table, which
    may result in denial of service (significant increase in the cost
    of lookups, increased CPU utilization).

CVE-2023-1989

    Zheng Wang reported a race condition in the btsdio Bluetooth
    adapter driver that can lead to a use-after-free.  An attacker
    able to insert and remove SDIO devices can use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly to run
    arbitrary code in the kernel.

CVE-2023-3212

    Yang Lan discovered that missing validation in the GFS2 filesystem
    could result in denial of service via a NULL pointer dereference
    when mounting a malformed GFS2 filesystem.

CVE-2023-3390

    A use-after-free flaw in the netfilter subsystem caused by
    incorrect error path handling may result in denial of service or
    privilege escalation.

    A race condition was found in the nftables subsystem that could
    lead to a use-after-free.  A local user could exploit this to
    cause a denial of service (crash), information leak, or possibly
    for privilege escalation.

CVE-2023-4622

    Bing-Jhong Billy Jheng discovered a use-after-free within the Unix
    domain sockets component, which may result in local privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2023-4623

    Budimir Markovic reported a missing configuration check in the
    sch_hfsc network scheduler that could lead to a use-after-free or
    other problems.  A local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in
    any user or network namespace could exploit this to cause a denial
    of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2023-4921

    "valis" reported flaws in the sch_qfq network scheduler that could
    lead to a use-after-free.  A local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN
    capability in any user or network namespace could exploit this to
    cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly
    for privilege escalation.

CVE-2023-5717

    Budimir Markovic reported a heap out-of-bounds write vulnerability
    in the Linux kernel's Performance Events system caused by improper
    handling of event groups, which may result in denial of service or
    privilege escalation. The default settings in Debian prevent
    exploitation unless more permissive settings have been applied in
    the kernel.perf_event_paranoid sysctl.

CVE-2023-6606

    "j51569436" reported a potential out-of-bounds read in the CIFS
    filesystem implementation.  If a CIFS filesystem is mounted from a
    malicious server, the server could possibly exploit this to cause
    a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2023-6931

    Budimir Markovic reported a heap out-of-bounds write vulnerability
    in the Linux kernel's Performance Events system which may result in
    denial of service or privilege escalation. The default settings in
    Debian prevent exploitation unless more permissive settings have
    been applied in the kernel.perf_event_paranoid sysctl.

CVE-2023-6932

    A use-after-free vulnerability in the IPv4 IGMP implementation may
    result in denial of service or privilege escalation.

CVE-2023-25775

    Ivan D Barrera, Christopher Bednarz, Mustafa Ismail and Shiraz
    Saleem discovered that improper access control in the Intel Ethernet
    Controller RDMA driver may result in privilege escalation.

CVE-2023-34319

    Ross Lagerwall discovered a buffer overrun in Xen's netback driver
    which may allow a Xen guest to cause denial of service to the
    virtualisation host by sending malformed packets.

CVE-2023-34324

    Marek Marczykowski-Gorecki reported a possible deadlock in the Xen
    guests event channel code which may allow a malicious guest
    administrator to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2023-35001

    Tanguy DUBROCA discovered an out-of-bounds reads and write flaw in
    the Netfilter nf_tables implementation when processing an
    nft_byteorder expression, which may result in local privilege
    escalation for a user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any
    user or network namespace.

CVE-2023-39189, CVE-2023-39192, CVE-2023-39193

    Lucas Leong of Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative reported missing
    bounds checks in the nfnetlink_osf, xt_u32, and xt_sctp netfilter
    modules.  A local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any
    user or network namespace could exploit these to leak sensitive
    information from the kernel or for denial of service (crash).

CVE-2023-39194

    Lucas Leong of Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative reported a missing
    bounds check in the xfrm (IPsec) subsystem.  A local user with the
    CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any user or network namespace could
    exploit this to leak sensitive information from the kernel or for
    denial of service (crash).

    A use-after-free was discovered in Bluetooth L2CAP socket
    handling.

CVE-2023-42753

    Kyle Zeng discovered an off-by-one error in the netfilter ipset
    subsystem which could lead to out-of-bounds memory access.  A
    local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any user or
    network namespace could exploit this to cause a denial of service
    (memory corruption or crash) and possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2023-42754

    Kyle Zeng discovered a flaw in the IPv4 implementation which could
    lead to a null pointer deference.  A local user could exploit this
    for denial of service (crash).

CVE-2023-42755

    Kyle Zeng discovered missing configuration validation in the
    cls_rsvp network classifier which could lead to out-of-bounds
    reads.  A local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any user
    or network namespace could exploit this to cause a denial of
    service (crash) or to leak sensitive information.

    This flaw has been mitigated by removing the cls_rsvp classifier.

CVE-2023-45863

    A race condition in library routines for handling generic kernel
    objects may result in an out-of-bounds write in the
    fill_kobj_path() function.

CVE-2023-45871

    Manfred Rudigier reported a flaw in the igb network driver for
    Intel Gigabit Ethernet interfaces.  When the "rx-all" feature was
    enabled on such a network interface, an attacker on the same
    network segment could send packets that would overflow a receive
    buffer, leading to a denial of service (crash or memory
    corruption) or possibly remote code execution.

CVE-2023-51780

    It was discovered that a race condition in the ATM (Asynchronous
    Transfer Mode) subsystem may lead to a use-after-free.

CVE-2023-51781

    It was discovered that a race condition in the Appletalk subsystem
    may lead to a use-after-free.

CVE-2023-51782

    It was discovered that a race condition in the Amateur Radio X.25
    PLP (Rose) support may lead to a use-after-free. This module is not
    auto-loaded on Debian systems, so this issue only affects systems
    where it is explicitly loaded.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
4.19.304-1.  This update additionally includes many more bug fixes
from stable updates 4.19.290-4.19.304 inclusive.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

netfilter: nf\_tables: incorrect error path handling with NFT\_MSG\_NEWRULEIn case of error when adding a new rule that refers to an anonymous set,
deactivate expressions via NFT\_TRANS\_PREPARE state, not NFT\_TRANS\_RELEASE.
Thus, the lookup expression marks anonymous sets as inactive in the next
generation to ensure it is not reachable in this transaction anymore and
decrement the set refcount as introduced by c1592a89942e ("netfilter:
nf\_tables: deactivate anonymous set from preparation phase"). The abort
step takes care of undoing the anonymous set.
This is also consistent with rule deletion, where NFT\_TRANS\_PREPARE is
used. Note that this error path is exercised in the preparation step of
the commit protocol. This patch replaces nf\_tables\_rule\_release() by the
deactivate and destroy calls, this time with NFT\_TRANS\_PREPARE.
Due to this incorrect error handling, it is possible to access a
dangling pointer to the anonymous set that remains in the transaction
list.

Package        : linux
CVE ID         : CVE-2023-3390 CVE-2023-3610 CVE-2023-20593

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2023-3390

    A use-after-free flaw in the netfilter subsystem caused by incorrect
    error path handling may result in denial of service or privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2023-3610

    A use-after-free flaw in the netfilter subsystem caused by incorrect
    refcount handling on the table and chain destroy path may result in
    denial of service or privilege escalation.

CVE-2023-20593

    Tavis Ormandy discovered that under specific microarchitectural
    circumstances, a vector register in AMD "Zen 2" CPUs may not be
    written to 0 correctly.  This flaw allows an attacker to leak
    sensitive information across concurrent processes, hyper threads
    and virtualized guests.

    For details please refer to
    <<https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/zenbleed.html>> and
    <<https://github.com/google/security-research/security/advisories/GHSA-v6wh-rxpg-cmm8>>.

    This issue can also be mitigated by a microcode update through the
    amd64-microcode package or a system firmware (BIOS/UEFI) update.
    However, the initial microcode release by AMD only provides
    updates for second generation EPYC CPUs.  Various Ryzen CPUs are
    also affected, but no updates are available yet.

For the oldstable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed
in version 5.10.179-3.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

tracker page at:

Package        : linux-5.10
Version        : 5.10.179-3~deb10u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2023-2156 CVE-2023-3390 CVE-2023-3610 CVE-2023-20593
                 CVE-2023-31248 CVE-2023-35001

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2023-2156

    It was discovered that a flaw in the handling of the RPL protocol
    may allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause a denial of
    service if RPL is enabled (not by default in Debian).

CVE-2023-3390

    A use-after-free flaw in the netfilter subsystem caused by
    incorrect error path handling may result in denial of service or
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2023-3610

    A use-after-free flaw in the netfilter subsystem caused by
    incorrect refcount handling on the table and chain destroy path
    may result in denial of service or privilege escalation.

CVE-2023-20593

    Tavis Ormandy discovered that under specific microarchitectural
    circumstances, a vector register in AMD "Zen 2" CPUs may not be
    written to 0 correctly.  This flaw allows an attacker to leak
    sensitive information across concurrent processes, hyper threads
    and virtualized guests.

    For details please refer to
    <<https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/zenbleed.html>> and
    <<https://github.com/google/security-research/security/advisories/GHSA-v6wh-rxpg-cmm8>>.

    This issue can also be mitigated by a microcode update through the
    amd64-microcode package or a system firmware (BIOS/UEFI) update.
    However, the initial microcode release by AMD only provides
    updates for second generation EPYC CPUs.  Various Ryzen CPUs are
    also affected, but no updates are available yet.

CVE-2023-31248

    Mingi Cho discovered a use-after-free flaw in the Netfilter
    nf_tables implementation when using nft_chain_lookup_byid, which
    may result in local privilege escalation for a user with the
    CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any user or network namespace.

CVE-2023-35001

    Tanguy DUBROCA discovered an out-of-bounds reads and write flaw in
    the Netfilter nf_tables implementation when processing an
    nft_byteorder expression, which may result in local privilege
    escalation for a user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any
    user or network namespace.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
5.10.179-3~deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-5.10 packages.

its security tracker page at:
