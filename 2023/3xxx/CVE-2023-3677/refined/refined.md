Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-3677

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input (`pageId` parameter) in the `Export` function within the `woocommerce-pdf-invoice-ajax.php` file.
- There's a lack of proper preparation in the existing SQL query. This allows for the injection of malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, which occurs when untrusted data is inserted into an SQL query without proper sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the database.
- **Potential for Data Modification/Deletion:** The vulnerability, due to SQL injection, also provides the possibility to modify or delete data, although the primary impact as reported seems to be information disclosure.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
- **HTTP Request:** The attack vector involves sending a crafted HTTP request that includes a malicious `pageId` parameter to the vulnerable `Export` function via the `wp_ajax_rednao_wcpdfinv_get_designer_export` hook.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to have at least subscriber level privileges on the WordPress site.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the WordPress site.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code is located in the `Export` function within `/woo-pdf-invoice-builder/trunk/woocommerce-pdf-invoice-ajax.php`.
- Specifically, the SQL query at line `712` of `woocommerce-pdf-invoice-ajax.php` is vulnerable as it directly uses the user-supplied `$_POST['pageId']` parameter without sanitization or proper preparation:
 ```php
 $invoiceData=$wpdb->get_row("select extensions,conditions,attach_to,invoice_id,name,options,type,html,pages from ".RednaoWooCommercePDFInvoice::$INVOICE_TABLE." where invoice_id=".intval($_POST['pageId']));
 ```
- The patch involves using `intval()` to convert the `$_POST['pageId']` to an integer, which prevents SQL injection.

**Affected Software:**
- **Plugin:** WooCommerce PDF Invoice Builder
- **Versions:** <= 1.2.89

**Patch Information:**
- **Patched Version:** 1.2.90
- **Remediation:** Update to version 1.2.90 or later.
