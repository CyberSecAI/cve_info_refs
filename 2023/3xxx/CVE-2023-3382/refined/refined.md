Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability details:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization or encoding of user-supplied data within the `/dipam/save-delegates.php` file, specifically the `del_name` GET parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application stores the malicious script provided in the `del_name` parameter and later renders it within another page (`/dipam/all-delegates.php`), without proper sanitization leading to XSS.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code, which gets executed within the victim's browser when they visit the `/dipam/all-delegates.php` page. This can lead to:
    - **Session Hijacking:** Stealing cookies and session tokens to gain unauthorized access to user accounts.
    - **Phishing:** Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - **Defacement:** Modifying the content of the webpage.
    - **Malware distribution:** Injecting scripts that download and install malware on the user's computer.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP GET request to `/dipam/save-delegates.php` by supplying a malicious payload in the `del_name` parameter.
    - Example: `/dipam/save-delegates.php?del_name=<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>&del_color=%23000000`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- **Basic knowledge of HTTP:** The attacker needs to understand how to construct HTTP requests and embed a malicious script.
- **No Authentication Required** No authentication is mentioned as a prerequisite for the attack.

**Additional details:**
- The provided content includes a specific example payload `del_name=<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>` to demonstrate the vulnerability and highlights that the XSS is triggered when users visits `/dipam/all-delegates.php`.
- The content also includes screenshots demonstrating the exploit.
