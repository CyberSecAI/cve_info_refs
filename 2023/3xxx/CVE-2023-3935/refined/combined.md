#### CVE ID

[CVE-2023-3935](https://cert.vde.com/en/advisories/weakness/CVE-2023-3935)

#### Last Update:

Sept. 19, 2023, 8:50 a.m.

#### Severity

9.8

[(CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H&version=3.1)

#### Weakness

Out-of-bounds Write [(CWE-787)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/787.html)

#### Summary

A heap buffer overflow vulnerability in Wibu CodeMeter Runtime network service up to version 7.60b allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to achieve RCE and gain full access of the host system.

#### Details

[cert.vde.com](https://cert.vde.com/en/advisories/weakness/CVE-2023-3935)

---

#### Impact

An attacker exploiting the vulnerability in WIBU CodeMeter Runtime in server mode could gain full access to the affected server via network access without any user interaction.

Exploiting the vulnerability in WIBU CodeMeter Runtime in non-networked workstation mode could lead to a privilege elevation and full admin access on this workstation.

#### Solution

**Mitigation**

1. Use general security best practices to protect systems from local and network attacks like described in the application node [AH EN INDUSTRIAL SECURITY](https://dam-mdc.phoenixcontact.com/asset/156443151564/7287b631b23077172920b18d738b3b1c/107913_en_02.pdf).
2. Run CodeMeter as client only and use localhost as binding for the CodeMeter communication. With binding to localhost an attack is no longer possible via remote network connection. The network server is disabled by default. If it is not possible to disable the network server, using a host-based firewall to restrict access to the network for reducing the risk is strongly recommended.
3. The CmWAN server is disabled by default. Please check if CmWAN is enabled and disable the feature if it is not needed.
4. Run the CmWAN server only behind a reverse proxy with user authentication to prevent attacks from unauthenticated users. The risk of an unauthenticated attacker can be further reduced by using a host-based firewall that only allows the reverse proxy to access the CmWAN port.

**Remediation**

PHOENIX CONTACT strongly recommends affected users to upgrade to CodeMeter V7.60c, which fixes these vulnerabilities. WIBU-SYSTEMS has already published this update for CodeMeter on their homepage. Since this current version of CodeMeter V7.60c has not yet been incorporated into Phoenix Contact products, we strongly recommend to download and install the current CodeMeter version directly from the WIBU-SYSTEMS homepage.

Install Phoenix Contact Activation Wizard from version 1.7 when available.
Please check the Phoenix Contact e-Shop for your related Software product regularly.

Product Security Advisory WIBU-230704-01

Vulnerability Title

Heap Buffer Overflow Vulnerability in CodeMeter Runtime

Affected products

Product name
CodeMeter Runtime

Vulnerability description

Affected versions
<7.60c All platforms

Fixed Versions
>=7.60c
7.21g

In CodeMeter  Runtime versions up to 7.60b, there  is a heap buffer overflow vulnerability
which can potentially lead to a remote code execution. Currently, no PoC is known to us. To
exploit  the  heap overflow,  additional  protection mechanisms  need  to  be  broken.  Remote
access is only possible if CodeMeter is configured as a server. If CodeMeter is not configured
as a server, the adversary would need to log in to the machine where the CodeMeter Runtime
is running or trick the user into sending a malicious request to CodeMeter. This might result
in an escalation of privilege.

Security Advisory
WIBU-230704-01-v3.0

Mitigations for affected versions

If possible, run CodeMeter as client only. Otherwise restrict access to server to required
clients only by implementing an access list.

General security best practices can help to protect systems from local and network attacks.

#### Summary

The TRUMPF CAD/CAM software tools mentioned above use the vulnerable CodeMeter Runtime (up to version 7.60b) application from WIBU-SYSTEMS AG to manage licenses within the component TRUMPF License Expert. This CodeMeter application contains new vulnerabilities, which may enable an attacker to gain full access to the server or workstation on which the TRUMPF License Expert has been installed on. A new version of the TRUMPF License Expert which fixes this vulnerability is available.
Machines with a running and correctly installed mGuard hardware firewall cannot be exploited by this vulnerability if used as intended (according to the manual).

**Update A, 2023-11-13**

Removed CVE-2023-4701 because it was revoked.

#### CVE ID

[CVE-2023-3935](https://cert.vde.com/en/advisories/weakness/CVE-2023-3935)

#### Last Update:

#### Severity

9.8

[(CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H&version=3.1)

#### Weakness

Out-of-bounds Write [(CWE-787)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/787.html)

#### Summary

A heap buffer overflow vulnerability in Wibu CodeMeter Runtime network service up to version 7.60b allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to achieve RCE and gain full access of the host system.

#### Details

[cert.vde.com](https://cert.vde.com/en/advisories/weakness/CVE-2023-3935)

---

#### Impact

An attacker exploiting the vulnerability in WIBU CodeMeter Runtime in server mode could gain full access to the affected server via network access without any user interaction.

Exploiting the vulnerability in WIBU CodeMeter Runtime in non-networked workstation mode could lead to a privilege elevation and full access on this workstation for an already authenticated user (logged in locally to the PC).

#### Solution

**Mitigation**

* Implement general security best practices like network segmentation, endpoint protection and system hardening.
* Restrict network access to the TRUMPF License Expert server component to required clients only by using firewalls or other suitable products.

**Remediation**

Get the latest version of the TRUMPF License Expert software (>= V2.0.0) at [trumpf.com/de\_DE/produkte/software/software-lizenzierung](https://www.trumpf.com/de_DE/produkte/software/software-lizenzierung/) and install it on all affected servers and workstations.
