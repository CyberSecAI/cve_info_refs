Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in the "album title" and "album description" fields within the asset-manager module of Boom CMS v8.0.7.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application fails to adequately sanitize user-supplied input, allowing attackers to inject malicious script code that is stored persistently and executed whenever the affected content is rendered.
*  **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application attempts to prevent SQL injection by escaping single and double quotes using backslashes. However, this is insufficient to prevent XSS attacks, as it does not address other methods of injecting malicious code, such as HTML and JavaScript.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation can lead to:
*   **Session Hijacking:** Attackers can steal user session cookies.
*   **Persistent Phishing Attacks:** Malicious scripts can be used to display fake login forms or redirect users to phishing sites.
*   **External Redirects to Malicious Sources:** Users can be redirected to attacker-controlled websites.
*   **Persistent Manipulation of Affected Application Modules:**  Attackers can modify the behavior or content of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
*   **POST Request:** Malicious script code is injected via POST requests when creating or editing album titles and descriptions.
*   **Vulnerable Parameters:** The vulnerable parameters are "title" and "description" in the "assets-manager (album)" module.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Low Privileged User Account:** An attacker needs a user account with restricted privileges to access the asset-manager and create or edit albums.
*   **Low User Interaction:** The attack requires minimal user interaction beyond viewing the affected content in the frontend or backend.

**Technical Details**
The vulnerability is located in the input fields of the album title and album description in the asset-manager module. The validation tries to parse the content by usage of a backslash, which only escapes double- and single-quotes and is insufficient to prevent XSS. The injected code is executed when the album is previewed in the frontend and backend.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Modules:** The vulnerability impacts both the frontend (where albums are displayed) and backend (within the asset manager's album listing).
*   **PoC:** The proof of concept demonstrates how an attacker can inject malicious script code into the album title and description, which is then executed when the album is viewed. The provided PoC includes example payloads like `<script>alert(document.cookie)</script><div style=1` and `<a onmouseover=alert(document.cookie)>test</a>`
*   **Patch:**  The suggested solution is to securely parse and encode the vulnerable title and description parameters, restrict input fields and disallow special characters, and sanitize the output.
