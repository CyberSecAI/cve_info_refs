{
  "CVE-2023-3961": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insufficient sanitization of client pipe names passed to the local_np_connect() function in smbd.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Path traversal vulnerability in the handling of SMB pipe names. Allows a client to connect to unix domain sockets outside of the intended private directory by sending a pipe name with directory traversal characters (../).",
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can connect as root to unintended unix domain sockets which may expose services to denial of service, service crash or potential compromise.",
    "Attack vectors": "By sending a specially crafted pipe name using the SMB protocol to the IPC$ share.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be an SMB client able to connect to the vulnerable server."
