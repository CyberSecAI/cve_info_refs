- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient authentication in the MQTT backend (broker) and lack of encryption and authentication of MQTT messages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    -  MQTT backend does not require authentication.
    -  Telemetry data is published on public topics.
    -  Commands are sent to vehicles via public MQTT topics.
    -  MQTT messages are not encrypted or authenticated.
    -  Backend can inject data into vehicle's CAN bus via MQTT messages on public topics without authentication.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Unauthorized access to the telemetry data of the entire fleet of vehicles (GPS location, speed, odometer, fuel, etc.).
    - Manipulation of telemetry data, leading to incorrect information being reported to the backend.
    - Injection of arbitrary data into the CAN bus of vehicles, potentially causing malfunctions or other issues.
    - Impersonation of vehicles or the backend by creating and posting fake messages.
- **Attack vectors**: Network access to the MQTT broker.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Ability to connect to the MQTT broker, which is publicly accessible without authentication.
