# [Improper Backend Communications Allow Access And Manipulation Of The Telemetry Data](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-3028)

## CVE ID

### CVE-2023-3028

## Description

Insufficient authentication in the MQTT backend (broker) allows an attacker to access and even manipulate the telemetry data of the entire fleet of vehicles using the HopeChart HQT-401 telematics unit. Other models are possibly affected too. Multiple vulnerabilities were identified.

* The MQTT backend does not require authentication, allowing unauthorized connections from an attacker.
* The vehicles publish their telemetry data (e.g. GPS Location, speed, odometer, fuel, etc) as messages on public topics.
* The backend also sends commands to the vehicles as MQTT posts in public topics. As a result, an attacker can access the confidential data of the entire fleet that is managed by the backend.
* The MQTT messages sent by the vehicles or the backend are not encrypted or authenticated. An attacker can create and post messages to impersonate a vehicle or the backend. The attacker could then, for example, send incorrect information to the backend about the vehicle’s location.
* The backend can inject data into a vehicle´s CAN bus by sending a specific MQTT message on a public topic. Because these messages are not authenticated or encrypted, an attacker could impersonate the backend, create a fake message, and inject CAN data in any vehicle managed by the backend.

The confirmed version is 201808021036, however further versions have been also identified as potentially impacted.
