- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize and escape a parameter before using it in a SQL statement.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unauthenticated Blind SQL Injection
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can potentially extract sensitive data from the database by using blind SQL injection techniques. Although the impact is rated as high by CVSS (8.6), the description states that this vulnerability allows for information disclosure (C:H) but there is no impact on integrity or availability (I:N/A:N).
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploitable through a crafted HTTP request to the `/wp-json/api/flutter_booking/get_staffs` endpoint, specifically by manipulating the `product_id` parameter
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need to be authenticated and can trigger the vulnerability remotely. The vulnerability can be exploited only if the site owner uses the woocommerce-appointments plugin and has paid for the pro features of the MStore API plugin.
