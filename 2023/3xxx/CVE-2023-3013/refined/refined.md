Based on the provided information, the content relates to a commit that fixes issue #2485 in the `gpac/gpac` repository. The commit introduces a fix in `src/filters/dasher.c`.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from a double free in `src/filters/dasher.c`. Specifically, when handling AVC (Advanced Video Coding) configurations, the code was reading and then potentially freeing an `avccfg` object twice. This can lead to a crash or potentially other memory corruption issues.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Double Free: The primary weakness is the double free of memory allocated for `GF_AVCConfig` via `gf_odf_avc_cfg_del(avccfg)`. The code appears to have two blocks that read and free `avccfg`, even though only one such object is created via `gf_odf_avc_cfg_read()`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The impact of this double free is a program crash due to memory corruption. In some scenarios, a double free can be leveraged for more serious exploits, but the provided code only indicates a crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when processing DASH streams.
- The attacker would need to supply a crafted DASH stream with a specific AVC configuration that would cause the double free within the dasher filter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have control over the input DASH stream.
- They need the ability to cause the application to process the specially crafted AVC configuration within the DASH stream.
- No specific capabilities are mentioned beyond this.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerability is located within the `dasher_configure_pid` function in `src/filters/dasher.c`, specifically within the `if` condition that handles AVC, SVC, and MVC codec IDs.

The code originally had this sequence:
1. Read the AVC config (`avccfg = gf_odf_avc_cfg_read(...)`).
2. Get a sequence parameter set (SPS) from `avccfg`.
3. Read SPS data and determine if the video is interlaced.
4. Free the AVC config (`gf_odf_avc_cfg_del(avccfg)`)
5. The block has repeated steps 2 & 3 again.
6. Free the AVC config a second time (`gf_odf_avc_cfg_del(avccfg)`)

The fix was to remove the duplicate code block, resolving the double free issue, as well as some code style improvements:
1. Read the AVC config (`avccfg = gf_odf_avc_cfg_read(...)`).
2. Get a sequence parameter set (SPS) from `avccfg`.
3. Read SPS data and determine if the video is interlaced.
4. Free the AVC config once (`gf_odf_avc_cfg_del(avccfg)`).
