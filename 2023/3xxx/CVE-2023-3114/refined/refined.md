- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper implementation of authorization rules for agent pools in Terraform Enterprise.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Authorization flaw that allowed any workspace within an organization to target an agent pool, even if it was not explicitly granted access.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A workspace could potentially access resources from a separate, higher-privileged workspace in the same organization that targeted an agent pool.
- **Attack vectors:** Workspaces within the same Terraform Enterprise organization could target agent pools they were not authorized to access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have a workspace within the affected Terraform Enterprise organization.
