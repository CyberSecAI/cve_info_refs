## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP-EMail < 2.69.1 - Admin+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

1. In the "Email Options" section of the plugin enter the payload `" style=animation-name:rotation onanimationstart=alert(/XSS/)//` for the "E-Mail Text Link For Post" and save.
2. Reload the page and see the XSS.
