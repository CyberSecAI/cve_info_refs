Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the identified SQL injection vulnerability:

*   **Vulnerability:** SQL Injection
*   **Affected Software:** IBOS OA v4.5.5
*   **Root Cause:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input (`uids` parameter) before using it in a SQL query. Specifically, the `fetchAllByUids()` method under the model constructs a SQL query using the unsanitized `uids` parameter.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   **Route:** `r=contact/default/export`
    *   **Parameter:** `uids`
    *   The attacker crafts a malicious payload within the `uids` parameter.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query. This could potentially allow the attacker to:
    *   Retrieve sensitive data.
    *   Modify or delete data.
    *   Potentially gain unauthorized access or control of the system.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable endpoint with a crafted `uids` parameter. The provided information implies this can be done remotely.
*   **Technical Details**
    *   The vulnerability is located in the `contact/default/export` route.
    *   The `actionExport()` method is called first, then the `export()` method in the `BaseController`.
    *   The `getUserData()` method is called within `export()`, which retrieves the `uids` parameter and uses it in SQL query construction.
    *   The `fetchAllByUids()` method under the model executes the SQL query.
    *   The attacker can inject SQL into the `uids` parameter and cause a time delay to confirm the SQL injection.
