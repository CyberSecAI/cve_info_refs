Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-3050

**Vulnerability:** Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking in a Security Decision

**Affected Product:** TMT Lockcell

**Root Cause:** The application relies on the value of an "admin" cookie to determine user privileges without properly validating or verifying the integrity of the cookie.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Lack of Cookie Validation:** The application doesn't check if the "admin" cookie is a valid value or if it has been tampered with.
*   **Lack of Integrity Checks:** The system does not verify the authenticity or integrity of the cookie. This allows an attacker to modify it without detection.
*   **Insecure Use of Cookies for Authentication:** Using cookie values directly for authentication purposes without proper validation is inherently insecure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Privilege Abuse:** By manually setting the "admin" cookie value to a specific value (e.g., 20), an attacker can gain administrative privileges without providing valid credentials.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** The vulnerability allows bypassing the normal login process completely, leading to unauthorized access.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks:** An attacker intercepting network traffic could potentially modify the cookie before it reaches the client or server.
*   **Direct Manipulation:** An attacker can manually modify the cookie value using browser developer tools or other web request manipulation tools.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs the ability to intercept or manipulate HTTP requests/responses to modify the cookie.
*   **Basic Web Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know how to view, edit, and inject HTTP headers, specifically cookies.
*   **No Prior Credentials Required:** The attacker doesn't need any existing username or password to exploit the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerability is triggered by setting the "admin" cookie to a value like "20".
*   The vulnerable application is built using ASP.NET.
*   The response shows that once the cookie is set, the application redirects the user to the home page `/`.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The content provides a detailed HTTP response example, demonstrating how the cookie is set and the resulting redirection.
*   The vulnerability allows an attacker to log in to the system without entering any credentials.
