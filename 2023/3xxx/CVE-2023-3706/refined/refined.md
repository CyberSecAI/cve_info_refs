Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The ActivityPub for WordPress plugin fails to properly check if a post title is intended to be public and associated with the plugin. This allows unauthorized access to post titles.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The vulnerability is an IDOR issue, where a user can directly manipulate a parameter (`post_ID`) to access resources they shouldn't.
    *   **Broken Access Control:** The plugin does not enforce proper access controls, allowing a user with minimal privileges (Subscriber+) to access titles of posts that are not meant to be public (e.g., draft or private posts).
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** A subscriber-level attacker can retrieve the titles of arbitrary posts, including private or draft posts, leading to information disclosure.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is through a crafted `POST` request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php`.
    *   The attacker manipulates the `post_ID` parameter within the request body.
    *   The attacker utilizes the `parse-media-shortcode` action with the `ap_title` shortcode
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least subscriber-level privileges on the WordPress site.
