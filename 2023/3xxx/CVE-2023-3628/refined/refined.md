  "CVE-2023-3628": {
    "description": "A flaw was found in Infinispan's REST. Bulk read endpoints do not properly evaluate user permissions for the operation. This issue could allow an authenticated user to access information outside of their intended permissions.",
    "root_cause": "The REST bulk read endpoints `/rest/v2/caches/{cacheName}?action=keys` and `/rest/v2/caches/{cacheName}?action=entries` use the cluster publisher, which is an internal component that doesn't check if the subject has bulk read permissions.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient permission checks on REST bulk read endpoints."
    ],
    "impact": "An authenticated user can access information outside of their intended permissions.",
     "attack_vector": "An authenticated user can send requests to the vulnerable REST endpoints.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Infinispan REST API."
