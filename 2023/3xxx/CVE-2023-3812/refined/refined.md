  "CVE-2023-3812": {
    "Description": "A flaw in the Linux Kernel found. If napi frags enabled and patch 363a5328f4b0 (\"net: tun: fix bugs for oversize packet when napi frags enabled\") not applied, then when local user try to send too large IPV6 packet (with big packet length), it can lead to out of bounds memory bug.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability occurs due to the absence of a length check in the `tun_napi_alloc_frags` function. When NAPI frags are enabled, a local user can send an oversized IPv6 packet which leads to an out-of-bounds memory access. Specifically, skb->network_header and skb->transport_header offsets could be bigger than U16_MAX which results in an integer overflow affecting the value of __skb_push(skb, value) which could lead to skb->data less than skb->head.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds memory access due to lack of proper input validation.",
      "Integer overflow during offset calculations within network packets."
    ],
    "Impact": "A local user can cause a crash or potentially escalate privileges on the system by sending an oversized network packet.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local user sending a crafted IPv6 packet to the TUN/TAP device.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local user access on the system.",
    "Additional Details": [
     "The issue was triggered by oversized packets when napi frags are enabled.",
     "The first segment size of iov_iter from user space was very big, bypassing a threshold check in __alloc_pages().",
     "Odd IPv6 packets without NEXTHDR_NONE extension headers and large packet lengths can cause skb->network_header and skb->transport_header offsets to overflow."
