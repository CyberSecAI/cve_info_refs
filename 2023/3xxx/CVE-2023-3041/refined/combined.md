## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Autochat <= 1.1.9 - Unauthenticated Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape user input before outputting it back on the page, leading to a cross-site Scripting attack.

### Proof of Concept

In the chatbot input you can enter: `#"><img src=/ onerror=alert("XSS")>` at any point to trigger an XSS.

### Affects Plugins
