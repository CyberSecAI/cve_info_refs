- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape user input before outputting it back on the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the chat input that will be executed in the browsers of users who view the affected page. This could lead to a variety of malicious actions, such as redirecting users to malicious websites, stealing cookies, or defacing the website.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker injects malicious code through the chatbot input field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker does not need to be authenticated and can trigger the XSS by simply entering the malicious payload into the chatbot input field.
