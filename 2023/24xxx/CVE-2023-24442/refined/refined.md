{
  "CVE-2023-24442": {
    "Description": "GitHub Pull Request Coverage Status Plugin 2.2.0 and earlier stores the GitHub Personal Access Token, Sonar access token and Sonar password unencrypted in its global configuration file `com.github.terma.jenkins.githubprcoveragestatus.Configuration.xml` on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration. These credentials can be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.",
    "Root cause": "The plugin stores sensitive credentials (GitHub Personal Access Token, Sonar access token, and Sonar password) in plain text in the global configuration file on the Jenkins controller.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Credentials stored in plain text"
    ],
    "Impact": "Exposure of sensitive credentials, potentially leading to unauthorized access to GitHub and Sonar resources.",
    "Attack vectors": "Access to the Jenkins controller file system.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Access to the Jenkins controller's file system, which could be achieved through various means such as direct access, exploitation of other vulnerabilities, or by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system."
