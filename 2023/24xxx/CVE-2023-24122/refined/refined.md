Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-24122:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability. This occurs because the `ssid_5g` parameter, which is controlled by the user, is copied into a fixed-size stack buffer (`wifi_buf_entry`) without proper bounds checking.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stack Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a classic stack buffer overflow, which can be triggered due to lack of input length validation.
*   **Unchecked Input:** User-provided input via the `ssid_5g` parameter is not validated or sanitized for length before being copied into a stack buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The provided information indicates that triggering the overflow causes a denial of service.  The vulnerable device will likely crash and become unresponsive. It is possible that it can be used for other things but the provided info does not go into that.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is performed using HTTP POST requests.
*   **Specific URLs:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a large `ssid_5g` parameter to `/goform/WifiBasicSet` followed by a request to `/goform/WifiBasicGet`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device. This typically requires network connectivity.
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to authenticate to the device. The provided PoC script shows how to login using the default credentials.
*   **Default Credentials:** The PoC exploits the use of default credentials for the router to gain access, "username:admin" and "password:81dc9bdb52d04dc20036dbd8313ed055".

**Additional Details**

* The vulnerable software is Jensen of Scandinavia Eagle 1200AC V15.03.06.33\_en.
* The overflow happens when the /goform/WifiBasicGet handler tries to retrieve the data that was set in /goform/WifiBasicSet, thus the overflow is indirectly triggered by user input.
* The specific vulnerable location is within the function that handles `/goform/WifiBasicGet` where the `wifi_buf_entry` stack buffer is used.
