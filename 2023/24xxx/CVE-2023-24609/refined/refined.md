Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-24609:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is located in the matrixssl library, specifically in the parsing of pre-shared keys during a TLSv1.3 server handshake. It is triggered by a specific input during the handshake process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core weakness is a parsing vulnerability within the matrixssl library's implementation of the TLSv1.3 protocol. The specific vulnerability is in handling pre-shared keys during the server handshake. This can lead to a denial-of-service condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability results in a critical remote denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The server becomes unresponsive or unavailable, disrupting services relying on it.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is remote, exploiting the server-side implementation of TLSv1.3 when handling pre-shared keys in the handshake process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be able to initiate a TLSv1.3 handshake with a vulnerable server and send a malformed pre-shared key. This implies the attacker can establish a network connection to the target server. No further special capabilities are specified.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was discovered using modern fuzzing methods by security evaluators of Telekom Security.
- The vulnerability affects matrixssl library versions 4.6.0 to 4.0.0.
