## Secure Software Toolkits and Libraries

Rambus secure software toolkits and libraries feature a complete range of capabilities that secure communications, as well as offer cryptographic services that are FIPS-certified or protected against side channel attacks. The Security Protocol Toolkits provide high interoperability and portability for use in security gateways, cloud deployments, smartphones and IoT devices. They include full featured implementations of key exchange protocols, as well as the datapath with all required cipher libraries.

[Report Vulnerability](/security/response-center/report-vulnerability/)

| Solution | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Quantum Safe IPsec Toolkit](/security/software-protocols/quantum-safe-ipsec-toolkit/) | Quantum Safe complete IPsec implementation. Fast, scalable and fully compliant IPsec implementation. Used in cloud and virtual deployments, high traffic gateways, and embedded devices. |
| [Classic IPsec Toolkit](/security/software-protocols/ipsec-toolkit/) | A scalable and fully compliant IPsec implementation. Used in cloud and virtual deployments, high traffic VPN gateways, and embedded devices. |
| [FIPS Cryptographic Libraries](https://www.rambus.com/security/software-protocols/fips-crypto-library/) | FIPS 140-2 and FIPS 140-3 validated cryptographic libraries offering up-to-date implementations of all algorithms needed by IPsec or TLS. |

| [Quantum Safe Library](/security/software-protocols/quantum-safe-crypto-library/) | Quantum Safe Cryptographic library offering future-proof cryptography by providing new quantum resistant algorithms and classic algorithms in a single package. |

## IoT Security Framework

The Rambus IoT Security Framework is a series of embedded software toolkits that protect cost-sensitive devices which possess limited abilities to protect the internal SoC with a rich set of security protocols that include [TLS](https://www.rambus.com/security/software-protocols/tls-toolkit/) and [IPsec](https://www.rambus.com/security/software-protocols/ipsec-toolkit/). Designed for Internet of Things (IoT) devices and cloud-based applications, the IoT Security Framework offers a common API that provides the required cryptographic and certificate tools. Depending on unique applications needs, designers can choose either FIPS 140-2 or FIPS 140-3 level 1 certified or [DPA](https://www.rambus.com/security/dpa-countermeasures/)-protected crypto libraries. The FIPS TLS toolkit, in combination with a pre-integrated FIPS library, provides a FIPS-compliant software package that allows system designers to securely access any common cloud service for their device.

| Solution | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Secure Boot](https://www.rambus.com/security/software-protocols/secure-boot/) | Provides tools for integrating security into an embedded device’s system boot sequence. Uses strong cryptography to protect the boot process of SoCs and application processors. |
| [SHSlib](/security/software-protocols/stateful-hash-based-signature-library/) | Stateful hash-based signatures library providing a bare-metal implementation for LMS and XMSS schemes. |

### Secure Networking Basics: MACsec, IPsec, and SSL/TLS/DTLS

![Secure Networking Basics cover](https://www.rambus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Secure-Networking-Basics-white-paper-tn-229x300.png)

The MACsec, IPsec and SSL/TLS/DTLS protocols are the primary means of securing data in motion (communicated between connected devices). These protocols can be anchored in hardware or implemented in software as part of an end-to-end security architecture. This white paper provides fundamental information on each of these protocols including their interrelationships and use cases.

Variant of Satori/Mirai detected attacking public available ADB shells

10 July 2018

On the 10th of July at 23:30 UTC we noticed an increased traffic on our blackhole monitoring on TCP port 5555. Upon further analyzation, we saw a big chunk of this traffic coming from China, USA and the Dominican Republic. In total we gathered 246.434 packets from 68.361 unique IPs. Based on the packet details we gathered, we can assume that the packets were generated by a lot of different devices. In addition, the traffic behavior on port 555 matches the typicall scan behavior of botnets.

By misuse of several processor bugs it is possible to break up the separation between the kernel and user space.

## Deutsche Telekom CERT Assessment

On Intel CPU driven platforms, it is possible for normal user programs to gather information about protected kernel memory areas (“Meltdown attack”, CVE-2017-5754) [1] [2].  This results in an information leakage between kernel and user space.

This vulnerability affects every Intel CPU produced in the past decade (CPUs since 1995 except Itanium and pre-2013 Atoms). The in [3] listed ARM cores are also affected by this vulnerability.

A further issue is described in the “Spectre attack” (CVE-2017-5753 and CVE-2017-5715). Spectre allows a user-mode application to extract information from other processes or VMs to access memory of other VMs. This vulnerability affects all listed Intel CPUs, as well as AMD’s Ryzen, FX and Pro families and several ARM Cortex cores listed in [3].

Official disclosure for Spectre and Meltdown took place on 2018-01-04 [10].

To exploit both vulnerabilities an attacker needs to be able to execute code on the target machine.

Thus, up to now network components like routers, switches, firewalls, mobiles or CPEs don’t provide enough attack surface for exploitation even if they are affected. On most network components it is very difficult to run attacker crafted code because they’ve never been designed to run custom code.

## Recommendations

* Apply patches as soon as they are available from the respective supplier
  (for Microsoft desktop systems check availability with AV vendors [13])
* Top priority should be patching of (see timeline below)
  o   hypervisors of cloud systems
  o   operating systems of desktop clients and virtual/remote desktop systems
  o   operating systems of hosting platforms
* On XEN hypervisors:
  o   Enable “supervisor mode execute protection” if possible
  o   Evaluate if XEN VMs can be run in HVM or PVM mode (only PV hosting hypervisors are affected)
* For network components
  o   Even if an attack is unlikely ask your vendor if your device is vulnerable and needs patching

**Patch Prioritization**

In general high priority patching is advised for every machine which runs untrusted code from third parties. On shared and exclusive private clouds there is less risk because these platforms are dedicated to trusted customers. On all other servers it is unlikely that an attacker is able to run arbitrary code. Patch your system based on local patch cycles.

Due to the complexity of the attack it is unlikely that smartphones get exploited.

**Patch Availability**

* Microsoft Windows 7 SP1, 8.1, 10 [5]
  o   McAfee is now patch compatible [12]
  o   Further AV vendors can be found in [13]
  o   A registry key has to be set. Without the key the client doesn’t fetch the update. See [5].
* Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2, Server 2012 R2, Server 2016, Server Version 1709 Attention: The mitigation has to be enabled via registry [6]
* Mac OS X 10.13.1 (10.13.2 isn’t vulnerable)
* Several Suse Linux and RHEL distributions [7] [8]
* VMware ESXi 5.5 to 6.5, Workstation 12.X and 14.X, Fusion 8.X [9]
* Android (patchlevel 2018-01-05)
* iOS (patchlevel 11.2)

Linux Kernel patches will be most probably available on 2018-01-09.

IBM AIX patches will be most probably available on 2018-01-12 [11].

There is no announcement for a SOLARIS patch, we are in touch with Oracle.
