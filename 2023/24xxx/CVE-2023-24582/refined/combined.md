# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2023-1710

## Milesight UR32L urvpn\_client cmd\_name\_action OS command injection vulnerabilities

##### July 6, 2023

##### CVE Number

CVE-2023-24583,CVE-2023-24582

##### SUMMARY

Two OS command injection vulnerabilities exist in the urvpn\_client cmd\_name\_action functionality of Milesight UR32L v32.3.0.5. A specially crafted network request can lead to arbitrary command execution. An attacker can send a network request to trigger these vulnerabilities.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

Milesight UR32L v32.3.0.5

##### PRODUCT URLS

UR32L - <https://www.milesight-iot.com/cellular/router/ur32l/>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

8.8 - CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

##### CWE

CWE-77 - Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command (‘Command Injection’)

##### DETAILS

The Milesight UR32L is an industrial radio router. The router features include support for multiple VPNs, a router console shell, firewall and many others.

The router offers a service called Milesight VPN, which will connect to the Milesight VPN software. The binary client used for this service is `urvpn_client`. This binary will connect to the specified Milesight VPN server but will also listen for network request to allow the sender to change VPN settings. The function that will, eventually, parse the received data and modify the VPN settings is the `urvpn_client`’s`execute_urvpn_command` function:

```
undefined4 execute_urvpn_command(byte *data_buff)

{
  [... variable declaration ...]

  json = utils_parse_string2json_object(data_buff);
  [... variable initialization ...]
  if (json == 0) {
    uVar2 = 0xffffffff;
  }
  else {
    json_get_value_by_key(json,"type",type_value,0x40);
    is_equal = strcmp(type_value,"cmd_reconnect");
    if (is_equal == 0) {
      sleep(5);
      cmd_reconnect_action();
    }
    else {
      is_equal = strcmp(type_value,"cmd_subnet");
      if (is_equal == 0) {
        [...]
      }
      else {
        is_equal = strcmp(type_value,"cmd_name");
        if (is_equal == 0) {
          json_get_value_by_key(json,"name",cmd_name,0x40);                                             [1]
          cmd_name_action(cmd_name);
        }
      }
    }
   [...]
  }
  [...]
}

```

This function parses a JSON. Based on the value of the string corresponding to the key `type`, the function will execute a specific command. If the type value is equal to `cmd_name`, the code at `[1]` will be reached and the `cmd_name_action` function will be called with, as argument, the string value corresponding to the key `name` in the JSON.

Following the `cmd_name_action` function:

```
undefined4 cmd_name_action(char* cmd_name)

{
  [...]
  snprintf((char *)&formatted_string,0x200,
           "ubus call yruo_urvpn set \'{\"base\":\"urvpn_manage\", \"value\":{\"action\":2,\"device_ name\":\"%s\"}}\'"
           ,cmd_name);
  [...]
  system((char *)&formatted_string);                                                                    [2]
  return 0;
}

```

This function uses the provided `name` string value to compose a shell command that will be execute, at `[2]`, through the `system` function. This can lead to an OS command injection vulnerability.

There are two code paths to reach this vulnerable function, which are described as follows.

#### CVE-2023-24582 - TCP handler

It is possible to reach the `execute_urvpn_command` function through a TCP connection. The function that will manage this connection is `tcp_execute_urvpn_command_wrap`:

```
void tcp_execute_urvpn_command_wrap(undefined4 bufev,undefined4 param_2)

{
  [... variable declaration ...]

  local_20 = param_2;
  local_1c = bufev;
  start_evbuff_ptr = bufferevent_get_input(bufev);
  input_line = (byte *)0x0;
  evbuffer_search_eol(ev_buffer,start_evbuff_ptr,0,&local_14,0);
  if (local_14 == 0) {
    [...]
  }
  else {
    input_line = (byte *)evbuffer_readln(start_evbuff_ptr,0,0);
    if (input_line != (byte *)0x0) {
      log_stuff("comtcpip.c",0x4d,"_comtcpip_readcb",2,"reveive TCP :%s",input_line);
      execute_urvpn_command(input_line);
      [...]
    }
  }
  [...]
} The function will receive the JSON data and eventually call the `execute_urvpn_command` with, as argument, the JSON received. No checks are performed on the received data that will eventually reach the `cmd_name_action`.

```
#### CVE-2023-24583 - UDP handler

It is possible to reach the `execute_urvpn_command` function through a UDP connection. The function that will manage this connection is `tcp_execute_urvpn_command_wrap`:

```
undefined4 udp_execute_urvpn_command_wrap(int socket)

{
  [... variable declaration ...]

  recv_buff._0_4_ = 0;
  memset(recv_buff + 4,0,0x3fc);
  local_410 = 0x10;
  memset(recv_buff,0,0x400);
  sVar1 = recvfrom(socket,recv_buff,0x400,0,&sStack_420,&local_410);
  if (sVar1 == -1) {
    [...]
  }
  else if (sVar1 == 0) {
    [...]
  }
  else {
    log_stuff("comudp.c",0x29,"udp_read_cb",1,"Udp Read :[%s]",recv_buff);
    uVar4 = execute_urvpn_command((byte *)recv_buff);
  }
  [...]
} The function will receive the JSON data and eventually call the `execute_urvpn_command` with, as argument, the JSON received. No checks are performed on the received data that will eventually reach the `cmd_name_action`.

```
