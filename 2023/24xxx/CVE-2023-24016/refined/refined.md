- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Uncontrolled search path element in Intel Quartus Prime Pro and Standard edition software for Linux.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The software does not properly control the search path, potentially allowing an attacker to inject malicious code.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An authenticated local user can escalate their privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access, leveraging the uncontrolled search path to execute malicious code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An authenticated user with local access to the system where the vulnerable software is installed. The attacker must also be able to influence the search path.
