- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to an out-of-bounds write past the end of an allocated buffer when parsing specially crafted SPP files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write (CWE-787)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process. This could lead to complete system compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves a user opening a specially crafted SPP file using the vulnerable application (Tecnomatix Plant Simulation).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick the user into opening a malicious file. No special privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability, but user interaction (opening the malicious file) is necessary.
