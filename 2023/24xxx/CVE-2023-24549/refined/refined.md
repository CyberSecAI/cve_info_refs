- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by a stack-based buffer overflow while parsing specially crafted PAR files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could leverage the vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be triggered when the application reads a specially crafted PAR file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious PAR file with the affected application.
