Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-24124:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow.
- It occurs due to the lack of proper length validation when handling the `wrlEn` parameter within the `/goform/WifiBasicSet` and `/goform/WifiBasicGet` actions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stack Buffer Overflow:** The `wrlEn` string, controlled by the user, is copied into a stack buffer (`wifi_buf_entry`) without checking its length. This allows an attacker to write beyond the bounds of the buffer.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The code does not validate the length of the user-provided `wrlEn` parameter before copying it to the stack buffer.
- **Unsafe String Handling:** The application uses potentially unsafe string handling practices.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The immediate impact of exploiting this vulnerability is a DoS, as demonstrated in the provided PoC, where the overflow can cause the device to crash.
- **Potential for Remote Code Execution (RCE):** While not explicitly stated, a stack buffer overflow can often be leveraged for RCE if an attacker can carefully control the overflowed data to overwrite critical memory locations (e.g., return addresses), allowing arbitrary code execution on the device. This would require more advanced exploitation techniques beyond the PoC provided.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends HTTP POST requests to the `/goform/WifiBasicSet` endpoint.
- **`wrlEn` Parameter:** The vulnerable parameter is `wrlEn`, which is sent as part of the POST request's data.
- **Subsequent Request:** The vulnerability is triggered when `/goform/WifiBasicGet` is called and tries to copy the overly long wrlEn string into the stack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the device, specifically to the web interface accessible at `http://192.168.38.1` or a similar IP.
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated as an administrator to access the vulnerable endpoints. The provided PoC shows the attacker logs in with username `admin` and a known password hash.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoints and Parameter:** The attacker needs to know the correct endpoint `/goform/WifiBasicSet`, the vulnerable parameter `wrlEn`, and the subsequent GET request to trigger the overflow.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the Jensen Eagle 1200AC router due to missing input validation on the `wrlEn` parameter. This allows a remote attacker, with admin access to the router's web interface, to trigger a denial-of-service. This vulnerability potentially allows for more severe impact such as RCE if the attacker were able to carefully craft an exploit.
