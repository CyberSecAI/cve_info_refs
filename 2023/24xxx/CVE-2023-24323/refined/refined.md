Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE-2023-24323: XML External Entity (XXE) injection**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: The application processes XML data in a way that allows the inclusion of external entities, without proper sanitization or validation. This allows the attacker to control the XML input and include external files.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**: XML External Entity (XXE) injection.

*  **Impact of Exploitation**: An attacker can potentially read arbitrary files from the server's file system, potentially including sensitive configuration files, source code, or other confidential data. The attacker may also be able to cause a denial of service by making the system try to process large files or by making it access resources that are not available.

*   **Attack Vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by the processing of maliciously crafted XML input.
    
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**:
    *   The attacker must be an authenticated user with specific roles or permissions. Specifically, the user must have either the "Content Administrators" or "Administrators" role, or the "Edit Content and Style Templates" permission.
    *   The attack is remote and does not require physical access to the server.
*   **Affected Product**: Mojoportal v2.7
