# Mass Reporting The Dangerous PC Exploit

# As [we've learned](https://www.reddit.com/r/gtaonline/comments/10h7tfd/warning_for_all_pc_players/) it is not safe to play the game on PC right now due to a very dangerous exploit that has just come to light. Neither invite only or possibly Story Mode are safe.

[![r/gtaonline - First Report](https://preview.redd.it/mass-reporting-the-dangerous-pc-exploit-v0-q2qcudlsseda1.jpg?width=751&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=692b3092853c5b8c2dfc0f5d9b7e8ffc9f942bce)](https://preview.redd.it/mass-reporting-the-dangerous-pc-exploit-v0-q2qcudlsseda1.jpg?width=751&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=692b3092853c5b8c2dfc0f5d9b7e8ffc9f942bce "Image from r/gtaonline - First Report")

First Report

[![r/gtaonline - Update](https://preview.redd.it/mass-reporting-the-dangerous-pc-exploit-v0-3sopcdiuseda1.jpg?width=751&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5681eab923f15dbe92e418e98d8578f19b560fe7)](https://preview.redd.it/mass-reporting-the-dangerous-pc-exploit-v0-3sopcdiuseda1.jpg?width=751&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5681eab923f15dbe92e418e98d8578f19b560fe7 "Image from r/gtaonline - Update")

Update

# In the mean time, we need to mass-report this to Rockstar so they can't ignore it.

# Keep it civil or you'll get banned (ironically) from their support system.

# Go here - <https://support.rockstargames.com/community/200063373> - and make a post. This is the official Rockstar Support forum. Generally useless to get any actual help, but if it's flooded with reports of this it will be escalated to actual devs. Make sure to upvote everyone else's posts on there about this issue as well.

# Also, we need to mass-report this to their Bug reporting system here - <https://support.rockstargames.com/categories/200013306?step=dec658d0>

# In addition we need to flood their Social Media with reports as well:

# Rockstar Games Twitter - <https://twitter.com/RockstarGames>

# Rockstar Support Twitter - <https://twitter.com/RockstarSupport>

# Instagram - <https://www.instagram.com/rockstargames/?hl=en>

# Nothing will get done until Rockstar can no longer ignore this issue.

Thanks to [u/A-Jayy](https://www.reddit.com/user/A-Jayy/) for bringing this to our attention.
