{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The TYPO3 core component `GeneralUtility::getIndpEnv()` uses the unfiltered server environment variable `PATH_INFO`, which allows attackers to inject malicious content.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79)"
    ],
    "impact": "Attackers can inject malicious HTML code into pages that have not yet been rendered and cached. Injected values would be cached and delivered to other website visitors (persisted cross-site scripting).",
     "attack_vectors": "By injecting malicious content through the unfiltered `PATH_INFO` server variable.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker does not need any privileges, but user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability is triggered in combination with the TypoScript setting `config.absRefPrefix=auto`. Additionally, individual code relying on the resolved value of `GeneralUtility::getIndpEnv('SCRIPT_NAME')` and corresponding usages are vulnerable. Affected `GeneralUtility::getIndpEnv()` calls include: 'PATH_INFO', 'SCRIPT_NAME', 'TYPO3_REQUEST_DIR', 'TYPO3_REQUEST_SCRIPT', 'TYPO3_SITE_PATH', 'TYPO3_SITE_SCRIPT', and 'TYPO3_SITE_URL'. Installations of TYPO3 versions 8.7 and 9.x are probably only affected when server environment variable `TYPO3_PATH_ROOT` is defined (typically via Composer installations). Apache and Microsoft IIS web servers using PHP-CGI (FPM, FCGI/FastCGI, or similar) are affected. There might be a risk that nginx is also vulnerable. Apache/mod_php scenarios were not exploitable."
