Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2023-24752:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A NULL pointer dereference exists in the `ff_hevc_put_hevc_epel_pixels_8_sse` function within the `sse-motion.cc` file of the libde265 library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The core vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference. This occurs when the code attempts to access memory through a pointer that is not pointing to a valid memory location, in this case, a null pointer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial of service. The NULL pointer dereference causes the program to crash, disrupting the service provided by the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted Input File:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted input file. This file would likely be an HEVC encoded video or stream that leads to the vulnerable code path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide the crafted input file to the libde265 library. This could involve tricking a user into opening a malicious video file or providing the file as part of a service.
- No special privileges are required.
- User interaction (opening the crafted file) is required.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability occurs specifically within the `ff_hevc_put_hevc_epel_pixels_8_sse` function at line 987 of `sse-motion.cc`.
- The crash happens during a memory read operation when the `_mm_loadl_epi64` function attempts to dereference a NULL pointer.
- The vulnerability exists in libde265 version 1.0.10. It was fixed in version 1.0.11-0+deb10u4
- The vulnerability can be triggered using a specific "poc_segv02.bin" file.

In summary, this is a classic NULL pointer dereference vulnerability that an attacker can exploit by providing a malicious HEVC input file, resulting in the application crashing and a denial of service.
