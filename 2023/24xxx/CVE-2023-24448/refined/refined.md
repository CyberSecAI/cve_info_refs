The provided document contains multiple CVEs, and CVE-2023-24448 is one of them.

**CVE-2023-24448**

*   **Root Cause:** The RabbitMQ Consumer Plugin does not perform a permission check in a method implementing form validation and does not require POST requests.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   Missing permission check: The plugin lacks proper validation for user permissions when accessing the form validation method.
    *   CSRF vulnerability: The absence of POST request requirements allows for cross-site request forgery attacks.
*   **Impact:** An attacker with Overall/Read permission can connect to an attacker-specified AMQP server using attacker-specified username and password.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attacker can exploit the form validation method through a CSRF attack by tricking a user into submitting a crafted request.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   The attacker needs Overall/Read permission on the Jenkins instance.
    *   The attacker must be able to craft a malicious request and trick a user into executing it.
*   **Affected Plugin:** RabbitMQ Consumer Plugin
*   **Affected Versions:** 2.8 and earlier
*   **Fixed Version:** No fix is available as of the publication of this advisory.
