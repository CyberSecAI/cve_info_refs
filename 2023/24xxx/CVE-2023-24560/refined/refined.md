- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds write when parsing specially crafted PAR files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves tricking a user into opening a malicious PAR file using Solid Edge.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to create a specially crafted PAR file and induce the user to open it using the vulnerable Solid Edge application.
