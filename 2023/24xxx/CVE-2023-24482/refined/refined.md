- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The cache validation service in COMOS is vulnerable to a Structured Exception Handler (SEH) based buffer overflow. Specifically, a buffer copy occurs without proper size checking of the input, which leads to the overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Classic Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) due to missing input size validation. The vulnerability is triggered in the cache validation service and is related to the Structured Exception Handler (SEH).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system or cause a denial of service condition.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is remotely exploitable via network access (AV:N), and does not require user interaction (UI:N) or any privileges (PR:N).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs network access to the vulnerable service, and does not need any special privileges.
