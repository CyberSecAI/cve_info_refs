The provided content is a security advisory from Arista Networks regarding CVE-2023-24545 and CVE-2023-24513, both affecting the CloudEOS product.

**CVE-2023-24545:**

*   **Root cause:** An issue in the Software Forwarding Engine (Sfe) of Arista CloudEOS allows a potential denial-of-service (DoS) attack.
*   **Weakness:** Uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400) due to a leak of packet buffers when malformed packets are sent to the switch.
*   **Impact:** If enough malformed packets are received, the switch may stop forwarding traffic due to the exhaustion of packet buffers.
*   **Attack vector:** Sending malformed packets to the affected switch.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No specific capabilities or positions are mentioned beyond the ability to send malformed packets.

**CVE-2023-24513:**

*   **Root cause:** A size check bypass issue in the Software Forwarding Engine (Sfe) of Arista CloudEOS.
*  **Weakness:** Buffer over-read (CWE-126) which can occur after the size check bypass in later code execution.
*   **Impact:** May lead to buffer over-reads and potentially trigger a recomputation of the TCP checksum which could be leveraged in DDoS attacks.
*   **Attack vector:** Exploiting the size check bypass using crafted network packets.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No specific capabilities or positions are mentioned beyond the ability to send crafted network packets

**Affected Products:**

*   All CloudEOS software forwarding instances, including hypervisor deployments, DCA-200-VEOS appliances, and cloud marketplace versions on AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and Equinix Network Edge.

**Unaffected Products:**

*   Arista EOS-based hardware products and various other Arista products and platforms as detailed in the advisory.

**Required Configuration for Exploitation:**

*   The switch must be configured to run the Software Forwarding Engine (Sfe), which is the default configuration for CloudEOS platforms.

**Indicators of Compromise:**

*   **CVE-2023-24545:**
    *   Sfe agent logs showing warnings about low packet buffer levels (less than 25% free).
    *   High values in the `ForUsClassifyIpv4-frag_recv_pkts` counter indicating fragmented packets are being received.
*   **CVE-2023-24513:** No indicators of compromise are listed.

**Mitigation:**

*   No mitigation or workaround is available, only upgrading the software or applying a hotfix is recommended.

**Resolution:**

*   Upgrade to a fixed software version or apply the appropriate hotfix. Specific fixed versions are provided for each affected train (4.29.x, 4.28.x, 4.27.x, and 4.26.x).
*   Hotfixes are available as SWIX files for different release trains.

**Additional Information:**

*   The advisory also contains contact information for the Arista Networks Technical Assistance Center (TAC) for further assistance.
