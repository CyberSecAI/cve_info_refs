On affected platforms running Arista CloudEOS an issue in the Software Forwarding Engine (Sfe) can lead to a potential denial of service attack by sending malformed packets to the switch. This causes a leak of packet buffers and if enough malformed packets are received, the switch may eventually stop forwarding traffic.
