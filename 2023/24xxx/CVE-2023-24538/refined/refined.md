  "response": {
    "related": true,
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The `html/template` package in Go does not properly treat backticks (`) as JavaScript string delimiters, and therefore does not escape them as expected when a template contains a Go template action within a Javascript template literal.",
      "weaknesses": "Improper handling of backticks as JavaScript string delimiters in templates.",
      "impact": "An attacker could inject arbitrary Javascript code into the Go template by using the contents of a Go template action within a Javascript template literal to terminate the literal. This can lead to execution of arbitrary JavaScript, potentially compromising the security of web pages generated using the vulnerable templates. Also, denial of service through the 'Template.Parse' function which now returns an error on encountering the specified type of backtick usage.",
      "attack_vectors": "Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by crafting malicious input that contains JavaScript template literals with embedded Go template actions.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker does not need any special capabilities or privileges. The vulnerability can be exploited via network requests, as long as they have control of the template content.",
      "additional_information": "The fix involves disallowing Go template actions within JavaScript template literals. Users can re-enable the old behavior with the `GODEBUG=jstmpllitinterp=1` flag, but this will escape backticks, potentially breaking existing code and should be used with caution. The fix was implemented in Go versions 1.20.3 and 1.19.8. The vulnerable code is in the `html/template` package's `Template.Parse` function.\n\nThis vulnerability is also identified as  GHSA-v4m2-x4rp-hv22."
