{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to the use of the unsafe `strcpy` function in `NetlinkWeb::Information::SetDeviceIdentification` when handling the `location` and `name` parameters.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow (CWE-121)",
      "Use of unsafe function `strcpy` without proper bounds checking"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker with access to the web interface can cause a Denial of Service (DoS) by sending a string larger than the buffer size for the 'location' or 'name' parameter, causing the `httpserv` application to crash. It is also possible to potentially achieve arbitrary code execution by overflowing the buffer and overwriting the processor's pc register, leveraging ROP chains.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a maliciously crafted HTTP request with an oversized 'location' or 'name' parameter to the web interface of the device."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs access to the web interface of the device. No special configuration is required to reproduce the issue."
