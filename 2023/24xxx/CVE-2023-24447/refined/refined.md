The provided document is a Jenkins Security Advisory that details multiple vulnerabilities across different Jenkins plugins. Here's the breakdown of the information related to **CVE-2023-24447**:

**CVE-2023-24447**

*   **Vulnerability:** CSRF vulnerability and missing permission check in RabbitMQ Consumer Plugin
*   **Affected Plugin:** `rabbitmq-consumer`
*   **Affected Versions:** 2.8 and earlier
*   **Root Cause:** The plugin does not perform a permission check in a method implementing form validation, and this method does not require POST requests.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Missing Permission Check:** The plugin lacks proper authorization checks, allowing unauthorized users to perform actions they shouldn't.
    *   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The form validation method does not require POST requests.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker with Overall/Read permission can connect to an attacker-specified AMQP server using attacker-specified username and password.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Network:** The attack is performed through HTTP requests.
    *   **CSRF:** The vulnerability can be exploited through CSRF attacks by tricking a user with Overall/Read permission into making the malicious request.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Attacker needs to have Overall/Read permission in Jenkins.
    *   Attacker needs to trick a user with Overall/Read permission to trigger the CSRF request (for CSRF part).
    *   Attacker can control an AMQP server and specify credentials.

**Summary**

The RabbitMQ Consumer Plugin is vulnerable to CSRF and missing permission check. An attacker with Overall/Read permission can make Jenkins connect to a malicious AMQP server with attacker-controlled credentials by exploiting the lack of CSRF protection and proper permission checks in the form validation method, potentially intercepting or modifying data meant for the legitimate server.

**Note:** This vulnerability is not fixed as of the publication of the advisory.
