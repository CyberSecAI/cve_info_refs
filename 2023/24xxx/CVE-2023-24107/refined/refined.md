The provided content describes a supply chain vulnerability within the `hour_of_code_python_2015` GitHub repository, specifically due to a malicious `request` package dependency.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A malicious version of the `request` package was introduced into the project's dependencies. This malicious package was available on some PyPI mirror sites even after being removed from the main PyPI repository.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Supply Chain Attack:** The project was compromised by a malicious dependency introduced through a package manager (PyPI and its mirrors).
- **Remote Code Execution:** The malicious `setup.py` within the `request` package executes arbitrary code upon installation.
- **Persistence:** The malicious code installs a remote control Trojan and adds a backdoor to `.bashrc` to achieve persistence on the infected system.
- **Information Stealing:** The attacker uses the remote control trojan to steal sensitive information, including browser cookies and cryptocurrency account credentials.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Control:** Attackers gain remote control of infected machines via a Trojan.
- **Data Exfiltration:** Attackers can steal sensitive information, such as cryptocurrency account secrets, browser cookies, and potentially other sensitive data.
- **System Compromise:** Attackers can establish persistence on compromised systems, allowing for continued access and potential further malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Package Installation:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user installs the compromised `request` package, specifically via a PyPI mirror site that still hosts the malicious version.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Compromised Package:** The attacker needs to have published a malicious version of a package (in this case, `request`) to PyPI or its mirror sites.
- **Victim Installs Malicious Package:** The attacker relies on victims installing the compromised package from a vulnerable mirror site using the requirements.txt file.

**Additional Details:**
- The compromised `request` package contains malicious code in its `setup.py` file.
- This `setup.py` script remotely downloads and executes a second stage payload from `https://dexy.top/request/check.so`.
- The second stage payload installs a remote access trojan, which is stored as `.uds/_err.log` in the user's home directory.
- The trojan is controlled by the attacker via the command and control (C2) server at `dexy.top`, which allows the attacker to steal data using `http://dexy.top/x.pyx`.
- The report suggests replacing the compromised `request` dependency with the official `requests` library as a mitigation step.
