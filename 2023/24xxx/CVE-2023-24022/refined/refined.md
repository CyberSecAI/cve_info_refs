- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Hard-coded cryptographic credentials.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The device uses hard-coded credentials for cryptographic operations.
- **Impact of exploitation:** This vulnerability could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the device or perform other malicious activities, such as data breaches or manipulation.
- **Attack vectors:** The specific attack vector is not detailed, but likely involves leveraging the hardcoded credentials.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be able to interact with the system to use the hardcoded credentials.
