    - **Root cause of vulnerability:** The fix for CVE-2023-24998 in Apache Tomcat was incomplete. When non-default HTTP connector settings were configured such that the `maxParameterCount` could be reached using query string parameters, an attacker could bypass the limit for uploaded request parts by submitting exactly `maxParameterCount` parameters, leading to a potential denial-of-service (DoS).
    - **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Incomplete fix for a previous vulnerability (CVE-2023-24998), allowing bypass of upload limits when request parameters reach a configured limit.
    - **Impact of exploitation:** Denial of service by exhausting resources through large file uploads.
    - **Attack vectors:** Sending an HTTP request with a crafted query string that contains exactly `maxParameterCount` parameters.
    - **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to send crafted HTTP requests and know the server's `maxParameterCount` setting.

    - This content is a Debian Security Advisory (DSA 5522-1) which includes CVE-2023-24998 as one of the multiple vulnerabilities fixed in the `tomcat9` package.
    - **Root cause of vulnerability:** `tomcat9` uses a renamed copy of Apache Commons FileUpload which was also vulnerable to CVE-2023-24998. There was no limit to the number of request parts processed, allowing an attacker to trigger a DoS with a malicious upload or series of uploads.
    - **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unbounded processing of request parts for file uploads in Apache Tomcat.
    - **Impact of exploitation:** Denial of service via malicious uploads.
    - **Attack vectors:** A malicious upload or series of uploads.
    - **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No special capabilities or positions are specified other than to be able to send HTTP requests.
