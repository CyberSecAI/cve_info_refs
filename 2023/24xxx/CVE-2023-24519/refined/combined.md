# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2023-1706

## Milesight UR32L vtysh\_ubus toolsh\_excute.constprop.1 OS command injection vulnerabilities

##### July 6, 2023

##### CVE Number

CVE-2023-24519,CVE-2023-24520

##### SUMMARY

Two OS command injection vulnerability exist in the vtysh\_ubus toolsh\_excute.constprop.1 functionality of Milesight UR32L v32.3.0.5. A specially-crafted network request can lead to command execution. An attacker can send a network request to trigger these vulnerabilities.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

Milesight UR32L v32.3.0.5

##### PRODUCT URLS

UR32L - <https://www.milesight-iot.com/cellular/router/ur32l/>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

8.8 - CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

##### CWE

CWE-77 - Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command (‘Command Injection’)

##### DETAILS

The Milesight UR32L is an industrial cellular router. The router features include support for multiple VPNs, a router console shell, firewall and many others.

The Milesight router offers several functionalities through the `/cgi` endpoint. The “core” functionality we are considering is called `yruo_tools`, in this “core” there are two functions: “ping” and “traceroute”. For instance, the payload for the `/cgi` API to use the “traceroute” functionality is would look likes this:

```
{
    "id": 60,
    "execute": 1,
    "core": "yruo_tools",
    "function": "traceroute",
    "values": [
        {
            "host": "<some_host>"
        }
    ]
} The ping one would differ for the `"function"` value that would be "ping".

```

Both “ping” and “traceroute” will end up calling the `vtysh_ubus`’s `toolsh_excute.constprop.1` function.

```
void toolsh_excute.constprop.1(void *ping_or_trace,undefined4 params,void *rcp_session)

{
  [... variable declaration ...]

  [... variable initialization ...]
  [...]
  get_tool_path.constprop.4(ping_or_trace,1,rcp_session,(char)lock_path);
  get_tool_path.constprop.4(ping_or_trace,0,rcp_session,(char)log_path);
  if (ping_or_trace == (void *)0x0) {
    command = "ping";
  }
  else {
    command = "trace";
  }
  snprintf(shell_cmd,0x120,"%s %s %s %s %s &","/usr/sbin/webtools.sh",command,params,log_path,
           lock_path);                                                                                  [1]
  printf("** lock=%s **\n** path=%s **\n** command=%s **\n",lock_path,log_path,shell_cmd);
  does_lock_exist = access((char *)lock_path,0);
  if (does_lock_exist == 0) {
    [..]
  }
  else {
    lock_fd = open((char *)lock_path,0x41,0);
    if (-1 < lock_fd) {
      close(lock_fd);
      system(shell_cmd);                                                                                [2]
      [...]
    }
    [...]
  }
  [...]
} This function based on the `ping_or_trace` parameters will compose, at `[1]`, the string `/usr/sbin/webtools.sh <ping/trace> <params> <log_path> <lock_path> &`. If another "ping" or "traceroute" command is not currently running, checked with the lock file, the composed string will reach the `system` function at `[2]`. Because the `params` parameters is not checked or parsed enough, this can lead to an OS command injection at `[2]`. Following the "ping" and "traceroute" related function that will call the vulnerable `toolsh_excute.constprop.1` function.

```
#### CVE-2023-24519 - tools\_ping

The `tools_ping` is the function responsible for managing the ping function in the `yruo_tools` “core”:

```
void tools_ping(undefined4 param_1,undefined4 param_2,undefined4 param_3,undefined4 param_4,
               undefined4 *data)

{
  [... variable declaration ...]

  [... variable initialization ...]
  json_msg_output("!! yruo_tools.ping params",data);
  blob_buf_init(b,0);
  len = __bswapsi2(*data);
  blobmsg_parse(tools_ping_policy,2,tb,data + 1,(len & 0xffffff) - 4);
  if ((tb[0] == (blob_attr *)0x0) || (tb[1] == (blob_attr *)0x0)) {
    blobmsg_add_string(b,"error","lack of param to test");
  }
  else {
    blob_string = (char *)blobmsg_get_string((char *)tb[0]);
    strncpy(ping_host,blob_string,0x40);                                                                [3]
    blob_string = (char *)blobmsg_get_string((char *)tb[1]);
    strncpy(ubus_rpc_session,blob_string,0x40);
    strtok(ping_host," ");                                                                              [4]
    toolsh_excute.constprop.1(0,ping_host,ubus_rpc_session);
  }
  [...]
}

```

The data are transmitted through `blobmsg` structures, the two variable that eventually will reach this function transmitted are:
- `host`: a parameter that should represent the host that will be pinged
- `ubus_rpc_session`: a parameter that will be used to check if the provided request was performed by someone that had logged in successfully

At `[3]` the `host` parameter is copied and then, at `[4]`, only the first word, separated by a space, is taken into consideration. This first word will became the `params` parameter for the `toolsh_excute.constprop.1`. Here the only parsing performed on the `host` parameter is considering only the first word before a space. This is not enough to prevent an OS command injection vulnerability

#### CVE-2023-24520 - tools\_trace

The `tools_trace` is the function responsible for managing the “traceroute” function in the `yruo_tools` “core”:

```
void tools_trace(undefined4 param_1,undefined4 param_2,undefined4 param_3,undefined4 param_4,
                undefined4 *data)

{
  [... variable declaration ...]

  [... variable initialization ...]
  json_msg_output("!! yruo_tools.traceroute params",data);
  blob_buf_init(b,0);
  len = __bswapsi2(*data);
  blobmsg_parse(tools_trace_policy,2,tb,data + 1,(len & 0xffffff) - 4);
  if ((tb[0] == (blob_attr *)0x0) || (tb[1] == (blob_attr *)0x0)) {
    blobmsg_add_string(b,"error","lack of param to test");
  }
  else {
    tmp = (char *)blobmsg_get_string((char *)tb[0]);
    strncpy(host,tmp,0x40);                                                                             [5]
    tmp = (char *)blobmsg_get_string((char *)tb[1]);
    strncpy(ubus_rcp_session,tmp,0x40);
    strtok(host," ");                                                                                   [6]
    toolsh_excute.constprop.1(1,host,ubus_rcp_session);
  }
  [...]
}

```

The data are transmitted through `blobmsg` structures, the two variable that eventually will reach this function transmitted are:
- `host`: a parameter that should represent the host that will used for the “traceroute” functionality
- `ubus_rpc_session`: a parameter that will be used to check if the provided request was performed by someone that had logged in successfully

At `[5]` the `host` parameter is copied and then, at `[6]`, only the first word, separated by a space, is taken into consideration. This first word will became the `params` parameter for the `toolsh_excute.constprop.1`. Here the only parsing performed on the `host` parameter is considering only the first word before a space. This is not enough to prevent an OS command injection vulnerability
