**Vulnerability:** Open redirect vulnerability in OpenID Plugin

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-24445

**Root Cause:** The OpenID Plugin improperly validates the redirect URL after login, failing to ensure it points to a legitimate Jenkins endpoint.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Open redirect vulnerability. The plugin does not properly validate the redirect URL after a successful login.

**Impact of Exploitation:** Attackers can use this vulnerability to conduct phishing attacks. By crafting a malicious URL, they can redirect users to an attacker-controlled site after successful authentication on the legitimate Jenkins instance, potentially stealing their credentials or other sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:** A user clicks on a malicious URL crafted by the attacker that appears to be a legitimate Jenkins URL. Upon successful login, the user is redirected to a site controlled by the attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL that will be used to lure a user to the Jenkins instance. The attacker can be unauthenticated, requiring only user interaction to initiate the redirect.
