- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds read when parsing specially crafted STL files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially disclose sensitive information by reading from memory locations outside the allocated buffer.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be triggered by opening a specially crafted STL file in the affected application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious STL file. This requires the ability to create such a file and deliver it to the victim. The attacker does not need any specific privileges on the system.
