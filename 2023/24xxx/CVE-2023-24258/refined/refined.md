Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied data within the `_oups` POST parameter in the SPIP CMS. Specifically, when a user clicks the "Ooops" button to cancel an action, such as removing an author, the system processes the `_oups` parameter. This parameter, which is either a base64 encoded JSON object or a PHP serialized object (depending on the SPIP version), is not sufficiently sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code. The system takes the keys of this object and uses them as column names in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection (SQLi) flaw. The application uses user-supplied keys from the `_oups` parameter directly in SQL queries without proper sanitization or input validation.
*   **Unsafe Deserialization:** Older versions of SPIP used `unserialize` on the base64 decoded `_oups` parameter. Even with the fix to check for base64 validity, the underlying issue of injecting arbitrary column names through the keys persists.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The system fails to validate the keys in the JSON or serialized object, leading to the ability to inject arbitrary SQL into the query.
*   **Insecure Use of `_oups` Parameter:** The `_oups` parameter, initially intended for cancelling actions, is being processed in a way that makes it vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Exfiltration:** An attacker can exploit the SQL injection vulnerability to extract sensitive data from the database using time-based or error-based SQL injection techniques. The provided content details how an attacker can extract data by assigning the result of SQL queries to the `vu` column and then retrieve the content via the `_oups` parameter generated when removing an associated user
*   **Potential for Account Takeover/RCE:** The analysis indicates that the SQL injection can be leveraged for more severe attacks such as account takeover or remote code execution, although specific vectors are not detailed in this writeup.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector involves sending a crafted HTTP POST request with the malicious `_oups` parameter to specific administrative pages (e.g., editing articles) with the `formulaire_action=editer_liens` parameter.
*   **`_oups` Parameter Manipulation:** The vulnerability is triggered through the `_oups` parameter which can be manipulated to contain malicious SQL queries as part of the keys of a serialized object or JSON object, depending on the SPIP version.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have an authenticated session with "editor" or equivalent privileges to access the functionality that processes the `_oups` parameter.
*   **Knowledge of SPIP Functionality:** The attacker needs to have knowledge about how SPIP processes the `_oups` parameter when managing article authors, and the specific fields required to create a valid request.
*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to manipulate HTTP requests, for example by using a proxy such as Burp Suite, to inject the malicious parameter.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Time-based SQLi:** The provided material includes an example of using a time-based SQLi to exfiltrate data.
*   **Error-based SQLi:** The report also details how to use error-based SQLi.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** The report details how to use the `vu` column to retrieve data, by exploiting the way SPIP builds the `_oups` parameter for the cancel action.
*   **Versions Affected:** The report specifies that versions 4.1.5 and earlier, as well as master branch (prior to the fix) are affected.

The content also mentions that the vulnerability was present in the code for a long time and that the "Ooops" function should be deleted for good to prevent future exploits of this kind.
