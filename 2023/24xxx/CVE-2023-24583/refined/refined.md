- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `cmd_name_action` function in the `urvpn_client` binary constructs a shell command using user-provided input without proper sanitization. This command is then executed using the `system()` function, leading to command injection.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
  - OS Command Injection (CWE-77): The `cmd_name` parameter, received through either a TCP or UDP connection in JSON format, is used to form a command without any input sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands.

- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the device, potentially gaining full control of the router.

- **Attack vectors**:
  - Sending a crafted JSON payload with the `type` set to `cmd_name` and a malicious command in the `name` field, via a TCP connection.
  - Sending a crafted JSON payload with the `type` set to `cmd_name` and a malicious command in the `name` field, via a UDP connection.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
  - The attacker needs to be able to send network requests (either TCP or UDP) to the vulnerable service.
  - No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
