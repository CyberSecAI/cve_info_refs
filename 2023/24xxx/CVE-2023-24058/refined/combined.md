## Product history

The predecessor to Booked was phpScheduleIt. The author, Nick Korbel, originally created the program for the Immunology Applications Core Facility and the Ben May Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Chicago.[[3]](#cite_note-pSIOrigin1-3) A SourceForge project for phpScheduleIt began on November 21, 2003[[4]](#cite_note-pSISF-4), and by September 13, 2004 an official open-source version 1.0 release of the software was made on Freecode.[[1]](#cite_note-pSIStart-1) On March 22, 2006, new forums were created for supporting the software and the community.[[5]](#cite_note-pSINewForum-5) By the end of the summer, hosting on Freecode stopped, remaining exclusively on SourceForge.[[1]](#cite_note-pSIStart-1)

Work on the project tapered off by mid-2008, with only a few releases being made. But a flurry of updates arrived after the 2.0.0 release on February 12, 2012[[6]](#cite_note-pSISFFiles-6). Steady work has continued on it since, with Korbel stating in April 2012 "the time I spend [on it] is fun and rewarding."[[7]](#cite_note-pSIBlog-7)

On January 24, 2014, Korbel announced phpScheduleIt would become "Booked," developed by his new small business Twinkle Toes Software. The software would remain open-source.[[2]](#cite_note-BookedAnnounce-2)

On November 1, 2020, the open-source version of the software was discontinued, with release 2.8.5., with the software becoming "a ful SaaS offering."[[8]](#cite_note-SFBookedArch20-8) According the primary developer Nick Korbel, "Booked Scheduler will be shifting to better serve the small business and not-for-profit communities. Going forward I’ll be directing all new academic and research customers to LabArchives Scheduler."[[9]](#cite_note-KorbelBig20-9) A few users took to forking the software[[10]](#cite_note-DaevorOpen20-10), but it's not clear if those projects will take hold. As of January 2021, one fork has a 2.8.5.2 release.[[11]](#cite_note-NenimiloBookedRelease21-11)
