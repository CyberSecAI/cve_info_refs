```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `selectFields` parameter is not sanitized before being used in an SQL query.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL injection",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or deletion.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/backend/auth.Auth/index.html` endpoint with a malicious `selectFields` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have access to the vulnerable endpoint and the ability to send HTTP requests. The provided PoC requires administrator rights, suggesting authentication is needed to reach the vulnerable code, and execute the exploit."
