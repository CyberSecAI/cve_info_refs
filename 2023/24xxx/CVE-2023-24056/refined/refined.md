The provided content discusses the development of `u-config`, a new implementation of `pkg-config`, and compares it to existing implementations like the original `pkg-config` and `pkgconf`. While it highlights several issues in the existing tools, none of the issues are related to a specific CVE.

Specifically, it mentions the following potential issues:
*   **Original `pkg-config`:** Difficult to build on Windows, requires bootstrapping, and has inconsistent output behavior.
*   **`pkgconf`:** Difficult to build, memory corruption bugs, stack overflows when parsing certain inputs (including empty .pc files), and use of `strlcpy`.
*   **`u-config`:** While it attempts to address the issues found in the above mentioned implementations, it has its own limitation of a fixed arena memory allocation that can cause the program to exit.

The content does not directly relate to CVE-2023-24056.

Therefore, the response is: UNRELATED
