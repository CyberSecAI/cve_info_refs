- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application contains an out-of-bounds write past the end of an allocated buffer while parsing a specially crafted SPP file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write (CWE-787).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when the application parses a specially crafted SPP file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious SPP file with the affected application. The attacker needs local access to the machine.
