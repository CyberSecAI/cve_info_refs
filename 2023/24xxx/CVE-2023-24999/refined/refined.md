        "Summary": "When using the Vault and Vault Enterprise (Vault) approle auth method, any authenticated user with access to the `/auth/approle/role/:role_name/secret-id-accessor/destroy` endpoint can destroy the secret ID of any other role by providing the secret ID accessor. This vulnerability, CVE-2023-24999 has been fixed in Vault 1.13.0, 1.12.4, 1.11.8, 1.10.11 and above.",
        "Details": "When Vault is configured to use the approle auth method, approles can be managed via the Vault API. These include CRUDL operations on the approle, but require certain permissions to be set via a path policy for a normal user or user with administrator access to perform any operation on it. Users can destroy an approleâ€™s secret ID by querying the `/auth/approle/role/:role_name/secret-id-accessor/destroy` endpoint. Secret ID acessors belong to the Role a user has access to. When executing this command, Vault fails to verify if the Secret ID accessor provided belongs to the role. This creates the possibility of an authenticated user being able to specify valid secret ID accessors that do not belong to their role or path permissions. This will result in the affected approles not being able to authenticate to Vault."
