Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-24812:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient parameter validation within the `notes/search-by-tag` API endpoint. Specifically, the input `tag` parameter wasn't properly sanitized before being used in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The lack of proper sanitization of the `tag` parameter allows for the injection of arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation of the SQL injection vulnerability could allow an attacker to:
    *   Read sensitive data from the database.
    *   Modify data within the database.
    *   Potentially execute arbitrary code on the database server, depending on the database configuration and permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is exposed through the `notes/search-by-tag` API endpoint. An attacker can exploit this by sending malicious SQL code within the `tag` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to access the `notes/search-by-tag` API endpoint. This likely means they need to be able to make HTTP requests to the application's server. No authentication requirement is explicitly mentioned in the provided documents, but based on the context, authentication may be needed.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 13.3.3.
*   A temporary workaround is to block access to the `api/notes/search-by-tag` endpoint until the patch can be applied.
*   The commit `ee74df68233adcd5b167258c621565f97c3b2306` addresses this vulnerability by implementing `safeForSql` checks on the `tag` parameter.
*   The fix adds two checks `if (!safeForSql(ps.tag)) throw 'Injection';` and `if (!safeForSql(normalizeForSearch(ps.tag))) throw 'Injection';` which prevents SQL injection.
