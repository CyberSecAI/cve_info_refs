Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2023-24045:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA) issue, also known as Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR). The DataIku DSS application fails to properly validate user permissions when accessing files in the `myfile` section.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Broken Authorization:**  The system does not correctly verify if a user has the necessary permissions to access files belonging to other users.
*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The vulnerability stems from the fact that the application directly uses user-provided input (username within the `path` query string) to access files, without proper authorization checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** A malicious user with normal privileges can download arbitrary files of other Dataiku users. This includes user configurations and other sensitive resources stored within the `myfile` section.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP request by modifying the `path` parameter in the query string to include the username of the targeted user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Normal User Privileges:** The attacker only needs a valid user account with normal privileges within the DataIku DSS system.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Dataiku DSS application.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects DataIku DSS versions prior to 11.3.2.
*   The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
*   The GitHub Advisory Database entry assigns this vulnerability a "Moderate" severity with a CVSS score of 6.5

In summary, CVE-2023-24045 allows a low-privileged user to potentially gain access to other users' private files by manipulating the `path` parameter in a request to the Dataiku DSS application. This is due to a lack of proper authorization checks, resulting in an IDOR vulnerability.
