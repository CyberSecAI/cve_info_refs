-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : openimageio
Version        : 2.0.5~dfsg0-1+deb10u2
CVE ID         : CVE-2022-41649 CVE-2022-41684 CVE-2022-41794 CVE-2022-41837
                 CVE-2023-24472 CVE-2023-36183
Debian Bug     : 1027143 1034151

Multiple security vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenImageIO, a
library for reading and writing images. Buffer overflows and out-of-bounds
read and write programming errors may lead to a denial of service
(application crash) or the execution of arbitrary code if a malformed image
file is processed.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
2.0.5~dfsg0-1+deb10u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your openimageio packages.

For the detailed security status of openimageio please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/openimageio>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>
