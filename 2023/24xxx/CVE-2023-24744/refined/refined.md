Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2023-24744:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Rediker Software AdminPlus application is vulnerable to both DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Reflected XSS attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **DOM-based XSS:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious client-side scripts. This injected code modifies the Document Object Model (DOM) in the victim's browser.
*   **Reflected XSS:** The application reflects attacker-controlled input back to the user, allowing the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject malicious code into the application's DOM.
*   This injected code can be executed in the victim's browser, leading to unexpected client-side behavior.
*   A successful exploit could result in arbitrary JavaScript execution, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or defacement of the application.
*   The attacker can also extract data from the website via the reflected XSS payload.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **DOM-based XSS:** The attacker crafts a malicious payload that is sent to the host. The vulnerable application then processes this payload in such a way that it modifies the DOM in the victim's browser when the user loads the page.
*   **Reflected XSS:** The attacker embeds a malicious payload within a request (e.g., a URL parameter), which the server then reflects back in the response.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to send crafted requests containing malicious payloads to the vulnerable application.
*   For the reflected XSS attack, the attacker must entice a user to interact with a crafted URL.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was identified by manually examining Burp Suite requests, using the Dalfox XSS finder tool, and then verifying the DOM.
*   The document provides screenshots as proof of concept.
*   The recommendation provided is to sanitize all untrusted data, particularly user input, before using it in the application. It also suggests avoiding user input for affecting DOM elements.
