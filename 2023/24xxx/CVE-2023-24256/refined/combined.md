## Affected Product

NIO Aspen

## Affected version

Aspen <= 3.2.5

## CVE-ID

CVE-2023-24256

## Description

Aspen, the infotainment system of NIO EC6, had a debug built of a system app and a path traversal issue with the system settings script that allowed an attacker to escalate from the shell to persistent root.

I have mentioned these two issues in my presentation at MOSEC 2022, "Feat(My First EV)!: Add Support for App Store".

Now that NIO fix them in the lastest version of Aspen, details will be disclosed.

## Vulnerability Type

Misconfigurations

## Exploit

### Escalation from shell to system

**com.nextev.datastatistic** is compiled with android:debuggable = "true" as well as android:sharedUserId = "android.uid.system".
By communicating with com.nextev.datastatistic over the JDWP protocol, I managed to execute arbitratry code in the context of **u:r:system\_app:s0** context and **uid = 1000**.

### Escalation from system to persistent root

Aspen does not enable kernel module signing by default, so privileged processes can insmod their own ko files into the kernel.
According to **/system/bin/setup\_touch.sh**, **platform\_app** or **system\_app** can setprop "persist.sys.touchscreen" to something like "cyttsp6\_i2c.ko/../../../../data/system/exploit".
In this way, /data/system/exploit.ko will be inserted into the kernel and provides an attacker with persistent root privilege across reboots.
