* Username-less Login Support

  Advanced Authentication extends the FIDO2 method to support the username-less authentication to the Web Authentication events. The enrolled FIDO2 card contains the username. When the user taps the card, the username is filled in the respective field automatically. To configure the username-less authentication, three options have been introduced in the FIDO2 method.
* Ability to Disable the PIN Prompt

  Advanced Authentication facilitates the administrator to mandate or hide the PIN prompt when users enroll, test and authenticate with the FIDO2 method.

  For more information, see [FIDO2](../../server-administrator-guide/data/fido2-0.html#fido2-0) in the [Advanced Authentication - Administration](../../server-administrator-guide/data/bookinfo.html#bookinfo) guide.

#### Ability to Add Twilio Subaccounts in the SMS Sender Policy

The subaccounts distinguish the usage based on team, customer or product, and provides clear billing data. Also, allows resource (phone number) mapping.

For more information, see [SMS Sender](../../server-administrator-guide/data/sms_sender.html#sms_sender) in the [Advanced Authentication - Administration](../../server-administrator-guide/data/bookinfo.html#bookinfo) guide.
