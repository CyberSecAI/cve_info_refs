(CVE) ID: CVE-2023-24586
CVE Description: The web configuration interface of Seiko Solutions SkyBridge MB-A100/A110 versions up to 4.2.0, MB-A200 versions up to 01.00.05, MB-A130 versions up to 1.4.1, and SkySpider MB-R210 version up to 1.01.00 stores APN credentials in cleartext in the configuration file. An attacker with access to the device could read the credentials.

```
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described, along with other related vulnerabilities:

**CVE-2023-24586 Details**

*   **Root Cause:**  Cleartext storage of sensitive information (APN credentials) in the configuration file of affected devices.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Credentials (APN) are stored without encryption.
    *   A configuration file which contains the clear text credentials can be read through the web interface.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**  An attacker who gains access to the device or the configuration file can obtain the APN credentials.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Remote access if the web interface is exposed
    *   Local access, physical access to the device
    *   Access to the configuration file via other means
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Ability to access the device's file system or configuration file. This access could be achieved through network access or physical access

**Additional Vulnerabilities from the Content**

The provided content reveals multiple vulnerabilities affecting the same product line:

*   **CVE-2016-2183**: Exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor. A remote attacker may decrypt the communication sent to the WebUI.
*   **CVE-2022-36556**: Command injection. A user may execute an arbitrary OS command with administrative privilege via the WebUI.
*   **CVE-2022-36557**: Unrestricted upload of file with dangerous type. A user may update files or execute an arbitrary command with administrative privileges via the WebUI.
*  **CVE-2022-36558, CVE-2022-36560**: Use of hard-coded credentials. A local attacker may access the product with administrative privileges.
*   **CVE-2022-36559**: Command injection. A remote attacker may execute an arbitrary OS command with administrative privilege via the WebUI.
*   **CVE-2023-22361**: Improper privilege management. A user may alter the WebUI password.
*   **CVE-2023-22441**: Missing authentication for critical function. A remote attacker may obtain or alter the settings or execute critical functions without authentication, e.g., rebooting.
*   **CVE-2023-23578**: Improper access control. A remote attacker may connect to the device's ADB port.
*  **CVE-2023-23901**: Improper following of a certificate's chain of trust. A remote attacker may eavesdrop on or alter the communication sent to the WebUI
*   **CVE-2023-23906**: Missing authentication for critical function. A remote attacker may execute some critical functions without authentication, e.g., rebooting.
*   **CVE-2023-25070**: Cleartext transmission of sensitive information. If telnet is enabled, a remote attacker may eavesdrop on or alter the administrator's communication to the product.
*   **CVE-2023-25072, CVE-2023-25184**: Use of weak credentials. A remote attacker may decrypt passwords for the WebUI.

**Mitigation and Remediation**

*   **Firmware Update**:  The primary solution is to update the firmware of the affected devices to the following versions:
    *   SkyBridge MB-A100/110: Ver. 4.2.2 or later
    *   SkyBridge MB-A200: Ver. 01.00.07 or later
    *   SkyBridge BASIC MB-A130: Ver. 1.4.3 or later
    *   SkySpider MB-R210: not specified, but should be updated to the latest version.
*   **Workarounds**:
    *   Disable WAN-side web access (default setting is already disabled)
    *   Use closed network segments that are not connected to the internet
    *   Restrict web access to specific IP addresses (maximum 4 addresses, including connection destination)
    *   Use strong passwords (12 characters with 3 types of characters)
    *   Be aware that the HTTPS connection might not be properly verified due to the self-signed certificate.

**Additional Notes**

* The provided text highlights that the initial passwords for the WebUI are simple and can be easily guessed in all affected devices, and therefore, should be changed immediately by users of these devices.
* An attacker can directly execute web configuration commands without authentication in some versions.
* The document also states that attacks exploiting CVE-2022-36556 have been observed.
