**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content from the GitHub repository ([github.com_96bed24c_20250115_084928.html](https://github.com/ZYen12138/RouterOS/blob/main/CVE-2023-24094.md) and [github.com_0508eb06_20250115_215247.html](https://github.com/ZYen12138/RouterOS/blob/main/CVE-2023-24094.md)) directly addresses **CVE-2023-24090**, not CVE-2023-24094. However, given the lack of information for CVE-2023-24094, I will proceed by analyzing CVE-2023-24090. The other content does not relate to any CVE.

**2. Vulnerability Details (CVE-2023-24090):**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `bridge2` process of MikroTik RouterOS. The root cause is a memory corruption issue.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary vulnerability is a memory corruption flaw that can be triggered by sending crafted packets to the `bridge2` process. This results in invalid memory accesses and subsequent crashes.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation leads to a crash of the `bridge2` process. This can disrupt network services provided by the MikroTik router and potentially cause a denial of service.
*  **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through sending crafted network packets.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to trigger this vulnerability. They must have the capability to send network packets to the affected device.

**3. Technical Details (From Backtrace Log):**

The backtrace log provides detailed information about the crash:

*   The `bridge2` process crashed with a signal 11 (segmentation fault).
*   The crash occurred at memory address `0x776e2147`.
*   The logs show register values, memory maps, stack, and the crashing code.
*   The `backtrace` indicates the call chain leading to the crash: `0x776e2147 0x776e1aaa 0x776e1bd6 0x776e1ca3 0x776e8745 0x0804cdc1 0x77681fcb 0x0804cdf9`
*  The logtail shows a repeated "A" pattern in the log, which might be related to the crafted packets.
*   The vulnerable version is `6.40.5`, stable.

**4. Timeline:**

*   2023/1/12: Vulnerability reported to the vendor.
*   2023/1/23: Vendor confirmed the vulnerability.
*   2023/2/23: CVE reserved.

**Summary:**

CVE-2023-24090 is a memory corruption vulnerability in the `bridge2` process of MikroTik RouterOS, allowing unauthenticated remote attackers to crash the process via crafted network packets. The vulnerability was found in version 6.40.5, and the vendor has been notified.
