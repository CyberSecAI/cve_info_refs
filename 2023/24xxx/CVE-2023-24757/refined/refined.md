Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE-2023-24757**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** A NULL pointer dereference occurs in the `put_unweighted_pred_16_fallback` function within the `fallback-motion.cc` file of the `libde265` library.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The code attempts to access memory via a pointer that is NULL, leading to a segmentation fault. Specifically, this happens at line 179 in `fallback-motion.cc`: `out[0] = Clip_BitDepth((in[0] + offset1)>>shift1, bit_depth);` when `dst` is NULL.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation results in a Denial of Service (DoS) due to the application crashing.
*   **Attack vectors:** A crafted input file is used to trigger the vulnerability when processed by `libde265`. This likely involves an HEVC encoded video file with specific properties leading to the NULL pointer.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to provide a crafted input file. No specific privileges are required. User interaction is required to open/process the crafted file.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in `libde265` version 1.0.10.
*   The issue was reported on the `libde265` GitHub repository and fixed by commit `48eb7dafe204b825b4a62948ed171a0cd3f1bda2`.
*   The vulnerability is also present in Debian 10 (buster) and has been addressed in version 1.0.11-0+deb10u4.
*   The vulnerability was reported via AddressSanitizer and GDB.
*   The issue is related to how the library handles motion prediction in HEVC video decoding, specifically within the fallback motion compensation logic.
