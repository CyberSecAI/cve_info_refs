Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-24120:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insufficient input validation: The length of the `wrlEn_5g` parameter is not checked before being copied into a stack buffer (`wifi_buf_entry`).
- Vulnerable function: The `formWifiBasicSet` and `formWifiBasicGet` functions in the device's web interface are vulnerable. Specifically, `formWifiBasicSet` stores user input to `wl5g.enable` and `formWifiBasicGet` copies that to a stack buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): By sending a large string as the `wrlEn_5g` parameter, an attacker can overflow the stack buffer and crash the device. The provided PoC confirms this.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST requests: The vulnerability is triggered by sending POST requests to the `/goform/WifiBasicSet` and `/goform/WifiBasicGet` endpoints.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device.
- Authentication: The provided PoC script authenticates to the device's web interface using the default credentials (`admin` / `81dc9bdb52d04dc20036dbd8313ed055`). The attacker must either obtain valid credentials or bypass the authentication mechanism to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerable device is a Jensen of Scandinavia Eagle 1200AC V15.03.06.33\_en.
- The `wrlEn_5g` parameter is stored into `wl5g.enable` via `SetValue` in `/goform/WifiBasicSet` and later loaded into a stack buffer via `/goform/WifiBasicGet`.
- The PoC script demonstrates how to trigger the overflow using a string of "A" characters of length 0x1000 (4096).
