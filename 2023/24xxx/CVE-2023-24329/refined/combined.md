### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in [GitHub Advanced Security](https://github.com/enterprise/advanced-security).

#### What if I do not want Copilot?

Copilot is entirely optional and requires you to opt in before gaining access. You can easily configure its usage directly in the editor, enabling or disabling it at any time. Additionally, you have control over which file types Copilot is active for.

#### How do I control access to Copilot in my company?

Access to Copilot Business and Enterprise is managed by your GitHub Administrator. They can control access to preview features, models, and set Copilot policies for your organization. Additionally, you can use your network firewall to explicitly allow access to Copilot Business and/or block access to Copilot Pro or Free. For more details, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-access-to-github-copilot-in-your-organization).

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in GitHub Advanced Security and available to all public repositories.

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

GeneralPlans & PricingPrivacyResponsible AI
### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model.

That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

## Footnotes

1. [Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO)](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud%40latest/authentication/authenticating-with-saml-single-sign-on/about-authentication-with-saml-single-sign-on) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

### @kenballus **[kenballus](/kenballus)** commented [Nov 12, 2022](#issue-1446600751) • edited by bedevere-bot Loading

urllib.parse.urlparse does not enforce that a scheme must begin with a character from `[A-Za-z]`. This patch adds a check to enforce that rule.

* Issue: [[tangentially related to CVE-2023-24329] urlparse does not correctly handle schemes that begin with ASCII digits, '+', '-', and '.' characters #99418](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/99418)

(GH-99421)

Prevent urllib.parse.urlparse from accepting schemes that don't begin with an alphabetical ASCII character.

RFC 2234 defines an ALPHA like this: `ALPHA = %x41-5A / %x61-7A`

The WHATWG URL spec defines a scheme like this:
`\"A URL-scheme string must be one ASCII alpha, followed by zero or more of ASCII alphanumeric, U+002B (+), U+002D (-), and U+002E (.).\"`

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2023-953c2607d8
2023-05-30 01:07:37.232581
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : python2.7
Product : Fedora 37
Version : 2.7.18
Release : 27.fc37
URL : <https://www.python.org/>
Summary : Version 2.7 of the Python interpreter
Description :
Python 2 is an old version of the language that is incompatible with the 3.x
line of releases. The language is mostly the same, but many details, especially
how built-in objects like dictionaries and strings work, have changed
considerably, and a lot of deprecated features have finally been removed in the
3.x line.

Note that Python 2 is not supported upstream after 2020-01-01, please use the
python3 package instead if you can.

This package also provides the "python2" executable.

Package        : python2.7
Version        : 2.7.16-2+deb10u3
CVE ID         : CVE-2021-23336 CVE-2022-0391 CVE-2022-48560 CVE-2022-48565
                 CVE-2022-48566 CVE-2023-24329 CVE-2023-40217

This update fixes multiple vulnerabilities concerning the urlparse module as
well as vulnerabilities concerning the heapq, hmac, plistlib and ssl modules.

CVE-2021-23336

    Python was vulnerable to Web Cache Poisoning via urlparse.parse_qsl and
    urlparse.parse_qs by using a vector called parameter cloaking. When the
    attacker can separate query parameters using a semicolon (;), they can
    cause a difference in the interpretation of the request between the proxy
    (running with default configuration) and the server. This can result in
    malicious requests being cached as completely safe ones, as the proxy would
    usually not see the semicolon as a separator, and therefore would not
    include it in a cache key of an unkeyed parameter.

CVE-2022-0391

    The urlparse module helps break Uniform Resource Locator (URL) strings into
    components. The issue involves how the urlparse method does not sanitize
    input and allows characters like '\r' and '\n' in the URL path.  This flaw
    allows an attacker to input a crafted URL, leading to injection attacks.

CVE-2022-48560

    A use-after-free exists in Python via heappushpop in heapq.

CVE-2022-48565

    An XML External Entity (XXE) issue was discovered in Python.  The plistlib
    module no longer accepts entity declarations in XML plist files to avoid
    XML vulnerabilities.

CVE-2022-48566

    An issue was discovered in compare_digest in Lib/hmac.py in Python.
    Constant-time-defeating optimisations were possible in the accumulator
    variable in hmac.compare_digest.

CVE-2023-24329

    An issue in the urlparse component of Python allows attackers to bypass
    blocklisting methods by supplying a URL that starts with blank characters.

CVE-2023-40217

    The issue primarily affects servers written in Python (such as HTTP
    servers) that use TLS client authentication. If a TLS server-side socket is
    created, receives data into the socket buffer, and then is closed quickly,
    there is a brief window where the SSLSocket instance will detect the socket
    as "not connected" and won't initiate a handshake, but buffered data will
    still be readable from the socket buffer.  This data will not be
    authenticated if the server-side TLS peer is expecting client certificate
    authentication, and is indistinguishable from valid TLS stream data. Data
    is limited in size to the amount that will fit in the buffer. (The TLS
    connection cannot directly be used for data exfiltration because the
    vulnerable code path requires that the connection be closed on
    initialization of the SSLSocket.)

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
2.7.16-2+deb10u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your python2.7 packages.

For the detailed security status of python2.7 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/python2.7>

## Security Resources

With the ever prevalent threats that span todayâs landscape, NetApp continues
to derive and provide security solutions across the portfolio. Links to
security resources are found below. As always, stay tuned because just like the
threat landscape, these resources are ever changing and being updated!

#### Products and Solutions

The product and solutions resources provide guidance, recommendations, and best
practices with regard to security elements and configurations amongst the
NetApp portfolio.

##### ONTAP

[ONTAP 9 Security Datasheet](http://www.netapp.com/us/media/ds-3846.pdf) - The
ONTAP 9 Security Datasheet provides a comprehensive list of security features
and functions available in ONTAP 9 - So if the question is, âwhat are all the
security features/functions in ONTAP 9?â, This is your resource!

[Security Hardening Guide for NetApp ONTAP
9](https://www.netapp.com/us/media/tr-4569.pdf) - We humbly refer to the
Security Hardening Guide for NetApp ONTAP 9 as your key resource when it comes
to answering the question, âhow do I deploy ONTAP 9 in the most secure
fashion?â. The hardening guide provides the recommended commands and configs
necessary to enable ONTAP 9 in the most secure configuration.

[ONTAP 9 Encryption Power
Guide](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/pdfs/sidebar/Security_and_data_encryption.pdf)

* When it comes to understanding the configuration and management details of NSE and NVE,
  including deployment, certificates, onboard key management and more, the Power
  Guide is the key resource!

[ONTAP 9 Network Management
Guide](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/pdfs/sidebar/Network_management.pdf) - While
this guide provides vast elements surrounding ONTAP networking (IPv4, v6,
IPSpaces, and more), it also captures some key security elements such as
managing SVMs, protocol restrictions and firewall configuration in addition to
control plane elements such as DNS, SNMP, FIPS configuration, and MTU details.
The Network Management Guide also shows list of ports used in ONTAP, also
listed in the hardening guide.

[ONTAP 9 Manage administrator authentication and RBAC with the
CLI](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/authentication/)

* You can enable login accounts for ONTAP cluster administrators and storage virtual machine (SVM) administrators.
  You can also use role-based access control (RBAC) to define the capabilities of administrators.

[DS-3898: NetApp Storage Encryption and NetApp Volume
Encryption](http://www.netapp.com/us/media/ds-3898.pdf) - When it comes to
encryption at rest there are many questions about the capabilities. The NSE and
NVE Datasheet seeks to quell such questions by providing a comprehensive
understanding of what NSE is, what NVE is, use cases, and how they can be
leveraged individually or together for a true dual/double encryption solution.

[NetApp Storage Encryption
Datasheet](http://www.netapp.com/us/media/ds-3213-en.pdf) - The NSE Datasheet
provides a holistic overview of the NSE solution and use cases. If you have
ever wondered what NSE is, what we mean by self encrypting drives, or what
encryption algorithm is in use, this is the resource for you!

Threat resources consist of guidance to address known threats through a
combination of prevention, mitigation, and remediation.

##### Ransomware

[The NetApp Solution for
Ransomware](http://www.netapp.com/us/media/tr-4572.pdf) - Ransomware wages war
on every environment. Being the custodians of one of the worldâs most valuable
resources (data/information), itâs imperative that we protect it. When it comes
to ransomware, this is your guide to addressing and remediating the threat.

Varonis in addressing the advanced techniques around this threat. We have
discussed and captured the solution in this joint white paper.

#### Integration and Solutions Guides

As we continue to tout the key elements of security including key management,
we understand the challenges and value of timeliness as it applies to adoption
and deployment. Due to such challenges we provide integration guides where we
walk through the configuration/provisioning of âkeyâ elements such as key
managers, FPolicy, and other security laden integration solutions.

##### Key Management

[NetApp ONTAP 9 External Key Management: Vormetric Key Management Integration
Guide](http://www.netapp.com/us/media/tr-4618.pdf) - The Vormetric integration

## Description

![@AdrianBunk](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3358267?u=86d7f4d590bfcf024de4837ad6e841fe4f2f1b2f&v=4&size=48)[AdrianBunk](https://github.com/AdrianBunk)opened [on Feb 22, 2023](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/102153#issue-1595844394)

Everyone (including the [submitter](https://pointernull.com/security/python-url-parse-problem.html) of the now public exploit who submitted the issue half a year ago to `security@python.org` and the [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-24329)) seems to think that [#99421](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/99421) "accidently fixed" [CVE-2023-24329](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-r32r-rqw2-wv5m "CVE-2023-24329").

Did the Python Security Response Team verify that this vulnerability that was reported to them and that is now public was fixed by [#99421](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/99421)?

The PoC from the submitter still works for me with the Debian package 3.11.2-4, which surprised me and makes me wonder whether the fix had any effect at all on the stripping of leading blanks issue in the CVE.

| [@gpshead](https://github.com/gpshead) I'm sorry to bother you, but I don't know urllib very well. Can you answer my question?  If I use this solution （[https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/102470）](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/102470%EF%BC%89) to fix CVE when I don't think about compatibility, can the CVE be completely fixed? Will other problems be introduced? |

| We aren't currently confident that we can safely backport a fix to older Python versions as *something* likely depends on some of the behavior around spaces. That said, this solution likely does work for a lot of code.  It is a reasonable recommendation (as I think the blog post suggested?) for people to call .lstrip() themselves on their url before passing it to urlparse from their own code rather than assuming they're running on top of a Python without the issue.  The other PR I closed this in favor of will have potentially even more side effects that could impact other uses of urlparse as it removes a wider/different set of characters than `lstrip()` considers from anywhere in the entire url string.  If you do go with this or any of the PRs in your own patched Python interpreter, please let us know how that went. Details like the relative size of your overall Python code base using your patched interpreter was and how many, if any, issues around the behavior change in the API came up after some period of time testing and deploying things with it. Those are all good data to have to inform decisions. (I'll be trying some testing of that nature myself) |

[@gpshead](https://github.com/gpshead) yes, it may have more side effects. But it removes the characters only at the beginning and the end of a URL string (and a scheme if one is passed separately.) |

(I'll be trying some testing of that nature myself)  I plan to add constraints to fix CVE: "The first character of the URL-scheme string must be one ASCII alpha." Then I initiated a check on users for this constraint for two weeks, and did not receive any feedback on the impact. I think the impact of fixing the CVE problem should be small. |

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2023-96aa33f0d3
2023-05-28 01:02:24.590659
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : python2.7
Product : Fedora 38
Version : 2.7.18
Release : 31.fc38
URL : <https://www.python.org/>
Summary : Version 2.7 of the Python interpreter
Description :
Python 2 is an old version of the language that is incompatible with the 3.x
line of releases. The language is mostly the same, but many details, especially
how built-in objects like dictionaries and strings work, have changed
considerably, and a lot of deprecated features have finally been removed in the
3.x line.

Note that Python 2 is not supported upstream after 2020-01-01, please use the
python3 package instead if you can.

This package also provides the "python2" executable.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2023-309cadedc6
2023-06-08 01:59:06.605307
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : python3.10
Product : Fedora 37
Version : 3.10.11
Release : 2.fc37
URL : <https://www.python.org/>
Summary : Version 3.10 of the Python interpreter
Description :
Python 3.10 is an accessible, high-level, dynamically typed, interpreted
programming language, designed with an emphasis on code readability.
It includes an extensive standard library, and has a vast ecosystem of
third-party libraries.

The python3.10 package provides the "python3.10" executable: the reference
interpreter for the Python language, version 3.
The majority of its standard library is provided in the python3.10-libs package,
which should be installed automatically along with python3.10.
The remaining parts of the Python standard library are broken out into the
python3.10-tkinter and python3.10-test packages, which may need to be installed
separately.

Documentation for Python is provided in the python3.10-docs package.

Packages containing additional libraries for Python are generally named with
the "python3.10-" prefix.

### @kenballus **[kenballus](/kenballus)** commented [Nov 12, 2022](#issue-1446600751) • edited by bedevere-bot Loading

urllib.parse.urlparse does not enforce that a scheme must begin with a character from `[A-Za-z]`. This patch adds a check to enforce that rule.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

### @kenballus **[kenballus](/kenballus)** commented [Nov 12, 2022](#issue-1446600751) • edited by bedevere-bot Loading

urllib.parse.urlparse does not enforce that a scheme must begin with a character from `[A-Za-z]`. This patch adds a check to enforce that rule.

* Issue: [[tangentially related to CVE-2023-24329] urlparse does not correctly handle schemes that begin with ASCII digits, '+', '-', and '.' characters #99418](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/99418)

(GH-99421)

Prevent urllib.parse.urlparse from accepting schemes that don't begin with an alphabetical ASCII character.

RFC 3986 defines a scheme like this: `scheme = ALPHA *( ALPHA / DIGIT / \"+\" / \"-\" / \".\" )`
RFC 2234 defines an ALPHA like this: `ALPHA = %x41-5A / %x61-7A`

The WHATWG URL spec defines a scheme like this:
`\"A URL-scheme string must be one ASCII alpha, followed by zero or more of ASCII alphanumeric, U+002B (+), U+002D (-), and U+002E (.).\"`

urllib.parse.urlparse does not enforce that a scheme must begin with a character from `[A-Za-z]`. This patch adds a check to enforce that rule.

* Issue: [[tangentially related to CVE-2023-24329] urlparse does not correctly handle schemes that begin with ASCII digits, '+', '-', and '.' characters #99418](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/99418)

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2023-994ecd7dbc
2023-05-31 17:29:34.390126
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : python3.10
Product : Fedora 38
Version : 3.10.11
Release : 2.fc38
URL : <https://www.python.org/>
Summary : Version 3.10 of the Python interpreter
Description :
Python 3.10 is an accessible, high-level, dynamically typed, interpreted
programming language, designed with an emphasis on code readability.
It includes an extensive standard library, and has a vast ecosystem of
third-party libraries.

The python3.10 package provides the "python3.10" executable: the reference
interpreter for the Python language, version 3.
The majority of its standard library is provided in the python3.10-libs package,
which should be installed automatically along with python3.10.
The remaining parts of the Python standard library are broken out into the
python3.10-tkinter and python3.10-test packages, which may need to be installed
separately.

Documentation for Python is provided in the python3.10-docs package.

Packages containing additional libraries for Python are generally named with
the "python3.10-" prefix.

## Python Parsing Error Enabling Bypass CVE-2023-24329

#### Vulnerability Note VU#127587

Original Release Date: 2023-08-11 | Last Revised: 2023-08-11

---

### Overview

urllib.parse is a very basic and widely used basic URL parsing function in various applications.

### Description

An issue in the urllib.parse component of Python before v3.11 allows attackers to bypass blocklisting methods by supplying a URL that starts with blank characters.

urlparse has a parsing problem when the entire URL starts with blank characters. This problem affects both the parsing of hostname and scheme, and eventually causes any blocklisting methods to fail.

**URL Parsing Security** \*

The [`urlsplit()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.html#urllib.parse.urlsplit "urllib.parse.urlsplit") and [`urlparse()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.html#urllib.parse.urlparse "urllib.parse.urlparse") APIs do not perform **validation** of inputs. They may not raise errors on inputs that other applications consider invalid. They may also succeed on some inputs that might not be considered URLs elsewhere. Their purpose is for practical functionality rather than purity.

Instead of raising an exception on unusual input, they may instead return some component parts as empty strings. Or components may contain more than perhaps they should.

We recommend that users of these APIs where the values may be used anywhere with security implications code defensively. Do some verification within your code before trusting a returned component part. Does that `scheme` make sense? Is that a sensible `path`? Is there anything strange about that`hostname`? etc.

What constitutes a URL is not universally well defined. Different applications have different needs and desired constraints. For instance the living [WHATWG spec](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-basic-url-parser) describes what user facing web clients such as a web browser require. While [**RFC 3986**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986.html) is more general. These functions incorporate some aspects of both, but cannot be claimed compliant with either. The APIs and existing user code with expectations on specific behaviors predate both standards leading us to be very cautious about making API behavior changes.

\*Note: This was added as part of the documentation update in https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/102508

### Impact

Due to this issue, attackers can bypass any domain or protocol filtering method implemented with a blocklist. Protocol filtering failures can lead to arbitrary file reads, arbitrary command execution, SSRF, and other problems. Failure of domain name filtering may lead to re-access of blocked bad or dangerous websites or to failure of CSRF referer type defense, etc.

Because this vulnerability exists in the most basic parsing library, more advanced issues are possible.

### Solution

The fixes are in the following releases:

fixed in >= 3.12

fixed in 3.11.x >= 3.11.4

fixed in 3.10.x >= 3.10.12

fixed in 3.9.x >= 3.9.17

fixed in 3.8.x >= 3.8.17

fixed in 3.7.x >= 3.7.17

## Description

![@kenballus](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49924171?u=e5fdbc516bb1f36efc22782d270108d10a2b8c6c&v=4&size=48)[kenballus](https://github.com/kenballus)opened [on Nov 12, 2022](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/99418#issue-1446574312)
# Background

RFC 3986 defines a scheme like this:

* `scheme = ALPHA *( ALPHA / DIGIT / "+" / "-" / "." )`

RFC 2234 defines an ALPHA like this:

* `ALPHA = %x41-5A / %x61-7A`

The WHATWG URL spec defines a scheme like this:

* "A URL-scheme string must be one [ASCII alpha](https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#ascii-alpha), followed by zero or more of [ASCII alphanumeric](https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#ascii-alphanumeric), U+002B (+), U+002D (-), and U+002E (.)."

# The bug

This is the scheme string parsing code from `Lib/urllib/parse.py:462-468`:

```
    i = url.find(':')
    if i > 0:
        for c in url[:i]:
            if c not in scheme_chars:
                break
        else:
            scheme, url = url[:i].lower(), url[i+1:]
```

This is the definition of `scheme_chars` from `Lib/urllib/parse.py:77-80`:

```
scheme_chars = ('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
                'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
                '0123456789'
                '+-.')
```

This will erroneously validate schemes that begin with any of `('.', '-', '+', '0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9')`. This behavior is in violation of both specifications.

This bug is reproducible with the following snippet:

```
>>> from urllib.parse import urlparse
>>> urlparse(".://") # Should error, but doesn't
ParseResult(scheme='.', netloc='', path='', params='', query='', fragment='')
```
# My environment

* CPython versions tested on:
  + 3.12.0a1+ ([fb844e1](https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/fb844e1931bc1ad2f11565fbe25627a1a41b4203))
  + 3.10.8
* Operating system and architecture:
  + Arch Linux x86\_64

`urllib.parse.urlsplit` has already been respecting the WHATWG spec a bit [#25595](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/25595).

This adds more sanitizing to respect the "Remove any leading C0 control or space from input" [rule](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#url-parsing:~:text=Remove%20any%20leading%20and%20trailing%20C0%20control%20or%20space%20from%20input.) in response to [CVE-2023-24329](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-24329).

### **[gpshead](/gpshead)** commented [Mar 9, 2023](#issuecomment-1461672925)

| This PR moves us in the direction I'd like to see the APIs go. I'm not sure it could ever be backported as a security fix for the long list of analysis reasons I just posted over in the Issue, but it might make sense in 3.12.  I believe there's still an open question of trailing spaces on paths potentially carrying meaning in some (presumably not-HTTP) scenarios (see the Issue analysis). So stripping all of the C0 characters early on might not be the right approach. But they should be stripped from most places. Lets keep this PR around as a likely option.  (I'll still put a do-not-submit tag on it for now, just as an indicator that we're not ready to accept it *yet*). |

| Results from internal testing across a huge body of code (including test suites of many open source libraries and applications): Stripping the C0 characters from the left hand side doesn't appear to cause any problems. Stripping them from the right hand side of the URL does, as existing code calling urllib.parse such as `django.core.validators.URLValidator.__call__` (at least up through 3.2, the code has changed slightly in 4.2 but I believe that remains true).  i've updated the PR to use lstrip on the url. |

| I'm a lot more confident that we could actually backport this as a security bug fix without breaking the world now.  As for documentation to be added to warn users of these APIs, I'm not quite sure how to word that and what to convey yet. I've opened up as a discussion in <https://discuss.python.org/t/how-to-word-a-warning-about-security-uses-in-urllib-parse-docs/26399>. |

`urllib.parse.urlsplit` has already been respecting the WHATWG spec a bit GH-25595.

This adds more sanitizing to respect the \"Remove any leading C0 control or space from input\" [rule](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/GH-url-parsing:~:text=Remove%20any%20leading%20and%20trailing%20C0%20control%20or%20space%20from%20input.) in response to [CVE-2023-24329](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-24329).

I simplified the docs by eliding the state of the world explanatory
paragraph in this security release only backport.  (people will see
that in the mainline /3/ docs)

Upgrade builds to OpenSSL 1.1.1u.

Also updates _ssl_data_111.h from OpenSSL 1.1.1u, _ssl_data_300.h from 3.0.9.

Manual edits to the _ssl_data_300.h file prevent it from removing any
existing definitions in case those exist in some peoples builds and were
important (avoiding regressions during backporting).

* [3.8] gh-103142: Upgrade binary builds and CI to OpenSSL 1.1.1u (GH-105174) (GH-105200) (GH-105205) (#105370)

Upgrade builds to OpenSSL 1.1.1u.

Also updates _ssl_data_111.h from OpenSSL 1.1.1u, _ssl_data_300.h from 3.0.9.

Manual edits to the _ssl_data_300.h file prevent it from removing any
existing definitions in case those exist in some peoples builds and were
important (avoiding regressions during backporting).

`urllib.parse.urlsplit` has already been respecting the WHATWG spec a bit GH-25595.

This adds more sanitizing to respect the \"Remove any leading C0 control or space from input\" [rule](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/GH-url-parsing:~:text=Remove%20any%20leading%20and%20trailing%20C0%20control%20or%20space%20from%20input.) in response to [CVE-2023-24329](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-24329).

Backported from Python 3.12

(cherry picked from commit f48a96a28012d28ae37a2f4587a780a5eb779946)

## Timelines

07/20/2022: Issue first discoverd

08/03/2022: Report sent to security@python.org

08/25/2022: One staff wrote: “I personally agree this should probably be improved, we’ll see if I can convince the others. They’ll likely say we need to work through it publicly”

09/30/2022: Report accepted by CERT. (VU#127587)

~~11/12/2022: Issue is accidently fixed https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/99418. But the exploit is still private.~~ According to https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/102153, the problem was not fixed.

[added] Between 08/25/2022 and 01/20/2023, I sent about 10 follow-ups to security@python.org and the staff responded me but got no replies.

[added] I did way more than what I wrote here to try to make the conversion going on: I contacted CERT at 09/30/2022 to rebuild the communication channel with Python; I contacted Snyk through its open source security program at 11/09/2022, again to try to reach to Python in a private way; CERT got responses from Python in Jan 2023, but the response was not that helpful. Neither the “public discussion” nor “private discussion” were never occurred.

[added] I do see a lot of discussions going on but I do not want to escalate the issue: after all, the purpose of this report is to inform developers the existing potential attack vectors. I really appreciate Python volunteers: I know they are busy and they have more prioritized work to do; I really appreciate the people speak for me that I am responsible for the disclosure process: I am so gratified my sincere and my efforts were seen by others.

01/20/2023: Article published and apply for a CVE number.

02/17/2023: CVE-2023-24329 is assigned.

## Summary

urllib.parse is a very basic and widely used basic URL parsing function in various applications. One of Python’s core functions, urlparse, has a parsing problem when the entire URL starts with blank characters. This problem affects both the parsing of hostname and scheme, and eventually causes any blocklisting methods to fail.

This vulnerability is applicable to all python version before 3.11.

## Affected Module:

urllib (<https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.11/Lib/urllib>)

## Relevant Package Manager/Ecosystem

<https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.html>

## Root Cause of the Problems

File Name: \Python\Python39\Lib\urllib\[parse.py](http://parse.py/)

```
def urlparse(url, scheme='', allow_fragments=True):
    """Parse a URL into 6 components:
    <scheme>://<netloc>/<path>;<params>?<query>#<fragment>

    The result is a named 6-tuple with fields corresponding to the
    above. It is either a ParseResult or ParseResultBytes object,
    depending on the type of the url parameter.

    The username, password, hostname, and port sub-components of netloc
    can also be accessed as attributes of the returned object.

    The scheme argument provides the default value of the scheme
    component when no scheme is found in url.

    If allow_fragments is False, no attempt is made to separate the
    fragment component from the previous component, which can be either
    path or query.

    Note that % escapes are not expanded.
    """
    url, scheme, _coerce_result = _coerce_args(url, scheme)
    splitresult = urlsplit(url, scheme, allow_fragments)
    scheme, netloc, url, query, fragment = splitresult
    if scheme in uses_params and ';' in url:
        url, params = _splitparams(url)
    else:
        params = ''
    result = ParseResult(scheme, netloc, url, params, query, fragment)
    return _coerce_result(result)

```

The urlparse() function itself is more like a wrapper function. The mean function to process the URL is urlsplit() inside the same file.

def urlsplit(url, scheme=”, allow\_fragments=True):
“””Parse a URL into 5 components:
:///?#

```
def urlsplit(url, scheme='', allow_fragments=True):

    """

    url, scheme, _coerce_result = _coerce_args(url, scheme)

    for b in _UNSAFE_URL_BYTES_TO_REMOVE:
        url = url.replace(b, "")
        scheme = scheme.replace(b, "")

    allow_fragments = bool(allow_fragments)
    key = url, scheme, allow_fragments, type(url), type(scheme)
    cached = _parse_cache.get(key, None)
    if cached:
        return _coerce_result(cached)
    if len(_parse_cache) >= MAX_CACHE_SIZE: # avoid runaway growth
        clear_cache()
    netloc = query = fragment = ''
    i = url.find(':')
    if i > 0:

            if c not in scheme_chars:
                break
        else:
            scheme, url = url[:i].lower(), url[i+1:]

                (']' in netloc and '[' not in netloc)):

    if allow_fragments and '#' in url:
        url, fragment = url.split('#', 1)
    if '?' in url:
        url, query = url.split('?', 1)
    _checknetloc(netloc)
    v = SplitResult(scheme, netloc, url, query, fragment)
    _parse_cache[key] = v
    return _coerce_result(v)
```

On line 24, the **\_UNSAFE\_URL\_BYTES\_TO\_REMOVE** list is good for prevent injection.

```
for b in _UNSAFE_URL_BYTES_TO_REMOVE:
        url = url.replace(b, "")
        scheme = scheme.replace(b, "")
```

On line 39, the content of scheme\_chars is below:

```
if i > 0:
        for c in url[:i]:
            if c not in scheme_chars:
                break
        else:
            scheme, url = url[:i].lower(), url[i+1:]
```
![](https://pointernull.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-24.png)

**Since it is a for-else structure, once there is any char not in *scheme\_chars,* scheme and url will not be assigned by the parsed value.**

Therefore, Scheme will be blank and URL will be the whole string.

Going forward, the condition of *if url[:2] == ‘//’:* will not hold anymore (for normal URL, it will be true because the URL will be assigned as url[i+1:] in the previous else clause)

Therefore, netloc and

```
if url[:2] == '//':
        netloc, url = _splitnetloc(url, 2)
        if (('[' in netloc and ']' not in netloc) or
                (']' in netloc and '[' not in netloc)):
            raise ValueError("Invalid IPv6 URL")
```

Then, on line 54, this is a function to concatenate each component

```
v = SplitResult(scheme, netloc, url, query, fragment)
```
```
class SplitResult(_SplitResultBase, _NetlocResultMixinStr):
    __slots__ = ()
    def geturl(self):
        return urlunsplit(self)
```
```
def urlunsplit(components):
    """Combine the elements of a tuple as returned by urlsplit() into a
    complete URL as a string. The data argument can be any five-item iterable.
    This may result in a slightly different, but equivalent URL, if the URL that
    was parsed originally had unnecessary delimiters (for example, a ? with an
    empty query; the RFC states that these are equivalent)."""
    scheme, netloc, url, query, fragment, _coerce_result = (
                                          _coerce_args(*components))
    if netloc or (scheme and scheme in uses_netloc and url[:2] != '//'):
        if url and url[:1] != '/': url = '/' + url
        url = '//' + (netloc or '') + url
    if scheme:
        url = scheme + ':' + url
    if query:
        url = url + '?' + query
    if fragment:
        url = url + '#' + fragment
    return _coerce_result(url)
```

Since the previous pre-processing are all failed, the whole URL will be regraded as path and other components will be regraded as blank.

As a final result, the parsed result of parsed = urlparse(“\*https://google.com”), will be

![](https://pointernull.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-25.png)

abnormal case of urlparse(“\*https://google.com”)

![](https://pointernull.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-26.png)

normal case of urlparse(”https://google.com”)

**As an intermediate conclusion, we know that chars not in scheme\_chars will cause urlparse() function to misinterpret results, impacting nearly every field including hostname and scheme.**

However, so far the results is just interesting but not impressive because the URL isn’t really visible.

`urllib.request.urlopen("*<https://google.com>")` gives us a

*urllib.error.URLError: <urlopen error unknown url type: \*https> error*

![](https://pointernull.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-27.png)

After some research, I found **blank** is magic characters helping us to achieve our goal that makes our URL visitable but at same time gives urlparse() a misbehaved result.

For urlopen, the step extracting scheme happening in

```
def _splittype(url):
    """splittype('type:opaquestring') --> 'type', 'opaquestring'."""
    global _typeprog
    if _typeprog is None:
        _typeprog = re.compile('([^/:]+):(.*)', re.DOTALL)

    match = _typeprog.match(url)
    if match:
        scheme, data = match.groups()
        return scheme.lower(), data
    return None, url
```

but before entering this step, the URL will be go through

```
def full_url(self, url):
        # unwrap('<URL:type://host/path>') --> 'type://host/path'
        self._full_url = unwrap(url)
        self._full_url, self.fragment = _splittag(self._full_url)
        self._parse()
```
```
def unwrap(url):
    """Transform a string like '<URL:scheme://host/path>' into 'scheme://host/path'.

    The string is returned unchanged if it's not a wrapped URL.
    """
    url = str(url).strip()
    if url[:1] == '<' and url[-1:] == '>':
        url = url[1:-1].strip()
    if url[:4] == 'URL:':
        url = url[4:].strip()
    return url
```

the strip function gets rid of the leading blank(s). so that it behave normally.

For request library, there is also a similar function to process URL

```
def prepare_url(self, url, params):
        """Prepares the given HTTP URL."""
        #: Accept objects that have string representations.
        #: We're unable to blindly call unicode/str functions
        #: as this will include the bytestring indicator (b'')
        #: on python 3.x.
        #: https://github.com/psf/requests/pull/2238
        if isinstance(url, bytes):
            url = url.decode('utf8')
        else:
            url = unicode(url) if is_py2 else str(url)

        # Remove leading whitespaces from url
        url = url.lstrip()
```

the lstrip function also gets rid of the leading blank(s). so that it behave normally.

Since those are two most prevailing libraries in Python, this vulnerability is already very applicable in many cases and situations.

(NOTE: leading blanks are also valid in current mainstream browsers but It will still fail on urllib3 because there is no similar strip() on it. )

## PoCs

```
import urllib.request
from urllib.parse import urlparse

def safeURLOpener(inputLink):
    block_schemes = ["file", "gopher", "expect", "php", "dict", "ftp", "glob", "data"]
    block_host = ["instagram.com", "youtube.com", "tiktok.com"]

    input_scheme = urlparse(inputLink).scheme
    input_hostname = urlparse(inputLink).hostname

    if input_scheme in block_schemes:
        print("input scheme is forbidden")
        return

    if input_hostname in block_host:
        print("input hostname is forbidden")
        return

    target = urllib.request.urlopen(inputLink)
    content = target.read()
    print(content)

def main():
    safeURLOpener(" https://youtube.com")
    safeURLOpener(" file://127.0.0.1/etc/passwd")
    safeURLOpener(" data://text/plain,<?php phpinfo()?>")
    safeURLOpener(" expect://whoami")
```
## Impact

I personally think the impact of this vulnerability is huge because this urlparse() library is widely used. Although blocklist is considered an inferior choice, there are many scenarios where blocklist is still needed. This vulnerability would help an attacker to bypass the protections set by the developer for scheme and host. This vulnerability can be expected to help SSRF and RCE in a wide range of scenarios.

## Mitigation

Community should also add strip() function before processing the URL, thereby eliminating this inconsistency.
