- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A memory corruption vulnerability exists within the application while parsing specially crafted DWG files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer (CWE-119) leading to memory corruption.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when the application parses a specially crafted DWG file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to entice a user to open a malicious DWG file with the affected application.
