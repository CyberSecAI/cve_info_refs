- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by a heap-based buffer overflow when parsing specially crafted PAR files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by tricking a user to open a malicious PAR file with the affected Solid Edge application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to create a specially crafted PAR file and have the victim open it with a vulnerable version of Solid Edge.
