- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Incomplete session invalidation upon logout in Guardian/CMC versions before 22.6.2, specifically when using the Chrome web browser under certain timing conditions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Session Fixation (CWE-384). The application fails to properly invalidate user sessions on logout, leaving them vulnerable to reuse.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An authenticated local attacker could gain unauthorized access to an original user's session if it isn't properly invalidated after the user logs out.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access. The attacker needs to be on the same machine or have local access to the browser session. The vulnerability is triggered based on the timing and usage of the Chrome browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be an authenticated user, have local access to the system where the vulnerable application is running, and be able to manipulate or re-use an existing user session. The attacker must be able to be present to take advantage of the window of opportunity that opens up when a user logs out but the session doesn't fully invalidate.
