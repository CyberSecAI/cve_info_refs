{
  "CVE-2023-24807": {
    "description": "The `Headers.set()` and `Headers.append()` methods are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attacks when untrusted values are passed into the functions. This is due to the inefficient regular expression used to normalize the values in the `headerValueNormalize()` utility function.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from an inefficient regular expression used in the `headerValueNormalize()` function within the `undici` library. This function is used to normalize header values before they are processed. The inefficient regex can be exploited using a specially crafted input string leading to a ReDoS attack.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to Denial of Service (DoS).",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Network"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker can be remote and requires low privileges. No user interaction is required. The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests that contain header values with a specific pattern that triggers the vulnerability.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability was reported by Carter Snook. The issue is present in `undici` versions prior to 5.19.1 and is fixed in v5.19.1.  There is no workaround besides updating to an unaffected version."
  },
 "CVE-2023-23936": {
    "description": "undici library does not protect `host` HTTP header from CRLF injection vulnerabilities.",
    "root_cause": "The `undici` library does not properly sanitize or validate the `host` header, allowing an attacker to inject Carriage Return and Line Feed (CRLF) characters into the header. These characters can then be interpreted as new lines by the HTTP server, potentially allowing the attacker to inject additional headers or modify the request.",
   "vulnerabilities": [
      "CRLF Injection"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to unexpected behaviour or other attacks. The injected headers can be used for cache poisoning and session hijacking.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability, requiring low privileges, and user interaction.",
       "additional_details": "The vulnerability was reported by Zhipeng Zhang. The issue is present in `undici` versions 2.0.0 and up to 5.19.0 and is fixed in v5.19.1. The suggested workaround is to sanitize the `headers.host` string before passing to undici."
