Based on the provided information, this GitHub issue describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the funadmin project.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `member.memberLevel#selectFields[value]` parameter which is passed to the `app\backend\controller\member\MemberLevel.php` and subsequently to `app\common\traits\Curd.php#selectList`. Ultimately, it reaches `\vendor\topthink\think-orm\src\db\BaseQuery.php#field` where it's directly concatenated into a SQL query without proper sanitization or filtering.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of sanitization of user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries. Specifically, the `selectFields[value]` parameter is directly injected into the SQL query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary SQL query execution: An attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the `selectFields[value]` parameter to perform unauthorized database operations, potentially leading to:
    - Data breaches (reading, modifying, or deleting sensitive data)
    - Authentication bypass
    - Privilege escalation
    - Denial of service

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET request: The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/backend/member.memberLevel/index` endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No specific user privileges within the application are mentioned, implying that the vulnerability may be exploitable by unauthenticated users, although further investigation would be needed to be certain.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft the specific malicious payload and insert it into the `selectFields[value]` parameter.
