more information on installation and upgrading to iManager 3.2.6.0300, see the NetIQ iManager Installation

IMPORTANT:

 iManager 3.2.6.0300 is supported on eDirectory 9.2 or later. If you have both eDirectory and iManager
installed on the same machine, upgrade eDirectory to 9.2 (or later) before upgrading iManager. This is
applicable when upgrading iManager from 3.2.x to 3.2.6.0300.

Engine 4.8.6. If you do, you might encounter the java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Could not
initialize class novel.jclient.JCContext error. To fix the issue, follow the steps in this
