Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-24070:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of the "Referer" HTTP request header within the "add" action of the "AuthKeys" controller in MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application takes user-controlled input from the "Referer" header and reflects it back in the response without proper sanitization, leading to an XSS vulnerability. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web page that executes within the victim's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser when they visit a crafted URL. This could lead to:
    - Stealing sensitive information (e.g., session cookies, user credentials).
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Defacing the web page.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted URL that includes malicious script in the "Referer" HTTP request header. When a user clicks this specially crafted URL, the server reflects the malicious code which is then executed in the victim's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL with XSS payload.
- The attacker needs to lure a victim to click on the crafted link.
- The attacker requires low privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
-  The victim must be a logged in user of the MISP platform.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Dawid Czarnecki from Zigrin Security, who used their tool Cake Fuzzer to detect it.
- The vulnerable version of MISP is 2.4.166, and the fix is available in version 2.4.168.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.1 score of 3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N (Low).
- The fix for the vulnerability was made in commit `f7238fe5e71ac065daa43c8607d02f8ac682f18f`
- The fix involves sanitizing the referer header by using `h()` function before rendering it on the page.
