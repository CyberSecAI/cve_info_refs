Here's the relevant information for CVE-2023-24434:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-24434

**Vulnerability:** CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in GitHub Pull Request Builder Plugin

**Affected Plugin:** `ghprb` (GitHub Pull Request Builder Plugin)

**Affected Versions:** 1.42.2 and earlier

**Root Cause:**
*   The plugin does not perform permission checks in methods implementing form validation.
*   These form validation methods do not require POST requests.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Missing permission check:**  Lack of proper authorization checks allows unauthorized users to access and manipulate plugin functionalities.
*   **CSRF:** Vulnerable endpoints do not require POST requests, making them susceptible to Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Attackers with `Overall/Read` permission can connect to an attacker-specified URL.
*   They can use attacker-specified credentials IDs, obtained through other vulnerabilities, to capture credentials stored in Jenkins.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   An attacker needs to lure a user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website while logged into Jenkins.
*   The attacker needs to have `Overall/Read` permissions.
*   The attacker also needs to have knowledge of valid credentials IDs within the Jenkins instance to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   Attacker needs to have `Overall/Read` permission in Jenkins.
*   Attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL or website.
*   Attacker needs to have knowledge of valid credentials IDs stored in Jenkins which can be obtained via other vulnerabilities like CVE-2023-24436.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The advisory states that there is no fix available for this vulnerability as of the publication date.
*   This CVE is part of a broader issue (SECURITY-2789) which also includes CVE-2023-24435 (missing permission check) and CVE-2023-24436 (missing permission check).
