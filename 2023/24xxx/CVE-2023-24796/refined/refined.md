Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

*   **Root Cause:** A password vulnerability exists in the Vinga WR-AC1200 router firmware.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The vulnerability lies within the handling of the `password` parameter at the `/goform/sysTools` and `/adm/systools.asp` endpoints. It is implied that there is a lack of proper input validation or sanitization, allowing for injection of malicious code.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A remote attacker can execute arbitrary code on the affected device.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack is performed remotely by sending a crafted request to the vulnerable endpoints (`/goform/sysTools` and `/adm/systools.asp`) using a malicious payload in the password parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker must be able to send network requests to the device to exploit the vulnerability, which typically means the attacker is on the same network as the router or has some network path to reach it.
