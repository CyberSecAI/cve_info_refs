| phpipam 1.6 (looking at the changelog, tested on 1.5 demo at <https://demo.phpipam.net/login/timeout/>) has a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability that is executed by exploiting parameter 'closeClass'.  Example of vulnerable URL: [https://demo.phpipam.net/app/tools/subnet-masks/popup.php?closeClass=">](https://demo.phpipam.net/app/tools/subnet-masks/popup.php?closeClass=%22%3E)<script>alert("XSS")</script>  [XSS](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108727010/214061357-307827b2-1cea-44b4-be36-a11fd41284a8.PNG)  Vulnerable source code: <https://github.com/phpipam/phpipam/blob/master/app/tools/subnet-masks/popup.php>  ``` <!-- footer --> <div class="pFooter"> 	<div class="btn-group"> 		<button class="btn btn-sm btn-default <?php print @$_REQUEST['closeClass']; ?>"><?php print _('Close'); ?></button> 	</div> </div>   ```  (partial) Browser's response :  ``` <!-- footer --> <div class="pFooter"> 	<div class="btn-group"> 		<button class="btn btn-sm btn-default "><script>alert("XSS")</script>">Close</button> 	</div> </div>  ``` |

| Hello All, [@GaryAllan](https://github.com/GaryAllan) We are using PHPIPAM latest released 1.6 where we are observed A reflected XSS is possible by manipulating the closeClass parameter of the endpoint /app/tools/subnet-masks/popup.php. A stored XSS is feasible on the URL : https://\*\*\*\*\*\*/administration/nat/ by adding a NAT and edit it with malicious code in the "Destination address" field.  How to over come this vulnerability can achieve this by adding user input that is inserted in HTML code must be HTML-encoded, a variable that is inserted in a link should be URL-encoded, etc.)  Reproduction steps:- Connect to the IPAM application as an administrator. Reflected XSS: Put malicious code in the closeClass parameter of the endpoint /app/tools/subnet-masks/popup.php and put it in the web browser to trigger the XSS.  Stored XSS: Navigate to [https://demo.phpipam.net](<https://demo.phpipam.net/administration/nat/>. Add NAT with name XSS (NAT parameters do not matter). Edit the NAT object and put a malicious payload in "Destination address"  "onmouseover="alert('XSS') [image](https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/53812218/314441165-18a60250-8ddc-40ab-86fd-c5bf2bdcc78e.png?jwt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.-YmojzkMmb3NYZ94pDqoK4XQ3OOeite6Fdl4xgCNWX8) Click on "Edit" and edit the object again.
