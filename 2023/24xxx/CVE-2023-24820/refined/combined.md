# Integer Underflow during IPHC receive

High

[chrysn](/chrysn)
published
GHSA-vpx8-h94p-9vrj
Apr 24, 2023

## Package

RIOT-OS

## Affected versions

< 2022.10

## Patched versions

2022.10

## Description

### Impact

RIOT-OS contains a network stack with the ability to process 6LoWPAN frames. An attacker can send a crafted frame to the device resulting in a large out of bounds write beyond the packet buffer. The write will create a hard fault exception after reaching the last page of RAM. The hard fault is not handled and the system will be stuck until reset. Thus the impact is denial of service.

### Patches

* [master](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/pull/18817/commits/2709fbd827b688fe62df2c77c316914f4a3a6d4a)
* [2022.10](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/pull/18820/commits/d052e2ee166e55bbdfe4c455e65dbd7e3479ebe3)

### Workarounds

* Backport the patches listed above

### For more information

* Open an issue in [RIOT](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/issues)
* Email us at RIOT-security

### Bug Details

While copying the payload from the 6LoWPAN snippet to the IPv6 snippet the payload size is calculated as the size of the 6LoWPAN packet minus the offset after decompressing the header.

A crafted packet can lead to the offset being larger then the size of the packet.

In this case `payload_offset` is larger than `sixlo->size` leading to an integer underflow ([source](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/blob/2022.07-branch/sys/net/gnrc/network_layer/sixlowpan/iphc/gnrc_sixlowpan_iphc.c#L885)):

```
    memcpy(((uint8_t *)ipv6->data) + uncomp_hdr_len,
           ((uint8_t *)sixlo->data) + payload_offset,
           sixlo->size - payload_offset);

```

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
