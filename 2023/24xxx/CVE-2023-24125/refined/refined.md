Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a stack buffer overflow in the Jensen Eagle 1200AC router's firmware.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Stack buffer overflow:** The `wepkey2_5g` parameter, which is user-controlled, is copied to a stack buffer (`wifi_buf_entry`) without proper length validation. If a large string is sent in the `wepkey2_5g` parameter, it will overflow the stack buffer when retrieved by `/goform/WifiBasicGet`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The stack overflow can lead to a denial-of-service condition, likely causing the device to crash or become unresponsive.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network-based:** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/WifiBasicSet` endpoint with a large string in the `wepkey2_5g` parameter and subsequently sending a request to `/goform/WifiBasicGet`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target device, typically implying the attacker is on the same network.
- **Authentication:** The attacker must authenticate to the web interface of the router to send the malicious requests. This involves obtaining a valid session cookie after authenticating with username and password.

**Additional notes:**
- The provided PoC script demonstrates how to exploit this vulnerability by sending a large string as the `wepkey2_5g` parameter and triggering the overflow when requesting the wifi settings.
- The vulnerability lies in how the router's firmware handles the `wepkey2_5g` parameter when setting and getting wifi settings. Specifically the lack of length check before copying data to stack allocated buffer.
