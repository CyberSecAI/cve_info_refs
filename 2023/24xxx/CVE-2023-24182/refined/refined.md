The provided content relates to CVE-2023-24182.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper sanitization of user-provided input within the OpenWRT LuCI web interface when displaying SSH keys for deletion. Specifically, the comment part of the public SSH key is not escaped when displayed in the delete confirmation dialog.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists due to the lack of output sanitization of user input when displaying SSH key comments in the delete confirmation dialog.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code within the comment field of a public SSH key. When a user attempts to delete the key, the injected JavaScript will be executed in the user's browser. This allows the attacker to perform arbitrary actions within the user's session, which could include data theft, session hijacking, and more.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the LuCI web interface of OpenWRT.
- An attacker needs to have the ability to add an SSH key with a crafted comment to the system. This can be achieved either through direct access to the LuCI interface or through other vulnerabilities that allow modifying the authorized_keys file.
- Exploitation occurs when an admin user attempts to delete a crafted SSH key, triggering the stored XSS.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attacker needs low privileges to be able to add SSH keys.
- Attacker must be able to inject the malicious script in the comment field of a public SSH key which can be done either through direct access to the LuCI interface or through other vulnerabilities that allow modifying the authorized_keys file.
- No user interaction required besides the admin user clicking on the delete button for an ssh key which includes the malicious script.
