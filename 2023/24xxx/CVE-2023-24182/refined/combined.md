# Stored Cross Site Scripting via SSH Delete Key in OpenWRT LuCI Console.

High

[abbcdec](/abbcdec)
published
GHSA-7vqh-2r8q-rjg2
Mar 24, 2023

## Package

sshkeys.js
(OpenWRT LuCI)

## Affected versions

OpenWrt 22.03.3

## Patched versions

None

## Description

### Impact

Since the keys are getting stored to authorized\_keys file it will be executed every time the SSH keys page is being loaded while deleting the key. Attacker can perform further malicious actions using this JavaScript execution.

### Patches

[openwrt/luci@588381e](https://github.com/openwrt/luci/commit/588381e2111079265cc3b20af33507052f1b58cb)

[openwrt/luci@aa7938d](https://github.com/openwrt/luci/commit/aa7938d4cb3a3f889dead894ea19334ad07ade51)

[openwrt/luci@0186d7e](https://github.com/openwrt/luci/commit/0186d7eae0e123a409e9919a83fdfecc7945c984)

### Proof of Concept

1. Login to Luci console using credentials
2. Go to System -> Administration -> SSH Keys
3. Add the Payload below in comment part of the Public SSH key.

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/126053795/220555415-f5deb13e-bbc8-45e8-b7f5-e75d6bfbd852.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/126053795/220555415-f5deb13e-bbc8-45e8-b7f5-e75d6bfbd852.png)

4. Once key is saved now when we click on delete button. The application asks for confirmation of key deletion and shows the content of the key.
5. Here the input is not handled properly due to which JavaScript code can be executed.

Exact code line where the issue is happening : <https://github.com/openwrt/luci/blob/f470452c4a1c478caf1bbbc19568c523e203e8dc/modules/luci-mod-system/htdocs/luci-static/resources/view/system/sshkeys.js#L207>

### Workarounds

It is recommended to pull the patched LuCI version from the main branch to mitigate this vulnerability.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L

### CVE ID

CVE-2023-24182
