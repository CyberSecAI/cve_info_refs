This document provides details about multiple vulnerabilities found in PMB version 7.4.6, but it does not specify which vulnerability corresponds to CVE-2023-24737. Therefore, I will list all the vulnerabilities and their details described in the document.

**1. Reflected XSS**

*   **Root cause:** Improper neutralization of user-controllable input before placing it in output.
*   **Weakness:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
*   **Impact:** Allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
*   **Attack vector:** Crafted URL with a malicious JavaScript payload in the `query` parameter.
*   **Attacker capabilities:** Unauthenticated.
*   **Affected endpoints:** `/pmb/admin/convert/export_z3950_new.php` and `/pmb/admin/convert/export_z3950.php`
*   **Specific details:** The payload must end with `=or` to bypass a filter.

**2. SQL Injection (edit.php)**

*   **Root cause:** Improper neutralization of user-controllable input before placing it in an SQL query.
*   **Weakness:** SQL Injection.
*   **Impact:** Potential account takeover by extracting the admin's SESSID cookie.
*   **Attack vector:** Crafted URL with a malicious SQL payload in the `user` parameter.
*   **Attacker capabilities:** Unauthenticated.
*   **Affected endpoint:** `/pmb/edit.php`
*   **Specific details:** `action` and `dest` parameters are required, and the `user` parameter is the injection point.

**3. Unrestricted File Upload**

*   **Root cause:** Lack of proper file type validation.
*   **Weakness:** Unrestricted File Upload.
*   **Impact:** Allows uploading of arbitrary files, potentially leading to further attacks like Remote Code Execution.
*   **Attack vector:**  POST request to `camera_upload.php` with the malicious file content as a base64 encoded string in the parameter `imgBase64`.
*   **Attacker capabilities:** Authenticated.
*   **Affected endpoint:** `/pmb/camera_upload.php`
*   **Specific details:** Uploaded file needs to start with `GIF89a` to bypass initial filter.

**4. Remote Code Execution**

*   **Root cause:** User-controlled input is passed to `exec` function without sanitization.
*   **Weakness:** Remote Code Execution.
*   **Impact:** Allows execution of arbitrary shell commands.
*   **Attack vector:** Crafted URL with a malicious command in the `decompress` parameter.
*   **Attacker capabilities:** Authenticated.
*   **Affected endpoint:** `/pmb/admin/sauvegarde/restaure_act.php`
*   **Specific details:** `filename` needs to point to a file ending with `#data-section`, `compress` must be `1`, and `decompress_type` must be `external`.

**5. Open Redirect**

*   **Root cause:**  Accepts user-controlled input for redirection URLs without validation.
*   **Weakness:** Open Redirect.
*   **Impact:**  Can be used in phishing attacks to redirect users to malicious sites.
*   **Attack vector:** Crafted URL with a malicious URL in the `url` parameter.
*   **Attacker capabilities:** Unauthenticated.
*   **Affected endpoint:** `/pmb/opac_css/pmb.php`
*   **Specific details:**  `from` parameter must be empty and a md5 hash of the url provided in `url` parameter must be passed in `hash` parameter.

**6. SQL Injection (opac_css/export.php)**

*   **Root cause:** Improper neutralization of user-controllable input before placing it in an SQL query.
*   **Weakness:** SQL Injection.
*   **Impact:**  Potential account takeover by extracting the admin's SESSID cookie.
*   **Attack vector:** Crafted URL with a malicious SQL payload in the `notice_id` parameter.
*  **Attacker capabilities:** Unauthenticated.
*   **Affected endpoint:** `/pmb/opac_css/export.php`
*  **Specific details:** `action` parameter must be set to `export` and `notice_id` must start with `es`.
