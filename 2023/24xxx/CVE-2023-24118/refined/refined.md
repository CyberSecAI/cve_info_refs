Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-24118:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a stack buffer overflow that occurs because the length of user-provided input is not validated before being copied to a fixed-size buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Stack buffer overflow:** Specifically, the `security` parameter received through the `/goform/WifiBasicSet` endpoint is stored into `wl2g.extra.security`. Later when `/goform/WifiBasicGet` endpoint is called, the content of  `wl2g.extra.security` is copied into the stack buffer `wifi_buf_entry` without any size validation. An overly long string passed via the `security` parameter during the `/goform/WifiBasicSet` call can overflow the buffer during the `/goform/WifiBasicGet` request.
- **Lack of input validation:** The software fails to check the length of the `security` parameter before storing it in memory and later loading it into a stack buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Overflowing the stack buffer can lead to a crash or undefined behavior, rendering the device unusable. This is the stated impact in the provided document, but depending on the architecture and compiler, the overflow can also potentially be used for remote code execution(RCE).

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP POST request to `/goform/WifiBasicSet`:** The attacker sends a crafted POST request to the `/goform/WifiBasicSet` endpoint, including an overly long string in the `security` parameter.
- **HTTP POST request to `/goform/WifiBasicGet`:**  After setting the security parameter, an attacker calls the `/goform/WifiBasicGet` endpoint to trigger the overflow during data retrieval.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device. This typically implies the attacker needs to be on the same network as the device or have some other means of reaching the device's IP address.
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be able to login into the device using valid credentials and have a valid session. This is achieved by using the provided login functionality and obtaining a valid cookie.

**Additional Information:**
- The provided information includes a Python Proof-of-Concept (PoC) script.
- The PoC highlights the steps to reproduce the vulnerability, including authenticating, setting the overflow string using `/goform/WifiBasicSet` and triggering the overflow with `/goform/WifiBasicGet`.
- The PoC attempts to send a string of "A" repeated 2048 (0x800 in hex) times as the security parameter.
- This vulnerability is in Jensen of Scandinavia Eagle 1200AC V15.03.06.33_en.
