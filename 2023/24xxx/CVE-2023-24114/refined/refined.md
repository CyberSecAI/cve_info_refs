Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a combination of issues in the `install.php` file of Typecho version 1.1/17.10.30:
   - **Error Handling Bypass:** Lines 60-69 of `install.php` catch database connection errors but don't properly handle them, allowing the script to proceed past a crucial `exit` statement on line 65.
   - **Referer Bypass:** Lines 74-87 of `install.php` check the referer, but this can be easily bypassed by setting a fake referer such as `http://localhost/`.
    - **Unsafe Unserialization:** Line 291 of `install.php` uses the `unserialize` function on data from cookies without proper sanitization. The cookie data is derived from line 83 of `/var/Typecho/Cookie.php`. This allows an attacker to inject malicious serialized objects.
   - **Magic Method Exploitation:** The injected objects can trigger the `__toString` magic method (located in `/var/Typecho/Feed.php` line 223) and `__get` magic method (located in `/var/Typecho/Request.php` line 270), leading to the execution of arbitrary code via `call_user_func`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

   - **Inadequate Error Handling:** Failure to properly terminate the script after a database connection error.
   - **Insufficient Referer Validation:** The referer check is easily bypassed, providing no meaningful security.
   - **Unsafe Deserialization:** The use of `unserialize` on unsanitized user-controlled data.
    - **Magic Method Abuse**: The ability to trigger `__toString` and `__get` methods on crafted objects, leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

   - **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the Typecho application.
   - **Full System Compromise:** Successful RCE can lead to complete control of the server and potentially further attacks on other systems on the network.
   - **Data Breach:** The attacker could access, modify, or delete sensitive data stored on the server.
   - **Website Defacement/Malware Injection:** The attacker could modify the website content or inject malicious scripts.

**Attack Vectors:**

   - **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP POST request to `install.php`.
   - **Cookie Injection:** The attacker manipulates the `__typecho_config` cookie by providing a base64 encoded, serialized payload.
    - **Referer header spoofing**: By setting the referer header to a specific value such as `http://localhost/`, the attacker can bypass the referer check.
   - **Network Instability Exploitation**: The vulnerability is more easily exploited under conditions where the network is unstable and database connection errors occur.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

   - **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target Typecho server.
   - **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication.
   - **Basic Web Security Knowledge**: An understanding of HTTP requests, cookies, PHP serialization, and object-oriented programming is needed to craft the exploit.

**Additional Details:**

   - The provided content includes Proof of Concept (POC) code in PHP to generate the exploit payload, demonstrating the vulnerability.
   - The issue was closed and fixed in Typecho version 1.2.0.
   - The exploit requires a specific chain of events involving database connection errors and crafted cookie payloads. The attacker can force this condition via DDOS or by waiting for such errors to occur naturally.
