Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the use of `${}` in the MyBatis mapper (`UserMapper.xml`) which allows for direct string interpolation of user-controlled input into the SQL query. Specifically, the `dataScope` parameter is directly injected into the SQL statement.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection due to the use of `${}` in the MyBatis mapper. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker can use this vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the database.
- **Database Manipulation:** An attacker can modify or delete data from the database.
- **Potential for privilege escalation:** If the database user has excessive privileges, an attacker may be able to further compromise the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the `dataScope` parameter in the request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application and manipulate URL parameters.
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of the application's API and how to pass parameters to trigger the vulnerable code path.
- No authentication details are needed in the provided example.
