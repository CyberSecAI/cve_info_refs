{
  "CVE-2023-24429": {
    "root_cause": "The Semantic Versioning Plugin defines a controller/agent message that processes a given file as XML and its XML parser is not configured to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks. Additionally, the plugin does not restrict execution of the controller/agent message to agents and implements no limitations about the file path that can be parsed.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "XML External Entity (XXE) injection",
      "Lack of access control"
    ],
    "impact": "Attackers able to control agent processes can have Jenkins parse a crafted file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker who can control the agent processes can send the crafted XML file to the controller via the controller/agent message.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to control agent processes and have access to submit controller/agent messages."
