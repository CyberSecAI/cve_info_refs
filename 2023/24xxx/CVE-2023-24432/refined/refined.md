      "cve_id": "CVE-2023-24432",
      "description": "Orka by MacStadium Plugin 1.31 and earlier does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.\n\nThis allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an attacker-specified HTTP server using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.\n\nAdditionally, these HTTP endpoints do not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.",
      "root_cause": "Missing permission checks and lack of CSRF protection in HTTP endpoints.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Missing permission checks",
        "CSRF vulnerability"
      ],
      "impact": "Attackers can capture credentials stored in Jenkins by connecting to an attacker-controlled server.",
      "attack_vector": "By sending crafted requests to vulnerable HTTP endpoints.",
       "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs Overall/Read permission, ability to obtain credentials IDs (possibly through another vulnerability) and ability to set up an HTTP server to receive captured credentials."
