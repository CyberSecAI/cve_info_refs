Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from unsanitized user input being directly incorporated into an SQL query. Specifically, the `selectFields` parameter, passed via HTTP GET, is used without proper sanitization when constructing the SQL query.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The application takes user-supplied data (`selectFields` parameter) and directly includes it in a SQL query without proper escaping or sanitization. This allows an attacker to manipulate the query, potentially accessing or modifying data.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to:
    *   Potentially access sensitive data.
    *   Modify or delete data.
    *   Potentially gain further control over the system, depending on the database user's permissions.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP GET Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP GET request, specifically manipulating the `selectFields` parameter.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application.
    *   **Understanding of Parameter Structure:** The attacker needs to know the specific parameter name (`selectFields`) to target.
    *   **Basic SQL Knowledge:** The attacker needs SQL knowledge to craft a malicious payload.

**Technical Details:**

1.  The vulnerability is located in the `funadmin` application.
2.  The vulnerable code is spread across these files:
    *   `app\backend\controller\member\MemberLevel.php`: The initial entry point.
    *   `app\backend\controller\member\Member.php`: Calls the vulnerable function.
    *   `app\common\traits\Curd.php`: Where `selectList` method is defined.
    *   `\vendor\topthink\think-orm\src\db\BaseQuery.php`: Where the unsanitized input is concatenated into the SQL query.
3.  The vulnerable parameter `selectFields` is used in `MemberLevel::index()`
4.  The parameter's value is passed to `Curd::selectList()` method.
5.  The `selectList` method finally passes the unescaped input to the `field` method of the database query builder, which is then used in SQL query.
6.  The provided SQLMap PoC demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability.
7.  The vulnerable function does not properly escape or sanitize the selectFields array.
