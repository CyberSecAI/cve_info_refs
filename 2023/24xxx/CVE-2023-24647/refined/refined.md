- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input in the `email` parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially steal all information from the database, leading to data breaches and unauthorized access.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted POST request to the login form with a malicious SQL payload in the `email` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the application. No specific privileges or prior access is required.
