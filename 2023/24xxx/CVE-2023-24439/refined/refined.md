    "weaknesses": [
      "Private keys stored in plain text",
	  "API keys not masked in UI"
    ],
    "impact": "The stored private key and API key can be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system, potentially leading to unauthorized access to the associated JIRA instance.",
    "attack vectors": "Attacker gains access to the Jenkins controller file system to read the plugin's configuration file.",
    "required attacker capabilities": "Attacker needs access to the Jenkins controller file system to read the configuration file."
