Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-24535

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a change in the `prototext` package to support parsing numbers with whitespace between the minus sign and the number. This change introduced a flaw where an incomplete number consisting of a minus sign, whitespace, and no further input would cause a panic.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Panic on Invalid Input:** The primary vulnerability is that the `Unmarshal` and `UnmarshalOptions.Unmarshal` functions in the `google.golang.org/protobuf/encoding/prototext` package, along with the `Decoder.Peek` and `Decoder.Read` functions in `google.golang.org/protobuf/internal/encoding/text`,  will panic when parsing a text-format message containing an incomplete negative number (e.g., `"- "`).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause a denial of service by providing a specially crafted input that triggers the panic, causing the application to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Input:** The attack vector is through parsing a specially crafted text-format message that includes a minus sign followed by whitespace and nothing else, triggering the panic.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to provide input that is processed by the affected `Unmarshal`, `UnmarshalOptions.Unmarshal`, `Decoder.Peek` or `Decoder.Read` functions. This could be achieved if an application is parsing user-supplied or externally obtained protobuf text data.

**Affected Packages and versions:**
- `google.golang.org/protobuf/encoding/prototext`: versions from v1.29.0 before v1.29.1
- `google.golang.org/protobuf/internal/encoding/text`: versions from v1.29.0 before v1.29.1

**Additional details:**
- The fix for this issue was introduced in commit `https://go.dev/cl/475995`
