- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer underflow while parsing specially crafted PAR files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap-based buffer underflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploiting the vulnerability requires the user to open a specially crafted PAR file in the affected application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious PAR file and trick the user into opening it with the vulnerable application.
