- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application contains an out-of-bounds write vulnerability due to improper parsing of specially crafted SPP files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write (CWE-787).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process. This may result in a crash or allow for complete system compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when the application parses a specially crafted SPP file. An attacker needs to trick a user into opening such a malicious file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to prepare a malicious SPP file and convince a user to open this file with the vulnerable application. The attacker does not need any special privileges on the system.
