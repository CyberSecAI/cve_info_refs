    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of input validation on the 'wepkey3_5g' parameter.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow",
      "Lack of input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by overflowing a stack buffer. This could potentially lead to other impacts depending on the specific device memory layout.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/WifiBasicSet` endpoint with an overly long 'wepkey3_5g' parameter, followed by a request to `/goform/WifiBasicGet`.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device and needs valid credentials to authenticate to the device's web interface."
