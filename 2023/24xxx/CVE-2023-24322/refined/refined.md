Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-24322:

**Verification:**
The provided content from github.com/blakduk/Advisories explicitly mentions CVE-2023-24322 and describes it as a Reflected Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in mojoPortal. This confirms that the content relates to the specified CVE.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `FileDialog.aspx` component of mojoPortal v2.7. It appears that the application does not properly sanitize or encode user-supplied input passed through the 'ed' and 'tbi' parameters.

*   **Weaknesses:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper input validation and output encoding. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the context of the user's browser. Specifically, it is a Reflected XSS vulnerability because the malicious script is part of the crafted request and is then reflected back in the response without being sanitized.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary web scripts or HTML in a user's browser when the user visits a crafted URL. This could lead to:
    *   Session hijacking: Attacker can steal user's session cookies.
    *   Data theft: Attacker can steal sensitive information from the user.
    *   Defacement: Attacker can alter content on the page.
    *   Malware distribution: Attacker can redirect the user to malicious websites or force downloads.
    *   Phishing: The attacker could redirect to a login page that looks legitimate to steal credentials.

*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is a crafted URL containing the malicious JavaScript payload in the 'ed' and 'tbi' parameters, which is then reflected back by the application without proper encoding.  The user would need to be tricked into visiting the crafted URL.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated. They need to be able to craft a malicious URL and lure a victim into visiting it, usually through social engineering or by embedding the malicious link in another website.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content includes a Proof of Concept (PoC) video link, which provides additional context about how the vulnerability can be exploited.
*   The content explicitly mentions the vulnerable version as `mojoPortal v2.7`.
*   This analysis is more specific than the typical CVE description that will eventually be available.
