- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds read when parsing a specially crafted PAR file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially execute code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is a specially crafted PAR file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick the user into opening the malicious PAR file with the vulnerable application.
