# [R2] Tenable.sc 6.0.0 Fixes Multiple Vulnerabilities

Critical

[← View More Security Advisories](/security)
### Synopsis

Tenable.sc leverages third-party software to help provide underlying functionality. One of the third-party components (libcurl) was found to contain vulnerabilities, and updated versions have been made available by the providers. Additionally, four separate vulnerabilities were discovered, reported and fixed.

1. CVE-2023-24493 - A formula injection vulnerability exists in Tenable.sc due to improper validation of user-supplied input before returning it to users. An authenticated attacker could leverage the reporting system to export reports containing formulas, which would then require a victim to approve and execute on a host.

2. CVE-2023-24494 - A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in Tenable.sc due to improper validation of user-supplied input before returning it to users. An authenticated, remote attacker can exploit this by convincing a user to click a specially crafted URL, to execute arbitrary script code in a user's browser session.

3. CVE-2023-24495 - A Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in Tenable.sc due to improper validation of session & user-accessible input data. A privileged, authenticated remote attacker could interact with external and internal services covertly.

4. CVE-2023-0476 - A LDAP injection vulnerability exists in Tenable.sc due to improper validation of user-supplied input before returning it to users. An authenticated attacker could generate data in Active Directory using the application account through blind LDAP injection.

Out of caution and in line with best practice, Tenable has opted to upgrade these components and fix the additional reported vulnerabilities to address the potential impact of the issues. Tenable.sc 6.0.0 fixes the reported vulnerabilities and updates libcurl to version 7.86.0.

### Solution

Tenable has released Tenable.sc 6.0.0 to address these issues. The installation files can be obtained from the Tenable Downloads Portal: <https://www.tenable.com/downloads/tenable-sc>

  ###### medium

  GitHub Desktop is an open-source Electron-based GitHub app designed for git development. An attacker convincing a user to clone a repository directly or through a submodule can allow the attacker access to the user's credentials through the use of maliciously crafted remote URL. GitHub Desktop relies on Git to perform all network related operations (such as cloning, fetching, and pushing). When a user attempts to clone a repository GitHub Desktop will invoke `git clone` and when Git encounters a remote which requires authentication it will request the credentials for that remote host from GitHub Desktop using the git-credential protocol. Using a maliciously crafted URL it's possible to cause the credential request coming from Git to be misinterpreted by Github Desktop such that it will send credentials for a different host than the host that Git is currently communicating with thereby allowing for secret exfiltration. GitHub username and OAuth token, or credentials for other Git remote hosts stored in GitHub Desktop could be improperly transmitted to an unrelated host. Users should update to GitHub Desktop 3.4.12 or greater which fixes this vulnerability. Users who suspect they may be affected should revoke any relevant credentials.
* ##### [CVE-2025-0502](https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-0502)

  ###### medium

  Transmission of Private Resources into a New Sphere ('Resource Leak') vulnerability in CrafterCMS Engine on Linux, MacOS, x86, Windows, 64 bit, ARM allows Directory Indexing, Resource Leak Exposure.This issue affects CrafterCMS: from 4.0.0 before 4.0.8, from 4.1.0 before 4.1.6.
* ##### [CVE-2025-0480](https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-0480)

  ###### medium

  A vulnerability classified as problematic has been found in wuzhicms 4.1.0. This affects the function test of the file coreframe/app/search/admin/config.php. The manipulation of the argument sphinxhost/sphinxport leads to server-side request forgery. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.
* ##### [CVE-2024-52005](https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-52005)

  ###### high

  Git is a source code management tool. When cloning from a server (or fetching, or pushing), informational or error messages are transported from the remote Git process to the client via the so-called "sideband channel". These messages will be prefixed with "remote:" and printed directly to the standard error output. Typically, this standard error output is connected to a terminal that understands ANSI escape sequences, which Git did not protect against. Most modern terminals support control sequences that can be used by a malicious actor to hide and misrepresent information, or to mislead the user into executing untrusted scripts. As requested on the git-security mailing list, the patches are under discussion on the public mailing list. Users are advised to update as soon as possible. Users unable to upgrade should avoid recursive clones unless they are from trusted sources.

  ###### medium

  GitHub Desktop is an open-source Electron-based GitHub app designed for git development. An attacker convincing a user to clone a repository directly or through a submodule can allow the attacker access to the user's credentials through the use of maliciously crafted remote URL. GitHub Desktop relies on Git to perform all network related operations (such as cloning, fetching, and pushing). When a user attempts to clone a repository GitHub Desktop will invoke `git clone` and when Git encounters a remote which requires authentication it will request the credentials for that remote host from GitHub Desktop using the git-credential protocol. Using a maliciously crafted URL it's possible to cause the credential request coming from Git to be misinterpreted by Github Desktop such that it will send credentials for a different host than the host that Git is currently communicating with thereby allowing for secret exfiltration. GitHub username and OAuth token, or credentials for other Git remote hosts stored in GitHub Desktop could be improperly transmitted to an unrelated host. Users should update to GitHub Desktop 3.4.12 or greater which fixes this vulnerability. Users who suspect they may be affected should revoke any relevant credentials.

  ###### high

  In Yubico pam-u2f before 1.3.1, local privilege escalation can sometimes occur. This product implements a Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM) that can be deployed to support authentication using a YubiKey or other FIDO compliant authenticators on macOS or Linux. This software package has an issue that allows for an authentication bypass in some configurations. An attacker would require the ability to access the system as an unprivileged user. Depending on the configuration, the attacker may also need to know the user's password.

#### Description

curl before 7.86.0 has a double free. If curl is told to use an HTTP proxy for a transfer with a non-HTTP(S) URL, it sets up the connection to the remote server by issuing a CONNECT request to the proxy, and then tunnels the rest of the protocol through. An HTTP proxy might refuse this request (HTTP proxies often only allow outgoing connections to specific port numbers, like 443 for HTTPS) and instead return a non-200 status code to the client. Due to flaws in the error/cleanup handling, this could trigger a double free in curl if one of the following schemes were used in the URL for the transfer: dict, gopher, gophers, ldap, ldaps, rtmp, rtmps, or telnet. The earliest affected version is 7.77.0.

#### Description

In curl before 7.86.0, the HSTS check could be bypassed to trick it into staying with HTTP. Using its HSTS support, curl can be instructed to use HTTPS directly (instead of using an insecure cleartext HTTP step) even when HTTP is provided in the URL. This mechanism could be bypassed if the host name in the given URL uses IDN characters that get replaced with ASCII counterparts as part of the IDN conversion, e.g., using the character UTF-8 U+3002 (IDEOGRAPHIC FULL STOP) instead of the common ASCII full stop of U+002E (.). The earliest affected version is 7.77.0 2021-05-26.
