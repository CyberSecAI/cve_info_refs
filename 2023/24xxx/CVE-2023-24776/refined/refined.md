Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `Addon.php` file within the `funadmin` application. Specifically, the offline installation plugin functionality does not properly filter malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to achieve remote code execution by uploading a maliciously crafted plugin.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The core weakness is the absence of input validation or sanitization when handling plugin uploads. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary code through the plugin installation process.
*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The application allows uploading arbitrary files as plugins.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server where the application is hosted. This could lead to:
    *   Full system compromise
    *   Data breaches
    *   Malware installation
    *   Denial of service

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Plugin Upload:** The attacker constructs a specially crafted plugin containing malicious code.
*   **Offline Plugin Installation:** The attacker uploads this malicious plugin via the "offline installation" feature in the application's backend.
*   **Accessing the Malicious Plugin:** Once installed, accessing the plugin's entry point (e.g., `/addons/snowflake`) triggers the malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to the Application's Backend:** The attacker needs to have access to the application's backend with the necessary privileges to upload and install plugins.
*   **Ability to Construct Malicious Plugin:** The attacker must be capable of creating a malicious plugin that contains code to be executed on the server.
*   **Knowledge of Application Structure:** Knowledge of the application's plugin structure and naming conventions, such as controller paths, is needed to craft the exploit.

**Technical Details:**

*   The attacker created a plugin named "snowflake" with a controller `addons\snowflake\controller\Index.php`.
*   The controller's `index()` function contained the malicious code, in this case, `phpinfo()`, which when accessed will run the phpinfo command on the server.
*   The vulnerability is located in `app\backend\controller\Addon.php`.
*   The attacker uses the `/backend/ajax/uploads?save=1&path=addon` endpoint to upload the malicious plugin.
*   Then the `/backend/addon/localinstall` endpoint to install it.
*   Accessing `/addons/snowflake` triggers the execution of the malicious code.
