Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-24455:

**CVE-2023-24455**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `visualexpert` Plugin does not restrict the names of files in methods implementing form validation. This lack of restriction allows an attacker to specify an arbitrary file path.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Path traversal vulnerability
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can check for the existence of an attacker-specified file path on the Jenkins controller file system.
*   **Attack vectors:** Network-based. The attacker exploits the vulnerability via HTTP requests.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs `Item/Configure` permission within Jenkins.

**Summary of CVE-2023-24455 from the provided advisory:**

The `visualexpert` Plugin, up to version 1.3, is vulnerable to a path traversal issue. The plugin's form validation methods do not restrict file names, allowing users with `Item/Configure` permissions to check for the existence of arbitrary file paths on the Jenkins controller's file system. There is no fix available for this vulnerability at the time of the advisory publication.
