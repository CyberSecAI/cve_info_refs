{
  "CVE-2023-24435": {
    "Description": "GitHub Pull Request Builder Plugin 1.42.2 and earlier does not perform permission checks in methods implementing form validation.\n\nThis allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.\n\nAdditionally, these form validation methods do not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.",
    "Root cause": "Missing permission checks and CSRF vulnerability",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Missing permission checks",
      "CSRF vulnerability"
    ],
    "Impact": "Attackers with Overall/Read permission can capture credentials stored in Jenkins by connecting to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker can exploit the lack of permission checks and CSRF vulnerability in the form validation methods to connect to a malicious server and capture credentials.",
     "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs Overall/Read permission to exploit this vulnerability."
  }
