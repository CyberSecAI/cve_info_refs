The provided content describes a supply chain vulnerability affecting the `request` package in Python, specifically versions up to `6d48cd6` within the `MvcTools` project. This is not a vulnerability in GitHub itself, but rather a vulnerability within a project hosted on GitHub.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   A malicious backdoor was introduced into the `request` package dependency, which was listed in the `MvcTools/design/requirements.txt` file.
*   The malicious package was still available on some mirror sites despite being removed from PyPI.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Compromised dependency:** The `request` package contained malicious code within its `setup.py` file.
*   **Lack of dependency verification:** The project did not verify the integrity of the downloaded dependencies.
*   **Reliance on untrusted mirrors:** The use of mirror sites that may not be fully synchronized with PyPI could lead to the installation of outdated or malicious packages.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Remote code execution:** The malicious `setup.py` file executes arbitrary code when the package is installed.
*   **Trojan installation:** The malicious code downloads and installs a remote control Trojan (`_err.log`) on the victim's machine.
*   **Persistence:** The Trojan achieves persistence by adding malicious commands to the `.bashrc` file.
*   **Data theft:** The attacker can issue commands through the Trojan to steal sensitive information such as browser cookies and cryptocurrency account secrets.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Supply chain attack:**  By compromising the `request` package, attackers could infect anyone using the package as a dependency.
*   **Installation through compromised mirrors:** Attackers can leverage vulnerable mirrors to distribute the malicious package to unsuspecting users.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to compromise the `request` package on a mirror site.
*   The attacker needs to control the malicious code hosted at `dexy.top`.

**Additional notes:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by user `di1l0o`.
*   The maintainer initially dismissed the report but later closed the issue as completed, likely after addressing the vulnerability by suggesting to replace `request` with `requests` in `MvcTools/design/requirements.txt`
*   The provided mirror site `mirrors.neusoft.edu.cn` is provided as an example of vulnerable distribution site
