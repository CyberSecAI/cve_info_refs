# Permissive regex leads to domain filter bypass

## Package

pip

safeurl-python
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

1.0

## Patched versions

None

## Description

### Description

In SafeURL it is possible to specify a list of domains that should be matched before a request is sent out. The regex used to compare domains did not work as intended.

### Impact

The regex used was:

`re.match("(?i)^%s" % domain, value)`

This has two problems, first that only the beginning and not the end of the string is anchored. Second, that a dot in the domain matches any character as part of regex syntax.

Therefore, an allowlist of ["victim.com"] could allow the domain "victimacomattacker.com" to be requested.

This has lower impact since the usual attacker aim in an SSRF is to request internal resources such as private IP addresses rather than an attacker's own domain. But, in a case where SafeURL had specifically been used to try to limit requests to a particular allowlist, say for example a PDF renderer, the finding would be more severe.

### Patches

Fixed in [#5](https://github.com/IncludeSecurity/safeurl-python/pull/5)

### References

[Server-side request forgery (SSRF)](https://portswigger.net/web-security/ssrf)

### Severity

Low

### CVE ID

CVE-2023-24622

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
