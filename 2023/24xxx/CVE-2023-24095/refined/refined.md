- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `boa` binary of the TRENDNet TEW-820AP firmware. Specifically, the `send_redirect_perm` function copies an attacker-controlled `submit-url` parameter into a stack buffer using `sprintf`, without proper bounds checking.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack-based buffer overflow, Improper input validation
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote code execution (RCE) or denial of service (DoS). An attacker can overwrite parts of the stack and potentially execute arbitrary code.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to `/boafrm/formSystemCheck` with an overly long `submit-url` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the device's web interface and must be able to reach the `/boafrm/formSystemCheck` endpoint. This likely requires network access to the device.
