*   **Attack vectors:** Network-based. Attacker needs to trick a user into performing an action (CSRF).
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker requires Overall/Read permission in Jenkins.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to trick a user into performing a request that triggers the vulnerable functionality (CSRF).
