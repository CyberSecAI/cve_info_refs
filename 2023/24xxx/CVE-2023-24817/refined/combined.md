# Out of Bounds write in routing with SRH

High

[miri64](/miri64)
published
GHSA-xjgw-7638-29g5
May 30, 2023

## Package

RIOT-OS

## Affected versions

<= 2022.10

## Patched versions

2023.04

## Description

### Impact

RIOT-OS contains a network stack with the ability to process 6LoWPAN frames. An attacker can send a crafted frame to the device resulting in an integer underflow and out of bounds access in the packet buffer. Triggering the access at the right time will corrupt other packets or the allocator metadata. Corrupting a pointer will lead to denial of service.

### Patches

No public patches are available.

### Workarounds

* Disabling SRH in the network stack

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:

* Open an issue in [RIOT](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/issues)
* Email us at RIOT-security

### Bug Details

If RPL with SRH is used the next hop is read from an array of addresses.

The index calculation is susceptible to an integer underflow ([source](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/blob/ccbb304eae7b59e8aca24a6ffd095b5b3f7720ee/sys/net/gnrc/routing/rpl/srh/gnrc_rpl_srh.c#L78)):

```
    num_addr = (((rh->len * 8) - GNRC_RPL_SRH_PADDING(rh->pad_resv) -
                 (16 - GNRC_RPL_SRH_COMPRE(rh->compr))) /
                (16 - GNRC_RPL_SRH_COMPRI(rh->compr))) + 1;

```

If `rh->len` is zero the bug can be triggered and later cause an out of bounds access while the next routing address is fetched.

The next address to use is calculated based one `current_pos` without any additional bounds checks ([source](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/blob/ccbb304eae7b59e8aca24a6ffd095b5b3f7720ee/sys/net/gnrc/routing/rpl/srh/gnrc_rpl_srh.c#L98)):

```
    current_address = &addr_vec[(current_pos - 1) * compri_addr_len];
    memcpy(&addr.u8[pref_elided], current_address, addr_len);

```

The out of bounds access manifests as follows:

1. Calculate `current_address` which is out of bounds from `addr_vec`
2. `memcpy` from `current_address` to `addr`
3. Some checks are preformed with `addr`
4. `memcpy` from `addr` to `current_address`

During step 3 a interrupt can occur and change the content of `current_address`.

Then step 4 overwrites `current_address` again destroying the new contents.

This can lead to corrupted pointers, resulting in a crash.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
