The provided content contains information about multiple vulnerabilities in OX App Suite, including CVE-2023-24601.

**CVE-2023-24601**

*   **Root cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-provided input within the "registry" sub-tree of the jslob API. This allowed users to inject arbitrary references, including malicious code.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS) - CWE-80. The application fails to properly sanitize user-provided input leading to XSS.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow attackers to execute malicious script code within the victim's context. This can lead to session hijacking or triggering unwanted actions via the web interface and API.
*   **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting malicious code via non-app deeplinks, specifically the "registry" sub-tree within the jslob API.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would require temporary access to the user's account or lure a user to a compromised account to inject the malicious code.
