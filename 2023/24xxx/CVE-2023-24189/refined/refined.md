The provided content relates to CVE-2023-24189.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of XML data within the `com.bstek.urule.console.servlet.flow.RuleFlowDesignerServletHandler.java` file, specifically in the `parseXml` method. The code directly reads XML data without disabling external entity parsing.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary vulnerability is an XML External Entity (XXE) injection vulnerability. The application fails to disable external entity processing when parsing XML data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to:
    - Read arbitrary files on the server's operating system.
    - Perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) to probe internal network resources.
    - Conduct Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks by utilizing recursively defined entities.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves sending a specially crafted XML payload containing external entity declarations to the server. The payload can be sent via HTTP POST requests to the /urule/ruleflowdesigner/saveFlowDefinition endpoint during the saving of a decision flow, and then triggered by loading the flow via /urule/ruleflowdesigner/loadFlowDefinition.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints of the application. No specific user privileges are mentioned as required for this exploitation, suggesting any user or unauthenticated request can potentially trigger the vulnerability.
