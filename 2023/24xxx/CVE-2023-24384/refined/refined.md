- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress Organization Chart plugin (<= 1.4.4) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary vulnerability is CSRF.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The impact varies depending on the specific actions the plugin allows.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a crafted request that is triggered by a logged-in user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user (with higher privileges) to execute an unwanted action, such as by clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious page, while they have an active session on the vulnerable website.
