- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to an out-of-bounds read when parsing specially crafted PAR files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: By tricking a user into opening a malicious PAR file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to create a specially crafted PAR file and get the user to open it with the vulnerable software.
