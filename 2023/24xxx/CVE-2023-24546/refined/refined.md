Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
Improper access controls in the CloudVision Portal authorization layer allow unauthorized access to telemetry and configuration data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-284: Improper Access Control:** The core issue is a lack of proper checks on user permissions when accessing CloudVision database.
-  Specifically, a bug in the authorization layer granted certain types of clients read access to additional parts of the CloudVision database (2021.1 and 2021.2 releases), and later write access (2021.3, 2022.1.0, 2022.1.1, 2022.2.0, 2022.2.1, and 2022.3.0 releases) that they should not have had.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Data Access:** Attackers can read sensitive telemetry and configuration data within the CloudVision system.
- **Configuration Manipulation:** In later affected versions (2021.3 onwards), attackers can also write to the CloudVision database, potentially modifying configurations.
- **System Compromise:** By gaining broader access, an attacker can potentially cause damage, disrupt services, or further compromise the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** Attackers need network access to the CloudVision cluster.
- **Account Credentials:** The attacker needs valid credentials for a specific type of account to leverage the vulnerability, the type of account is not specified.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Proximity:** Must have network connectivity to the CloudVision Portal.
- **Valid Credentials:**  Must possess valid login credentials for a specific type of CloudVision user account.

**Additional Details:**
- The severity of the vulnerability varies based on the CloudVision release and the original version used to deploy the cluster. 
- Systems initially deployed with 2022.2.0 or 2022.2.1 are most vulnerable, receiving a CVSS score of 10.0.
- The vulnerability only affects on-premise deployments of CloudVision Portal, and doesn't impact CloudVision as-a-Service.
- There are no known indicators of compromise for this vulnerability.
- Upgrading to the fixed versions of CloudVision Portal (2022.1.2, 2022.2.2, or 2022.3.1) is the recommended fix.
