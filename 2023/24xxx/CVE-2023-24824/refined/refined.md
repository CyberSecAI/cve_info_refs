{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from two polynomial time complexity issues in cmark-gfm. Specifically, the parser's handling of nested block structures and blank lines could lead to excessive resource consumption.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Quadratic time complexity issues in the parsing logic. The parser exhibited inefficient handling of nested block structures and empty lines, resulting in a quadratic increase in processing time with larger inputs.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A successful attack leads to unbounded resource exhaustion and a denial of service (DoS). The vulnerability can be exploited by providing crafted input that triggers the inefficient parsing logic, causing the application to become unresponsive.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by providing specifically crafted markdown text as input to the cmark-gfm parser. The provided proof-of-concept examples show how input strings with nested block structures and a large number of blank lines can trigger the vulnerability.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to provide input to an application or service using the vulnerable cmark-gfm parser. No special capabilities are required other than the ability to send text data to the parser."
