{
  "CVE-2023-24603": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application did not enforce size limits for external content during data transfer.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400)"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker-controlled resource (e.g., iCal feed) could return excessive data, causing the system to download it fully before applying size checks. This could potentially be used to amplify denial-of-service (DoS) attacks on other services.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker-controlled resource such as an iCal feed.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to control a resource accessed by the application."
