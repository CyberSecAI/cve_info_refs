- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Stored cross-site scripting (XSS)
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper input sanitization or encoding when handling user-supplied data within the web management console of the affected Buffalo network devices allows for the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with access to the web management console can inject and store malicious JavaScript code that will be executed when a legitimate user accesses the web interface. This can lead to various malicious actions including but not limited to unauthorized data access or manipulation within the context of the legitimate user's session.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker needs to have access to the web management console to inject the malicious JavaScript. The malicious script is stored and executed when another legitimate user accesses the web interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have low-level access to the web management console of the affected Buffalo network device, and a separate user must access the interface after the injection for the XSS to trigger.
