  "CVE-2023-24422": {
    "description": "Script Security Plugin provides a sandbox feature that allows low privileged users to define scripts, including Pipelines, that are generally safe to execute. Calls to code defined inside a sandboxed script are intercepted, and various allowlists are checked to determine whether the call is to be allowed. In Script Security Plugin 1228.vd93135a_2fb_25 and earlier, property assignments performed implicitly by the Groovy language runtime when invoking map constructors were not intercepted by the sandbox.",
    "root_cause": "Property assignments performed implicitly by the Groovy language runtime when invoking map constructors were not intercepted by the sandbox.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Sandbox bypass"

    "impact": "Attackers with permission to define and run sandboxed scripts, including Pipelines, to bypass the sandbox protection and execute arbitrary code in the context of the Jenkins controller JVM.",
    "attack_vectors": "By defining and running sandboxed scripts, including Pipelines.",
