- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to an out-of-bounds read when parsing specially crafted PAR files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application contains an out-of-bounds read past the end of an allocated structure.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by opening a specially crafted PAR file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious PAR file using the affected application.
