# Integer Underflow during defragmentation

High

[chrysn](/chrysn)
published
GHSA-2fpr-82xr-p887
Apr 24, 2023

## Package

RIOT-OS

## Affected versions

< 2022.10

## Patched versions

2022.10

## Description

### Impact

RIOT-OS contains a network stack with the ability to process 6LoWPAN frames. An attacker can send a crafted frame to the device resulting in a large out of bounds write beyond the packet buffer. The write will create a hard fault exception after reaching the last page of RAM. The hard fault is not handled and the system will be stuck until reset. Thus the impact is denial of service.

### Patches

* [master](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/pull/18817/commits/9728f727e75d7d78dbfb5918e0de1b938b7b6d2c)
* [2022.10](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/pull/18820/commits/bd31010231f5340e21410595dd95afc86bbfd341)

### Workarounds

* Disabling support for fragmented IP datagrams, or
* Backport the patches listed above

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:

* Open an issue in [RIOT](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/issues)
* Email us at RIOT-security

### Bug Details

In `_6lo_frag_size` the fragment size is calculated as `frag_size = pkt->size - sizeof(sixlowpan_frag_n_t);` ([source](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/blob/2022.07-branch/sys/net/gnrc/network_layer/sixlowpan/frag/rb/gnrc_sixlowpan_frag_rb.c#L234)).

`sizeof(sixlowpan_frag_n_t)` is 4 bytes but `pkt->size` can be less resulting in an integer underflow.

`_rbuf_add` later uses this value as size argument for memcpy ([source](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/blob/2022.07-branch/sys/net/gnrc/network_layer/sixlowpan/frag/rb/gnrc_sixlowpan_frag_rb.c#L469)).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
