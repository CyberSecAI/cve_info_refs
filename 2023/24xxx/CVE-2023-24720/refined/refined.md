- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Readium cloud reader uses iframes to display EPUB content, but these iframes lack the sandbox attribute. Additionally, the reader loads content using blob URLs, which inherit the origin of the parent page. This allows scripts within the iframe to execute with the same origin as the parent page. Furthermore, the reader doesn't enforce a Content Security Policy.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Lack of iframe sandboxing: The iframes used to display EPUB content do not have the `sandbox` attribute set, allowing scripts within the iframe to execute with the same permissions as the parent page.
    - Insecure blob URL handling: The use of `blob:` URLs for iframe content causes the iframe to inherit the origin of the parent page, enabling script execution in the context of the parent page's domain.
    - Absence of Content Security Policy (CSP): The reader does not implement a CSP, failing to restrict where scripts can be loaded from.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Stored XSS: A malicious user can upload a specially crafted EPUB containing JavaScript. When other users open the malicious EPUB, the JavaScript will execute, potentially compromising their accounts.
    - Reflected XSS: By using a specially crafted URL containing the malicious payload in the `epub` parameter, an attacker can trigger arbitrary JavaScript execution when a user clicks the malicious URL.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Uploading a malicious EPUB file to an online library using Readium.
    - Providing a malicious URL with the `epub` parameter pointing to an attacker controlled resource.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - For stored XSS: Ability to upload EPUB files to a vulnerable online library.
    - For reflected XSS: Ability to craft a malicious URL and convince a user to click on the link.
