Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-24133:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a stack buffer overflow in the Jensen of Scandinavia Eagle 1200AC router firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stack Buffer Overflow:** The `wepkey_5g` parameter, received from user input, is stored in `wl5g.extra.wep_key` without proper length checks. When the value from `wl5g.extra.wep_key` is copied to a stack buffer `wifi_buf_entry`, if the input string `wepkey_5g` is too long it overwrites memory beyond the stack buffer boundaries causing a crash.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The firmware fails to validate the length of the user-supplied `wepkey_5g` string before using it in memory operations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The stack overflow leads to a crash of the device, causing a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/WifiBasicSet` endpoint with an overly long value for the `wepkey_5g` parameter and then triggering a call to `/goform/WifiBasicGet`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable router's web interface.
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to make the necessary requests.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided content includes a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) Python script that demonstrates how to exploit this vulnerability.
- The vulnerable device is identified as "Jensen of Scandinavia Eagle 1200AC V15.03.06.33_en".
- The PoC script logs into the router using default credentials, sets an overly long `wepkey_5g` and then fetches config through `/goform/WifiBasicGet` which will cause a crash.
- The overflow happens when a long `wepkey_5g` value is loaded from `wl5g.extra.wep_key` to stack buffer `wifi_buf_entry`.
