Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is a Host Header Injection vulnerability in the Plesk Obsidian login page. The application does not properly validate the Host header provided in the HTTP request, allowing an attacker to manipulate it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Host Header Injection:** The application trusts the value in the "Host" header without proper sanitization or validation.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** Insufficient validation of the "Host" HTTP request header allows an attacker to inject a malicious domain.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Redirection to Malicious Site:** Attackers can redirect users from the legitimate login page to a malicious login page controlled by the attacker.
- **Phishing:** The attacker can potentially steal user credentials by displaying a fake login page to unsuspecting users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP "Host" Header Manipulation:** The attack vector involves modifying the "Host" header in an HTTP request to a malicious domain.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Intercept HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify HTTP requests, typically through a proxy tool like Burp Suite or a similar man-in-the-middle setup.
- **Knowledge of Target Application:** The attacker needs to know the target application's login page path (`/login.php` in this case).

**Additional details from the content:**
- The vulnerability affects Plesk Obsidian versions 18.0.49 and below.
- The provided steps for exploitation involve intercepting the `login.php` request and changing the `Host` header value to a malicious site.
- The content also includes a link to a Medium article with screenshots and a PoC video, which provides further detail.
- There's a mention that the vendor declined the vulnerability, along with a link to the vendor's support article.
