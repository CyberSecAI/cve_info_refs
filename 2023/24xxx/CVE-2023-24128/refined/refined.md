Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-24128:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the Jensen of Scandinavia Eagle 1200AC router firmware due to insufficient bounds checking on the `wepkey2` parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Stack overflow:** The `wepkey2` parameter's value, which is user-controlled, is copied into a fixed-size stack buffer (`wifi_buf_entry`) without proper length validation during the `WifiBasicGet` operation.
- **Lack of input validation:** The firmware does not check the length of the `wepkey2` parameter before copying it to the stack buffer.
- **Unsafe data handling:** The use of `SetValue` to store the string from `wepkey2` to  `wl2g.extra.wep_key2` and then using it to copy it to stack buffer `wifi_buf_entry`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrates that sending a large string via the `wepkey2` parameter can cause a stack overflow when processed by the `/goform/WifiBasicGet` endpoint, which can lead to a crash of the device and therefore a DoS. It's implied that further exploitation might allow remote code execution but this is not explicitly stated in this document.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP POST request:** The attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/WifiBasicSet` endpoint with a large string for the `wepkey2` parameter, followed by a request to `/goform/WifiBasicGet`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable router. This likely means they need to be on the same network as the router, or have access to it through a forwarded port or other means.
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to authenticate to the routerâ€™s admin interface. The provided exploit uses credentials `admin` and a hashed password. It also retrieves the password hash.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable endpoints and parameter:** The attacker needs to know about the vulnerable `/goform/WifiBasicSet` and `/goform/WifiBasicGet` endpoints and the `wepkey2` parameter.

**Additional notes:**
- The provided information includes a proof-of-concept Python script that demonstrates the vulnerability by overflowing the buffer by sending a large string of 'A' characters, which causes a crash on the device.
