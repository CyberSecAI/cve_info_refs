# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2023-1718

## Milesight UR32L urvpn\_client http\_connection\_readcb stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability

##### July 6, 2023

##### CVE Number

CVE-2023-24019

##### SUMMARY

A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the urvpn\_client http\_connection\_readcb functionality of Milesight UR32L v32.3.0.5. A specially crafted network packet can lead to a buffer overflow. An attacker can send a malicious packet to trigger this vulnerability.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

Milesight UR32L v32.3.0.5

##### PRODUCT URLS

UR32L - <https://www.milesight-iot.com/cellular/router/ur32l/>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

8.1 - CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

##### CWE

CWE-120 - Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input (‘Classic Buffer Overflow’)

##### DETAILS

The Milesight UR32L is an industrial cellular router. The router features include support for multiple VPNs, a router console shell, firewall and many others.

The router offers a service called Milesight VPN, a VPN service that will connect to the Milesight VPN software. The vulnerability described in this report requires this service to be enabled by the admin, as it is disabled by default. The binary client used for this service is `urvpn_client`. This binary will connect to the specified Milesight VPN server. The first request is used to “authenticate” the router to the server. Essentially, the router will send information about itself to the server. After the request, the `http_connection_readcb` function will be executed to read the response of the server. Following the `http_connection_readcb` function:

```
void http_connection_readcb(undefined4 param_1,http_connection *connection)

{
  [... variable declaration ...]

  [...]
  associated_request = connection->associated_request;
  input_obj = bufferevent_get_input(param_1);
  evbuffer_search_eol(auStack_f0,input_obj,0,&line_length,1);
  tmp = (char *)evbuffer_get_length(input_obj);
  response_body_len = associated_request->content_size;
  inbody = associated_request->inbody;
  status = associated_request->status;
  iVar4 = line_length;
  log_message("httptransport.c",0x152,"http_connection_readcb",0,
              "libevent begin : http input receive size %d, req->response_body_len %d,
              req->inbody % d, req->status %d line_length %d"
              ,tmp,response_body_len,inbody,status,line_length);
  if (((int)associated_request->content_size < 1) && (line_length == 0)) {
    log_message("httptransport.c",0x156,"http_connection_readcb",0,"Did not receive enough data",tmp
                ,response_body_len,inbody,status,iVar4);
    log_message("httptransport.c",0x157,"http_connection_readcb",0,"Did not receive enough data");
    return;
  }
  if (associated_request->content_size == 0xffffffff) {
    log_message("httptransport.c",0x15e,"http_connection_readcb",1,
                "req->response_body_len == -1, this is a fresh request, handle response header",tmp,
                response_body_len,inbody,status,iVar4);
    input_line = (char *)evbuffer_readln(input_obj,0,1);                                                [1]
    log_message("httptransport.c",0x165,"http_connection_readcb",0,"line %s",input_line);
    iVar1 = sscanf(input_line,"HTTP/%d.%d %d %s",http_major_version,http_minor_version,
                   &http_status_code,http_status_message);                                              [2]
    if (iVar1 < 1) {
      log_message("httptransport.c",0x169,"http_connection_readcb",3,"Couldn\'t parse HTTP response"
                 );
      probably_free_associated_req(&connection->associated_request,&associated_request);
      free(input_line);
      return;
    }
    free(input_line);
    associated_request->status = http_status_code;
    associated_request->content_size = 0;
  }
  [...]
}

```

At `[1]` the first line of the response is fetched, then at `[2]` is parsed, expecting to be of the `HTTP/%d.%d %d %s` form. So, the protocol version is parsed, as well as the status code and the status message. For containing the status message, the `http_status_message` stack buffer is used. Because no check is performed against the line received at `[1]`, and because the `http_status_message` buffer is only 52 bytes long, this function is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow that can occur at `[2]`.

Because HTTPS is used for the connection to the server, it would seems impossible to man-in-the-middle this communication. Because of TALOS-2023-1705 this is actually possible because the client does not verify the server.

##### VENDOR RESPONSE

Since the maintainer of this software did not release a patch during the 90 day window specified in our policy, we have now decided to release the information regarding this vulnerability, to make users of the software aware of this problem.
