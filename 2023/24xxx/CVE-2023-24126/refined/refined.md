Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-24126:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a stack buffer overflow in the Jensen Eagle 1200AC router's firmware.
*   Specifically, the `wepkey4_5g` parameter, which is user-controlled, is copied into a stack buffer named `wifi_buf_entry` without proper length checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stack Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a classic stack buffer overflow. By providing an overly long string to the `wepkey4_5g` parameter, an attacker can overwrite data on the stack.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The software lacks proper input validation for the `wepkey4_5g` parameter. The code does not check the length of the input before copying it into the stack buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact mentioned is a denial of service. By overflowing the stack buffer, an attacker can crash the device, rendering it unusable.
*   **Potential for Remote Code Execution (RCE):** While not explicitly stated, a stack buffer overflow vulnerability often has the potential to be exploited for remote code execution. With more sophisticated techniques, an attacker could potentially overwrite the return address on the stack and gain control of the device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector involves sending an HTTP POST request to the `/goform/WifiBasicSet` endpoint with a malicious payload in the `wepkey4_5g` parameter. A subsequent request to `/goform/WifiBasicGet` triggers the overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable router. Typically, this would be within the local network where the router is connected or, depending on the configuration, potentially via an exposed management interface on the WAN side.
*   **Authentication:** The attacker must be authenticated as an admin on the router to exploit this vulnerability. The provided proof of concept (PoC) script shows how to log in using default credentials.

**Additional Details:**

* The vulnerable parameter is `wepkey4_5g` and it is used in the function `formWifiBasicGet`. The data is stored in the `wl5g.extra.wep_key4` variable when the `/goform/WifiBasicSet` action is called.
* The vulnerable device is the Jensen Eagle 1200AC V15.03.06.33\_en
