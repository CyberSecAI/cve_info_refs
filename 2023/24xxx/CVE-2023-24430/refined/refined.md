Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2023-24430:

**CVE-2023-24430**

*   **Vulnerability:** XXE vulnerability on agents in Semantic Versioning Plugin
*   **Root Cause:** The Semantic Versioning Plugin's XML parser is not configured to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.
*   **Weakness:** The plugin does not disable external entity resolution, which allows an attacker to inject malicious XML.
*   **Impact:** Attackers who can control the content of the version file for the "Determine Semantic Version" build step can have agent processes parse a crafted file that uses external entities. This could lead to:
    *   Extraction of secrets from the Jenkins agent.
    *   Server-side request forgery (SSRF).
*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker manipulates the content of the XML version file used by the "Determine Semantic Version" build step.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must have the ability to control the XML file used by the "Determine Semantic Version" build step
    *  Ability to control agent processes and their environment.
*   **Affected Plugin:** Semantic Versioning Plugin
*   **Affected Versions:** 1.14 and earlier
*   **Fixed Version:** 1.15
*   **Mitigation:** Upgrade to Semantic Versioning Plugin 1.15, which disables external entity resolution for its XML parser.

**Additional Notes**
*   The vulnerability is considered to have a real impact in very narrow circumstances, specifically when attackers can control XML files, but are unable to change build steps, Jenkinsfiles, or other test code executed on agents.
*  This is due to an incomplete fix of a previous vulnerability (SECURITY-2124)
