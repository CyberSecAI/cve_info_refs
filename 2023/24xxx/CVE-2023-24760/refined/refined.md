Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `respwd` method within `SysUserController` of OFCMS v1.1.4. The application directly uses the provided `user_id` parameter in the request to modify a user's password without verifying if the user initiating the request has the authority to modify the password of the target `user_id`. There is no validation or check to confirm if the user sending the request is the same user that is being modified.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The `user_id` parameter is directly used to specify which user's password is to be changed without any authorization check or validation if the user is authorized to modify that other user's password.
    *   **Lack of Authentication/Authorization:** The application does not verify if the logged-in user has the right to modify the password of the user specified by the `user_id`. The server-side logic relies solely on the `user_id` sent in the request.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A remote attacker, even with a low-privileged or normal account, can modify the password of any other user, including administrator accounts, leading to privilege escalation and full control of the application. The attacker can log in as the target user and take over their account privileges
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Remote Exploitation:** The attack can be performed remotely over the network.
    *   **Manipulated HTTP Request:** The attacker needs to intercept the password change request, modify the `user_id` parameter to the target user's `user_id`, and then send the manipulated request.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have an account on the affected system, even a low privileged one.
    *   The attacker must know or have access to a valid `user_id`, such as a normal user's ID and the admin ID in this case.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify HTTP requests.

**Summary:**

The provided content details a critical vulnerability in OFCMS v1.1.4 that allows an attacker to change any user's password, including the administrator account, by exploiting the lack of proper authorization checks in the `respwd` method of `SysUserController`. This issue enables a remote attacker with any normal user account to perform privilege escalation.
