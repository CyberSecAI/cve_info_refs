Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   Improper privilege management in Arista EOS on modular platforms with redundant supervisor modules configured for RPR or SSO.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   An unprivileged user can log in to the standby supervisor module as a root user, which leads to privilege escalation.
*   The vulnerability exists due to the way user authentication is handled on standby supervisor modules when RPR or SSO is configured.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker with valid, low-privilege user credentials can gain full root access on the standby supervisor module.
*   **System Compromise:** Root access allows an attacker to perform any action on the affected system, including changing configurations, disrupting services, accessing sensitive data, and potentially pivoting to other systems.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have network access to the device and a valid user account (non-root).
*   **Redundant Supervisor Modules:** The target switch must have two supervisor modules installed and active.
*   **Redundancy Protocol:** The switch must be configured with RPR or SSO for supervisor redundancy.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to connect to the network where the affected Arista switch is located.
*   **Valid User Credentials:** The attacker must have valid login credentials for a user account on the switch. This account does not need to have administrative privileges.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker must be aware of the vulnerability and how to exploit it, which involves logging into the standby supervisor module.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is tracked by BUG 723401.
*   Arista acknowledges Marc-André Labonté from Desjardins for reporting the vulnerability.
*   A hotfix is available for specific vulnerable versions, and upgrading to patched versions is the primary recommendation.
*   The advisory provides a workaround using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to disable the “ssh” command in unprivileged mode.
*   The vulnerability is specific to modular switches with redundant supervisors.
* The CVSSv3.1 Base Score is 9.3 (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)
