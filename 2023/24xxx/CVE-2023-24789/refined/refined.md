The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in Jeecg 3.4.4, specifically within the building block report functionality.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization or parameterization of user-supplied input within the SQL query construction process. Specifically, when creating a new SQL data set in the report design feature, the user can inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The core vulnerability is SQL injection. The application directly incorporates the user's input into an SQL query without validation or sanitization, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-   **Information Disclosure:** By injecting SQL code, an attacker can retrieve sensitive information from the database. In the given example, the attacker retrieves database schema information (SCHEMA_NAME) from the information_schema.SCHEMATA table, revealing names of all databases on the mysql server.
-   **Data Manipulation:** Beyond information disclosure, SQL injection can be leveraged to modify, insert or delete data from the database.
-   **Potential Complete System Compromise:** Depending on the database user privileges, an attacker might gain complete control over the database server, and potentially the entire application server.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the report design feature, specifically the new SQL data set creation option, where users can input a malicious SQL payload.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the necessary privileges to access the visual design menu and report design feature within the application. The example uses the default system account password.
-   **Knowledge of the Application:** The attacker needs to know the application interface (report design) and where to insert the malicious payload. The example uses the following SQL:
`select * from sys_user WHERE id='' union SELECT 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,(select group_concat(SCHEMA_NAME) from information_schema.SCHEMATA)`
