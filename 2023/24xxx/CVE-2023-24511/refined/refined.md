- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A specially crafted SNMP packet can trigger a memory leak in the `snmpd` process on affected Arista EOS platforms. This is due to a missing release of memory after its effective lifetime (CWE-401).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the `snmpd` process's handling of specific SNMP packets, leading to a memory leak.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The memory leak can cause the `snmpd` process to terminate, resulting in SNMP request timeouts. In severe cases, it could lead to memory resource exhaustion for other processes on the switch. The vulnerability has no confidentiality or integrity impacts to the system.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is a network-based attack involving a specially crafted SNMP packet.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs the ability to send SNMP packets to the affected device with a specific malformed structure.
