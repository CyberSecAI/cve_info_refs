Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-24121

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a stack buffer overflow. It occurs due to a lack of proper length validation when handling the `security_5g` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stack Buffer Overflow:** The application copies a user-controlled string (`security_5g`) into a fixed-size stack buffer (`wifi_buf_entry`) without checking its length.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application fails to validate the length of the `security_5g` parameter before copying it into the buffer, making it vulnerable to overflow attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  By providing a large string for `security_5g`, an attacker can overflow the stack buffer leading to a crash and denial of service for the device. While the provided PoC only shows a crash, it is theoretically possible to achieve remote code execution as well.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Requests:** The attacker sends crafted HTTP POST requests to two specific endpoints: `/goform/WifiBasicSet` and `/goform/WifiBasicGet`. The first sets the oversized value, while the second triggers the stack overflow when reading the value.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the device's web interface.
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to authenticate with the device to be able to set and get the parameter value. This is done by using the hardcoded credentials `admin`/`81dc9bdb52d04dc20036dbd8313ed055` which are provided in the Proof of Concept.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable software is Jensen of Scandinavia Eagle 1200AC V15.03.06.33\_en.
- The overflow occurs when processing data within the `formWifiBasicGet` function.
- The `security_5g` parameter is initially set using the `formWifiBasicSet` endpoint which stores the value in `wl5g.extra.security`, and then later read and used by `formWifiBasicGet` which copies the data to the vulnerable stack buffer.
