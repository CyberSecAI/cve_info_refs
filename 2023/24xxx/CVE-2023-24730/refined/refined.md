The vulnerability is located in the user profile update function, specifically through the 'company' parameter in the 'get-quote.php' page. \n\nRoot cause of vulnerability: The application does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. \n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The primary weakness is the lack of input sanitization which leads to SQL injection vulnerability. \n\nImpact of exploitation: Exploiting this vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass authentication and authorization, retrieve sensitive data from the database, modify or delete data, execute arbitrary commands on the database server, and potentially gain complete control of the server. \n\nAttack vectors: The attack vector is through a web-based SQL injection on the 'get-quote.php' page using a crafted payload in the 'company' parameter. \n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to have a valid user account to access the quote request page. They also need to be able to intercept and modify the HTTP requests, typically through a proxy tool like Burp Suite, and have the knowledge of SQLi techniques to craft the attack."
