- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to an out-of-bounds write past the end of an allocated buffer while parsing a specially crafted SPP file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds write (CWE-787).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local (AV:L), requiring the user to open a malicious SPP file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a user into opening a specially crafted SPP file. No special privileges are required (PR:N), but user interaction (UI:R) is needed.
