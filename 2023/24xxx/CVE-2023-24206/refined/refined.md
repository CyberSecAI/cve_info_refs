The provided content is related to CVE-2023-24206.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by using `$` as a splice character in the `edp.davinci.dao.DisplayMapper#selectMaxNameOrderByName` function which leads to SQL injection. The `selectMaxNameOrderByName` function is used in `edp.davinci.service.impl.DisplayServiceImpl#copyDisplay`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability exists in the `edp.davinci.dao.DisplayMapper#selectMaxNameOrderByName` function due to unsanitized input being used in SQL queries.
- The usage of `$` as a splice character is identified as the specific weakness, allowing for injection.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries. This can result in unauthorized access to data, modification of data, or potentially taking over the entire database.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `copyDisplay` function which utilizes the vulnerable `selectMaxNameOrderByName` function. 
- The injection point is within the SQL query constructed in the `selectMaxNameOrderByName` method within the `DisplayMapper`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to invoke the `copyDisplay` function with malicious input.
- The attacker must have the ability to pass malicious data that will eventually be processed by the vulnerable SQL query.
