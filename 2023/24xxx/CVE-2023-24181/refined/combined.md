## Package

/luci-app-openvpn/luasrc/view/openvpn/pageswitch.htm
(OpenWRT LuCI)

## Affected versions

OpenWrt 22.03.3

## Patched versions

None

## Description

### Impact

An attacker can send this URL with a malicious payload to genuine Luci user which can lead to execution of payload on Luci console. It can lead to session hijacking attacks. The vulnerability can further help attackers to bypass protection mechanism like same origin policy (CSP) and Anti-CSRF tokens.

### Proof of Concept

1. Login to Luci Console using valid credentials.
2. Paste below payload in Browser window.

Payload: `<img src=a onerror=alert('xss')>`

[https://{your-luci-ip}/cgi-bin/luci/root/vpn/openvpn/basic/sample\_serverjyo69%3Cimg%20src%3da%20onerror%3dalert('xss')%3Ezja1d](https://%7Byour-luci-ip%7D/cgi-bin/luci/root/vpn/openvpn/basic/sample_serverjyo69%3Cimg%20src%3Da%20onerror%3Dalert%28%27xss%27%29%3Ezja1d)

You will see JavaScript being executed and XSS pop-up will appear. Please find attached Proof of concept video for more details.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
