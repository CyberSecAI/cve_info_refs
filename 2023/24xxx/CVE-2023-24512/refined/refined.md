Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   Improper access control in the gNMI interface of the Streaming Telemetry Agent (TerminAttr) in Arista EOS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-284 Improper Access Control:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient access control checks within the gNMI interface of the TerminAttr agent. This allows an authenticated user with gNMI access to send specially crafted requests that can modify arbitrary configurations within the switch, even if they shouldn't have the required permissions to do so.
*   The vulnerability is present when gNMI access is configured on the TerminAttr agent for external connections, typically used for streaming to 3rd party systems, not by default when streaming to CloudVision.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can make unauthorized configuration changes on the affected Arista EOS devices.
*   This could potentially disrupt network operations, cause denial-of-service, or enable further malicious activities. The impact is categorized as High in terms of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (C:H/I:H/A:H).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Network-based attack.
*   The attacker must have authorized access to the gNMI interface on the switch where TerminAttr is enabled.
*   The attacker needs to craft malicious gNMI requests to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated user:** The attacker must possess valid credentials to access the gNMI interface on the affected device.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the affected Arista EOS device and be able to send gNMI requests.
*   **Knowledge of the gNMI protocol:** The attacker needs to understand the gNMI protocol and craft malicious requests to modify configurations.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is tracked internally by Arista as BUG751697.
*   The advisory provides specific instructions on how to check if a device is vulnerable, including commands to verify the TerminAttr version and configuration.
*   The advisory includes mitigation steps to configure TerminAttr in gRPC read-only mode (-grpcreadonly), effectively preventing the exploitation of this vulnerability.
*   The recommended long term solution is to upgrade to a fixed version of either the TerminAttr agent or the EOS itself.
*   The advisory lists specific affected and unaffected platforms and software versions.
