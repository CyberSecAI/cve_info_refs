- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The XenForum module for PrestaShop fails to properly sanitize SQL parameters in multiple functions, specifically within `XenForumAttachment::getListAttachments()`, `XenForumCat`, `XenForumPost`, and related classes. This lack of sanitization allows for the injection of arbitrary SQL code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Multiple instances of improper neutralization of SQL parameters, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities (CWE-89). The vulnerable code uses `implode` to create SQL queries with unsanitized input, making it susceptible to injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to:
    - Technical and personal data leaks.
    - Obtaining admin access.
    - Removal of all data from the linked PrestaShop.
    - Display of sensitive tables in the front office, potentially unlocking admin's ajax scripts of modules protected by token.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks, specifically through HTTP calls to the vulnerable module.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be an authenticated user.
    - The attacker needs low privileges within the application.
    - No user interaction is required for exploitation.
