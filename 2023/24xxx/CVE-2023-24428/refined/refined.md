    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
    ],
    "impact": "Attackers can trick users into logging into the attacker's account.",
    "attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by tricking a user to visit a malicious website or link that initiates an OAuth flow without the state parameter, effectively logging the victim in to the attacker controlled account on the Jenkins server.",
    "attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to trick a user to initiate the authentication flow."
