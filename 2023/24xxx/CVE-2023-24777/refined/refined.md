The provided content is related to CVE-2023-24777.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by direct concatenation of user-supplied `id` parameter into an SQL query without sanitization in the `app\databases\controller\table.php#list` method.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `list` method of the `table.php` controller.
- Lack of input sanitization for the `id` parameter which leads to direct embedding of the input into the query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or complete system compromise.
- In this specific example, the attacker uses a `UNION ALL SELECT` to extract the database user, demonstrating the ability to read sensitive data.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request to `/databases/table/list` endpoint with a crafted `id` parameter containing SQL injection payload.
- Attackers can send a crafted POST request with a SQL injection payload in the `id` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable application.
- No specific authentication seems necessary for the initial exploit.
- Knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint `/databases/table/list` and the parameter name `id` is required to exploit the vulnerability.
