Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2023-24984:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to an out-of-bounds write past the end of an allocated buffer while parsing a specially crafted SPP file.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The core vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787).
*  **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process. This could potentially lead to complete system compromise.
*   **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves a user opening a malicious SPP file using the affected application.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious SPP file. They do not need to be in any special network position and can simply provide the file to the user.

The document provides more detail than the typical CVE description, including the specific CWE (CWE-787), the CVSS vector, and the fact that it is one of multiple vulnerabilities stemming from similar issues in SPP file parsing.
