Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-24758:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A NULL pointer dereference exists in the `ff_hevc_put_weighted_pred_avg_8_sse` function within the `sse-motion.cc` file of libde265.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference** - The code attempts to access memory via a pointer that is NULL, leading to a crash.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation results in a crash of the software due to the NULL pointer dereference. This makes the software unavailable for legitimate users.

**Attack vectors:**
- A crafted input file is required to trigger the vulnerability. The specific nature of this input file isn't described in detail but it's intended to cause the vulnerable function to dereference a NULL pointer.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply the vulnerable software with a specially crafted input file. The attacker does not need any special privileges on the local system to cause the crash. User interaction is required to open/process the malicious file.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
- The vulnerability was found in `libde265 v1.0.10`.
- A patch is available in commit `bfb6de155f9fb015d2904cb4ef07809f17995276` of the `strukturag/libde265` repository on GitHub.
- A Debian LTS advisory (DLA 3352-1) addresses the vulnerability by updating the package to `1.0.11-0+deb10u4`.
- The issue is triggered in the `_mm_storel_epi64` instruction, which is part of the SSE intrinsics.
- The crash occurs when trying to write to an address (0x0) that corresponds to a null pointer dereference.
- The vulnerability is considered of moderate severity with a CVSS score of 5.5.
- The EPSS score is 0.055% indicating a low probability of exploitation.
