- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds write past the end of an allocated buffer while parsing a specially crafted SPP file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write (CWE-787).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves a user being tricked into opening a malicious SPP file using the vulnerable application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to create a malicious SPP file and trick a user into opening it with the vulnerable application. The attacker does not require any privileges on the local system, but requires the user to interact with the malicious file.
