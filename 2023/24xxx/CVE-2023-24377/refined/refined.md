The provided content relates to CVE-2023-24377.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The Ecwid Shopping Cart plugin for WordPress, in versions 6.11.3 and earlier, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.

**Attack vectors:** The attacker exploits the lack of CSRF protection in the plugin. This means that if a logged in user browses to a malicious website or clicks on a malicious link, the attacker could send arbitrary requests to the vulnerable website and have the user perform actions without their knowledge.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into performing a request.
