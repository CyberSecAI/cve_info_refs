GHSA-xr8x-pxm6-prjg
Jan 23, 2023

## Package

maven

org.hl7.fhir.publisher
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

< 1.2.30

## Patched versions

1.2.30

## Description

### Impact

MITM can enable Zip-Slip.

### Vulnerability

#### Vulnerability 1: `Publisher.java`

There is no validation that the zip file being unpacked has entries that are not maliciously writing outside of the intended destination directory.

[fhir-ig-publisher/org.hl7.fhir.publisher.core/src/main/java/org/hl7/fhir/igtools/publisher/Publisher.java](https://github.com/HL7/fhir-ig-publisher/blob/87313e92de6dd6cea816449e0edd225e054a7891/org.hl7.fhir.publisher.core/src/main/java/org/hl7/fhir/igtools/publisher/Publisher.java#L3598-L3610)

Lines 3598 to 3610
in
[87313e9](/HL7/fhir-ig-publisher/commit/87313e92de6dd6cea816449e0edd225e054a7891)

|  | ZipInputStream zip = new ZipInputStream(npm.load("other", "ig-template.zip")); |
| --- | --- |
|  | byte[] buffer = new byte[2048]; |
|  | ZipEntry entry; |
|  | while((entry = zip.getNextEntry())!=null) { |
|  | String filename = Utilities.path(adHocTmpDir, entry.getName()); |
|  | String dir = Utilities.getDirectoryForFile(filename); |
|  | Utilities.createDirectory(dir); |
|  | FileOutputStream output = new FileOutputStream(filename); |
|  | int len = 0; |
|  | while ((len = zip.read(buffer)) > 0) |
|  | output.write(buffer, 0, len); |
|  | output.close(); |
|  | } |

#### Vulnerability 2: `WebSourceProvider.java`

There is a check for malicious zip entries here, but it is not covered by test cases and could potentially be reverted in future changes.

[fhir-ig-publisher/org.hl7.fhir.publisher.core/src/main/java/org/hl7/fhir/igtools/web/WebSourceProvider.java](https://github.com/HL7/fhir-ig-publisher/blob/87313e92de6dd6cea816449e0edd225e054a7891/org.hl7.fhir.publisher.core/src/main/java/org/hl7/fhir/igtools/web/WebSourceProvider.java#L104-L112)

Lines 104 to 112
in
[87313e9](/HL7/fhir-ig-publisher/commit/87313e92de6dd6cea816449e0edd225e054a7891)

|  | try (ZipInputStream zis = new ZipInputStream(new ByteArrayInputStream(buf))) { |
| --- | --- |
|  | ZipEntry zipEntry = zis.getNextEntry(); |
|  | while (zipEntry != null) { |
|  | Path newPath = Utilities.zipSlipProtect(zipEntry, target); |
|  | Files.delete(newPath); |
|  | zipEntry = zis.getNextEntry(); |
|  | } |
|  | zis.closeEntry(); |
|  | } |

#### Vulnerability 3: `ZipFetcher.java`

This retains the path for Zip files in FetchedFile entries, which could later be used to output malicious entries to another compressed file or file system.

[fhir-ig-publisher/org.hl7.fhir.publisher.core/src/main/java/org/hl7/fhir/igtools/publisher/ZipFetcher.java](https://github.com/HL7/fhir-ig-publisher/blob/87313e92de6dd6cea816449e0edd225e054a7891/org.hl7.fhir.publisher.core/src/main/java/org/hl7/fhir/igtools/publisher/ZipFetcher.java#L57-L106)

| --- | --- |
|  |  |
|  | Map<String, FetchedFile> dirs = new HashMap<String, FetchedFile>(); |
|  | while (true) { |
|  | ZipEntry entry = zis.getNextEntry(); |
|  | if (entry == null) { |
|  | myLogger.logMessage("No more entries"); |
|  | break; |
|  | } |

|  | myLogger.logMessage(String.format("Found entry: {}", entryName)); |
|  |  |
|  | FetchedFile ff = new FetchedFile(entryName); |
|  | ff.setPath(entryName); |
|  | ff.setName(SimpleFetcher.fileTitle(entryName)); |
|  | ff.setTime(entry.getTime()); |
|  | if (entry.isDirectory()) { |
|  | ff.setContentType("application/directory"); |
|  | ff.setFolder(true); |
|  | if (entryName.endsWith("/")) { |
|  | entryName = entryName.substring(0, entryName.length() - 1); |
|  | ff.setPath(entryName); |
|  | } |
|  | dirs.put(entryName, ff); |
|  |  |
|  | // TODO: work this in |
|  | // for (File fl : f.listFiles()) |
|  | // ff.getFiles().add(fl.getCanonicalPath()); |
|  | } else { |

|  |  |
|  | myFiles.put(normalisePath(entryName), ff); |
|  | } |
|  |  |
|  | } catch (IOException e) { |
|  | // should not happen |
|  | throw new Error(e); |
|  | } |
|  | } |

#### Vulnerability 4: `IGPack2NpmConvertor.java`

The loadZip method retains the path for entries in the zip file, which could later be used to output malicious entries to another compressed file or file system.

[fhir-ig-publisher/org.hl7.fhir.publisher.core/src/main/java/org/hl7/fhir/igtools/publisher/IGPack2NpmConvertor.java](https://github.com/HL7/fhir-ig-publisher/blob/87313e92de6dd6cea816449e0edd225e054a7891/org.hl7.fhir.publisher.core/src/main/java/org/hl7/fhir/igtools/publisher/IGPack2NpmConvertor.java#L442-L463)

Lines 442 to 463
in
[87313e9](/HL7/fhir-ig-publisher/commit/87313e92de6dd6cea816449e0edd225e054a7891)

|  | private Map<String, byte[]> loadZip(InputStream stream) throws IOException { |
| --- | --- |
|  | Map<String, byte[]> res = new HashMap<String, byte[]>(); |
|  | ZipInputStream zip = new ZipInputStream(stream); |
|  | ZipEntry ze; |
|  | while ((ze = zip.getNextEntry()) != null) { |
|  | int size; |

|  |  |
|  | ByteArrayOutputStream bytes = new ByteArrayOutputStream(); |
|  | BufferedOutputStream bos = new BufferedOutputStream(bytes, buffer.length); |
|  |  |

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
