Organization: [Archive Team](https://archive.ph/o/NH0Bk/https%3A//archive.org/details/archiveteam)

![](data:image/gif;base64...) Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
The main site for Archive Team is at [archiveteam.org](https://archive.ph/o/NH0Bk/www.archiveteam.org/) and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the [Wayback Machine](https://archive.ph/o/NH0Bk/archive.org/web/web.php), providing a path back to lost websites and work.
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
**The Archive Team Panic Downloads** are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

## Introduction

A Brackish Security researcher recently uncovered a vulnerability affecting the myQ iOS application that allows an attacker to take over arbitrary user accounts. This issue was discovered in iOS application version 5.222.0.32277. No other versions were tested, but it is possible that multiple versions and platforms use the same APIs with vulnerable functionality. This issue affects millions of accounts and give attackers access to garage door openers, cameras, locks, and other devices that are controlled via the myQ application. The myQ iOS application has 1.2M ratings on the Apple App Store and is currently #13 in the free application charts.

A door, but we have the key

## A Simple Vulnerability

The attacker needs prior knowledge of a victim’s email account, or as Brackish discovered, an attacker could make repeated requests to the following endpoint to determine if an account is present.
```
POST /api/Account/ForgotPassword
```
If the account does not exist, a lengthy *Location* response header containing the following will be returned.
```
email=amltQGJyYWNraXNoLmlv
```
This is the base 64 encoded version of *jim@brackish.io* – an account that does not exist. If the account exists, this parameter will not be present in the *Location* response header.
Once a victim’s email is discovered, the account takeover is simple. At the heart of it is the lack of rate limiting on the following endpoint
```
POST /api/Account/EmailValidation
```
Where the body of this request contains (amongst other parameters) the reset code that is emailed to the victim.
```
Code=5308
```

](/NH0Bk/52b636e35a9b9c7b64c51fe425960c7e3fe21962.png)

302 response when reset code is hit after thousands of requests

The reset code is only four digits in length, and there is no rate limiting on this endpoint. An attacker is free to brute force this code and reset the victim’s password. This issue was reported to Chamberlain on 1/10/23.
## Fixed

As of 1/20/23, a fix has been implemented via rate limiting on the server or in middleware. The application itself has not been updated. The fact that the fix was implemented in this fashion lends more credence to the speculation that every myQ account was affected by this vulnerability.

## Conclusion

Security of IoT devices is essential. As evidenced by the simplicity of this exploit, these applications and devices sometimes sit without eyes on them for long periods of time.
Brackish Security recommends penetration testing and source code review of all software and IoT devices. Additionally, it is recommended that every company establish a Vulnerability Disclosure Program (VDP) or Bug Bounty Program (BBP). If you need a penetration test, or some assistance in establishing a VPD or BBP, please [reach out](https://archive.ph/o/NH0Bk/web.archive.org/web/20230122144550/mailto%3Ainfo%40brackish.io) to Brackish and Help Make the Bad Guys Salty!

Organization: [Archive Team](https://archive.org/details/archiveteam)

![](http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg) Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.

History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.

The main site for Archive Team is at [archiveteam.org](http://www.archiveteam.org) and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.

This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the [Wayback Machine](http://archive.org/web/web.php), providing a path back to lost websites and work.

Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.

**The Archive Team Panic Downloads** are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

## Introduction

A Brackish Security researcher recently uncovered a vulnerability affecting the myQ iOS application that allows an attacker to take over arbitrary user accounts. This issue was discovered in iOS application version 5.222.0.32277. No other versions were tested, but it is possible that multiple versions and platforms use the same APIs with vulnerable functionality. This issue affects millions of accounts and give attackers access to garage door openers, cameras, locks, and other devices that are controlled via the myQ application. The myQ iOS application has 1.2M ratings on the Apple App Store and is currently #13 in the free application charts.

## A Simple Vulnerability

The attacker needs prior knowledge of a victim’s email account, or as Brackish discovered, an attacker could make repeated requests to the following endpoint to determine if an account is present.

```
POST /api/Account/ForgotPassword
```

If the account does not exist, a lengthy *Location* response header containing the following will be returned.

```
email=amltQGJyYWNraXNoLmlv
```

This is the base 64 encoded version of *jim@brackish.io* – an account that does not exist. If the account exists, this parameter will not be present in the *Location* response header.

Once a victim’s email is discovered, the account takeover is simple. At the heart of it is the lack of rate limiting on the following endpoint

```
POST /api/Account/EmailValidation
```

Where the body of this request contains (amongst other parameters) the reset code that is emailed to the victim.

```
Code=5308
```

The reset code is only four digits in length, and there is no rate limiting on this endpoint. An attacker is free to brute force this code and reset the victim’s password. This issue was reported to Chamberlain on 1/10/23.

## Fixed

As of 1/20/23, a fix has been implemented via rate limiting on the server or in middleware. The application itself has not been updated. The fact that the fix was implemented in this fashion lends more credence to the speculation that every myQ account was affected by this vulnerability.

## Conclusion

Security of IoT devices is essential. As evidenced by the simplicity of this exploit, these applications and devices sometimes sit without eyes on them for long periods of time.

Brackish Security recommends penetration testing and source code review of all software and IoT devices. Additionally, it is recommended that every company establish a Vulnerability Disclosure Program (VDP) or Bug Bounty Program (BBP). If you need a penetration test, or some assistance in establishing a VPD or BBP, please [reach out](http://web.archive.org/web/20230122144550/mailto%3Ainfo%40brackish.io) to Brackish and Help Make the Bad Guys Salty!
