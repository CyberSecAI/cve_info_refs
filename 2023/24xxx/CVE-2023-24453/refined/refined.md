The provided document contains information about multiple vulnerabilities, including CVE-2023-24453.

**CVE-2023-24453:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The TestQuality Updater Plugin does not perform permission checks in a method implementing form validation.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   Missing permission check: The plugin does not check if the user has the necessary permissions to access the affected form validation method.
    *   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): The form validation method doesn't require POST requests, making it vulnerable to CSRF attacks.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with Overall/Read permission can connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified username and password, potentially capturing credentials or performing other malicious actions on the attacker-controlled URL.
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   Network: The attacker can send a crafted request over the network.
    *   User interaction: The attacker needs to trick a user into visiting a malicious website or link that triggers the vulnerability.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have Overall/Read permissions in Jenkins.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to trick a user into interacting with a malicious link.
