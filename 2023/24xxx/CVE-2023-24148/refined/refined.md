The provided content describes a command injection vulnerability in the TOTOLINK CA300-PoE router, specifically in the `setUploadUserData` function.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the insecure usage of the `FileName` parameter within the `setUploadUserData` function. The provided filename, which is retrieved from user input, is directly used in a system command without proper sanitization, leading to command injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Command Injection: The application fails to sanitize user-provided input, specifically the `FileName` parameter, before using it in a system command.
- Lack of Input Validation: The application does not validate or sanitize the `FileName` parameter to prevent command injection characters.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote Command Execution: An attacker can inject arbitrary commands into the `FileName` parameter, which will then be executed by the router's operating system.
- System Compromise: Successful exploitation could lead to full control of the router.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request to the `/cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi` endpoint.
- The `FileName` parameter in the request body.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access to the router's web interface.
- Ability to send HTTP POST requests to the router.
