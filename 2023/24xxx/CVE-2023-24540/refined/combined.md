## Description

Not all valid JavaScript whitespace characters were considered to be whitespace. Templates containing whitespace characters outside of the character set "\t\n\f\r\u0020\u2028\u2029" in JavaScript contexts that also contain actions may not be properly sanitized during execution.

Hello gophers,

We have just released Go versions 1.20.4 and 1.19.9, minor point releases.

These minor releases include 3 security fixes following the [security policy](https://go.dev/security):

* html/template: improper sanitization of CSS values

  Angle brackets (<>) were not considered dangerous characters when inserted into CSS contexts. Templates containing multiple actions separated by a '/' character could result in unexpectedly closing the CSS context and allowing for injection of unexpected HMTL, if executed with untrusted input.

  Thanks to Juho Nurminen of Mattermost for reporting this issue.

  This is CVE-2023-24539 and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/59720>.
* html/template: improper handling of JavaScript whitespace

  Not all valid JavaScript whitespace characters were considered to be whitespace. Templates containing whitespace characters outside of the character set "\t\n\f\r\u0020\u2028\u2029" in JavaScript contexts that also contain actions may not be properly sanitized during execution.

  Thanks to Juho Nurminen of Mattermost for reporting this issue.

  This is CVE-2023-24540 and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/59721>.
* html/template: improper handling of empty HTML attributes

  Templates containing actions in unquoted HTML attributes (e.g. "attr={{.}}") executed with empty input could result in output that would have unexpected results when parsed due to HTML normalization rules. This may allow injection of arbitrary attributes into tags.

  Thanks to Juho Nurminen of Mattermost for reporting this issue.

  This is CVE-2023-29400 and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/59722>.

View the release notes for more information:

<https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#go1.20.4>

You can download binary and source distributions from the Go website:

<https://go.dev/dl/>

To compile from source using a Git clone, update to the release with

`git checkout go1.20.4` and build as usual.

Thanks to everyone who contributed to the releases.

Cheers,

Carlos and Dmitri for the Go team

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
