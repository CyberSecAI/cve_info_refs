- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds read when parsing specially crafted PAR files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read vulnerability (CWE-125).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by tricking a user into opening a malicious PAR file with the affected Solid Edge application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to create a malicious PAR file and convince a user to open it using a vulnerable version of Solid Edge.
