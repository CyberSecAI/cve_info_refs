Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-24600:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from incorrect application of folder access control list (ACL) combinations. Specifically, the combination of "read own, delete all" permissions allowed users to move objects (like contacts) that they did not have read access to.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper Access Control (CWE-284): The system incorrectly handled permissions during move operations, allowing users to bypass "read own" restrictions.
- Insufficient permission checks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: By moving contacts to folders where they had read access, users could effectively bypass the intended "read own" restriction, potentially gaining access to contact information they shouldn't have. This could include other users' contacts if those contacts are in a folder where another user has the ability to delete all, but not read all.

**Attack vectors:**
- Exploitation involved a user with "read own, delete all" permissions moving contact objects to folders they had access to read, bypassing the intended "read own" restriction.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have an account on the affected system.
- The attacker needs to have specific folder permissions: "read own" and "delete all".

**Additional notes:**
- This vulnerability was identified by Tim Coen.
- The vulnerability was fixed in OX App Suite backend 7.10.6-rev37.
- The vulnerability is categorized as having a CVSS score of 4.3 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)
