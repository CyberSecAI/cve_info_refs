Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `boa` binary of the D-Link DIR-605L router.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `sprintf` function is used to copy the value of the "curTime" parameter from an HTTP POST request to a stack buffer without proper bounds checking. The length of the `curTime` parameter is not validated, allowing for a buffer overflow.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution (RCE): An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code on the router.
- Denial of service (DoS): The overflow can cause the router to crash or become unresponsive.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/formSchedule` endpoint, with an overly long value for the `curTime` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the router, either from within the local network or remotely if the router's web interface is exposed.
- No authentication is explicitly mentioned as a requirement in the provided text. It is suggested that default credentials can be used to log into the web interface, which suggests that the attacker might not need authenticated access to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `/bin/boa` binary, which is responsible for handling HTTP requests.
- The specific vulnerable code is in a function that processes the `/goform/formSchedule` endpoint.
- The vulnerability affects D-Link DIR-605L with firmware version 2.13B01 BETA.
- A proof-of-concept (POC) Python script `POC_for_formSchedule.py` has been created to trigger the vulnerability.
