{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to a stack buffer overflow in the /goform/WifiBasicGet handler. The string loaded from `wl5g.extra.wep_type` and stored in the `wifi_buf_entry` stack buffer. The size of the string is not checked before being copied which allows for a buffer overflow",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Stack buffer overflow"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of Service (DoS)",
  "Attack vectors": "By sending a crafted POST request to /goform/WifiBasicSet with a large value for the `wepauth_5g` parameter, and then sending a GET request to /goform/WifiBasicGet",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device. The attacker also needs to login with the administrator credentials."
