The provided content relates to CVE-2023-24655.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability present in the `profile.php` page of the "Simple Customer Relationship Management (CRM) System" application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The application fails to properly sanitize user input provided in the `name` parameter during profile updates. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Code Execution:** The attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database server.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker can potentially escalate privileges by manipulating database entries.
- **Information Disclosure:** The attacker can gain unauthorized access to sensitive information stored in the database, including login credentials, personal data, and financial data.
- **Data Modification:** The attacker can modify or delete data, causing incorrect results or system failures.
- **Server Compromise:** In some cases, the attacker could gain unauthorized access to the underlying operating system and take control of the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through a web browser or tools like Burp Suite by sending a crafted request to the vulnerable `profile.php` endpoint.
- The attack vector involves injecting SQL code into the `name` parameter of the profile update form.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a registered user of the system.
- They must have the ability to intercept HTTP requests (e.g., using Burp Suite).
- The attacker requires a basic understanding of SQL injection techniques.
- The attacker needs to access to the `profile.php` page.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided steps to reproduce outline how to register a user, log in, access the profile update page, intercept the request, and inject SQL code using Burp Suite.
- A sample payload `' AND (SELECT 123 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(10)))abc)-- abc` is provided. This payload uses a `SLEEP` function to demonstrate the SQL injection through a time-based delay.
- The provided steps also show how to use `sqlmap` to automate database dumping and data extraction.
