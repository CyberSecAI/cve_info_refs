# Usage of Uninitialized Timer during forwarding of Fragments with SFR

Moderate

[miri64](/miri64)
published
GHSA-xfj4-9g7w-f4gh
May 30, 2023

## Package

RIOT-OS

## Affected versions

<= 2022.10

## Patched versions

2023.04

## Description

### Impact

RIOT-OS contains a network stack with the ability to process 6LoWPAN frames. An attacker can send crafted frames to the device to trigger the usage of an uninitialized object leading to denial of service.

### Patches

No public patches are available.

### Workarounds

* Disabling fragment forwarding or SFR

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:

* Open an issue in [RIOT](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/issues)
* Email us at RIOT-security

### Bug Details

If SFR is activated the 6LoWPAN stack uses a timer to handle fragment timeouts.

The timer is only initialized once the first fragment with `_frag_ack_req` is send ([source](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/blob/ccbb304eae7b59e8aca24a6ffd095b5b3f7720ee/sys/net/gnrc/network_layer/sixlowpan/frag/sfr/gnrc_sixlowpan_frag_sfr.c#L402)):

```
    if (_frag_ack_req(frag_desc)) {
        /* initialize _arq_timer if not yet done */
        if (_arq_timer.callback == NULL) {
            evtimer_init_msg(&_arq_timer);
        }
        _sched_arq_timeout(fbuf, fbuf->sfr.arq_timeout);
    }

```

If an error occurs during processing of this frame the timer won't be initialized but is still used ([source](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/blob/ccbb304eae7b59e8aca24a6ffd095b5b3f7720ee/sys/net/gnrc/network_layer/sixlowpan/frag/sfr/gnrc_sixlowpan_frag_sfr.c#L420)).

Once the timer event fires it calls the uninitialized function pointer of the event.

Which then results in a crash.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
