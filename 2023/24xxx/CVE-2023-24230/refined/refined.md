Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the identified vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when setting a page title, specifically the `Page Title` field. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application does not sanitize the user-provided page title before storing it in the database.
*   **Improper Output Encoding:** The application does not properly encode the stored page title when rendering it on the page, which allows the injected JavaScript to be executed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed within the victim's browser when they view the affected page.
*   **Session Hijacking:** An attacker can steal user session cookies, potentially allowing for account takeover.
*   **Phishing:** An attacker could redirect users to a phishing page designed to steal credentials.
*   **Malware Distribution:** An attacker could redirect users to a malicious website designed to distribute malware.
*   **Defacement:** An attacker can change the appearance of the page or display unwanted content.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited through the web interface by an attacker with admin access.
*   **Page Title Field:** Specifically, the `Page Title` field is used to inject the malicious payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Administrative Access:** The attacker needs to be logged in to the admin panel to create and publish pages.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Input Field:** The attacker must know to use the `Page Title` field to inject the malicious payload.

**Technical Details:**
*   The provided payload `test_xss<image src/onerror=alert("test_xss")>` was used to demonstrate the stored XSS vulnerability. This payload exploits the lack of input sanitization and output encoding by embedding an `<img>` tag with an `onerror` event handler. When the browser attempts to load the (non-existent) image source, the `onerror` handler is triggered, causing the injected JavaScript `alert("test_xss")` to execute.

**Additional Notes:**
* The medium.com article provides a clear, step-by-step guide on how to reproduce the vulnerability.
* The GitHub content confirms the vulnerable version of the Formwork software (1.12.1).
