Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2023-24441:

**CVE-2023-24441**

*   **Vulnerability:** XXE vulnerability on agents in MSTest Plugin.
*   **Root Cause:** The MSTest Plugin's XML parser is not configured to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.
*   **Affected Plugin:** MSTest Plugin
*   **Affected Versions:** 1.0.0 and earlier.
*   **Weaknesses:** The plugin does not disable external entity resolution for its XML parser.
*   **Attack Vectors:** An attacker can control the contents of the report file for the 'Publish MSTest test result report' post-build step. They can inject malicious XML containing external entity references.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to control the contents of the XML report file that is processed by the agent. They require the ability to influence the input to the 'Publish MSTest test result report' post-build step.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can cause the agent process to parse a crafted XML file, leading to:
    *   Extraction of secrets from the Jenkins agent.
    *   Server-side request forgery (SSRF).
*   **Additional Information:**
    *   The vulnerability has a real impact when attackers can control XML files but are unable to change build steps, Jenkinsfiles, test code or similar.
    *   There is currently no fix available for this vulnerability.
