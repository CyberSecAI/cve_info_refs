Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is the lack of proper filtering of user-provided input, specifically within the video link iframe functionality of the WangEditor 5 rich text editor. This allows for the injection of malicious HTML/JavaScript code via an iframe.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The editor fails to sanitize the iframe `srcdoc` attribute which allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that will be stored in the editor's data.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The editor doesn't properly filter or encode user-supplied video links, specifically the content of the `srcdoc` attribute within an iframe tag, when inserting it into the editor's content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of a user's browser when they view the editor's content.
- **Account Takeover/Session Hijacking:** The injected script could potentially steal cookies or session tokens, leading to account takeover or session hijacking.
- **Data Theft/Manipulation:** The injected script could be used to steal sensitive information or manipulate the content of the page.
- **Malware Distribution:** The injected script could redirect users to malicious websites, leading to malware downloads.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Video Link Insertion:** The primary attack vector involves inserting a crafted video link with a malicious iframe. Specifically the `srcdoc` attribute of an iframe tag.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Editor Access:** An attacker must have access to the WangEditor 5 instance and have the ability to insert/edit content using the video insert feature.
- **No Special Privileges:** The attacker does not need any special privileges, only the ability to use the editor's functionality.

**Technical Details**
- The vulnerability is located in the handling of the `iframe` tag.
- The editor doesn't properly sanitize the `srcdoc` attribute of the `iframe` tag.
- The attacker can insert the malicious code using the video insert feature of the editor by providing a crafted iframe within the video link field.
- The vulnerability is confirmed by local testing and by using the official website demo.
- The vulnerable code can be found in the `index.js` file of the `@wangeditor/editor` package
- The attacker can use the following POC: `<iframe srcdoc="<script>alert(1)</script>"></iframe>`
