Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2023-24597:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the automatic loading of remote resources in the print view of emails, even when the user has configured the system to not load remote content by default to enhance privacy or when an email is marked as spam. This occurs without explicit user consent.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Exposure:** The primary weakness is the exposure of user behavior by loading external content, such as tracking pixels, in the email print view. This allows an attacker to potentially monitor when and if a user prints an email. This corresponds to CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The main impact is the potential for tracking user behavior via malicious remote content within emails. This could allow an attacker to infer when emails are viewed/printed, but no specific data breach or other direct harm appears to result.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through emails containing malicious remote content such as tracking pixels or external images.
*   The vulnerability is triggered when a user attempts to print the email, causing the remote content to load automatically.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send emails to the victim.
*   The emails need to contain external content (e.g., tracking pixels, remote images) that the attacker controls.
*   No specific user interaction is required beyond the user printing the email.

**Additional Information:**

*   The issue was discovered on 2023-01-03 and fixed on 2023-02-06.
*   The affected versions are up to OX App Suite frontend 7.10.6-rev23, and the fix is included in 7.10.6-rev24 and later.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 4.2 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N).
*   No publicly available exploits are known.
