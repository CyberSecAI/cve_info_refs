- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Material Design Icons for Page Builders plugin for WordPress lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor could force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions, under their current authentication. The specific impact varies depending on the context.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious actor can craft a request that, when executed by an authenticated user, performs actions the attacker desires without the user's knowledge or consent.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into triggering a malicious request. This could be done through a crafted link or webpage. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the target website.
