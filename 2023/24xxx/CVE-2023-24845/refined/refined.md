- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The affected RUGGEDCOM ROS devices do not properly block data from being forwarded over the mirror port into the mirrored network.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insufficient filtering of data on the mirror port, leading to unintended forwarding of packets. The vulnerability is classified as CWE-684: Incorrect Provision of Specified Functionality.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious packets into the mirrored network, potentially influencing the configuration and runtime behavior of systems within that network.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack via the mirror port.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send packets that will be mirrored by the affected device.
