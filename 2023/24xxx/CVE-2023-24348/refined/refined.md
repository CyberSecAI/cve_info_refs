Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `boa` binary of the D-Link DIR-605L router. The vulnerability occurs due to the use of `sprintf` to copy the `curTime` parameter from a POST request to a stack buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The `sprintf` function, when used with an unbounded input like the `curTime` parameter, can write past the allocated buffer on the stack, leading to a buffer overflow.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:**  The vulnerability can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the router.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The buffer overflow can also crash the device, causing a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/formSetACLFilter` endpoint.
- **`curTime` parameter:** The attack exploits the `curTime` parameter within the POST request, which can be arbitrarily long.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the router's web interface.
- **Ability to send HTTP POST requests:** The attacker must be capable of crafting and sending an HTTP POST request with the malicious `curTime` parameter to the vulnerable endpoint on the router.
- **No authentication:** The provided information suggests that exploitation can happen post successful login to the web interface of the device using default credentials.

**Additional details from the content:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `boa` binary.
- The vulnerable firmware version is 2.13B01 BETA for D-Link DIR-605L.
- The content includes a proof-of-concept (PoC) Python script (`POC_for_formSetACLFilter.py`) which demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported to the vendor, but no response has been received yet.
