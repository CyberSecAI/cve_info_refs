  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious actor can force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.",
  "Attack vectors": "A malicious actor crafts a request that, when triggered by an authenticated user, performs unwanted actions on the target web application.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to trick an authenticated user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious page that triggers the CSRF request. No specific privileges are required for the attacker, but the target user must have the necessary permissions to perform the targeted actions."
