  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2023-24818",
    "description": "RIOT-OS contains a network stack with the ability to process 6LoWPAN frames. An attacker can send a crafted frame to the device resulting in a NULL pointer dereference. During forwarding of a fragment an uninitialized entry in the reassembly buffer is used. The NULL pointer dereference triggers a hard fault exception resulting in denial of service.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by using an uninitialized entry in the reassembly buffer during fragment forwarding, leading to a null pointer dereference.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-252",
      "CWE-476"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service due to a hard fault exception triggered by a NULL pointer dereference.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "A crafted 6LoWPAN frame sent to the device."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker capable of sending network packets to the target device is required.",

        {
            "location": "gnrc_sixlowpan_dispatch_send",
            "explanation": "NULL pointer dereference occurs due to unchecked use of return value from `gnrc_netif_get_by_pid`. The return value is NULL because `hdr->if_pid` is zero, which is defined as an invalid PID."

        {
            "location": "gnrc_sixlowpan_frag_minfwd_forward",
            "explanation": "The function calls `gnrc_sixlowpan_dispatch_send` and passes a packet with a potentially invalid netif header."

         {
            "location": "gnrc_sixlowpan_frag_rb.c/_rbuf_add",
             "explanation": "The `vrb` is retrieved using `gnrc_sixlowpan_frag_vrb_get` with `netif_hdr->src_l2addr_len` equal to zero, resulting in an uninitialized vrb entry being returned."

        {
          "location": "gnrc_netif_ieee802154.c/_make_netif_hdr",
           "explanation": "The source and destination addresses are retrieved based on the Frame Type header. If the addressing mode indicates the address is not present, a length of zero is returned, causing the address to be absent from the packet forwarded to the 6LoWPAN layer."
