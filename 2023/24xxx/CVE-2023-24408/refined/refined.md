- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Ecwid Shopping Cart plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin allows for the injection of malicious scripts, such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads into the website.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can inject scripts that will be executed when guests visit the site, leading to potential redirects, display of unwanted advertisements or execution of other malicious HTML payloads.
- **Attack vectors:**  The attack vector is through a vulnerability in the plugin, where it does not properly sanitize user input allowing injection of client-side scripts.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to inject scripts through the vulnerable input fields or parameters within the plugin. The required privilege to perform such an attack is "Contributor".
