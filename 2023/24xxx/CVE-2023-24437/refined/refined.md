The provided content is a Jenkins Security Advisory that includes information about multiple vulnerabilities, including CVE-2023-24437.

**CVE-2023-24437**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The JIRA Pipeline Steps Plugin does not perform permission checks in methods implementing form validation, and these methods do not require POST requests, leading to CSRF.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    *   Missing permission checks
    *   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability
*   **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers with Overall/Read permission can connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs, potentially capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.
*   **Attack vectors**:
    *   Network access to the Jenkins instance
    *   Manipulating a user's browser to make requests to the vulnerable endpoint
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    *   Overall/Read permission in Jenkins
    *   Ability to trick a user into visiting a malicious website or link or use a malicious script to perform the request.
