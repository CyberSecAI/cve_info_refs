The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the `funadmin` project.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `app\databases\controller\table.php` file, specifically in the `columns` method.
- The code directly uses the `id` parameter from the request and concatenates it into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability. The `id` parameter is directly inserted into the SQL query, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to:
    - Data exfiltration
    - Data modification
    - Unauthorized access to database information
    - Potential for further system compromise

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is accessible through the HTTP GET request to the `/databases/table/columns` endpoint.
- The `id` parameter in the request is the vulnerable point.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
- No specific authentication or other preconditions are explicitly stated, but access to the application and vulnerable plugin is required.
- The attacker can be external to the system.

**Additional details:**
- The provided content includes a proof of concept (PoC) using SQLMap, which demonstrates the exploitability of this vulnerability
- The vulnerability is confirmed on version 3.2.0
- The issue was reported by `qbz95aaa`
- The issue has been closed by the `funadmin` user, and a commit was made by `MarkLee131` to fix it, however, the specific fix implementation isn't provided.
