# Security Bulletin: IBM Virtualization Engine TS7700 is vulnerable to a privilege escalation threat (CVE-2023-24958)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

IBM Virtualization Engine TS7700 is vulnerable to a privilege escalation threat (CVE-2023-24958). IBM Virtualization Engine TS7700 has addressed the applicable CVE.

## Vulnerability Details

 **CVEID:** [CVE-2023-24958](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-24958)

## Affected Products and Versions

All versions of microcode for the IBM Virtualization Engine TS7700 (3957-VEC, 3957-VED, and 3948-VED) prior to and including the following are affected:

| **Machine Type** | **Model** | **Release** | **Version** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3957 | VEC | R5.1 | 8.51.2.12 |
| R5.2 Phase 1 | 8.52.102.13 |
| VED | R5.1 | 8.51.2.12 |
| R5.2 Phase 1 | 8.52.102.13 |
| R5.2 Phase 2 | 8.52.200.111 |
| R5.3 | 8.53.0.63 |
| 3948 | VED | R5.3 | 8.53.0.63 |

## Remediation/Fixes

IBM strongly recommends addressing the vulnerability now by visiting <https://tape.ibmrcl.enterpriseappointments.com/v2/> or contacting IBM Service at 1-800-IBM-SERV to arrange an upgrade to the latest microcode version followed by the installation of the appropriate VTD\_EXEC as needed. Minimum microcode versions are shown below:

| **Machine Type** | **Model** | **Release** | **Fix** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3957 | VEC | R5.1 | Upgrade to 8.51.2.12 + VTD\_EXEC.900 |
| R5.2 Phase 1 | Upgrade to 8.52.102.13 + VTD\_EXEC.901- OR -Upgrade to 8.52.103.23 |
| VED | R5.1 | Upgrade to 8.51.2.12 + VTD\_EXEC.900 |
| R5.2 Phase 1 | Upgrade to 8.52.102.13 + VTD\_EXEC.901- OR -Upgrade to 8.52.103.23 |
| R5.2 Phase 2 | Upgrade to 8.53.0.63 + VTD\_EXEC.903 (see NOTE below)- OR -Upgrade to 8.53.1.21 (see NOTE below) |
| R5.3 | Upgrade to 8.53.0.63 + VTD\_EXEC.903- OR -Upgrade to 8.53.1.21 |
| 3948 | VED | R5.3 | Upgrade to 8.53.0.63 + VTD\_EXEC.903- OR -Upgrade to 8.53.1.21 |

**NOTE:** R5.3 requires 128GB of memory. 3957-VED needs to be upgraded to 128GB of memory (FC 3479, 64GB DDR 4 memory upgrade for P9 based VED), whereas 3948-VED includes 128GB memory as default.

The minimum VTD\_EXEC version is shown below:

| **VTD\_EXEC Package** | **Version** |
| --- | --- |
| VTD\_EXEC.900 | v1.14 |
| VTD\_EXEC.901 | v1.11 |
| VTD\_EXEC.903 | v1.04 |

## Workarounds and Mitigations

Although IBM recommends that you upgrade to the fixes identified above, you can mitigate, but not eliminate the risk of these vulnerabilities by restricting physical and network access to the TS7700 to authorized users and IBM Service Personnel only.

## Disclaimer

According to the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST), the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is an "industry open standard designed to convey vulnerability severity and help to determine urgency and priority of response." IBM PROVIDES THE CVSS SCORES ""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. CUSTOMERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF ANY ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL SECURITY VULNERABILITY. In addition to other efforts to address potential vulnerabilities, IBM periodically updates the record of components contained in our product offerings. As part of that effort, if IBM identifies previously unidentified packages in a product/service inventory, we address relevant vulnerabilities regardless of CVE date. Inclusion of an older CVEID does not demonstrate that the referenced product has been used by IBM since that date, nor that IBM was aware of a vulnerability as of that date. We are making clients aware of relevant vulnerabilities as we become aware of them. "Affected Products and Versions" referenced in IBM Security Bulletins are intended to be only products and versions that are supported by IBM and have not passed their end-of-support or warranty date. Thus, failure to reference unsupported or extended-support products and versions in this Security Bulletin does not constitute a determination by IBM that they are unaffected by the vulnerability. Reference to one or more unsupported versions in this Security Bulletin shall not create an obligation for IBM to provide fixes for any unsupported or extended-support products or versions.
