Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the use of `${}` within the `DeptMapper.xml` file for constructing SQL queries. Specifically, the `dataScope` parameter is passed directly into the SQL query without proper sanitization or using prepared statements. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The application directly embeds user-controlled data (`dataScope` parameter) into a SQL query.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize the `dataScope` input, which leads to the vulnerability.
*  **Use of `${}` in MyBatis:** The MyBatis framework's `${}` syntax is used, which directly substitutes the parameter value into the SQL statement, making it vulnerable to SQL injection. MyBatis recommends using `#{}` for parameter substitution as it handles parameter escaping.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Information Disclosure:** An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive data from the database, including usernames, passwords, or any other stored information. As demonstrated in the provided content, the attacker was able to query the database version and name.
*   **Data Modification:** Attackers could potentially modify or delete data within the database.
*  **Potential Remote Code Execution:** In some database configurations, SQL injection can even lead to remote code execution on the server.
* **Complete database compromise**: An attacker could potentially obtain full control over the entire database.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code via the `dataScope` parameter in an HTTP request. Specifically, the `dataScope` parameter is controllable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the application to send crafted HTTP requests.
*   **Knowledge of the Application:** The attacker needs some understanding of the application's structure and how it handles parameters, specifically the `dataScope` parameter, to craft the SQL injection payload correctly.

**Summary of Technical Details:**

The vulnerability is located in the `DeptMapper.xml` file where the `selectDeptList` query uses `${}` for parameter substitution. This allows an attacker to inject SQL code through the `dataScope` parameter passed to the `selectDeptList` method. The attacker demonstrated successful exploitation by retrieving the database version and name, confirming the SQL injection vulnerability.
