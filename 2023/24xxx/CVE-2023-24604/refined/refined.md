{
  "CVE-2023-24604": {
    "Description": "HTTP client requests initiated by App Suite middleware were not validating the length of HTTP headers.",
    "Root cause": "The application does not limit the length of HTTP headers when processing external content.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption)"
    ],
    "Impact": "The system could temporarily lock up processing those headers if an attacker-controlled resource (e.g. iCal feed) returned excessive amount of HTTP headers.",
    "Attack vectors": "By providing a malicious external resource (e.g., iCal feed) that returns HTTP headers with excessive length.",
     "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to control a resource that the application fetches, like an iCal feed, and the attacker must have a valid user account in the system. "
