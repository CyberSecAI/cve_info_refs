- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Admin Console of IBM WebSphere Application Server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts into the Admin Console, which could then be executed in the browsers of other users, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the Admin Console of IBM WebSphere Application Server. An attacker could inject malicious scripts into input fields or parameters that are not properly sanitized by the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need to be able to inject malicious scripts into the Admin Console, which could potentially require some level of access to the application or the ability to manipulate requests to it. The attacker would need to be able to target users who access the Admin Console.
