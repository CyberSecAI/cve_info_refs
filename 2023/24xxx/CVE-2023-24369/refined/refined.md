The provided content describes a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in UJCMS version 4.1.3.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of URL validation when adding articles in the backend. Specifically, when a redirect URL is provided, the system doesn't sanitize or validate the input. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code using the `javascript:` pseudo-protocol.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper input validation: The system fails to validate the redirect URL, allowing any string including `javascript:` to be entered.
- Lack of sanitization: The system does not sanitize the provided URL, allowing the execution of malicious JavaScript.
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The lack of input validation and sanitization allows for the injection of client-side scripts.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Execution of arbitrary JavaScript: An attacker can inject JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of the user's browser.
- Browser control and data exfiltration: The injected script can perform actions such as stealing cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or performing actions within the user's context.
- Obtaining sensitive user information: Attackers can potentially gain access to sensitive information such as session tokens or other personal data by stealing cookies.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious URL Injection: An attacker adds a new article via the admin interface and injects malicious javascript in the URL field by using `javascript:` pseudo-protocol.
- User interaction: The vulnerability is triggered when the user clicks the article in the frontend.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Authenticated backend access: The attacker needs to be able to add articles via the backend admin interface to inject the malicious URL.
