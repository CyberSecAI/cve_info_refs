```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application uses a `${}` parameter in the `RoleMapper.xml` which allows for direct SQL injection. The `params.dataScope` is passed directly into the SQL query without sanitization.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL Injection",
    "Unsanitized user input passed to a SQL query"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration, data modification, or complete compromise of the database server.",
  "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the `dataScope` parameter in the HTTP request, specifically the `params[dataScope]` query string parameter. The user controlled input is then directly inserted into the SQL query.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to make requests to the vulnerable endpoint, and control the parameters to be passed in the request. No authentication is required based on the report."
