**CVE-2023-24457: CSRF vulnerability in Keycloak Authentication Plugin**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Keycloak Authentication Plugin does not implement a state parameter in its OAuth flow. A state parameter is a unique, non-guessable value associated with each authentication request.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability due to the missing state parameter in the OAuth flow.
*  **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can trick users into logging into the attacker's account.
*   **Attack vectors:**  The attacker leverages the lack of a state parameter in the OAuth flow to craft malicious links and trick users into authenticating with the attacker's account instead of their own.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to create and distribute malicious links, or otherwise entice a user to click on such a link and initiate an authentication flow via the vulnerable plugin.

The affected plugin is:

*   **Keycloak Authentication Plugin** up to and including version 2.3.0

There is no fix available for this vulnerability as of the publication of the advisory.
