Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-24813:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a discrepancy in how `dompdf` and `php-svg-lib` handle the `href` and `xlink:href` attributes within SVG `image` tags. `dompdf` prioritizes `xlink:href` over `href` for initial URL validation, while `php-svg-lib`, which is used later to parse the SVG, prioritizes `href` if both attributes are present. This difference allows an attacker to bypass `dompdf`'s validation by providing a harmless `xlink:href` value for validation and a malicious `href` attribute for actual processing by `php-svg-lib`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inconsistent Attribute Parsing:** The core weakness is the inconsistent attribute handling between the two libraries, specifically for the `href` and `xlink:href` attributes of SVG `image` tags.
*   **Bypass of URL Validation:** The inconsistent parsing enables a bypass of the URL validation performed by `dompdf`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary URL Calls:** An attacker can force the application to make arbitrary URL calls with arbitrary protocols, potentially leading to various malicious actions.
*   **Remote Code Execution (in older PHP versions):** In PHP versions before 8.0.0, this vulnerability could lead to arbitrary unserialize, which might allow for arbitrary file deletion and potentially remote code execution, depending on available classes.
*   **Data Exfiltration or Modification:** The arbitrary URL calls could be used to exfiltrate data, modify data on the server or connected systems.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SVG File Upload:** The primary attack vector involves providing a malicious SVG file to `dompdf` for processing.
*   **Network:** The attack vector is network based as the malicious SVG could be sent over the network, to be processed by the vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to provide SVG file to dompdf:**  The attacker must have the ability to provide SVG files to the `dompdf` library for processing. This could be via a file upload form, by providing an SVG through an API, or by manipulating other input vectors to pass in the SVG for processing.
*   **No user interaction required:** The attacker does not require any user interaction to exploit this vulnerability, besides providing the SVG file.
*   **No privileges required:** The attacker doesn't require any elevated privileges to execute this exploit.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is a bypass of a previous fix for CVE-2023-23924.
*   The vulnerable versions are specifically `dompdf` versions prior to 2.0.3.
*   The commit `95009ea98230f9b084b040c34e3869ef3dccc9aa` addresses the vulnerability by validating both `xlink:href` and `href` attributes.
