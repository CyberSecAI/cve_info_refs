**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Checkmarx Plugin disables SSL/TLS certificate validation by default for connections to the Checkmarx server.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The plugin's default configuration disables SSL/TLS validation, which can allow man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker performing a man-in-the-middle attack can intercept and potentially modify communication between the Jenkins server and the Checkmarx server, leading to data breaches or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
Network-based man-in-the-middle attack.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the Jenkins server and the Checkmarx server.
An attacker with low level of privileges (e.g. Overall/Read) can exploit this vulnerability.
