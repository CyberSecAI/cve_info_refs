  "related": true,
  "summary": "CVE-2023-35845 is related to the Anaconda3 installer creating world-writable files. This can lead to a MITM attack by compromising the cacert.pem file, used by the python certify module under their pip installation.",
  "details": [
    {
      "type": "Root cause",
      "detail": "The Anaconda3 installer incorrectly sets file permissions, resulting in numerous world-writable files."
    },
    {
      "type": "Weaknesses",
      "detail": "The primary weakness is the creation of world-writable files, particularly the 'cacert.pem' file. This file is used for SSL certificate validation. World-writable permissions allow any user to modify these files."
    },
    {
      "type": "Impact",
       "detail": "Modification of 'cacert.pem' can lead to Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks, allowing untrusted content to pass through SSL connections. Attackers can also cause Denial of Service (DoS) by deleting or truncating files. "
    },
    {
      "type": "Attack vectors",
       "detail": "An attacker can exploit this by modifying the world-writable files, especially 'cacert.pem', to intercept or manipulate SSL traffic. This is a local attack vector, as the attacker would need access to the system where Anaconda3 is installed. "
    },
    {
      "type": "Required attacker capabilities",
      "detail": "The attacker needs to have local access to the system where Anaconda3 or Miniconda is installed. No special privileges or access is required to manipulate the files after installation. "
