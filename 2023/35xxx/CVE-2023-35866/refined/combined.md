## Description

![@CyberCtzn](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/131913002?u=23876a9a08949fc665ae034554f1168a08e0a1c4&v=4&size=48)[CyberCtzn](https://github.com/CyberCtzn)opened [on May 5, 2023](https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/issues/9391#issue-1697123229)
## Overview

Having set up a YubiKey for my Two-Factor-Authentication i noticed that a confirmation through the set up second-factor is not required when making changes to security-settings within that KeePassXC-Database.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. In Database-settings/Security set up a YubiKey Challenge-Response
2. Create a new Entry
3. Confirm with YubiKey Challenge-Response
4. Go back to Database-settings/Security
5. Remove YubiKey Challenge-Response

## Expected Behavior

Imperative authentication through YubiKey Challenge-Response when making security-related changes to database settings.

## Actual Behavior

No Two-Factor-Authentication required, while it is set up.

## Context

This is a similar but different issue like [9339](https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/issues/9339).

KeePassXC - 2.7.4

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General

* [Why KeePassXC instead of KeePassX?](#faq-keepassx)

  KeePassX is no longer developed - as announced on the KeePassX website on 2021-12-09. Our decision to fork KeePassX
  was made some years prior, due to a sharp decline in code frequency at the time, combined with our wish to provide
  you with everything you love about KeePassX plus many new [features and bugfixes](/#project).
* [Why KeePassXC instead of KeePass?](#faq-keepass)

  KeePass is a very proven and feature-rich password manager and there is nothing fundamentally wrong with it.
  However, it is written in C# and therefore requires Microsoft's .NET platform.
  On systems other than Windows, you can run KeePass using the Mono runtime libraries, but you won't get
  the native look and feel which you are used to.

  KeePassXC, on the other hand, is developed in C++ and runs natively on Linux, macOS and Windows giving you the
  best-possible platform integration.
* [Which password database formats are compatible with KeePassXC?](#faq-format)

  KeePassXC currently uses the KeePass 2.x (.kdbx) password database formats KDBX 3.1 and KDBX 4 as its native file formats.
  KDBX 2 files can be opened, but will be upgraded to a newer format. KeePass 1.x (.kdb) databases can be imported into
  a .kdbx file, but saving a .kdbx file as .kdb would be lossy, and saving to .kdb is not supported by KeePassXC.
* [Why is there no cloud synchronization feature built into KeePassXC?](#faq-cloudsync)

  Cloud synchronization with Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, ownCloud, Nextcloud etc. can be easily accomplished by
  simply storing your KeePassXC database inside your shared cloud folder and letting your synchronization service of
  choice do the rest. We prefer this approach, because it is simple, not tied to a specific cloud provider and keeps
  the complexity of our code low.
* [Does KeePassXC support (KeePass2) plugins?](#faq-general-plugins)

  No, KeePassXC does not support plugins at the moment and probably never will. KeePassXC already provides many of the features that
  need third-party plugins in KeePass2, so for most things you don't even need plugins, nor should you ever want them.
  Plugins are inherently dangerous. Many KeePass2 plugins are barely maintained (if at all), some have known vulnerabilities that
  have never been (and probably never will be) fixed, and none of them are as thoroughly tested and reviewed as we test and review
  code that goes into our main application. We find that encouraging users to install untested (and often quickly-abandoned) third-party
  plugins is inherently incompatible with the security demands of a password manager.

  If you really need external functionality not
  available in KeePassXC, you can look for "plugins" that use the KeePassXC-Browser API, which is a much more secure way of sharing
  passwords with third-party applications than loading those applications as plugins directly into KeePassXC.
* [How can I add additional word lists to the passphrase generator?](#faq-general-wordlist)

  You can add additional word lists to the passphrase generator by copying the word list file to the
  `share/wordlists` folder inside your KeePassXC installation directory and then restarting KeePassXC.

  On Linux, the default install location is `/usr/share/keepassxc`,
  on macOS it is `/Applications/KeePassXC.app/Contents/Resources` and
  on Windows `C:\Program Files\KeePassXC` (or `C:\Program Files (x86)\KeePassXC` for 32-bit).

### Security

* [How can I migrate my database to KDBX 4?](#faq-security-kdbx4)

  In the *Database* application menu, select *Database security...*. Select the *Encryption Settings* tab
  and choose *KDBX 4.0 (recommended)*. Press OK and save the database.
* [KeePassXC allows me to store my TOTP secrets.
  Doesn't this undermine any advantage of two-factor authentication?](#faq-security-totp)

  Yes. But only if you store them in the same database as your password. We believe that storing both together
  can still be more secure than not using 2FA at all, but to maximize the security gain from using 2FA,
  you should always store TOTP secrets in a separate database, secured with a different password, possibly even on a different computer.
* [Why would I use a password manager? Isn't it totally insecure to use
  one password for everything?](#faq-security-why-pm)

  Password reuse and simple, easy-to-guess passwords are the biggest problems when using online services.
  If one service gets compromised (either by guessing your password or by exploiting a security vulnerability
  in the service's infrastructure), an attacker may gain access to all of your other accounts.

  But using different passwords for all websites is difficult without a way of storing them somewhere safe.
  Especially with arbitrary password rules for various services, it becomes increasingly hard to use both strong
  and diverse passwords. KeePassXC stores your passwords for you in an encrypted database file, so you only
  need to remember one master password. Of course, the security of all your services depends on the strength
  of your master password now, but with a sufficiently strong password, the password database should be
  infeasible to crack.

  The database is encrypted with either the industry-standard AES256 or the Twofish
  block cipher and the master password is strengthened by a configurable number of key transformations
  to harden it against brute force attacks. Additionally, you can use a key file filled with an arbitrary
  number of random bytes or a YubiKey to further enhance your master key.
* [Has KeePassXC ever had an external security audit?](#faq-audit)

  Yes, an audit was conducted by Zaur Molotnikov, an independent security consultant, and completed on January 19, 2023. This
  audit was conducted free of charge to the KeePassXC Team and the findings and writeup were reviewed for correctness.
  **[Download the Audit Report](/assets/pdf/KeePassXC-Review-V1-Molotnikov.pdf)**.

  Keep in mind that:

  + An audit is not 100% proof that software is safe and secure. Some flaws can be overlooked even by the best auditors.
  + An audit is valid only for a “snapshot” of the code. If new code is added, new vulnerabilities can be introduced.
  + Audits are expensive and time consuming, you can consult with [OSTIF](https://ostif.org/) or
    [OTF](https://www.opentech.fund/) for funding additional KeePassXC audits.
* [I see that KeePassXC requires network access. What for?](#faq-security-network)

  KeePassXC needs network access for downloading website icons (favicons) for password entries. This feature is optional
  and opt-in. KeePassXC will never access any network resource without your explicit prior consent. If you
  don't use this feature, you may also compile KeePassXC without any networking code (see
  next question).
* [Can I get a KeePassXC version without any networking code?](#faq-security-no-network)

  Yes, you can compile KeePassXC without any networking code. Simply configure CMake with `-DWITH_XC_NETWORKING=OFF`
  (see [Building KeePassXC](https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/wiki/Building-KeePassXC)).

### AppImage and Snap package

* [How do I execute an AppImage?](#faq-appsnap-run-appimage)

  The AppImage is a self-contained executable archive, comparable to an Android APK or macOS DMG. To execute
  it, simply give the downloaded `*.AppImage` file execution permissions:

  ```
  1chmod +x ./KeePassXC-*.AppImage
  ```

  After that you can execute it either from the terminal or by double clicking it just like any other program.
* [What systems can I use the AppImage or Snap package on?](#faq-appsnap-support)

  The AppImage should run out of the box on almost any moderately modern Linux distribution. The Snap is supported on all
  systems, which have `snapd` installed. This is primarily Ubuntu, but also Debian, Fedora, OpenSUSE,
  Arch Linux and many more. For a full list and more information visit [snapcraft.io](https://snapcraft.io/). Note
  that not all systems that can run Snaps also support confinement via AppArmor.
* [How do I use the KeePassXC CLI tool with the AppImage?](#faq-appsnap-appimage-cli)

  Starting with version 2.2.2, you can run the KeePassXC CLI tool from the AppImage by executing it with the
  `cli` argument:

  ```
  1./KeePassXC-*.AppImage cli
  ```
* [Why doesn't my theme work?](#faq-appsnap-theme)

  Since Snaps and AppImages are self-contained and mostly isolated from your system, they cannot know what
  theme you are currently running. This is a known issue with both Snaps and AppImages.
* [How do I get my YubiKey to work with the Snap?](#faq-appsnap-yubikey)

  Due to a Snap's isolation and security settings, you must manually enable the `raw-usb` interface in order
  to use your YubiKey. Issue the following command from a terminal to enable this interface:

  ```
  1sudo snap connect "keepassxc:raw-usb" "core:raw-usb"
  ```
* [Why can't I see anything outside my home directory?](#faq-appsnap-homedir)

  Due to Snap's isolation and security settings, you cannot access any files outside your home directory.
  Furthermore, you cannot access any hidden files within your home directory. The only exception is mounted
  USB drives, but you must type in `/media/` into the file open dialog to see them.

  If you still cannot access the `/media/` directory then you may need to enable this permission in the Ubuntu store.
  Open the Ubuntu store, choose the KeePassXC app, and click permissions.

### Key Files

* [What is a key file and how can I get one?](#faq-keyfile-howto)

  A key file is a file containing random bytes that can be added to your master key for additional security.
  Think of it as a really complicated and long password that is read from a file, so you don't have to remember
  or type it into your master password field. You can basically use any file you want as a key file, but **it
  is of *utmost* importance that a) the file never changes and b) it actually contains unpredictable data.** If the file
  changes, it is as if you forgot your password and you will lose access to your database.

  On the other hand, if the data
  is not random enough, then it's a really bad password. So, for instance, a static and never-changing holiday picture
  is okay, your personal notes file is not. Generally, we recommend you let KeePassXC generate a dedicated key file for you.
  Go to *Database -> Database Settings -> Security*. There you click on *Add Key File* and then
  on *Generate*. Select the location where to save the key file, make sure the path to the new file
  is inserted into the Key File field, and save your database. Don't forget to keep a backup of the key file in
  a safe place!
* [How secure is a key file and how can I sync it to other devices?](#faq-keyfile-security)

  A key file is only as secure as you keep it. It is basically a password that you've written down. As a general
  rule, you should never use a key file without an actual password, because it is harder to keep your key file
  secret than a memorized password that only you know. However, a key file can be very strong additional
  protection if kept separately from the database file, such as on an external thumb drive. If you sync your database
  via a cloud provider (Dropbox, Google Drive, Nextcloud, …), you should only sync the KDBX file and distribute the key file to
  your computers by different means, such as said thumb drive.

  But whatever you do, **keep a backup in a safe location!**
  If you lose your key file, you lose your database. Keep in mind that USB thumb drives are notoriously unreliable,
  break easily, or get lost. If you can afford it, we recommend you use a hardware token such as a YubiKey or OnlyKey
  instead of a key file (see next section). Such a key adds an even greater amount of security, but with fewer potential pitfalls.

### YubiKey / OnlyKey

* [Does KeePassXC support two-factor authentication (2FA) with YubiKeys or OnlyKeys?](#faq-yubikey-2fa)

  Yes and no. No, because technically speaking, KeePassXC is not a service and therefore does not use "authentication". Instead,
  you are "decrypting" your database, which is different from "authentication". Nonetheless, you can improve the security of your database
  by use of a YubiKey in a slightly different way. KeePassXC generates a challenge and uses the YubiKey's response to this challenge to
  enhance the encryption key of your database.

  So in a sense, it makes your password stronger, but technically it doesn't qualify as a
  separate second factor, since this is not an authentication scheme and also because the expected response doesn't change every time you
  try to decrypt your database. It does, however, change every time you save your database. Be aware, however, that the previous version of your
  database can still be decrypted with the old challenge/response (but no other version prior to that and no future version either).
* [How do I configure my YubiKey / OnlyKey for use with KeePassXC?](#faq-yubikey-howto)

  To use a YubiKey for securing your KeePassXC database, you have to configure one of your slots for HMAC-SHA1 Challenge-Response mode
  **(see [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYUVzWDgmVc))**.
  Instructions on how to use your OnlyKey are found [here](https://docs.onlykey.io/usersguide.html#using-onlykey-with-a-software-password-manager).
  Once your hardware key is set up, open your database in KeePassXC, go to
  *Database -> Database Security*, click on *Add additional protection*, then *Add Challenge Response*.
  Once your key/slot is recognized, press ok and then save your database.

  **Important:** Always make a copy of the secret that is programmed into your hardware key while
  you configure it and store in a secure physical location. If you lose or brick the key you will permanently
  lose access to your database!

  For more information on Challenge Response, please see [Yubico's website](https://docs.yubico.com/yesdk/users-manual/application-otp/challenge-response.html).
* [When I use KeeChallenge with KeePass2, it creates an extra file. Why do
  I have no such file when using KeePassXC?](#faq-yubikey-no-extra-file)

  Our implementation differs from how KeeChallenge handles YubiKeys. KeeChallenge uses the HMAC secret
  directly to enhance the database. To make this work, they need to store the secret in a side-car file,
  encrypted with the response of a challenge-response pair that is calculated ahead of time. In KeePassXC,
  we do not require any knowledge of the HMAC secret. We use the database's master seed (a random byte string that is part of your database)
  as challenge and then use the response to encrypt the database. That way we do not need an extra file and also gain
  the advantage that the required response changes every time you save the database, which resembles
  actual two-factor authentication more closely.
* [When I secure my database in KeePass2 with a YubiKey, I can't open it in
  KeePassXC (or vice versa), why?](#faq-yubikey-incompatible)

  Due to the fact that our YubiKey implementation differs from KeeChallenge's, they are inherently incompatible
  (see question above). If you need compatibility between KeePass2 and KeePassXC, you cannot use YubiKeys
  at the moment.
* [Why only HMAC-SHA1? Why not FIDO-U2F or TOTP?](#faq-yubikey-why-hmac-sha1)

  Both FIDO-U2F and TOTP require a dynamic component (i.e., a counter or timestamp) for successful authentication.
  This is perfect for authenticating at an online service, but doesn't work for an offline database which needs
  to be encrypted with a fixed key. HMAC-SHA1, on the other hand, can be computed ahead of time
  as it only needs a fixed secret and no dynamic component of any kind.
* [But the feature list says KeePassXC supports TOTP. I am confused.](#faq-yubikey-otp)

  We do support generation of timed one-time passwords (TOTP), but do not (and cannot) support it for securing
  your KeePassXC database. KeePassXC allows you to store TOTP secrets for online services inside a database
  and generates the corresponding timed one-time passwords for you. For TOTP, see also the question
  [KeePassXC allows me to store my TOTP secrets. Doesn't this undermine any advantage of
  two-factor authentication?](#faq-security-totp)
* [What happens if I break my YubiKey? Can I create backup keys?](#faq-yubikey-broken-yubikey)

  You should always make a copy of the HMAC secret that is stored on the YubiKey and keep it in a secure
  location. This can be an analog paper copy, but since the YubiKey personalization tool allows you to
  program a custom secret into the key, you may as well program a second key with the same secret.
* [Can I register multiple YubiKeys with my KeePassXC database?](#faq-yubikey-multiple-yubikeys)

  You can only use a single secret for encrypting the database. So you can use multiple YubiKeys, but they
  all have to be programmed with the same secret (see question above).

### Browser integration

* [Does KeePassXC support browser extensions?](#faq-browser)

  Yes. KeePassXC supports the extension KeePassXC-Browser.
  You can download it for [Mozilla Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/keepassxc-browser/) and
  [Google Chrome / Chromium / Vivaldi](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keepassxc-browser/oboonakemofpalcgghocfoadofidjkkk).
  Firefox ESR (52.x) is supported, but the following features are disabled because of WebExtension API limitations:

  + Showing context menus on password fields (`menus.ContextType`)+ HTTP Auth support (`webRequest.onAuthRequired`)
* [How do I connect browser extensions with KeePassXC?](#faq-browser-howto)

  You can enable Browser Integration (KeePassXC-Browser) from the application settings.
  See the page [How to connect KeePassXC-Browser with KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/docs/KeePassXC_GettingStarted.html#_configure_keepassxc_browser) for more
  detailed information for the new Browser Integration. For troubleshooting see the following [wiki page](https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc-browser/wiki/Troubleshooting-guide).
* [How do I fill in additional values on a webpage?](#faq-string-fields)

  It is possible to fill additional information beyond username, password, and TOTP by defining String Fields on a page.

  1. From the extension popup menu, click "Choose custom login fields". You can skip the Username, Password, and TOTP fields if not needed.
  2. On Step 4 (Confirm Selection), choose the additional string fields you need to fill. Note that they are numbered sequentially.
  3. After choosing the String Fields, go to your KeePassXC client and create advanced attributes with a prefix of 'KPH: ' in the order you chose them above. NOTE: The space after the colon is required.
  4. If you wish, you may add a short name after the prefix to help you remember its purpose.

  An example using the page `https://meine.deutsche-bank.de/trxm/db/init.do`:

  1. Choose custom login fields for this page and select Branch, Account and Sub-account as String Fields when you reach step 4.
  2. Go to your entry and add the following advanced attributes (the order is critical):
     1. KPH: Branch
     2. KPH: Account
     3. KPH: Sub-account
  3. Test the filling of the string fields by refreshing the page and using the extension.

### SSH Agent integration

* [How does the SSH Agent integration work?](#faq-ssh-agent-how)

  The SSH Agent integration is supported on all target platforms (Linux, macOS and Windows) and it acts as a client
  for an existing agent. It can automatically add SSH keys from your KeePassXC database to a running SSH agent
  when unlocked and remove them when locked.

  + On Linux, most desktops are already running an agent without any set up required.
  + On macOS, `ssh-agent` is running by default and no further setup is required.
  + On Windows, you have multiple options:
    - One is to have *Pageant* running. It is part of the
      [PuTTY suite](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html).
    - An alternative is to use e.g. [Win32 OpenSSH](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse)
      which may come preinstalled with your Windows 10 version.
    - The MSYS2 ssh-agent socket offered by Git for Windows's bundled OpenSSH is
      [**not supported**](https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/issues/4681)
* [What SSH key types are supported?](#faq-ssh-agent-keys)

  Most SSHv2 key types are supported (DSA, RSA and Ed25519), including encrypted keys. ECDSA keys are only
  supported with the new OpenSSH file format. 3DES-encrypted keys are not supported and we highly recommend
  upgrading them for external storage or store them decrypted inside the database.

  + SSHv1 keys are **not** supported.
  + PuTTY format key files (.ppk) are **not** supported. You can use *PuTTY Key Generator
    (puttygen.exe)* to convert your keys to OpenSSH format.
  + RFC4716 format key files are **not** supported.
* [Why are the agent buttons greyed out / why doesn't it work?](#faq-ssh-agent-not-working)

  On Linux or macOS, you need to have `ssh-agent` running and the `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` environment
  variable available for KeePassXC at launch.

  [Arch Linux wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/SSH_keys#SSH_agents) has a generic guide
  how to manually run `ssh-agent` if it's not already set up. Sometimes other applications like
  *GNOME Keyring* or `gpg-agent` already provide a compatible agent that also works with
  KeePassXC.

  On Windows, either Pageant needs to be running, see [How does the SSH Agent integration work?](#faq-ssh-agent-how)
  or, alternatively, you need to enable and start the Windows `OpenSSH Authentication Agent`
  (commonly referred to as `ssh-agent`). This process is documented in
  [Microsoft's documentation for user keys](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_keymanagement#user-key-generation).

  The MSYS2 ssh-agent socket offered by Git for Windows's bundled OpenSSH is [not supported](https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/issues/4681).
* [How do I set up a passphrase for encrypted keys?](#faq-ssh-agent-passphrase)

  The SSH Agent integration uses the entry password field as the decryption key.
* [Why does the public key (seem to) have no comment?](#faq-ssh-agent-comment)

  When using normal DSA or RSA keys, the private key file does not contain any embedded text. In that case,
  the entry username field is used as the public key comment. It is also sent to the agent when adding a key
  and is visible in the agent when listing keys.

  If you are using Ed25519 keys or have converted your old key to the new OpenSSH file format, the comment is
  embedded in the key file which is then used by KeePassXC. You can use `ssh-keygen` to modify the comment.
* [I'm already using KeeAgent, is KeePassXC compatible with it?](#faq-ssh-agent-keeagent)

  Yes, mostly. KeeAgent supports more key types and provides a custom agent, but otherwise you can use the
  same database with KeeAgent and KeePassXC.
* [Why is Pageant refusing my keys?](#faq-ssh-agent-pageant)

  Pageant does not support confirm-on-use or automatic removal of key after a timeout. There doesn't seem to be
  any alternative to Pageant for Windows that supports both of them.
* [Why is OpenSSH ssh-agent refusing my keys?](#faq-ssh-agent-openssh)

  You may experience an Agent protocol error if you are using confirm-on-use option for your keys
  (e.g. set via the environment variable `SSH_ASKPASS_REQUIRE`). In that case `ssh-agent`
  needs to have a `ssh-askpass` program available.

  + On Linux it depends on your distribution and desktop environment how to install and configure one as there are several available.
  + On macOS, you need a third party program like [theseal/ssh-askpass](https://github.com/theseal/ssh-askpass).
  + On Windows the default Windows OpenSSH installation does not support confirm-on-use or automatic removal of key after a timeout.
* [I'm getting protocol or connection errors, what's wrong?](#faq-ssh-agent-errors)

  If you are using *GNOME Keyring*, it is known to be buggy and the SSH Agent implementation fairly incomplete
  prior to release **3.27.92**. You are encouraged to use OpenSSH `ssh-agent` if you are stuck with
  an older version.

  Known limitations of older versions include no support for Ed25519 keys, no support for confirm-on-use and incorrect
  implementation of the agent protocol causing protocol errors.
* [I'm getting a "Too many authentication failures" error, what shall I do?](#faq-ssh-agent-auth-errors)

  SSH will try all available identity files in sequence when connecting to a server. If you export many SSH
  keys at a time, you'll very likely experience a *"Received disconnect from {port}: Too many
  authentication failures"* error. To solve this issue, you'll have to tell SSH which identity file to
  use. Either use the `-i` command line option or the `IdentityFile` directive in your
  OpenSSH config file (`~/.ssh/config`) to pass the path to the respective private key file.

  If you use the `IdentityFile` directive, you likely want to use the `IdentitiesOnly`
  directive, too. The [Arch Linux wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/SSH_keys#Managing_multiple_keys) has a generic guide on how to manage multiple keys.

  If you prefer storing your private key inside your database using an attachment, you can still do so.
  Instead of letting the `IdentityFile` directive point to a private key file, let it point to
  your public key file. The SSH Agent will use the provided information to select the correct private key.
* [How do I use KeePassXC SSH Agent integration with Git (Bash) on Windows?](#faq-ssh-agent-git-bash)

  KeePassXC on Windows can be used with [Pageant](KeePassXC_UserGuide.html#_openssh_agent_and_pageant_on_windows)
  or with Windows OpenSSH.
   Git for Windows supports both options since version
  [2.33.0](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/tag/v2.33.0.windows.1).

  You will be prompted during installation of Git for Windows to pick the option you prefer – depending on
  your Windows version and whether PuTTY is installed.

  The MSYS2 ssh-agent socket offered by Git for Windows's bundled OpenSSH is
  [**not supported**](https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/issues/4681).

  If you did not choose Windows OpenSSH during Git installation you can still do the following to make Git (Bash) use Windows OpenSSH:
  Prepend the path to Windows OpenSSH to the `PATH` variable inside the Git Bash, e.g.
  `export PATH="/c/Windows/System32/OpenSSH:$HOME/bin:$PATH"` or use the `GIT_SSH_COMMAND` environment variable
  (`core.sshCommand` in the Git configuration file) to override the path to the SSH binary specifically for Git.

### Platform-specific

* [Is Auto-Type supported on macOS, Windows and Linux?](#faq-autotype)

  Yes, Auto-Type works on all three supported platforms, although on Linux it only works in an X11 session, not Wayland.
* [Does KeePassXC work on mobile phones? If not, which app would you recommend?](#faq-platform-mobile)

  We don't have our own mobile app, but you can have the same functionality on both Android and iOS!

  + For Android, we recommend [KeePassDX](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kunzisoft.keepass.free) and
    [KeePass2Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=keepass2android.keepass2android).
  + And for iOS, we suggest [Strongbox](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/strongbox-password-safe/id897283731) and
    [KeePassium](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/keepassium-keepass-passwords/id1435127111).

  For KeePassXC, porting it properly to mobile platforms would require a full rewrite.
  You may be able to compile KeePassXC for the mobile OS of your choice, but it isn't at all optimized
  for mobile screen sizes and form factors, let alone multi-touch input. We also don't see any advantage in
  providing a mobile version of KeePassXC when there are already excellent options.
* [Why do the tray menu and in-app shortcuts not work on Ubuntu/Unity?](#faq-ubuntushortcuts)

  This is a bug caused by `appmenu-qt5`. You have 3 options:

  + Remove the `appmenu-qt5` package+ Set the environment variable `UBUNTU_MENUPROXY=''`+ Set the environment variable `QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=''`

  **Note:** When you choose the first or third option, KeePassXC will lose the Unity look and feel.
* [I am getting "System Error: VCRUNTIME140\_1.dll was not found" when starting KeePassXC. Why?](#faq-msvc-runtime-missing)

  This error indicates that you are missing the MSVC runtime library (Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable). You can [download the latest version from Microsoft](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe). A download link can also be found on our [downloads page](https://keepassxc.org/download/#windows).

## Description

![@xantoniorx](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/117211587?v=4&size=48)[xantoniorx](https://github.com/xantoniorx)opened [on Apr 20, 2023](https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/issues/9339#issue-1676085284)

I am disappointed because when exporting the database no password is required.

And when I want to change the master password no password is required.

For me it is a bad lack of security because if an attacker who has managed to have access to the PC locally or remotely he can change the password or export the entire database in clear text in a second without any kind of protection. It's rare but it can happen and if it happens game over!

All password managers require the master password to export and change the master password.

I don't understand why KeePass XC doesn't!

That's why I don't use KeePass XC because it's too insecure for it.

I hope you will include this important protection becouse if this problem is not solved it remains a totally useless application to contain passwords.

## Description

![@xantoniorx](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/117211587?v=4&size=48)[xantoniorx](https://github.com/xantoniorx)opened [on Apr 20, 2023](https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/issues/9339#issue-1676085284)

I am disappointed because when exporting the database no password is required.

And when I want to change the master password no password is required.

For me it is a bad lack of security because if an attacker who has managed to have access to the PC locally or remotely he can change the password or export the entire database in clear text in a second without any kind of protection. It's rare but it can happen and if it happens game over!

All password managers require the master password to export and change the master password.

I don't understand why KeePass XC doesn't!

That's why I don't use KeePass XC because it's too insecure for it.

I hope you will include this important protection becouse if this problem is not solved it remains a totally useless application to contain passwords.

KeePassXC, a widely used open-source password manager, is renowned for its robust security features and the ability to protect sensitive user information. However, recent observations by [CyberCitizen.tech](https://www.cybercitizen.tech) raised concerns regarding security-setting changes within the KeePassXC-Database. Notably, CyberCitizen and other users have noticed that a confirmation through the master password or the set-up second-factor is not required when making modifications to security settings. In this article, we delve into the implications of this issue and discuss the importance of enhancing security measures in KeePassXC.

# The Importance of Security Settings

Security settings within a password manager serve as a vital defense mechanism against unauthorized access to sensitive information. These settings control aspects such as password requirements, encryption methods, and key file settings, ensuring that stored data remains secure. It is imperative that these settings are well-protected to maintain the integrity and confidentiality of user credentials.

# The Security Setting Gap

The identified gap in KeePassXC’s security model is the absence of confirmation through the master password or the set-up second-factor when making changes to security settings within the KeePassXC-Database. This means that any individual with access to the (open) database can modify critical security configurations without providing proper authentication.

This security oversight compromises the very purpose of the master password and the set-up second-factor. These measures are designed to ensure that only authorized users with the correct credentials can access and modify security settings. Without these confirmation requirements, unauthorized individuals can tamper with security configurations, potentially compromising the security of stored data.

# Addressing the Security Gap

To reinforce the security measures in KeePassXC and address the observed gap, the following actions can be considered:

Master Password Confirmation: Implement a mandatory master password confirmation whenever changes are made to security settings. Requiring the entry of the master password ensures that only authorized users with knowledge of the password can modify critical security configurations.

Second-Factor Authentication Confirmation: If set-up, introduce a requirement for second-factor authentication confirmation, such as the use of a physical key or other 2FA methods, when making changes to security settings. This step adds an additional layer of authentication, ensuring that only individuals with the necessary credentials can modify security configurations.

Regular Security Audits: Conduct routine security audits to identify and rectify potential vulnerabilities within KeePassXC. This includes regularly reviewing the codebase, engaging in penetration testing, and involving the security community to identify and address any security loopholes. (Interestingly, a recent security audit was performed: [https://keepassxc.org/blog/2023-04-15-audit-report](https://keepassxc.org/blog/2023-04-15-audit-report/)/)

User Education: promote user awareness about the importance of maintaining good security practices and the potential risks associated with the absence of confirmation requirements for security setting changes. Encourage users to regularly review their security settings, report suspicious activities, and stay informed about security updates and patches.

# Conclusion

The absence of confirmation through the master password or the set-up second-factor when making changes to security settings in KeePassXC-Database is a significant security concern. By implementing the suggested measures, KeePassXC can strengthen its security model and provide users with a more robust and reliable password management solution. Maintaining the integrity of security settings is crucial to ensure the protection of sensitive information and uphold user trust in the software.

**Please note:** given the fact, that KeePassXC is fully open-source and based on a team of volunteers, this article is in no way meant to blame them. Instead it is meant as an honest way to support them and the community in order to increase the security posture.
