{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from a lack of bounds checking in the `fstReaderIterBlocks2` function while parsing the `chain_table` in FST files. Specifically, during the processing of `FST_BL_VCDATA` and `FST_BL_VCDATA_DYN_ALIAS2` sections, the code uses attacker-controlled values to index into the `chain_table` array. When a specific varint is processed, the code writes zeros to chain_table, incrementing the index `idx`. This index is not validated against the allocated size of chain_table, causing a heap-based buffer overflow.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Heap-based buffer overflow due to missing bounds check when writing to the `chain_table` array in `fstReaderIterBlocks2`."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary code execution, potentially allowing an attacker to gain control over the affected system.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by opening a specially crafted `.fst` file with GTKWave. The attacker needs to craft a malicious `.fst` file with specific data in the `chain_mem` section that causes `fstReaderIterBlocks2` to write past the boundaries of the `chain_table` buffer.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to provide the victim with a malicious `.fst` file and the victim must then open this file with the vulnerable application GTKWave."
