# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2023-1789

## GTKWave FST fstReaderIterBlocks2 chain\_table parsing heap-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities

##### January 8, 2024

##### CVE Number

CVE-2023-35969,CVE-2023-35970

##### SUMMARY

Multiple heap-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist in the fstReaderIterBlocks2 chain\_table parsing functionality of GTKWave 3.3.115. A specially crafted .fst file can lead to arbitrary code execution. A victim would need to open a malicious file to trigger these vulnerabilities.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

GTKWave 3.3.115

##### PRODUCT URLS

GTKWave - <https://gtkwave.sourceforge.net>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

7.8 - CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

##### CWE

CWE-119 - Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer

##### DETAILS

GTKWave is a wave viewer, often used to analyze FPGA simulations and logic analyzer captures. It includes a GUI to view and analyze traces, as well as convert across several file formats (`.lxt`, `.lxt2`, `.vzt`, `.fst`, `.ghw`, `.vcd`, `.evcd`) either by using the UI or its command line tools. GTKWave is available for Linux, Windows and MacOS. Trace files can be shared within teams or organizations, for example to compare results of simulation runs across different design implementations, to analyze protocols captured with logic analyzers or just as a reference when porting design implementations.

Trace files can be shared within teams or organizations. For example, they can be shared to compare results of simulation runs across different design implementations, to analyze protocols captured with logic analyzers, or just as a reference when porting design implementations. GTKWave also sets up mime types for its supported extensions. It is enough for a victim to double-click on a wave file received by e-mail to trigger the vulnerabilities described in this advisory.

The function `fstReaderOpen` is used to parse `.fst` files.

```
     void *fstReaderOpen(const char *nam)
     {
[1]  struct fstReaderContext *xc = (struct fstReaderContext *)calloc(1, sizeof(struct fstReaderContext));

[2]  if((!nam)||(!(xc->f=fopen(nam, "rb"))))
             {
             free(xc);
             xc=NULL;
             }
             else
             {
             int flen = strlen(nam);
             char *hf = (char *)calloc(1, flen + 6);
             int rc;

     #if defined(FST_UNBUFFERED_IO)
             setvbuf(xc->f, (char *)NULL, _IONBF, 0);   /* keeps gzip from acting weird in tandem with fopen */
     #endif

             memcpy(hf, nam, flen);
             strcpy(hf + flen, ".hier");
             xc->fh = fopen(hf, "rb");

             free(hf);
             xc->filename = strdup(nam);
[3]          rc = fstReaderInit(xc);

```

At [1] the `xc` structure is created. It is a big (about 65KB) structure, used to hold information regarding the `.fst` file.

At [2] the `xc->f` field is set to the file pointer returned by `fopen` after opening the file being parsed.

Then, the function `fstReaderInit` is called [3] to parse the various `.fst` sections from the input file.

```
     int fstReaderInit(struct fstReaderContext *xc)
     {
     fst_off_t blkpos = 0;
     fst_off_t endfile;
     uint64_t seclen;
     int sectype;
     uint64_t vc_section_count_actual = 0;
     int hdr_incomplete = 0;
     int hdr_seen = 0;
     int gzread_pass_status = 1;

     sectype = fgetc(xc->f);
     ...
     if(gzread_pass_status)
             {
             fstReaderFseeko(xc, xc->f, 0, SEEK_END);
             endfile = ftello(xc->f);

             while(blkpos < endfile)
                     {
                     fstReaderFseeko(xc, xc->f, blkpos, SEEK_SET);

[4]                  sectype = fgetc(xc->f);
                     seclen = fstReaderUint64(xc->f);

                     if(sectype == EOF)
                             {
                             break;
                             }

[5]                  if((hdr_incomplete) && (!seclen))
                             {
                             break;
                             }

[6]                  if(!hdr_seen && (sectype != FST_BL_HDR))
                             {
                             break;
                             }

                     blkpos++;
                     ...

```

At [4], the `sectype` (1 byte) is read off the file. This variable will tell us which kind of sector weâ€™re parsing. The checks at [5] and [6] are important because we donâ€™t want to trigger them in order to reach the vulnerable code: we need to make sure `hdr_incomplete` stays 0 and that we start with a `FST_BL_HDR` sector, which will set `hdr_seen` to 1.

So, if the input file starts with a `0x00`, weâ€™ll land inside the following condition:

```
     ...
     if(sectype == FST_BL_HDR)
             {
             if(!hdr_seen)
                     {
                     int ch;
                     double dcheck;

                     xc->start_time = fstReaderUint64(xc->f);
                     xc->end_time = fstReaderUint64(xc->f);

[7]                  hdr_incomplete = (xc->start_time == 0) && (xc->end_time == 0);

                     ...
[8]                  hdr_seen = 1;

[9]                  xc->mem_used_by_writer = fstReaderUint64(xc->f);
                     xc->scope_count = fstReaderUint64(xc->f);
                     xc->var_count = fstReaderUint64(xc->f);
                     ...
                     }
             }
     ...

```

After parsing the header, `fstReaderInit` then proceeds to parse other blocks that are not relevant for this advisory.

Upon return from `fstReaderOpen`, GTKWave eventually calls `fstReaderIterBlocks2` to parse all VCDATA blocks, as they havenâ€™t been fully parsed in `fstReaderInit`.

`fstReaderIterBlocks2` is a pretty large function, so weâ€™ll focus on the interesting lines only:

```
     int fstReaderIterBlocks2(void *ctx,
                              void (*value_change_callback)(void *user_callback_data_pointer, uint64_t time, fstHandle facidx, const unsigned char *value),
                              void (*value_change_callback_varlen)(void *user_callback_data_pointer, uint64_t time, fstHandle facidx, const unsigned char *value, uint32_t len),
                              void *user_callback_data_pointer, FILE *fv) {
         struct fstReaderContext *xc = (struct fstReaderContext *)ctx;

         uint64_t previous_time = UINT64_MAX;
         uint64_t *time_table = NULL;
         uint64_t tsec_nitems;
         unsigned int secnum = 0;
         int blocks_skipped = 0;
         fst_off_t blkpos = 0;
         uint64_t seclen, beg_tim;
         uint64_t end_tim;
         uint64_t frame_uclen, frame_clen, frame_maxhandle, vc_maxhandle;
         fst_off_t vc_start;
         fst_off_t indx_pntr, indx_pos;
         fst_off_t *chain_table = NULL;
         uint32_t *chain_table_lengths = NULL;
         unsigned char *chain_cmem;
         unsigned char *pnt;
         long chain_clen;
         fstHandle idx, pidx = 0, i;
         uint64_t pval;
         uint64_t vc_maxhandle_largest = 0;
         uint64_t tsec_uclen = 0, tsec_clen = 0;
         int sectype;
         uint64_t mem_required_for_traversal;
         unsigned char *mem_for_traversal = NULL;
         uint32_t traversal_mem_offs;
         uint32_t *scatterptr, *headptr, *length_remaining;
         uint32_t cur_blackout = 0;
         int packtype;
         unsigned char *mc_mem = NULL;
         uint32_t mc_mem_len; /* corresponds to largest value encountered in chain_table_lengths[i] */
         int dumpvars_state = 0;

         ...
[10]     for (;;) {
             uint32_t *tc_head = NULL;
             traversal_mem_offs = 0;

             fstReaderFseeko(xc, xc->f, blkpos, SEEK_SET);

[11]         sectype = fgetc(xc->f);
             seclen = fstReaderUint64(xc->f);

             if ((sectype == EOF) || (sectype == FST_BL_SKIP)) {
     #ifdef FST_DEBUG
                 fprintf(stderr, FST_APIMESS "<< EOF >>\n");
     #endif
                 break;
             }

             blkpos++;
[12]         if ((sectype != FST_BL_VCDATA) && (sectype != FST_BL_VCDATA_DYN_ALIAS) && (sectype != FST_BL_VCDATA_DYN_ALIAS2)) {
                 blkpos += seclen;
                 continue;
             }

             if (!seclen) break;
         ...

```

As previously said, all blocks are scanned [10], and only the blocks with a `sectype` [11] containing VCDATA are parsed [12]. These blocks are `FST_BL_VCDATA`, `FST_BL_VCDATA_DYN_ALIAS` and `FST_BL_VCDATA_DYN_ALIAS2`.

Later on, the code extracts `vc_maxhandle`:

```
        fstReaderFseeko(xc, xc->f, (fst_off_t)frame_clen, SEEK_CUR); /* skip past compressed data */

[13]    vc_maxhandle = fstReaderVarint64(xc->f);
        vc_start = ftello(xc->f); /* points to '!' character */
        packtype = fgetc(xc->f);

```

Right after this, the `chain_clen` is extracted [14], which is the size of the `chain` section, extracted at [15].

```
        indx_pntr = blkpos + seclen - 24 - tsec_clen - 8;
        fstReaderFseeko(xc, xc->f, indx_pntr, SEEK_SET);
[14]    chain_clen = fstReaderUint64(xc->f);
        indx_pos = indx_pntr - chain_clen;
        ...
[15]    chain_cmem = (unsigned char *)malloc(chain_clen);
        if (!chain_cmem) goto block_err;
        fstReaderFseeko(xc, xc->f, indx_pos, SEEK_SET);
        fstFread(chain_cmem, chain_clen, 1, xc->f);

        if (vc_maxhandle > vc_maxhandle_largest) {
            free(chain_table);
            free(chain_table_lengths);

            vc_maxhandle_largest = vc_maxhandle;
[16]        chain_table = (fst_off_t *)calloc((vc_maxhandle + 1), sizeof(fst_off_t));
            chain_table_lengths = (uint32_t *)calloc((vc_maxhandle + 1), sizeof(uint32_t));
        }

```

The `chain_table` and `chain_table_lengths` buffers are cached across the parsing of the different FST blocks. However, initially `chain_table` and `chain_table_lengths` will be zero, so the initialization happens at [16], allocating `vc_maxhandle+1` items. `vc_maxhandle` should correspond to the number of VC elements in VCDATA.

The `chain` section and VCDATA have different formats depending on the `sectype`.

In the case of a `FST_BL_VCDATA` sectype, `chain_cmem` will contain a series of offsets into VCDATA, to point at each VC element. The code below is extracing offsets and lengths for each VC element:

```
     pnt = chain_cmem;
     idx = 0;
     pval = 0;

     if (sectype == FST_BL_VCDATA_DYN_ALIAS2) {
        ...
[17] } else {
         do {
             int skiplen;
[18]         uint64_t val = fstGetVarint32(pnt, &skiplen);

[19]         if (!val) {
                 pnt += skiplen;
                 val = fstGetVarint32(pnt, &skiplen);
                 chain_table[idx] = 0;            /* need to explicitly zero as calloc above might not run */
                 chain_table_lengths[idx] = -val; /* because during this loop iter would give stale data! */
                 idx++;
[20]         } else if (val & 1) {
                 pval = chain_table[idx] = pval + (val >> 1);
                 if (idx) {
                     chain_table_lengths[pidx] = pval - chain_table[pidx];
                 }
                 pidx = idx++;
[21]         } else {
                 fstHandle loopcnt = val >> 1;
                 for (i = 0; i < loopcnt; i++) {
                     chain_table[idx++] = 0;
                 }
             }

             pnt += skiplen;
         } while (pnt != (chain_cmem + chain_clen));
     }

     chain_table[idx] = indx_pos - vc_start;
     chain_table_lengths[pidx] = chain_table[idx] - chain_table[pidx];

```

For `FST_BL_VCDATA` and `FST_BL_VCDATA_DYN_ALIAS` sections, we enter the block at [17]. A varint is read [18]:

```
- if 0 [19] the element is set to 0
- if the LSB is 1 [20], the remaining 31 bits are the offset of the VC element in VCDATA
- otherwise [21], the remaining 31 bits represent the number of elements to zero out (skips a number of chain_table indexes)

```

At [21] lies the problem. Since we control val, we can choose how many zeros to write to `chain_table`. Recall that the `chain_table` size is controlled by `vc_maxhandle` [16], and there are no checks to make sure that `idx` stays within the bounds of `chain_table` in this loop. This clearly allows writing out-of-bounds in the heap.

After the loop ends, we also have the chance to write arbitrary values in the heap, after `idx` has been offset arbitrarily, by providing an odd value and writing it in the block at [20].

#### CVE-2023-35969 - `fstReaderIterBlocks2` `chain_table` legacy

By not checking whether `idx` fits within the size of the `chain_table` buffer, the loop in [21] will write out-of-bounds on the heap, leading to arbitrary code execution.

An attacker can control the allocation size of the `chain_table` buffer, and at the same time manipulate the `chain_mem` section in order to write NULLs out-of-bounds, shifting idx arbitrarily. An attacker can then write arbitrary values at the shifted memory offset by supplying more `chain_mem` varints.

#### CVE-2023-35970 - `fstReaderIterBlocks2` `chain_table` `FST_BL_VCDATA_DYN_ALIAS2`

`FST_BL_VCDATA_DYN_ALIAS2` is handled by an earlier condition block, but the issue and exploitation strategy is exactly the same:

```
     if (sectype == FST_BL_VCDATA_DYN_ALIAS2) {
         uint32_t prev_alias = 0;

         do {
             int skiplen;

             if (*pnt & 0x01) {
[23]             int64_t shval = fstGetSVarint64(pnt, &skiplen) >> 1;
                 if (shval > 0) {
                     pval = chain_table[idx] = pval + shval;
                     if (idx) {
                         chain_table_lengths[pidx] = pval - chain_table[pidx];
                     }
                     pidx = idx++;
                 } else if (shval < 0) {
                     chain_table[idx] = 0;                          /* need to explicitly zero as calloc above might not run */
                     chain_table_lengths[idx] = prev_alias = shval; /* because during this loop iter would give stale data! */
                     idx++;
                 } else {
                     chain_table[idx] = 0;                  /* need to explicitly zero as calloc above might not run */
                     chain_table_lengths[idx] = prev_alias; /* because during this loop iter would give stale data! */
                     idx++;
                 }
             } else {
                 uint64_t val = fstGetVarint32(pnt, &skiplen);

                 fstHandle loopcnt = val >> 1;
[22]             for (i = 0; i < loopcnt; i++) {
                     chain_table[idx++] = 0;
                 }
             }

             pnt += skiplen;
         } while (pnt != (chain_cmem + chain_clen));

```

By not checking whether `idx` fits within the size of the `chain_table` buffer, the loop at [22] will write out-of-bounds on the heap, leading to arbitrary code execution.

An attacker can control the allocation size of the `chain_table` buffer, and at the same time manipulate the `chain_mem` section in order to write NULLs out-of-bounds, shifting idx arbitrarily. An attacker can then write arbitrary values at the shifted memory offset by supplying more `chain_mem` varints.

A small difference between this and the legacy version is that a 64-bit varint is read at [23], while in the legacy format a 32-bit varint is read.
