Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2023-35161:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the lack of sanitization of the `xredirect` parameter in the `DeleteApplication` page of XWiki. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code through a crafted URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (RXSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS, where the injected script is reflected back to the user in the page.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application does not properly sanitize the `xredirect` parameter before using it in the page, allowing for the injection of malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser within the context of the vulnerable XWiki application.
- **Information Theft:** The injected JavaScript can be used to steal sensitive information such as cookies, session tokens, and other data from the user's browser.
- **Account Takeover:** An attacker could potentially perform actions on behalf of the victim if the session is compromised.
- **Malware Distribution:** The attacker could redirect the victim to malicious websites or distribute malware.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **URL Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL that includes the `xredirect` parameter with the payload.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick the victim into clicking on the malicious link. This could be achieved through phishing emails, compromised websites, or social media.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need any privileges on the XWiki application to exploit the vulnerability.
- **User Interaction Required:** The user needs to click on the crafted malicious link for the attack to be successful.
- **Network Access:** The attacker only requires network access to deliver the malicious URL to the victim.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists since XWiki 6.2-milestone-1.
- The vulnerability was fixed in XWiki versions 14.10.5 and 15.1-rc-1.
- The fix implemented a new macro (`getSanitizedURLAttributeValue`) to sanitize URLs in templates.
- The vulnerability is tracked as XWIKI-20614 in the XWiki Jira instance.
- The CVSS v3 base score for this vulnerability is 9.7, indicating a critical severity.

The information provided is consistent with the details expected for a reflected XSS vulnerability.
