Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-35173:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how the Nextcloud End-to-End Encryption app handles metadata files associated with file drops. By providing an invalid metadata file, an attacker can render previously dropped files inaccessible.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Improper Input Validation/Handling**: The application doesn't properly validate the metadata file, allowing an attacker to provide a malicious or invalid one. This leads to the inability to access the encrypted files.
- **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control):** Although the primary impact is availability, the root cause is related to access control in a broad sense. The vulnerability can be seen as a failure in access control because providing manipulated metadata can deny access to previously stored data.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Availability Impact**: The primary impact is a loss of availability of files dropped using the end-to-end encryption feature. Attackers can make previously uploaded files inaccessible. There is no loss of Confidentiality or Integrity.

**Attack vectors:**

-   **Network**: The attack can be performed remotely over a network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Low Privileges**: The attacker needs low privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
-   **User Interaction**: Requires some form of user interaction (e.g., user performing the file drop) or an attacker with the ability to interact with the application in a way that changes the metadata.
