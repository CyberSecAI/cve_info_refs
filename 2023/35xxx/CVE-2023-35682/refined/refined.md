Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-35682:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises from how the Launcher handles legacy shortcuts. When building a legacy shortcut, the Launcher calls `PackageManager#resolveActivity` to retrieve the necessary permissions to launch an intent. However, if the source app wraps an arbitrary intent within an `Intent#createChooser`, the existing logic fails because launching a chooser doesn't require additional permissions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Permission Check:** The Launcher fails to perform proper permission checks when an intent is wrapped within an `Intent#createChooser`. This allows a malicious app to bypass intended permission restrictions.
*   **Intent Wrapping:** The ability of a source app to wrap an arbitrary intent within `Intent#createChooser` is a key factor in triggering this vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow a malicious application to launch activities or access resources that it would normally not have permission to access, leading to a local elevation of privilege.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   A malicious app could create a legacy shortcut with an intent wrapped inside `Intent#createChooser`.
*   The user would need to interact with the shortcut for the exploit to occur.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have an app installed on the device that can create legacy shortcuts.
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious intent and wrap it with `Intent#createChooser`.
*  The attacker does not need additional execution privileges or user interaction beyond clicking on the shortcut.

**Additional Details:**
* The fix was introduced in commit `09f8b0e52e45a0b39bab457534ba2e5ae91ffad0` which performs permission check on the wrapped intent.
