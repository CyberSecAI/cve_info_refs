{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input validation in the CGI program, which allows injection of malicious scripts.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Cross-site scripting (XSS)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A successful XSS attack could result in the execution of stored malicious scripts, potentially leading to the stealing of cookies when a user visits the specific CGI page used for dumping ZTP logs.",
  "Attack vectors": "An unauthenticated attacker on the LAN can store malicious scripts on the vulnerable device.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be on the same LAN as the affected device and must be able to send HTTP requests to the device's web interface."
