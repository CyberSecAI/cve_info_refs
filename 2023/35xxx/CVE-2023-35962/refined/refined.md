Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-35962

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of input file names when handling compressed files. GTKWave uses `popen` to decompress files with `gzip`, `bzip2`, or `zip`. The program concatenates a decompression command with the input filename and executes it as a shell command. Because the filename is not sanitized, it is possible to inject shell commands via the filename.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **OS Command Injection:** The core issue is that the program constructs shell commands by directly concatenating a fixed decompression command with the potentially malicious filename, without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands.
*   **Use of `popen`:** The `popen` function executes a string as a shell command, which, when combined with unsanitized input, creates the command injection vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the victim's system with the privileges of the user running GTKWave.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Wave Files:** The primary attack vector is through specially crafted wave files with malicious filenames.
*   **File Opening:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user opens a malicious wave file using GTKWave, either through the UI (e.g., double-clicking the file) or command-line tools.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **File Creation:** The attacker needs to create a specially crafted wave file with a filename containing malicious shell commands.
*   **Victim Interaction:** The attacker needs to get the victim to open the malicious wave file with GTKWave. This could be achieved via email or other file sharing mechanisms.

**Specifics to CVE-2023-35962:**

*   **`vcd2vzt` `vcd_main` Decompression:** This specific vulnerability occurs in the `vcd_main()` function of the `vcd2vzt` program. When a `.gz` file is processed by vcd2vzt, a command is formed by prepending “gzip -cd “ to the file path, and then executing this via popen. This means that an attacker can control the file name, and hence inject malicious commands.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in GTKWave version 3.3.115 and earlier versions.
*   The vendor has released a patch in version 3.3.118 to address these issues.
*   The Debian LTS advisory indicates that the fix is included in version 3.3.98+really3.3.118-0+deb10u1 for Debian 10 buster.

This vulnerability is similar to CVE-2023-35959, CVE-2023-35960, CVE-2023-35961, CVE-2023-35963, and CVE-2023-35964, which were also fixed in GTKWave 3.3.118.
