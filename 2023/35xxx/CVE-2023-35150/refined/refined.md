Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2023-35150:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient escaping of a translation parameter within the XWiki Invitation application. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary code into a document reference, leading to the execution of that code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unescaped Translation Parameter:** The core issue is that the application does not properly sanitize user-provided input when used within a translation parameter. This enables the injection of malicious content.
*   **Code Injection:** By crafting a specific URL, an attacker can inject Groovy code into the document reference. Groovy, a scripting language supported by XWiki, is then executed by the server.
*   **Lack of CSRF Protection:** The vulnerability is exacerbated by the absence of CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection, enabling attacks via simple URL visits or embedding the malicious URL in an image reference within a document.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the XWiki application, potentially leading to a full compromise of the server.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** A user with only view rights can escalate their privileges to that of a user with programming rights through the injection of malicious code in the application.
*   **Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability Impact**: The CVSS metrics indicate a high impact on confidentiality and integrity and a low impact on availability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is performed over the network by crafting a malicious URL.
*   **URL Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL that includes the payload.
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The lack of CSRF protection makes it possible to trigger the attack by simply visiting a malicious link (or embedding it in an image reference on a page visited by the victim).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low Privileges:**  The attacker needs only view rights to any document to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to understand how to craft the specific payload for the translation parameter of the Invitation application to achieve remote code execution.

**Technical Details and Descriptions:**

*   **Affected Versions:** XWiki versions >= 2.4-m-2
*   **Patched Versions:** XWiki 15.0, 14.4.8, and 14.10.4
*   **Specific Example URL:** The advisory provides an example of a malicious URL ` <xwiki-host>/xwiki/bin/view/%5D%5D%20%7B%7Basync%20async%3D%22true%22%20cached%3D%22false%22%20context%3D%22doc.reference%22%7D%7D%7B%7Bgroovy%7D%7Dprintln(%22Hello%20%22%20%2B%20%22from%20groovy!%22)%7B%7B%2Fgroovy%7D%7D%7B%7B%2Fasync%7D%7D?sheet=Invitation.InvitationGuestActions&xpage=view ` which demonstrates how to inject a Groovy script.
*   **Vulnerable Documents:** While the `Invitation.InvitationGuestActions` document is explicitly vulnerable as per the example URL, other documents such as `Invitation.InvitationMemberActions`, `Invitation.InvitationMailClass` and `Invitation.InvitationCommon` may also be affected under specific circumstances. `Invitation.InvitationConfig` is explicitly listed as not exploitable.

**Patch Information**
* The provided commit `b65220a4d86b8888791c3b643074ebca5c089a3a` addresses the vulnerability by improving the escaping of parameters within the Invitation application. Additionally, it introduces an internal role to identify documents provided by an extension and includes an automatic fix during upgrades to address potential escaping issues in generated code. The commit also modifies the `xwiki-platform-index` to split the index-api from index-default, allowing the use of the api in oldcore.
