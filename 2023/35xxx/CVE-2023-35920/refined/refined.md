- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper processing of specially crafted IP packets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Uncontrolled resource consumption due to the inability to handle specially crafted IP packets.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can cause a denial of service condition. The affected devices must be manually restarted.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending specially crafted IP packets to the device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An unauthenticated remote attacker is sufficient.
