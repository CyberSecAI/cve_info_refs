*   The GitHub commit `859eae2b2acf751ae7db3c9ffefe275aa5da0d5d` and merged pull request `b07e528feb3a5ffa66bdcc358549edd73e4c8a12` are both related to fixing this vulnerability in Gradle.
*   Therefore, the provided content is relevant to CVE-2023-35946.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause:**
    *   The vulnerability is caused by a path traversal issue within Gradle's dependency cache. Gradle uses dependency coordinates to create file paths within its cache, and by crafting malicious coordinates, it's possible to force Gradle to write files to unintended locations.
*  **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**:
    *   Path Traversal (CWE-22):  Improper sanitization of dependency coordinates allows an attacker to write files to arbitrary locations, outside the designated cache directory.
	 *   Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere (CWE-829):  Gradle does not properly validate that the dependency coordinates used to create cache paths are safe.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Data Modification/Addition:**  Attackers can potentially overwrite or add new, malicious files within the Gradle dependency cache. This can lead to supply chain attacks, where legitimate dependencies are replaced with compromised versions.
	 *  **Arbitrary File Write:** An attacker could also overwrite important files on the filesystem where the Gradle process has write access, not limited to the dependency cache.
	 *  **Supply Chain Compromise:** An attacker could inject malicious code by modifying cached dependencies.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Dependency Repository Compromise:** Attackers can insert malicious coordinates into a dependency repository used by a Gradle build.
    *  **Build Configuration Manipulation:** Attackers can modify a build configuration to use the malicious coordinates and trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Attackers need control over a dependency repository or the ability to modify the build's configuration.
    *   Attackers need write permissions on the target filesystem.
*   **Affected Gradle versions:**
    *   Gradle versions prior to 7.6.2 are affected
	*   Gradle version 8.0 prior to 8.2 are affected
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Upgrade to Gradle version 7.6.2 or 8.2.
    *   Enable dependency verification to detect tampered files in the dependency cache and ensure that builds use expected artifacts only. This measure increases the difficulty of exploitation by requiring trusted keys for dependency signing and metadata verification, but does not prevent the arbitrary file write itself.
