Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the identified vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-35934

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how `yt-dlp` and potentially other downloaders handle cookies during HTTP redirects and when downloading fragments from different hosts than their parent manifest. Cookies, which are intended to be specific to a certain domain or path, were being passed as a generic `Cookie` header to the file downloader, losing their intended scope. This allowed for potential leakage of sensitive cookies to unintended destinations if redirects or sub-resource downloads occurred on a different host.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cookie Leakage:**  The primary weakness is that cookies, which should be scoped to a specific domain, are passed in a generic `Cookie` header to the file downloader, ignoring domain and path restrictions.
- **Unvalidated Redirects:** The vulnerability is exploitable by injecting redirects to attacker-controlled servers where the leaked cookies could be captured, since the URL for a download is not verified before use.
- **External Downloader Cookie Handling:** External downloaders, when not using their internal cookie handling, could also leak cookies if they used `http_headers`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker could potentially steal sensitive cookie information, leading to unauthorized access to user accounts or other data associated with the cookies.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Website:** Attackers can craft malicious websites with embedded URLs that redirect to an attacker controlled server.
- **Manipulated Manifest:** Attackers could manipulate media manifests (e.g. HLS, DASH) to include resources or redirects pointing to attacker-controlled servers.
- **External tools:** Other tools might also use yt-dlp's info.json output (with the `http_headers.Cookie`), also causing cookie leaks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to create or manipulate links:** The attacker needs to be able to create links that can be parsed by `yt-dlp` (e.g., in a malicious website or by manipulating a playlist)
- **Ability to set up a server**: The attacker needs to control a server that the malicious redirect will point to.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is present in versions of `youtube-dl`, `youtube-dlc`, and `yt-dlp` released since 2015-01-25.
*   The vulnerability affects both native and external downloaders, except `curl` and `httpie` (3.1.0 or later).
*   `yt-dlp` version 2023.07.06 and later, nightly builds from 2023.07.06.185519 mitigate the vulnerability by:
    *   Removing the `Cookie` header upon HTTP redirects.
    *   Having native downloaders calculate their own `Cookie` header from the cookiejar.
    *   Utilizing external downloaders' built-in support for cookies when available.
    *   Disabling HTTP redirection for `axel`, if it does not support cookies
    *   Limiting the scope of cookies passed via the `--add-header Cookie:` option
    *   Storing cookies separately in the info dict.
*   `youtube-dl` has also received patches that fix this issue, though it is considered a legacy project
