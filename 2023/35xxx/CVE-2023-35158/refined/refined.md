Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-35158:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of the `xredirect` parameter within the `restore.vm` template in XWiki. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the URL, which is then executed when a user interacts with the page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (RXSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. The `xredirect` parameter is directly used in the template's HTML without proper encoding or validation, allowing for the injection of malicious JavaScript.
*   **Insecure URL Handling:** The application fails to sanitize or validate the `xredirect` URL parameter before incorporating it into the HTML.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to:

*   **Execute arbitrary JavaScript:** By injecting malicious JavaScript code, an attacker can perform various actions, such as stealing cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, performing actions on behalf of the user within the application, or modifying the displayed content of the page.
*   **Full compromise of user:**  An attacker can potentially fully compromise a user's session by executing arbitrary actions within the application.
*   **Data manipulation:** An attacker can modify or view any information a user has access to.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **URL Manipulation:** An attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the JavaScript payload within the `xredirect` parameter.
*   **User Interaction:** The vulnerability requires user interaction in the form of visiting the malicious link and potentially clicking the cancel button within the restore template for the JavaScript to be triggered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Craft Malicious URLs:** The attacker needs to create a URL that includes the malicious JavaScript within the `xredirect` parameter.
*   **Victim must Visit Malicious URL:** The attacker needs to lure the victim to visit the crafted malicious URL.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists since XWiki version 9.4-rc-1.
*   The vulnerability was patched in XWiki 14.10.5 and 15.1-rc-1.
*   The fix involved the introduction of a new macro  `#getSanitizedURLAttributeValue` for sanitizing URL attributes in templates
*   The vulnerability was reported by Ren√© de Sain (@renniepak).
*   The vulnerability is related to other similar issues in delete and deletespace templates, which were also caused by the vulnerable `xredirect` parameter.
