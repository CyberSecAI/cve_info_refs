# RXSS via xredirect parameter in restore template

Critical

[surli](/surli)
published
GHSA-mwxj-g7fw-7hc8
Jun 22, 2023

## Package

maven

org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-flamingo-skin-resources
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

> 9.4-rc-1

## Patched versions

14.10.5,15.1-rc-1

## Description

### Impact

Users are able to forge an URL with a payload allowing to inject Javascript in the page (XSS).

It's possible to exploit the restore template to perform a XSS, e.g. by using URL such as:

> /xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/Main?xpage=restore&showBatch=true&xredirect=javascript:alert(document.domain)

This vulnerability exists since XWiki 9.4-rc-1.

### Patches

The vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 14.10.5 and 15.1-rc-1.

### Workarounds

It's possible to workaround the vulnerability by editing the template restore.vm to perform checks on it, but note that the appropriate fix involves new APIs that have been recently introduced in XWiki. See the referenced jira tickets.

### References

* Vulnerability in restore template: <https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-20352>
* Introduction of the macro used for fixing this vulnerability: <https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-20583>
* Commit containing the actual fix in the template: [d547210](https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/d5472100606c8355ed44ada273e91df91f682738)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

#### Description

**SUBMISSION REFERENCES**

* **Submission code**: XWIKI-JYQ2GU1E
* **Submission URL**: <https://www.intigriti.com/auth/dashboard?redirect=/submissions/e95a7ad5-7029-4627-abf0-3e3e3ea0b4ce/XWIKI-JYQ2GU1E>

**RESEARCHER INFORMATION**

* **Submitter**: renniepak

**SUBMISSION INFORMATION**

* **Created at**: Wed, 09 Nov 2022 14:28:57 GMT
* **Submission status**: Archived

**REPORT CONTENT**

* **Severity**: Medium
* **Domain**: <https://intigriti.xwiki.com/> (Url)
* **Proof of concept**: Hi XWiki team,

I found a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability in the restore.vm template.

1. 1. Reproduction

1. Navigate to: <https://intigriti.xwiki.com/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/Main?xpage=restore&showBatch=true&xredirect=javascript:alert(document.domain>)

2. Click the cancel button.

1. 1. Result

As soon as the cancel button is clicked our XSS payload triggers:

{709359}

Vulnerable code snippet:

<https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/blob/244dbbaa0738a0c40b19929c0369c8b62ae5236e/xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-flamingo/xwiki-platform-flamingo-skin/xwiki-platform-flamingo-skin-resources/src/main/resources/flamingo/restore.vm#L176>

* **Impact**: If an attacker can control a script that is executed in the victim's browser, then they can typically fully compromise that user. Amongst other things, the attacker can:

* Perform any action within the application that the user can perform.
* View any information that the user is able to view.
* Modify any information that the user is able to modify.
* **Personal data involved**: No
* **Recommended solution**: In general, effectively preventing XSS vulnerabilities is likely to involve a combination of the following measures:

* \***Filter input on arrival.**\* At the point where user input is received, filter as strictly as possible based on what is expected or valid input.
* \***Encode data on output.**\* At the point where user-controllable data is output in HTTP responses, encode the output to prevent it from being interpreted as active content. Depending on the output context, this might require applying combinations of HTML, URL, JavaScript, and CSS encoding.
* \***Use appropriate response headers.**\* To prevent XSS in HTTP responses that aren't intended to contain any HTML or JavaScript, you can use the Content-Type and X-Content-Type-Options headers to ensure that browsers interpret the responses in the way you intend.
* \***Content Security Policy.**\* As a last line of defense, you can use Content Security Policy (CSP) to reduce the severity of any XSS vulnerabilities that still occur.
* **Endpoint**: <https://intigriti.xwiki.com/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/Main?xpage=restore&showBatch=true&xredirect=javascript:alert(document.domain>)
* **Type**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting
