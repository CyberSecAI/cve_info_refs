Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-35964:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of input filenames when they are used in shell commands. Specifically, when GTKWave opens a file, it uses `popen` to execute external decompression programs like `gzip` or `bzip2`. The input file name is directly concatenated to the decompression command without any sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **OS Command Injection:** The vulnerability is an OS command injection (CWE-78). The application constructs a shell command using an unsanitized input filename, which allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.
- **Use of `popen`:** The use of `popen` to execute shell commands is the key to the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker can achieve arbitrary command execution on the system where GTKWave is running. This can lead to:
    - Data theft
    - System compromise
    - Malware installation
    - Denial of service

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Maliciously Crafted Wave Files:** The primary attack vector is through specially crafted wave files with filenames containing malicious shell commands.
- **File Opening:** The victim needs to open a malicious file (e.g., by double-clicking, or through command-line).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Craft a malicious wave file:** The attacker needs to be able to create a specially crafted wave file (e.g. a .ghw, .vcd.gz) with a filename containing a malicious shell command.
- **Victim interaction:** The attacker needs a victim to open the crafted file using GTKWave. This can be achieved by various methods like email attachment, download from websites, etc.

**Specific details for CVE-2023-35964:**

- **Vulnerable Code:** The vulnerability specifically exists in the `vcd_main` function within the `vcd2lxt.c` file when processing compressed files with a `.gz` extension.
- The vulnerable code snippet:
```c
    TimeType vcd_main(char *fname, char *lxname, int dostats, int doclock, int dochg, int dodict, int linear)
    {
    ...
    if((strlen(fname)>2)&&(!strcmp(fname+strlen(fname)-3,".gz")))
        {
        char *str;
        int dlen;
        dlen=strlen(WAVE_DECOMPRESSOR);
        str=(char *)wave_alloca(strlen(fname)+dlen+1);
        strcpy(str,WAVE_DECOMPRESSOR);
        strcpy(str+dlen,fname);
        vcd_handle=popen(str,"r");
        vcd_is_compressed=~0;
```
- The code checks if the filename ends with `.gz` and then constructs a command string by prepending "gzip -cd " to the filename. This string is passed to `popen`, leading to command injection if the filename contains malicious code.

**Additional Notes:**

- This vulnerability is one of a set of similar vulnerabilities in GTKWave related to command injection through the decompression functionality.
- The provided content explicitly mentions the affected versions as GTKWave 3.3.115 and the fix is available in version 3.3.118.
- The Debian LTS advisory also confirms the fix for this CVE.
