**Additional Notes:**

*   Many of these vulnerabilities involve use-after-free conditions, which are common and often difficult to exploit reliably.
*   Several vulnerabilities affect the network stack and rely on  `CAP_NET_ADMIN`, a capability that provides network management privileges.
*  Multiple issues can potentially lead to denial of service and privilege escalation.
*   The NetApp advisory indicates that these CVEs are applicable to their products using the affected Linux kernel versions. The NetApp advisory also notes that exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to sensitive information disclosure or modification of data.

It is important to note that the "security impact of this is unclear" for some vulnerabilities, meaning that the full extent of potential harm is unknown. However, any vulnerability that can lead to a use-after-free or out-of-bounds read/write should be treated with high severity.
