CVE ID: CVE-2023-35794

Vendor: Cassia Networks

Product: Access Controller

Version: Cassia-AC-2.1.1.2303271039

---

Vulnerability: Incorrect Access Control

Affected: web ssh, gateways

Decription: WebSSH session can be hijacked

Status: Confirmed by vendor, Fixed

Version Patched: Cassia-AC-2.1.1.2308181707

---

#### Details

Cassia uses WebSSH2 by billchurch to initiate SSH sessions from AC to Gateways. WebSSH2 Is a web SSH Client which uses ssh2, socket.io, xterm.js, and express.
A bare bones example of an HTML5 web-based terminal emulator and SSH client. It uses SSH2 as a client on a host to proxy a Websocket/Socket.io connection to a SSH2 server.

When a session of WebSSH is established with Gateway Device any external user can hijack it without any authentication and authorization.

Session establishment is done via GET request to proper
`/ap/remote/<mac>?ssh_port=<ac-rev-ssh-port>`
Gateway then receiving request through MQTT (or CAPWAP) channel
and establishes SSH tunnel with local port forwarding to Access Controller.
Then Access-Controller binds to the forwarded port with SSH Web Session.
The user who invoked the web ssh session is redirected to
`/ssh/host` but the session cookie is not validated.
The new WebSSH2 cookie is provided with 401 error.

In fact a user is being asked for providing Basic auth.
[![Alt text](/Dodge-MPTC/CVE-2023-35794-WebSSH-Hijacking/raw/main/img/2.png)](/Dodge-MPTC/CVE-2023-35794-WebSSH-Hijacking/blob/main/img/2.png)
Obtained Basic authentication credentials are sent in next requests
and potentially consumed by webssh2.bundle.js as credentials used to authenticate
to the choosen device.
[![Alt text](/Dodge-MPTC/CVE-2023-35794-WebSSH-Hijacking/raw/main/img/3.png)](/Dodge-MPTC/CVE-2023-35794-WebSSH-Hijacking/blob/main/img/3.png)

This allows unathorized to Access Controller portal User to hijack already existing SSH session with only knowing SSH username and password (note that
this commonly may be default `cassia:cassia-<last-mac-6-digits>`).

---

#### Exploitation

An attacker may use [CVE-2023-35793](https://github.com/Dodge-MPTC/CVE-2023-35793-CSRF-On-Web-SSH) to trick any athenticated user to initiate
a session to any device connected to the AC (note that the user does not need to login into the gateway, the session itself will be initiated with only exploiting CVE-2023-35793 CSRF). Then using this vulnerability
and knowing the MAC address an attacker may easily obtain access to the device
through WebSSH.

Lets assume an attacker triggered someone and the session is established
to the gateway where the default credentials are used.

1. Attacker just opens the web browser and enters default credentials for known device.

2. Attacker knowing which device were triggered provides default credentials (commonly these are not being changed)

3. Attacker is authenticated to device LXC container as a user which has root rights by default

# CVE-2023-35794-WebSSH-Hijacking

Repository contains description for CVE-2023-35794 discovered by Dodge Industrial Team for Dodge OPTIFY platfrom.

---

CVE ID: CVE-2023-35794

Vendor: Cassia Networks

Product: Access Controller

Version: Cassia-AC-2.1.1.2303271039

---

Vulnerability: Incorrect Access Control

Affected: web ssh, gateways

Decription: WebSSH session can be hijacked

Status: Confirmed by vendor, Fixed

Version Patched: Cassia-AC-2.1.1.2308181707

---

#### Details

Cassia uses WebSSH2 by billchurch to initiate SSH sessions from AC to Gateways.

WebSSH2 Is a web SSH Client which uses ssh2, socket.io, xterm.js, and express.

A bare bones example of an HTML5 web-based terminal emulator and SSH client.

It uses SSH2 as a client on a host to proxy a Websocket/Socket.io connection to a SSH2 server.

When a session of WebSSH is established with Gateway Device any external user can hijack it without any authentication and authorization.

Session establishment is done via GET request to proper
> `/ap/remote/<mac>?ssh_port=<ac-rev-ssh-port>`

Gateway then receiving request through MQTT (or CAPWAP) channel

and establishes SSH tunnel with local port forwarding to Access Controller.

Then Access-Controller binds to the forwarded port with SSH Web Session.

The user who invoked the web ssh session is redirected to

`/ssh/host` but the session cookie is not validated.

The new WebSSH2 cookie is provided with 401 error.

In fact a user is being asked for providing Basic auth.

![](img/2.png)

Obtained Basic authentication credentials are sent in next requests

and potentially consumed by webssh2.bundle.js as credentials used to authenticate

to the choosen device.

![](img/4.png)

This allows unathorized to Access Controller portal User to hijack already existing SSH session

with only knowing SSH username and password (note that this commonly may be default

`cassia:cassia-<last-mac-6-digits>`).

---

#### Exploitation

An attacker may use [CVE-2023-35793](https://github.com/Dodge-MPTC/CVE-2023-35793-CSRF-On-Web-SSH) to trick any athenticated user

to initiate a session to any device connected to the AC (note that the user does not need to login into the gateway,

the session itself will be initiated with only exploiting CVE-2023-35793 CSRF). Then using this vulnerability and knowing the MAC address

an attacker may easily obtain access to the device through WebSSH.

Lets assume an attacker triggered someone and the session is established to the gateway where the default credentials are used.

1) Attacker just opens the web browser and enters default credentials for known device.

2) Attacker knowing which device were triggered provides default credentials (commonly these are not being changed)

![](img/6.png)

3) Attacker is authenticated to device LXC container as a user which has root rights by default
