        "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from Lua rules being enabled by default in Suricata, which could expose the system to supply chain attacks.",

          "Lua rules enabled by default",
          "Potential supply chain attack vector via malicious lua rules."

       "additional_notes": "The fix involves disabling Lua rules by default. They can be enabled by changing the 'security.lua.allow-rules' setting in the suricata.yaml configuration file. This change was made to mitigate supply chain attack risks."
