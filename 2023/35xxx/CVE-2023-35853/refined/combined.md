## A rich history of open source contribution

Stamus Networks has a long history of developing and supporting open source technologies. The company was founded by Éric Leblond and Peter Manev, two open source icons.

Éric and Peter are on [the board of directors and executive team for the OISF](https://oisf.net/team/) (the governing body for Suricata), respectively. And they are active developers on the [Suricata project](https://suricata.io/), the widely-deployed open source intrusion detection and network security monitoring engine. The OISF is a non-profit organization created to build community and to support open source security technologies like Suricata.

In addition to our extensive contributions to Suricata itself, our team at Stamus Labs have six active projects underway.

* Since 2014, we have developed and maintained [SELKS](/selks?hsLang=en) (now known as Clear NDR™ - Community), the popular turnkey Suricata-based open source intrusion detection system (IDS), Network Security Monitor (NSM) and threat hunting system.
* In 2020, we introduced the [Stamus App for Splunk](/stamus-networks-app-for-splunk?hsLang=en) which is a free and open source Splunk app for investigating and hunting in the IDS alert data and the protocol transaction logs generated by Suricata sensors. This Splunk app also provides complete access to data from Stamus Security Platform.
* Also in 2020, we introduced [GopherCAP](/gophercap?hsLang=en), an innovative PCAP manipulation application that provides accurate playback of extra large PCAP files directly from tar archives.
* In January 2022, we introduced the [Suricata Language Server](/suricata-language-server?hsLang=en), a tool that adds syntax checking, performance guidance, and auto-completion to popular text editors for Suricata signature developers.
* In November 2022, we published the "[Security Analyst's Guide to Suricata](/suricata-4-analysts?hsLang=en)" - the world's first practical guide for unlocking the full potential of Suricata. Written for security operations center (SOC) analysts and threat hunters who use Suricata to gain insights into what is taking place on their networks, the book provides vital information on entry points and in-depth analysis on the most important Suricata features.
* Also, in November 2022, we introduced the [free Suricata ruleset](/lateral-movement-ruleset-for-suricata?hsLang=en) specifically focused on detecting lateral movement in Microsoft Windows environments
* In 2023, we introduced the [Jupyter Playbooks for Suricata](/jupyter-playbooks-for-suricata?hsLang=en)
* Also in 2023, Stamus Networks introduced a set of free [newly-registered domain threat intelligence feeds (Open NRD)](/stamus-labs/subscribe-to-threat-intel-feed?hsLang=en), optimized for Suricata.
