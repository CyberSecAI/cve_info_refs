An authenticated remote command injection vulnerability exists in the ArubaOS web-based management interface. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability results in the ability to execute arbitrary commands as a privileged user on the underlying operating system. This allows an attacker to fully compromise the underlying operating system on the device running ArubaOS.
