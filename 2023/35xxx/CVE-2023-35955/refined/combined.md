# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2023-1785

## GTKWave FST fstReaderIterBlocks2 VCDATA parsing heap-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities

##### January 8, 2024

##### CVE Number

CVE-2023-35956,CVE-2023-35957,CVE-2023-35958,CVE-2023-35955

##### SUMMARY

Multiple heap-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist in the fstReaderIterBlocks2 VCDATA parsing functionality of GTKWave 3.3.115. A specially-crafted .fst file can lead to arbitrary code execution. A victim would need to open a malicious file to trigger these vulnerabilities.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

GTKWave 3.3.115

##### PRODUCT URLS

GTKWave - <https://gtkwave.sourceforge.net>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

7.8 - CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

##### CWE

CWE-119 - Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer

##### DETAILS

GTKWave is a wave viewer, often used to analyze FPGA simulations and logic analyzer captures. It uses a graphical user interface to convert the traces across several file formats (`.lxt`, `.lxt2`, `.vzt`, `.fst`, `.ghw`, `.vcd`, `.evcd`) either by using the UI or its command line tools. GTKWave is available for Linux, Windows and MacOS. Trace files can be shared within teams or organizations, for example to compare results of simulation runs across different design implementations, to analyze protocols captured with logic analyzers or just as a reference when porting design implementations. GTKWave also sets up mime types for its supported extensions.

GTKWave sets up mime types for its supported extensions. So, for example, itâ€™s enough for a victim to double-click on a wave file received by e-mail to trigger the vulnerabilities described in this advisory.

The function `fstReaderOpen` is used to parse `.fst` files.

```
     void *fstReaderOpen(const char *nam)
     {
[1]  struct fstReaderContext *xc = (struct fstReaderContext *)calloc(1, sizeof(struct fstReaderContext));

[2]  if((!nam)||(!(xc->f=fopen(nam, "rb"))))
             {
             free(xc);
             xc=NULL;
             }
             else
             {
             int flen = strlen(nam);
             char *hf = (char *)calloc(1, flen + 6);
             int rc;

     #if defined(FST_UNBUFFERED_IO)
             setvbuf(xc->f, (char *)NULL, _IONBF, 0);   /* keeps gzip from acting weird in tandem with fopen */
     #endif

             memcpy(hf, nam, flen);
             strcpy(hf + flen, ".hier");
             xc->fh = fopen(hf, "rb");

             free(hf);
             xc->filename = strdup(nam);
[3]          rc = fstReaderInit(xc);

```

At [1] the `xc` structure is created, a big (about 65KB) structure thatâ€™s used to hold information regarding the `.fst` file.

At [2] the `xc->f` field is set to the file pointer returned by `fopen` after opening the file being parsed.

Then, the function `fstReaderInit` is called [3] to parse the various `.fst` sections from the input file.

```
     int fstReaderInit(struct fstReaderContext *xc)
     {
     fst_off_t blkpos = 0;
     fst_off_t endfile;
     uint64_t seclen;
     int sectype;
     uint64_t vc_section_count_actual = 0;
     int hdr_incomplete = 0;
     int hdr_seen = 0;
     int gzread_pass_status = 1;

     sectype = fgetc(xc->f);
     ...
     if(gzread_pass_status)
             {
             fstReaderFseeko(xc, xc->f, 0, SEEK_END);
             endfile = ftello(xc->f);

             while(blkpos < endfile)
                     {
                     fstReaderFseeko(xc, xc->f, blkpos, SEEK_SET);

[4]                  sectype = fgetc(xc->f);
                     seclen = fstReaderUint64(xc->f);

                     if(sectype == EOF)
                             {
                             break;
                             }

[5]                  if((hdr_incomplete) && (!seclen))
                             {
                             break;
                             }

[6]                  if(!hdr_seen && (sectype != FST_BL_HDR))
                             {
                             break;
                             }

                     blkpos++;
                     ...

```

At [4], the `sectype` (1 byte) is read off the file. This variable will tell us which kind of sector weâ€™re parsing. The checks at [5] and [6] are important because we donâ€™t want to trigger them in order to reach the vulnerable code: we need to make sure `hdr_incomplete` stays 0 and that we start with a `FST_BL_HDR` sector, which will set `hdr_seen` to 1.

So, if the input file starts with a `0x00`, weâ€™ll land inside the following condition:

```
     ...
     if(sectype == FST_BL_HDR)
             {
             if(!hdr_seen)
                     {
                     int ch;
                     double dcheck;

                     xc->start_time = fstReaderUint64(xc->f);
                     xc->end_time = fstReaderUint64(xc->f);

[7]                  hdr_incomplete = (xc->start_time == 0) && (xc->end_time == 0);

                     ...
[8]                  hdr_seen = 1;

[9]                  xc->mem_used_by_writer = fstReaderUint64(xc->f);
                     xc->scope_count = fstReaderUint64(xc->f);
                     xc->var_count = fstReaderUint64(xc->f);
                     ...
                     }
             }
     ...

```

After parsing the header, `fstReaderInit` then proceeds to parse other blocks which are not relevant for this advisory.

Upon return from `fstReaderOpen`, GTKWave eventually calls `fstReaderIterBlocks2` to parse all VCDATA blocks, as they havenâ€™t been fully parsed in `fstReaderInit`.

`fstReaderIterBlocks2` is a pretty large function, so weâ€™ll focus on the interesting lines only:

```
     int fstReaderIterBlocks2(void *ctx,
                              void (*value_change_callback)(void *user_callback_data_pointer, uint64_t time, fstHandle facidx, const unsigned char *value),
                              void (*value_change_callback_varlen)(void *user_callback_data_pointer, uint64_t time, fstHandle facidx, const unsigned char *value, uint32_t len),
                              void *user_callback_data_pointer, FILE *fv) {
         struct fstReaderContext *xc = (struct fstReaderContext *)ctx;

         uint64_t previous_time = UINT64_MAX;
         uint64_t *time_table = NULL;
         uint64_t tsec_nitems;
         unsigned int secnum = 0;
         int blocks_skipped = 0;
         fst_off_t blkpos = 0;
         uint64_t seclen, beg_tim;
         uint64_t end_tim;
         uint64_t frame_uclen, frame_clen, frame_maxhandle, vc_maxhandle;
         fst_off_t vc_start;
         fst_off_t indx_pntr, indx_pos;
         fst_off_t *chain_table = NULL;
         uint32_t *chain_table_lengths = NULL;
         unsigned char *chain_cmem;
         unsigned char *pnt;
         long chain_clen;
         fstHandle idx, pidx = 0, i;
         uint64_t pval;
         uint64_t vc_maxhandle_largest = 0;
         uint64_t tsec_uclen = 0, tsec_clen = 0;
         int sectype;
         uint64_t mem_required_for_traversal;
         unsigned char *mem_for_traversal = NULL;
         uint32_t traversal_mem_offs;
         uint32_t *scatterptr, *headptr, *length_remaining;
         uint32_t cur_blackout = 0;
         int packtype;
         unsigned char *mc_mem = NULL;
         uint32_t mc_mem_len; /* corresponds to largest value encountered in chain_table_lengths[i] */
         int dumpvars_state = 0;

         ...
[10]     for (;;) {
             uint32_t *tc_head = NULL;
             traversal_mem_offs = 0;

             fstReaderFseeko(xc, xc->f, blkpos, SEEK_SET);

[11]         sectype = fgetc(xc->f);
             seclen = fstReaderUint64(xc->f);

             if ((sectype == EOF) || (sectype == FST_BL_SKIP)) {
     #ifdef FST_DEBUG
                 fprintf(stderr, FST_APIMESS "<< EOF >>\n");
     #endif
                 break;
             }

             blkpos++;
[12]         if ((sectype != FST_BL_VCDATA) && (sectype != FST_BL_VCDATA_DYN_ALIAS) && (sectype != FST_BL_VCDATA_DYN_ALIAS2)) {
                 blkpos += seclen;
                 continue;
             }

             if (!seclen) break;
         ...

```

As previously said, all blocks are scanned [10], and only the blocks with a `sectype` [11] containing VCDATA are parsed [12]. These blocks are `FST_BL_VCDATA`, `FST_BL_VCDATA_DYN_ALIAS` and `FST_BL_VCDATA_DYN_ALIAS2`.

```
 ...
 mem_required_for_traversal = fstReaderUint64(xc->f);
 mem_for_traversal = (unsigned char *)malloc(mem_required_for_traversal + 66); /* add in potential fastlz overhead */
 ...

```

Later the `mem_required_for_traversal` is a 64-bit (big endian) integer, taken directly from the .FST file, which is used to allocate the `mem_for_traversal` buffer. This buffer will be used to parse the VC (Value Change) data off the input file.

Later on, the code extracts the start of the VCDATA section [13] and the compression type [14]:

```
        fstReaderFseeko(xc, xc->f, (fst_off_t)frame_clen, SEEK_CUR); /* skip past compressed data */

        vc_maxhandle = fstReaderVarint64(xc->f);
[13]    vc_start = ftello(xc->f); /* points to '!' character */
[14]    packtype = fgetc(xc->f);

```

Right after this, the `chain_clen` is extracted, which is the size of the `chain` section, extracted at [16].

```
        indx_pntr = blkpos + seclen - 24 - tsec_clen - 8;
        fstReaderFseeko(xc, xc->f, indx_pntr, SEEK_SET);
[15]    chain_clen = fstReaderUint64(xc->f);
        indx_pos = indx_pntr - chain_clen;
        ...
[16]    chain_cmem = (unsigned char *)malloc(chain_clen);
        if (!chain_cmem) goto block_err;
        fstReaderFseeko(xc, xc->f, indx_pos, SEEK_SET);
        fstFread(chain_cmem, chain_clen, 1, xc->f);

        if (vc_maxhandle > vc_maxhandle_largest) {
            free(chain_table);
            free(chain_table_lengths);

            vc_maxhandle_largest = vc_maxhandle;
[17]        chain_table = (fst_off_t *)calloc((vc_maxhandle + 1), sizeof(fst_off_t));
[18]        chain_table_lengths = (uint32_t *)calloc((vc_maxhandle + 1), sizeof(uint32_t));
        }

```

The `chain_table` is cached across the parsing of the different FST blocks. However, initially `chain_table` will be zero, so the initialization happens at [17], allocating `vc_maxhandle+1` items. `vc_maxhandle` corresponds to the number of VC elements in VCDATA.

The `chain` section and VCDATA have different formats depending on the `sectype`.

In the case of a `FST_BL_VCDATA` sectype, `chain_cmem` will contain a serie of offsets into VCDATA, to point at each VC element. The code below is extracing offsets and lengths for each VC element:

```
     pnt = chain_cmem;
     idx = 0;
     pval = 0;

     if (sectype == FST_BL_VCDATA_DYN_ALIAS2) {
        ...
[19] } else {
         do {
             int skiplen;
             uint64_t val = fstGetVarint32(pnt, &skiplen);

[20]         if (!val) {
                 pnt += skiplen;
                 val = fstGetVarint32(pnt, &skiplen);
                 chain_table[idx] = 0;            /* need to explicitly zero as calloc above might not run */
                 chain_table_lengths[idx] = -val; /* because during this loop iter would give stale data! */
                 idx++;
[21]         } else if (val & 1) {
                 pval = chain_table[idx] = pval + (val >> 1);
                 if (idx) {
                     chain_table_lengths[pidx] = pval - chain_table[pidx];
                 }
                 pidx = idx++;
[22]         } else {
                 fstHandle loopcnt = val >> 1;
                 for (i = 0; i < loopcnt; i++) {
                     chain_table[idx++] = 0;
                 }
             }

             pnt += skiplen;
         } while (pnt != (chain_cmem + chain_clen));
     }

     chain_table[idx] = indx_pos - vc_start;
     chain_table_lengths[pidx] = chain_table[idx] - chain_table[pidx];

```

For `FST_BL_VCDATA` and `FST_BL_VCDATA_DYN_ALIAS` sections, we enter the block at [19]. A varint is read:

```
- if 0 [20] the element is set to 0
- if the LSB is 1 [21], the remaining 31 bits are the offset of the VC element in VCDATA
- otherwise, the remaining 31 bits represent the number of elements to zero out

```

The important thing to understand from the above encoding is that we can define semi-arbitrary offsets and lengths by controlling `chain_cmem`.

After the `chain_table` has been parsed, it is used to extract VCDATA.

```
     mc_mem_len = 16384;
     mc_mem = (unsigned char *)malloc(mc_mem_len); /* buffer for compressed reads */

     /* check compressed VC data */
     if (idx > xc->maxhandle) idx = xc->maxhandle;

```

The point of the code above is to decompress or copy each element of VCDATA into the `mem_for_traversal` buffer.

For each element [23] in VCDATA, the file cursor is set to the relative element within VCDATA [24], using the chain table previously built. The first value in VCDATA tells us if weâ€™re dealing with a compressed or uncompressed VC element.

If `val` is not 0, then thereâ€™s compression and `val` represents `destlen` (see below).

Then `mu` buffer (`u` stands for uncompressed) is set to `mem_for_traversal` (`traversal_mem_offs` is initially 0). Recall that we have full control on the size of `mem_for_traversal` via a specific field (`mem_required_for_traversal`) in the `.fst` file, and this field does not depend nor influence on any of the chain table fields.

The `mc` buffer (`c` stands for compressed) is also allocated, with a size of `sourcelen`.

At [26], the `destlen` for the `mu` buffer is set from `val`. This is a 32-bit varint. This is the uncompressed size of the current VC element.

At [27], the `sourcelen` is set from the precalculated `chain_table`. This is the compressed size of the current VC element.

At [28], the compressed VC element is read into `mc`.

At [29], depending on the compression type, the `mc` (compressed) buffer is decompressed into `mu` at [30], [31] and [32].

Since all three decompression commands donâ€™t check the actual remaining size of the `mu` buffer, they can all write out-of-bounds.

Similarly, if thereâ€™s no compression when reading `val` at [24], weâ€™ll land at [33]. In this case, `mu` is simply populated directly from file, and again `destlen` represents the uncompressed size of the VC element. `destlen` however is completely unrelated to `mem_required_for_traversal`, which is the size of the destination buffer `mu`, so this can also write out-of-bounds.

#### CVE-2023-35955 - `fstReaderIterBlocks2` mu `LZ4_decompress_safe_partial`

By not checking whether `destlen` fits within the remaining length of the `mu` buffer, `LZ4_decompress_safe_partial` [30] will write out-of-bounds on the heap, leading to arbitrary code execution.

An attacker can control the `mu` buffer size, and at the same time manipulate the `chain_table` by supplying a small (about 20 bytes) LZ4-compressed block of data, which can be easily decompress in +1000 bytes.

#### CVE-2023-35956 - `fstReaderIterBlocks2` mu `fastlz_decompress`

By not checking whether `destlen` fits within the remaining length of the `mu` buffer, `fastlz_decompress` [31] will write out-of-bounds on the heap, leading to arbitrary code execution.

An attacker can control the `mu` buffer size and at the same time manipulate the `chain_table` by supplying a small (about 20 bytes) fastlz-compressed block of data, which can be easily decompress in +1000 bytes.

#### CVE-2023-35957 - `fstReaderIterBlocks2` mu `uncompress`

By not checking whether `destlen` fits within the remaining length of the `mu` buffer, `uncompress` [32] will write out-of-bounds on the heap, leading to arbitrary code execution.

An attacker can control the `mu` buffer size and at the same time manipulate the `chain_table` by supplying a small (about 20 bytes) zlib-compressed block of data, which can be easily decompress in +1000 bytes.

#### CVE-2023-35958 - `fstReaderIterBlocks2` mu `fstFread`

By not checking whether `destlen` fits within the remaining length of the `mu` buffer, `fstFread` [33] will write out-of-bounds on the heap, leading to arbitrary code execution.

An attacker can control the `mu` buffer size and at the same time manipulate the `chain_table` by supplying an arbitrarily long block of data (for example at the end of the FST file in an unknown block), which will write over `mu` and out of its bounds.
