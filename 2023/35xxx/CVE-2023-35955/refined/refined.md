The provided content relates to CVE-2023-35955.

**Root cause of the vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a heap-based buffer overflow in the `fstReaderIterBlocks2` function, specifically within the LZ4 decompression routine. The code fails to validate if the decompressed data size fits within the allocated buffer, leading to out-of-bounds write.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow
- Improper bounds checking during decompression

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by opening a specially crafted `.fst` file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to create a malicious `.fst` file.
- The victim needs to open the malicious file using GTKWave.
