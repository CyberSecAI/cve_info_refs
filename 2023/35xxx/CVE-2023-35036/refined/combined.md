| 10-Jun-2023 | Clarified Remediation section and patch table Documentation column |
| 09-Jun-2023 | Original posting |

## Recommended Remediation

**NOTICE:  All MOVEit Transfer customers must take action** to address the latest vulnerabilities discovered in MOVEit Transfer. There are two paths to take depending on if you have applied the remediation and patching steps from the [MOVEit Transfer Critical Vulnerability (May 2023)](https://archive.is/o/58ty7/https%3A//community.progress.com/s/article/MOVEit-Transfer-Critical-Vulnerability-31May2023) article prior to June 9.

* **Have NOT applied May 2023 patch:** Discontinue reading this article and instead follow all the remediation steps and patching in the following article: [MOVEit Transfer Critical Vulnerability (May 2023)](https://archive.is/o/58ty7/https%3A//community.progress.com/s/article/MOVEit-Transfer-Critical-Vulnerability-31May2023) article. That article contains the latest patch, which includes the fixes for the June 9 vulnerabilities as well as the original vulnerability from May 31.

* **Have applied May 2023 patch and followed the remediation steps**: Proceed to apply the June 9 patch as outlined below and you will be up to date for the vulnerabilities announced on May 31 and June 9. Read further to determine which installation path you would like to take (DLL vs. full installer).

To provide our customers with flexibility and to reduce the effort required to apply the patch for CVE (CVE pending MITRE), we have released both full installer versions and DLLs that can be dropped-in to an existing installation.

## What should I consider before deciding to upgrade using the full installer versus a DLL drop-in?

A DLL drop-in requires less time to apply and may minimize disruptions to the application during upgrade. For the DLL to be fully functional, you must already have the required version installed.  See the table below for the required versions. Customers that are not operating any of the versions listed in the table below cannot use a DLL drop-in until fully upgraded to one of the required versions by applying the appropriate patch as outlined in the previous [MOVEit Transfer Critical Vulnerability (May 2023)](https://archive.is/o/58ty7/https%3A//community.progress.com/s/article/MOVEit-Transfer-Critical-Vulnerability-31May2023) article.

## DLL Drop-In

(for customers who have one of the required versions listed installed)

**IMPORTANT: Please read the README.txt before attempting the DLL Drop-in Install. Do not leave old versions of these DLL files on the system. They must be completely removed, not just renamed.**
