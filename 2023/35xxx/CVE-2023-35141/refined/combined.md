* Jenkins LTS 2.401.1
* Checkmarx Plugin 2023.2.6
* Dimensions Plugin 0.9.3.1
* Team Concert Plugin 2.4.2

Additionally, we announce unresolved security issues in the following
plugins:

* AWS CodeCommit Trigger Plugin
* Digital.ai App Management Publisher Plugin
* Maven Repository Server Plugin
* Sonargraph Integration Plugin
* Template Workflows Plugin

Summaries of the vulnerabilities are below. More details, severity, and
attribution can be found here:
<https://www.jenkins.io/security/advisory/2023-06-14/>

We provide advance notification for security updates on this mailing list:
<https://groups.google.com/d/forum/jenkinsci-advisories>

If you discover security vulnerabilities in Jenkins, please report them as
described here:

SECURITY-3135 / CVE-2023-35141
Jenkins provides context menus for various UI elements, like links to jobs
and builds, or breadcrumbs.

In Jenkins 2.399 and earlier, LTS 2.387.3 and earlier, POST requests are
sent in order to load the list of context actions. If part of the URL
includes insufficiently escaped user-provided values, a victim may be
tricked into sending a POST request to an unexpected endpoint (e.g., the
Script Console) by opening a context menu.

As of publication of this advisory, we are aware of insufficiently escaped
context menu URLs for label expressions, allowing attackers with
Item/Configure permissions to exploit this vulnerability.

SECURITY-2870 / CVE-2023-35142
Checkmarx Plugin allows to globally enable or disable SSL/TLS validation
for connections to the Checkmarx server. Checkmarx Plugin 2022.4.3 and
earlier disables it by default. Unless changed by an administrator, it
would cause all connections to the Checkmarx server to ignore SSL/TLS
validation, thereby enabling potential man-in-the-middle attacks.

SECURITY-2932 / CVE pending
Team Concert Plugin 2.4.1 and earlier does not perform permission checks in
methods implementing form validation.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to check for the
existence of an attacker-specified file path on the Jenkins controller file
system.

SECURITY-3138 / CVE-2023-32261
Dimensions Plugin 0.9.3 and earlier does not perform a permission check in
an HTTP endpoint.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to enumerate credentials
IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins. Those can be used as part of an
attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

SECURITY-3143 / CVE-2023-32262
Dimensions Plugin 0.9.3 and earlier does not set the appropriate context
for credentials lookup, allowing the use of System-scoped credentials
otherwise reserved for the global configuration.

This allows attackers with Item/Configure permission to access and capture
credentials they are not entitled to.

SECURITY-3156 / CVE-2023-35143
Maven Repository Server Plugin 1.10 and earlier does not escape the
versions of build artifacts on the Build Artifacts As Maven Repository
page.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by attackers able to control maven project versions in
`pom.xml`.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-2951 / CVE-2023-35144
Maven Repository Server Plugin 1.10 and earlier does not escape project and
build display names on the Build Artifacts As Maven Repository page.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by attackers able to change project or build display names.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-3155 / CVE-2023-35145
Sonargraph Integration Plugin 5.0.1 and earlier does not correctly escape
the file path and the project name for the Log file field form validation.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by attackers with Item/Configure permission.

NOTE: This issue is caused by an incomplete fix of
link:/security/advisory/2020-07-02/#SECURITY-1775[SECURITY-1775].

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-3166 / CVE-2023-35146
Template Workflows Plugin 41.v32d86a_313b_4a and earlier does not escape
names of jobs used as buildings blocks for Template Workflow Job.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by attackers able to create jobs.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-3099 / CVE-2023-35147
AWS CodeCommit Trigger Plugin allows downloading activity logs of AWS
Simple Queue Service (SQS) queues.

AWS CodeCommit Trigger Plugin 3.0.12 and earlier does not restrict the
queue name path parameter in the corresponding HTTP endpoint, allowing
attackers with Item/Read permission to obtain the contents of arbitrary
files on the Jenkins controller file system.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-2911 / CVE-2023-35148 (CSRF) & CVE-2023-35149 (missing permission check)
Digital.ai App Management Publisher Plugin 2.6 and earlier does not perform
permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an
attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained
through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

Additionally, these HTTP endpoints do not require POST requests, resulting
in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

## Descriptions

### CSRF protection bypass vulnerability

**SECURITY-3135
/
CVE-2023-35141**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Description:**

Jenkins provides context menus for various UI elements, like links to jobs and builds, or breadcrumbs.

In Jenkins 2.399 and earlier, LTS 2.387.3 and earlier, POST requests are sent in order to load the list of context actions.
If part of the URL includes insufficiently escaped user-provided values, a victim may be tricked into sending a POST request to an unexpected endpoint (e.g., the Script Console) by opening a context menu.

As of publication of this advisory, we are aware of insufficiently escaped context menu URLs for label expressions, allowing attackers with Item/Configure permissions to exploit this vulnerability.

Jenkins 2.400, LTS 2.401.1 sends GET requests to load the list of context actions.

### SSL/TLS certificate validation disabled by default in Checkmarx Plugin

**SECURITY-2870
/
CVE-2023-35142**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:

**Description:**

Checkmarx Plugin allows to globally enable or disable SSL/TLS validation for connections to the Checkmarx server.
Checkmarx Plugin 2022.4.3 and earlier disables it by default.
Unless changed by an administrator, it would cause all connections to the Checkmarx server to ignore SSL/TLS validation, thereby enabling potential man-in-the-middle attacks.

Checkmarx Plugin 2023.2.6 enables SSL/TLS validation by default.
Administrators who do not want SSL/TLS validation for connections to the Checkmarx server to be disabled are advised to review their configuration.

### Missing permission checks in Team Concert Plugin

An enumeration of credentials IDs in Dimensions Plugin 0.9.3.1 requires the appropriate permissions.

### Exposure of system-scoped credentials in Dimensions Plugin

**SECURITY-3143
/
CVE-2023-32262**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`dimensionsscm`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/dimensionsscm)**

**Description:**

Dimensions Plugin 0.9.3 and earlier does not set the appropriate context for credentials lookup, allowing the use of System-scoped credentials otherwise reserved for the global configuration.
