The provided content is a changelog for FME Server, and it mentions several security-related fixes. Here's a breakdown of the relevant entries:

**1. [Fix] Use AES instead of blowfish for LDAP account credential encryption (FME 2023.0.0.3 b23314 20230607)**
   - **Root cause:** The system was using the Blowfish algorithm, which is considered less secure than AES for encrypting LDAP account credentials.
   - **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Using a weaker encryption algorithm like Blowfish could make it easier for attackers to decrypt stored LDAP credentials.
   - **Impact of exploitation:** If the encryption is compromised, attackers could gain access to sensitive LDAP credentials, potentially allowing them to authenticate as valid users.
   - **Attack vectors:** An attacker who gains access to the encrypted credentials could attempt to decrypt them.
   - **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Access to the location where encrypted credentials are stored.

**2. [Fix] Security Vulnerabilities in Jackson prior to 2.12.7.1 (FME 2023.0.0.0 b23269 20230331)**
   - **Root cause:** The system used an older version of the Jackson library, which contained known security vulnerabilities.
   - **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** The presence of vulnerable Jackson libraries could lead to various issues, including remote code execution (depending on the specific vulnerability).
   - **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to data breaches or system compromise.
   - **Attack vectors:** This would depend on the specific vulnerability within the Jackson library.
   - **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Would vary depending on the specific vulnerability.

**3. [Fix] Security Vulnerabilities in Apache POI 5.0.0 (FME 2023.0.0.0 b23255 20230313)**
   - **Root cause:** The system used a vulnerable version of Apache POI.
   - **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Specific vulnerabilities in Apache POI could allow an attacker to gain control of the system.
   - **Impact of exploitation:** Could lead to remote code execution, information disclosure or other attacks.
   - **Attack vectors:**  Maliciously crafted files processed by Apache POI.
   - **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Ability to upload or cause the system to process malicious files.

**4. [Fix] Security Vulnerabilities in Postgresql JDBC Driver (FME 2023.0.0.0 b23229 20230203)**
    - **Root cause:** The system was using a vulnerable version of the PostgreSQL JDBC driver.
    - **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Using an outdated JDBC driver can expose the system to known vulnerabilities, potentially allowing for unauthorized access to the database or other malicious activities.
    - **Impact of exploitation:** Depending on the vulnerability, this could lead to data breaches, data manipulation or denial of service.
    - **Attack vectors:** SQL injection or other vulnerabilities through the database connection.
    - **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Ability to inject malicious queries, or exploit vulnerabilities in the JDBC driver.

**5. [Fix] Security: Don't allow <,> in automation name (FME 2023.0.0.0 b23062 20220509)**
    - **Root cause:** The system was not sanitizing automation names, allowing the use of `<` and `>` characters.
    - **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Allowing these characters could lead to stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, if the automation name is displayed on the UI.
    - **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts that would execute when a user views the automation name.
    - **Attack vectors:** Maliciously crafted automation names.
    - **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Ability to create or modify automations.

**6. [Update] Review Default Roles and Reduce Permission to Increase Security (FME 2023.0.0.0 b23134 20220913)**
    - **Root cause:** Default roles had excessive permissions that could be exploited.
    - **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**  Overly permissive default roles increase the attack surface.
    - **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers could potentially gain access to system functions by exploiting unnecessary permissions.
    - **Attack vectors:**  Compromising an account with an overly permissive role.
    - **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Ability to access an account with an overly permissive role.
