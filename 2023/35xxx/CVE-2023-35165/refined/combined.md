## Package

## Affected versions

## Patched versions

## Description

If you are using the `eks.Cluster` or `eks.FargateCluster` construct we need you to take action. Other users are not affected and can stop reading.

### Impact

`eks.Cluster` and `eks.FargateCluster` constructs create two roles that have an overly permissive trust policy.

The first, referred to as the *CreationRole*, is used by lambda handlers to create the cluster and deploy Kubernetes resources (e.g `KubernetesManifest`, `HelmChart`, ...) onto it. Users with CDK version higher or equal to [1.62.0](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/releases/tag/v1.62.0) (including v2 users) will be affected.

The second, referred to as the *default MastersRole*, is provisioned only if the `mastersRole` property isn't provided and has permissions to execute `kubectl` commands on the cluster. Users with CDK version higher or equal to [1.57.0](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/releases/tag/v1.57.0) (including v2 users) will be affected.

Both these roles use the account root principal in their trust policy, which allows any identity in the account with the appropriate `sts:AssumeRole` permissions to assume it. For example, this can happen if another role in your account has `sts:AssumeRole` permissions on `Resource: "*"`.

#### CreationRole

Users with CDK version higher or equal to [1.62.0](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/releases/tag/v1.62.0) (including v2 users). The role in question can be located in the IAM console. It will have the following name pattern:

```
*-ClusterCreationRole-*
```
#### MastersRole

Users with CDK version higher or equal to [1.57.0](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/releases/tag/v1.57.0) (including v2 users) that are not specifying the `mastersRole` property. The role in question can be located in the IAM console. It will have the following name pattern:

```
*-MastersRole-*
```
### Patches

The issue has been fixed in versions [v1.202.0](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/releases/tag/v1.202.0), [v2.80.0](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/releases/tag/v2.80.0). We recommend you upgrade to a fixed version as soon as possible. See [Managing Dependencies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/manage-dependencies.html) in the CDK Developer Guide for instructions on how to do this.

The new versions no longer use the account root principal. Instead, they restrict the trust policy to the specific roles of lambda handlers that need it. This introduces some breaking changes that might require you to perform code changes. Refer to [#25674](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/25674) for a detailed discussion of options.

### Workarounds

#### CreationRole

There is no workaround available for CreationRole.

#### MastersRole

To avoid creating the *default MastersRole*, use the `mastersRole` property to explicitly provide a role. For example:

```
new eks.Cluster(this, 'Cluster', {
  ...
  mastersRole: iam.Role.fromRoleArn(this, 'Admin', 'arn:aws:iam::xxx:role/Admin')
});
```

## Description

![@iliapolo](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1428812?v=4&size=48)[iliapolo](https://github.com/iliapolo)opened [on May 22, 2023](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/25674#issue-1720095053)
### Status

Resolved

---

### What is the issue?

`eks.Cluster` and `eks.FargateCluster` constructs create two roles that have an overly permissive trust policy.

The first, referred to as the *CreationRole*, is used by lambda handlers to create the cluster and deploy Kubernetes resources (e.g `KubernetesManifest`, `HelmChart`, ...) onto it.

The second, referred to as the *default MastersRole*, is provisioned only if the `mastersRole` property isn't provided and has permissions to execute `kubectl` commands on the cluster.

Both these roles use the account root principal in their trust policy, which allows any identity in the account with the appropriate `sts:AssumeRole` permissions to assume it. For example, this can happen if another role in your account has `sts:AssumeRole` permissions on `Resource: "*"`

---

### Error message

No error message will be presented to the customer.

---

### What is the impact?

An identity with access to a role that has the appropriate `sts:AssumeRole` permission can gain greater than intended access to the cluster.

---

### Workaround

Until a fix is available, you can follow the below workarounds.

---

#### MastersRole

To avoid creating the *default MastersRole*, use the `mastersRole` property to explicitly provide a role. For example:

```
new eks.Cluster(this, 'Cluster', {
  ...
  mastersRole: iam.Role.fromRoleArn(this, 'Admin', 'arn:aws:iam::xxx:role/Admin')
});
```
#### CreationRole

There is no workaround available for CreationRole.

---

### Who is affected?

#### MastersRole

Users with CDK version higher or equal to [1.57.0](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/releases/tag/v1.57.0) (including v2 users) that are not specifying the `mastersRole` property. The role in question can be located in the IAM console. It will have the following name pattern:

```
*-MastersRole-*
```
#### CreationRole

Users with CDK version higher or equal to [1.62.0](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/releases/tag/v1.62.0) (including v2 users). The role in question can be located in the IAM console. It will have the following name pattern:

```
*-ClusterCreationRole-*
```

---

### How do I resolve this?

The issue has been fixed in versions [v1.202.0](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/releases/tag/v1.202.0), [v2.80.0](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/releases/tag/v2.80.0). We recommend you upgrade to a fixed version as soon as possible. See [Managing Dependencies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/manage-dependencies.html) in the CDK Developer Guide for instructions on how to do this.

The new versions no longer use the account root principal. Instead, they restrict the trust policy to the specific roles of lambda handlers that need it. This introduces some breaking changes that might require you to perform code changes.

#### MastersRole

If you relied on the *default MastersRole*, it will no longer be available and will require you to

explicitly provide it via the `mastersRole` property. To retain the previous behavior, you could do:

```
new eks.Cluster(this, 'Cluster', {
  ...
  mastersRole: new iam.Role(thi, 'MastersRole', {
    assumedBy: new iam.AccountRootPrincipal(),
  });
});
```

However, this would still result in an overly permissive trust policy. We recommend specifying a stricter policy. See [trust policies](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-use-trust-policies-with-iam-roles/) on how to use IAM trust policies.

#### CreationRole

The change in the *CreationRole* trust policy should be mostly transparent to you. One scenario in which it could cause disruption is when it is being used on imported clusters, like so, for example:

```
const cluster = eks.Cluster.fromClusterAttributes(this, 'Cluster', {
  kubectlRoleArn: '',
});
cluster.addManifest(...);
```

Previously, the lambda handlers created for the `KubectlProvider` of the imported cluster were granted the appropriate `sts:AssumeRole` permissions, and since the *CreationRole* was using the account root principal, the handlers were able to assume it and execute `kubectl` commands. After the upgrade, the *CreationRole* no longer uses the account root principal, and will therefore not allow the new lambda handlers to assume it. The workaround differs based on whether you are creating a new stack, or updating an existing one.

##### For Existing Stacks

For imported cluster in existing stacks to continue to work, you will need to add the role of the kubectl provider function to the trust policy of the cluster's admin role:

```
// do this for each stack where you import the original cluster.
this.cluster.adminRole.assumeRolePolicy?.addStatements(new iam.PolicyStatement({
  actions: ['sts:AssumeRole'],
  principals: [iam.Role.fromRoleArn(this, 'KubectlHandlerImportStackRole', 'arn-of-kubectl-provider-function-role-in-import-stack')]
}));
```

To locate the relevant ARN, find the Lambda function **in the import stack** that has the *"onEvent handler for EKS kubectl resource provider"* description and use its role ARN. Redeploy the cluster stack and everything should work, no changes to the import stack needed.

Alternatively, you can do the reverse and specify the `kubectlLambdaRole` property when importing the cluster to point to the role of the original kubectl provider:

```
const cluster = eks.Cluster.fromClusterAttributes(this, 'Cluster', {
  kubectlRoleArn: '',
  kubectlLambdaRole: iam.Role.fromRoleArn(this, 'KubectlLambdaRole', 'arn-of-kubectl-provider-function-role-in-cluster-stack'),
});
```

This will make it so the role of the new provider will be the same as the original provider, and as such, is already trusted by the creation role of the cluster.

##### For New Stacks

If you are importing the cluster in a new stack, you should reuse the entire `KubectlProvider` of the cluster:

```
// import the existing provider
const kubectlProvider = eks.KubectlProvider.fromKubectlProviderAttributes(this, 'KubectlProvider', {
  functionArn: '',
  handlerRole: iam.Role.fromRoleArn(this, 'HandlerRole', ''),
  kubectlRoleArn: '',
});

// and reuse it
const cluster = eks.Cluster.fromClusterAttributes(this, 'Cluster', {
  kubectlProvider,
});
cluster.addManifest(...);
```

This way, no additional lambda handlers are created, and therefore no additional permissions are required.

Note that this approach will not work for your existing resources because it causes a modification to the service token

of the custom resources, which isn't allowed.
