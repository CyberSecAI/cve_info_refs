Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The `eks.Cluster` and `eks.FargateCluster` constructs in the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) create two roles with overly permissive trust policies.
- These roles, the *CreationRole* and the *default MastersRole*, use the account root principal in their trust policy, which allows any identity within the AWS account with the appropriate `sts:AssumeRole` permissions to assume them.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Overly Permissive Trust Policy:** The trust policies of the *CreationRole* and *default MastersRole* allow any principal within the AWS account to assume these roles if they have `sts:AssumeRole` permissions. This is a deviation from the principle of least privilege.
- **CWE-266 (Incorrect Privilege Assignment):**  The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-266, which indicates that the roles have been granted excessive privileges, and that was achieved through an overly permissive trust policy.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An attacker with an identity that has the `sts:AssumeRole` permission (for example a role with permissions on `Resource: "*"`) can assume the vulnerable roles.
- **CreationRole:** Allows an attacker to create clusters and deploy Kubernetes resources.
- **MastersRole:** Allows an attacker to execute `kubectl` commands on the cluster.
- This could result in unauthorized access to the Kubernetes cluster and the ability to perform actions such as data exfiltration, denial of service, or compromise of other services running in the cluster.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is network-based.
- Any identity within the same AWS account that has the `sts:AssumeRole` permissions on the role can exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to have an identity within the same AWS account as the affected EKS cluster.
- This identity must have the `sts:AssumeRole` permission that allows them to assume the vulnerable roles. This could be via a policy attached to the identity, or via a misconfigured role that trusts all other roles in the account.

**Affected Versions:**

- `@aws-cdk/aws-eks`: >=1.57.0 and <1.202.0
- `aws-cdk-lib`: >=2.0.0 and <2.80.0

**Patched Versions:**

- `@aws-cdk/aws-eks`: 1.202.0
- `aws-cdk-lib`: 2.80.0

**Additional Notes:**

- The *CreationRole* is used by lambda handlers to create and deploy resources to the EKS cluster.
- The *default MastersRole* is created when the `mastersRole` property is not provided and allows executing `kubectl` commands.
- The fix involves restricting the trust policy to only the specific roles of lambda handlers that need it, instead of using the account root principal, introducing some breaking changes that might require code changes when upgrading.
- Workarounds are available for the *MastersRole*, but not for the *CreationRole*.
