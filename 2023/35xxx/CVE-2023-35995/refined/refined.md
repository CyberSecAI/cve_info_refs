```
- Root cause of vulnerability: Improper array index validation in the `fstReaderIterBlocks2` function when handling tdelta values, leading to out-of-bounds write on the heap.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The code uses a `tdelta` value, derived from the input file, as an index into the `tc_head` array without proper bounds checking.
- Impact of exploitation: Arbitrary code execution due to heap out-of-bounds write.
- Attack vectors: A specially crafted `.fst` file, when opened by the vulnerable GTKWave application or tool, triggers the vulnerability.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to create a malicious `.fst` file and convince the victim to open it. The victim needs to have the GTKWave application installed.
