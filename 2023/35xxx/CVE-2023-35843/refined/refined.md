Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-35843:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a path traversal issue in the `fileRead` function within the `attachment.ctl.ts` file. The function constructs a file path by concatenating fixed strings ('nc', 'uploads') with user-provided input from the `req.params[0]` parameter, without sufficient sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The application fails to properly validate or sanitize the `path` parameter from the URL. This allows an attacker to use directory traversal sequences like `../` to access files and directories outside of the intended `nc/uploads` directory.
*   **Lack of Authentication:** The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users on the `/download` route.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Read:** Successful exploitation enables an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server's filesystem. This can lead to:
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Access to sensitive data such as configuration files, source code, database credentials, and user data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** An attacker crafts a malicious URL using a GET request to the `/download` route, including path traversal sequences in the path parameter (`req.params[0]`).
*   **URL manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the `path` parameter in the URL to access arbitrary files using directory traversal sequences (`../`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access:**  The attacker does not need to authenticate to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable NocoDB instance.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code is located in `/packages/nocodb/src/lib/controllers/attachment.ctl.ts`.
*   The `fileRead` function constructs the file path using `path.join('nc', 'uploads', req.params?.[0])`.
*   The vulnerability is triggered via the `/download` route using a specially crafted path parameter like `..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2Fetc%2Fpasswd`.
* The vulnerability exists in NocoDB versions <= 0.106.1
