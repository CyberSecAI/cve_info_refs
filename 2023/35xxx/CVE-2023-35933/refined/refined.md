{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of authorization models containing circular relationship definitions within OpenFGA versions prior to 1.1.1. When Check and ListObjects calls are executed against these models, a denial-of-service (DoS) attack can be triggered.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Circular relationship definitions in authorization models",
      "Insufficient validation of authorization models"
    ],
    "impact": "A successful attack can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) by causing excessive resource consumption or infinite loops, impacting the availability of the OpenFGA service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Executing specific Check and ListObjects calls against an OpenFGA instance using a vulnerable authorization model."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have the ability to make Check or ListObjects calls using a crafted authorization model with circular relationships, and access to the OpenFGA API.",
     "additional_details": "OpenFGA versions prior to v1.1.1 are vulnerable to DoS attacks when processing authorization models with circular relationships in `Check` and `ListObjects` calls. Version 1.1.1 addresses this by validating models and returning HTTP 400 errors for invalid model calls. An invalid authorization model is one that contains circular relationship definitions. The fix involves adding model validations on empty type names and relations, and also adding validation for check, list object, and expand operations."
