Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-35992

**Description:** An integer overflow vulnerability exists in the FST fstReaderIterBlocks2 vesc allocation functionality of GTKWave 3.3.115, when compiled as a 32-bit binary. A specially crafted .fst file can lead to memory corruption.

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow during the allocation of the `vesc` buffer within the `fstUtilityBinToEsc` function, which is called by `fstReaderIterBlocks2`.
- The size of `vesc` is determined by a value `len` read from the crafted `.fst` file, multiplied by 4, plus 1. This calculation, when performed using a 32 bit integer, can wrap around leading to a small buffer being allocated.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Integer Overflow (CWE-190):** The multiplication `len * 4 + 1` can overflow when `len` is a large value, leading to the allocation of a small memory buffer.
- **Heap-based buffer overflow:** Because of the integer overflow, the `vesc` buffer is smaller than required. The subsequent call to `fstUtilityBinToEsc` writes data beyond the bounds of this small buffer, resulting in heap-based buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Memory Corruption:** The heap-based buffer overflow can corrupt memory, leading to a crash.
- **Potential Code Execution:** The memory corruption could potentially be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code. The report mentions that due to the multithreaded nature of GTKWave, code execution may be possible.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Maliciously crafted `.fst` file:** The attacker needs to create a specially crafted `.fst` file with a specific `len` value to cause the integer overflow.
- **User Interaction:** A victim must open the malicious `.fst` file, either via the UI or command-line tools.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to create a malicious .fst file
- The attacker needs to convince a victim to open the malicious .fst file using a vulnerable version of GTKWave.
- The attack is only possible on a 32bit version of GTKWave.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability occurs in the `fstReaderIterBlocks2` function, specifically when handling `FST_BL_VCDATA` blocks.
- The size of the allocated buffer `vesc` depends on the value of `len` within the compressed VCDATA blocks, which is controlled by the attacker.
- The `fstUtilityBinToEsc` function writes data to `vesc` based on a length controlled by attacker controlled data.
- The `signal_lens` field within the FST file is also a factor, but does not cause the vulnerability directly, rather it controls which code path will be executed.
- The issue is only present in 32 bit binaries, due to the overflow of the `len` variable.
- The crash information shows the heap-buffer-overflow occurring in `fstUtilityBinToEsc`.
- The issue was fixed in version 3.3.118 of GTKWave.

The Debian Security Advisory confirms that this CVE is among multiple vulnerabilities fixed in a security update for the `gtkwave` package.
