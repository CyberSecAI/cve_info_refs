    "summary": "The vulnerability is a path traversal issue in Gradle's handling of Tar archives. Gradle versions prior to 7.6.2 and 8.0 prior to 8.2 are susceptible. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to write files outside of the intended directory, disclose sensitive information, or cause a Denial of Service (DoS). The attack requires control of the source of a Tar archive, modification of the build process to interact with a malicious archive, or compromising a remote build cache server.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The root cause is a path traversal vulnerability in Gradle's handling of Tar archives, where it does not validate that files are written within the intended directory when unpacking a Tar archive.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Path traversal vulnerability when unpacking Tar archives.",
        "Improper validation of file paths within Tar archive entries."
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to:\n*   Disclosure of sensitive information.\n*   Addition or modification of data.\n*   Denial of Service (DoS).",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "An attacker could control the source of a Tar archive already used by the build.",
        "An attacker could modify the build to interact with a malicious archive.",
        "An attacker could inject malicious build cache entries if they have control of a remote build cache server or perform a man-in-the-middle attack."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": [
          "Control over the source of a Tar archive used by the build.",
        "Ability to modify the build process to use a malicious archive.",
          "Ability to write to a remote Gradle build cache server (or perform a man-in-the-middle attack)."
      ],
      "additional_notes": "The advisory indicates that Gradle versions 7.6.2 and 8.2 include a fix that refuses to handle Tar archives with path traversal elements in a Tar entry name. It also suggests that if a build deals with untrusted Tar archives, they need to be inspected. The vulnerability is also described as a 'TarSlip' vulnerability, a variant of the 'ZipSlip' vulnerability. The CVSS score is 8.1 HIGH."
