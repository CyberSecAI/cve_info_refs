Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-35928:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Nextcloud handles session authentication for external storage. Specifically, it does not properly check the username associated with session credentials when accessing external storage.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insufficient Session Validation:** The core issue is the lack of proper validation of session credentials against the current user when accessing external storage. This allows an attacker to potentially bypass authentication checks.
- **User-Scoped External Storage:** The vulnerability is linked to the "user scoped external storage" feature of Nextcloud.
- **Improper Authorization:** The system fails to ensure that the user accessing external storage using session credentials is the same user that those credentials belong to.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Account Takeover:** A malicious user can potentially gain access to another user's account by exploiting this vulnerability and gaining access to their session credentials.
- **Data Breach:** If the victim user has access to sensitive data, the attacker can then access this data.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Although not explicitly mentioned, this could also lead to privilege escalation within the scope of the compromised user's account.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network-based:** The attack is performed over the network.
- **External Storage Misuse:** Attackers exploit the external storage functionality within Nextcloud.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Valid Nextcloud User Account:** The attacker needs to be a valid user on the Nextcloud instance.
- **High Privileges Required:**  The attacker must have privileges to configure external storage, and must be able to trigger the vulnerability.
- **User Interaction:**  The attacker requires some user interaction.

**Additional Information:**

- **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 score of 8.5, classified as high severity.
- **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability affects versions of Nextcloud Server >= 25.0.0 and >= 26.0.0, and Nextcloud Enterprise Server >= 19.0.0.
- **Patched Versions:** The issue is resolved in Nextcloud Server versions 25.0.7 and 26.0.2. For Nextcloud Enterprise Server, it's resolved in various versions depending on the 19.x to 26.x branches.
- **Workarounds:** Disabling the `files_external` app, disallowing external storage mounts for users, or restricting certain types of external storage are provided as workarounds.
- **Fix Details:** The fix involves checking the username when doing external storage session authentication, as detailed in the linked pull request.
- **CWE:** This is related to CWE-274 (Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges).

This vulnerability highlights the importance of proper session and user validation, especially when dealing with external resources.
