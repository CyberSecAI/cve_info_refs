Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2023-35986:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing DICOM files within Sante DICOM Viewer Pro.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stack-based Buffer Overflow (CWE-121):** The software is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow due to insufficient validation of user-provided data during DICOM file parsing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process. This could lead to information disclosure, system compromise, or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves supplying a specially crafted DICOM file to the vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to get the vulnerable application to parse a malicious DICOM file. This could be achieved through social engineering tactics such as tricking a user into opening a malicious file, or other means of delivering a crafted file.
*   The attacker requires a local position to exploit this vulnerability as it is not remotely exploitable.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory also mentions an out-of-bounds write vulnerability (CVE-2023-39431) in the same software, caused by similar improper validation of DICOM data.
