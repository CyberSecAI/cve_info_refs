Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-35146:

**CVE-2023-35146**

*   **Root Cause:** The Template Workflows Plugin fails to properly escape the names of jobs used as building blocks for Template Workflow Jobs.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The plugin doesn't sanitize job names, which are then displayed on the UI. This allows the injection of malicious JavaScript code.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript that will be executed when a user views the affected page. This could lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions performed within the context of the victim's browser session.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Attackers can exploit this by crafting a job with a malicious name and using it in a Template Workflow Job.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs the ability to create jobs in the Jenkins instance to exploit this vulnerability. This means they need at least Item/Create permissions on the target Jenkins instance. They also need to be able to get another user to view the page displaying the malicious data to trigger the XSS.

**Affected Plugin:** Template Workflows Plugin

**Affected Versions:** 41.v32d86a\_313b\_4a and earlier.

**Fix:** No fix is available as of the publication of the advisory.
