{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from insufficient permission checks in the `PanelGroupController.java` where the update operation for dashboard directories only requires level 1 permission, which is also granted to normal users. This allows normal users to manipulate dashboards created by administrators.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Insufficient access control, privilege escalation",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Normal users can manipulate dashboard directories created by administrators, potentially leading to unauthorized modifications or disruptions of dashboards.",
  "Attack vectors": "Network access to the application's API endpoint `/update`.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "A normal user account with level 1 permission on the vulnerable DataEase instance."
