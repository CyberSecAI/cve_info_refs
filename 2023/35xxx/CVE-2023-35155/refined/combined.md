* **Submission status**: Archived

**REPORT CONTENT**

* **Severity**: Medium (6.1)
* **Domain**: <https://intigriti.xwiki.com/> (Url)
* **Proof of concept**: Hi XWiki team,

I found a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability on your website ...:

1. 1. Reproduction

1. Login as any user

2. Navigate to: <https://intigriti.xwiki.com/xwiki/bin/view/Main/?viewer=share&send=1&target=&target=%3Cimg+src+onerror%3Dalert%28document.domain%29%3E+%3Cimg+src+onerror%3Dalert%28document.domain%29%3E+%3Crenniepak%40intigriti.me%3E&includeDocument=inline&message=I+wanted+to+share+this+page+with+you>.

1. 1. Result

As soon as the page is loaded our XSS payload triggers:

{823699}

* **Impact**: If an attacker can control a script that is executed in the victim's browser, then they can typically fully compromise that user. Amongst other things, the attacker can:

* Perform any action within the application that the user can perform.
* View any information that the user is able to view.
* Modify any information that the user is able to modify.
* **Personal data involved**: No
* **Recommended solution**: In general, effectively preventing XSS vulnerabilities is likely to involve a combination of the following measures:

* \***Filter input on arrival.**\* At the point where user input is received, filter as strictly as possible based on what is expected or valid input.
* \***Encode data on output.**\* At the point where user-controllable data is output in HTTP responses, encode the output to prevent it from being interpreted as active content. Depending on the output context, this might require applying combinations of HTML, URL, JavaScript, and CSS encoding.
* \***Use appropriate response headers.**\* To prevent XSS in HTTP responses that aren't intended to contain any HTML or JavaScript, you can use the Content-Type and X-Content-Type-Options headers to ensure that browsers interpret the responses in the way you intend.
* \***Content Security Policy.**\* As a last line of defense, you can use Content Security Policy (CSP) to reduce the severity of any XSS vulnerabilities that still occur.
* **Endpoint**: <https://intigriti.xwiki.com/xwiki/bin/view/Main/?viewer=share&send=1&target=&target=><PAYLOAD>
* **Type**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting

# RXSS in target parameter via share page by email

High

[manuelleduc](/manuelleduc)
published
GHSA-fwwj-wg89-7h4c
Jun 20, 2023

## Package

maven

org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-sharepage-api
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

>= 2.6 RC2, >= 2.7 RC1

## Patched versions

15.0-rc-1, 14.4.8, 14.10.4

## Description

### Impact

Users are able to forge an URL with a payload allowing to inject Javascript in the page (XSS).

For instance, the following URL execute an `alter` on the browser: `<xwiki-host>/xwiki/bin/view/Main/?viewer=share&send=1&target=&target=%3Cimg+src+onerror%3Dalert%28document.domain%29%3E+%3Cimg+src+onerror%3Dalert%28document.domain%29%3E+%3Crenniepak%40intigriti.me%3E&includeDocument=inline&message=I+wanted+to+share+this+page+with+you.`, where `<xwiki-host>` is the URL of your XWiki installation.

See <https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-20370> for me details.

### Patches

The vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 15.0-rc-1, 14.10.4, and 14.4.8.

### Workarounds

The fix is only impacting Velocity templates and page contents, so applying this [patch](https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/ca88ebdefb2c9fa41490959cce9f9e62404799e7) is enough to fix the issue.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
