Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2023-35996:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `fstReaderIterBlocks2` function of GTKWave, specifically in how it handles the `tc_head` array when processing VCDATA blocks. The code calculates an index `tdelta` based on data within the VCDATA, but it lacks proper validation to ensure `tdelta` remains within the bounds of the `tc_head` array. This allows for an out-of-bounds write operation. This specific instance of the vulnerability occurs when `xc->signal_lens[idx]` is equal to 0.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Array Index Validation (CWE-129):** The core issue is the lack of bounds checking on the `tdelta` index before using it to access `tc_head`.
*   **Heap-based Buffer Overflow:** When an attacker-controlled `tdelta` value is used to write to `tc_head` outside of the allocated memory, it causes a heap-based buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The heap buffer overflow allows an attacker to overwrite heap metadata, which can be leveraged to achieve arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Maliciously crafted `.fst` file:** The vulnerability is triggered by opening a specially crafted `.fst` file. This file manipulates the `tdelta` value and the size of `tc_head` to write out of bounds.
*   **User Interaction:** A victim needs to open the malicious file using GTKWave or a related tool (like fst2vcd).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to create a malicious `.fst` file:** The attacker needs to be able to construct a `.fst` file that contains the specific data required to trigger the out-of-bounds write.
*   **Ability to get the victim to open the malicious file:**  The attacker needs to deliver the malicious file to a victim, for example, through email.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code is within the `fstReaderIterBlocks2` function.
*   The `tc_head` array is allocated based on `tsec_nitems`, read from the file.
*   The `tdelta` value is derived from values within the VCDATA.
*   Specifically, the vulnerability described as CVE-2023-35996 occurs when `xc->signal_lens[idx]` is 0, leading to an out-of-bounds write to `tc_head` at the following line: `tc_head[i + tdelta] = idx + 1;`.
*   The vulnerability can occur at 4 different locations based on different signal_len values.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The Talos report indicates that the vulnerability was discovered by Claudio Bozzato of Cisco Talos.
*   The issue was fixed in GTKWave version 3.3.118.
*   The provided Debian Security Advisory confirms that a fix has been applied.
