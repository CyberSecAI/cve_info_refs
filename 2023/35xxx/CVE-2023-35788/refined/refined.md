Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-35788:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- An off-by-one error exists in the `fl_set_geneve_opt` function within the Linux kernel's Flower traffic classifier (`NET_CLS_FLOWER`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds write:** The vulnerability allows writing data past the allocated buffer on the kernel heap, specifically in `key->enc_opts.data`.
- The code calculates the pointer `opt` using `key->enc_opts.len` without proper bounds checking in relation to the size of `key->enc_opts.data[]`.
- When processing multiple `TCA_FLOWER_KEY_ENC_OPTS_GENEVE` packets, the `key->enc_opts.len` can be manipulated to bypass size check at `[2]` by making `key->enc_opts.len` equal to a value where the calculated offset becomes out of bound at line `[3]`.
- `opt->length` is updated without the correct length validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The out-of-bounds write can corrupt kernel memory, causing a system crash or instability.
- **Potential Privilege Escalation:** Arbitrary memory corruption can be a stepping stone to escalate privileges by overwriting critical kernel structures.
- **Disclosure of sensitive information:** the OOB read vulnerability can leak sensitive data if exploited.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local:** A local user with the ability to manipulate traffic control settings through Netlink can trigger the vulnerability by sending crafted `TCA_FLOWER_KEY_ENC_OPTS_GENEVE` packets.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have local access to the system and be able to configure network traffic control parameters. Specifically, they must be able to create and send Netlink messages with `TCA_FLOWER_KEY_ENC_OPTS_GENEVE` attributes.
- The attacker also needs the capability of mounting file systems or write to them to exploit the ext4 vulnerability.
- Some exploitation scenarios require the `CAP_NET_ADMIN` capability or any user or network namespace.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in Linux kernel versions prior to 6.3.7, which means multiple vendors and products are impacted, including NetApp products.
- NetApp has acknowledged the vulnerability and indicated that some of its HCI Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) products are affected.
- A patch has been released by the Linux kernel security team to address this issue.
- The issue is present in the `flower` classifier used for traffic control within the kernel.
- This is considered a high severity issue with a CVSS score of 7.8.
- Several distributions, like Debian, have released security updates which address this issue (and many others) .
- The vulnerability is also present in older kernels like 4.19 and 5.10.
- This vulnerability is present on several kernel subsystems: traffic control (TC), device mapper, XFS, Btrfs, IPvlan, relayfs, Bluetooth, NFC, Netfilter, GFS2, exFAT, Unix domain sockets, io_uring, DVB Core, ext4, Xen, Bluetooth L2CAP socket, and netfilter ipset
