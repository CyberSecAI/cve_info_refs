- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WooCommerce Square plugin is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin does not properly validate user authorization before accessing objects, leading to IDOR vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor could bypass authorization and potentially access sensitive files/folders or interact with the database.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector would be through the plugin's direct object references.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have Contributor-level privileges.
