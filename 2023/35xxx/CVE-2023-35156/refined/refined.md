Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-35156:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of the `xredirect` parameter within the delete template of the XWiki Flamingo Skin. Specifically, the `xredirect` parameter is used to construct a URL for the "Cancel" button. When a malicious `javascript:` URL is provided via the `xredirect` parameter, it gets directly inserted into the `href` attribute of the anchor tag, resulting in the execution of the JavaScript payload when the user clicks "Cancel" button.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (RXSS):** The primary vulnerability is RXSS. The server reflects the unsanitized input back to the user's browser, allowing the attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize or validate the `xredirect` parameter, which leads to the injection of malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
- **Complete User Compromise:** This can lead to the compromise of the user's session, allowing the attacker to perform actions as the user, view/modify information, or redirect the user to malicious sites.
- **Data Breach**: Unauthorized access to sensitive information can occur due to the attacker's control over the user's session.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **URL Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the JavaScript payload in the `xredirect` parameter.
- **User Interaction:** The attack requires user interaction, as the user needs to click the cancel button to trigger the injected javascript payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to craft a URL:** The attacker needs to be able to construct a URL and convince a user to visit it. This can be achieved through various methods (e.g., social engineering, phishing emails, etc.).
- **No special privileges required:** The attacker doesn't need any special privileges on the target XWiki system.
- **Network access:** The attacker must have network access to the XWiki instance.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability exists from XWiki version 6.0-rc-1.
- The fix involves using a dedicated Velocity macro for sanitizing URLs in templates (`getSanitizedURLAttributeValue`).
- Initially, a partial fix was implemented, but it wasn't enough to fully resolve the vulnerability.
- The complete fix was introduced in XWiki versions 14.10.6 and 15.1.
- The vulnerability was reported by Ren√© de Sain (@renniepak).

**Patches:**

- The vulnerability has been addressed in XWiki 14.10.6 and 15.1.
