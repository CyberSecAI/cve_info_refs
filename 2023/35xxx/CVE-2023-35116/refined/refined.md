The provided content describes a stack overflow vulnerability in the `jackson-databind` library, which is tracked as CVE-2023-35116.

- **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is caused by the library's handling of cyclic dependencies within a `Map` during serialization. Specifically, when a `Map` contains itself as a value, it triggers infinite recursion during the serialization process.
- **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper handling for self-referential or cyclic structures in Maps during serialization, leading to a stack overflow error.
- **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation results in a `StackOverflowError`, causing a denial of service.
- **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves providing a crafted `Map` with a self-referential structure to the serialization function of the `jackson-databind` library.
- **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to pass a crafted `Map` with cyclic dependencies to the `jackson-databind` library's serialization methods. This typically means having the ability to control the input data being processed by the application.
