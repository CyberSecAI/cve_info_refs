# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2023-1792

## GTKWave FST fstReaderIterBlocks2 time\_table tsec\_nitems integer overflow vulnerability

##### January 8, 2024

##### CVE Number

CVE-2023-35128

##### SUMMARY

An integer overflow vulnerability exists in the fstReaderIterBlocks2 time\_table tsec\_nitems functionality of GTKWave 3.3.115. A specially crafted .fst file can lead to memory corruption. A victim would need to open a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

GTKWave 3.3.115

##### PRODUCT URLS

GTKWave - <https://gtkwave.sourceforge.net>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

7.0 - CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

##### CWE

CWE-190 - Integer Overflow or Wraparound

##### DETAILS

GTKWave is a wave viewer, often used to analyze FPGA simulations and logic analyzer captures. It includes a GUI to view and analyze traces, as well as convert across several file formats (`.lxt`, `.lxt2`, `.vzt`, `.fst`, `.ghw`, `.vcd`, `.evcd`) either by using the UI or its command line tools. GTKWave is available for Linux, Windows and MacOS. Trace files can be shared within teams or organizations, for example to compare results of simulation runs across different design implementations, to analyze protocols captured with logic analyzers or just as a reference when porting design implementations.

GTKWave sets up mime types for its supported extensions. For example, it’s enough for a victim to double-click on a wave file received by e-mail to trigger the vulnerability described in this advisory.

The function `fstReaderOpen` is used to parse `.fst` files.

```
     void *fstReaderOpen(const char *nam)
     {
[1]  struct fstReaderContext *xc = (struct fstReaderContext *)calloc(1, sizeof(struct fstReaderContext));

[2]  if((!nam)||(!(xc->f=fopen(nam, "rb"))))
             {
             free(xc);
             xc=NULL;
             }
             else
             {
             int flen = strlen(nam);
             char *hf = (char *)calloc(1, flen + 6);
             int rc;

     #if defined(FST_UNBUFFERED_IO)
             setvbuf(xc->f, (char *)NULL, _IONBF, 0);   /* keeps gzip from acting weird in tandem with fopen */
     #endif

             memcpy(hf, nam, flen);
             strcpy(hf + flen, ".hier");
             xc->fh = fopen(hf, "rb");

             free(hf);
             xc->filename = strdup(nam);
[3]          rc = fstReaderInit(xc);

```

At [1] the `xc` structure is created. This big (about 65KB) structure is used to hold information regarding the `.fst` file.

At [2] the `xc->f` field is set to the file pointer returned by `fopen` after opening the file being parsed.

Then, the function `fstReaderInit` is called [3] to parse the various `.fst` sections from the input file.

```
     int fstReaderInit(struct fstReaderContext *xc)
     {
     fst_off_t blkpos = 0;
     fst_off_t endfile;
     uint64_t seclen;
     int sectype;
     uint64_t vc_section_count_actual = 0;
     int hdr_incomplete = 0;
     int hdr_seen = 0;
     int gzread_pass_status = 1;

     sectype = fgetc(xc->f);
     ...
     if(gzread_pass_status)
             {
             fstReaderFseeko(xc, xc->f, 0, SEEK_END);
             endfile = ftello(xc->f);

             while(blkpos < endfile)
                     {
                     fstReaderFseeko(xc, xc->f, blkpos, SEEK_SET);

[4]                  sectype = fgetc(xc->f);
                     seclen = fstReaderUint64(xc->f);

                     if(sectype == EOF)
                             {
                             break;
                             }

[5]                  if((hdr_incomplete) && (!seclen))
                             {
                             break;
                             }

[6]                  if(!hdr_seen && (sectype != FST_BL_HDR))
                             {
                             break;
                             }

                     blkpos++;
                     ...

```

At [4], the `sectype` (1 byte) is read off the file. This variable will tell us which kind of sector we’re parsing. The checks at [5] and [6] are important because we don’t want to trigger them in order to reach the vulnerable code. We need to make sure `hdr_incomplete` stays 0 and we start with a `FST_BL_HDR` sector, which will set `hdr_seen` to 1.

So, if the input file starts with a `0x00`, we’ll land inside the following condition:

```
     ...
     if(sectype == FST_BL_HDR)
             {
             if(!hdr_seen)
                     {
                     int ch;
                     double dcheck;

                     xc->start_time = fstReaderUint64(xc->f);
                     xc->end_time = fstReaderUint64(xc->f);

[7]                  hdr_incomplete = (xc->start_time == 0) && (xc->end_time == 0);

                     ...
[8]                  hdr_seen = 1;

[9]                  xc->mem_used_by_writer = fstReaderUint64(xc->f);
                     xc->scope_count = fstReaderUint64(xc->f);
                     xc->var_count = fstReaderUint64(xc->f);
                     ...
                     }
             }
     ...

```

After parsing the header, `fstReaderInit` proceeds to parse other blocks that aren’t relevant for this advisory.

Upon return from `fstReaderOpen`, GTKWave eventually calls `fstReaderIterBlocks2` to parse all VCDATA blocks, as they haven’t been fully parsed in `fstReaderInit`.

`fstReaderIterBlocks2` is a pretty large function, so we’ll focus on the interesting lines only:

```
     int fstReaderIterBlocks2(void *ctx,
                              void (*value_change_callback)(void *user_callback_data_pointer, uint64_t time, fstHandle facidx, const unsigned char *value),
                              void (*value_change_callback_varlen)(void *user_callback_data_pointer, uint64_t time, fstHandle facidx, const unsigned char *value, uint32_t len),
                              void *user_callback_data_pointer, FILE *fv) {
         struct fstReaderContext *xc = (struct fstReaderContext *)ctx;

         uint64_t previous_time = UINT64_MAX;
         uint64_t *time_table = NULL;
         uint64_t tsec_nitems;
         unsigned int secnum = 0;
         int blocks_skipped = 0;
         fst_off_t blkpos = 0;
         uint64_t seclen, beg_tim;
         uint64_t end_tim;
         uint64_t frame_uclen, frame_clen, frame_maxhandle, vc_maxhandle;
         fst_off_t vc_start;
         fst_off_t indx_pntr, indx_pos;
         fst_off_t *chain_table = NULL;
         uint32_t *chain_table_lengths = NULL;
         unsigned char *chain_cmem;
         unsigned char *pnt;
         long chain_clen;
         fstHandle idx, pidx = 0, i;
         uint64_t pval;
         uint64_t vc_maxhandle_largest = 0;
         uint64_t tsec_uclen = 0, tsec_clen = 0;
         int sectype;
         uint64_t mem_required_for_traversal;
         unsigned char *mem_for_traversal = NULL;
         uint32_t traversal_mem_offs;
         uint32_t *scatterptr, *headptr, *length_remaining;
         uint32_t cur_blackout = 0;
         int packtype;
         unsigned char *mc_mem = NULL;
         uint32_t mc_mem_len; /* corresponds to largest value encountered in chain_table_lengths[i] */
         int dumpvars_state = 0;

         ...
[10]     for (;;) {
             uint32_t *tc_head = NULL;
             traversal_mem_offs = 0;

             fstReaderFseeko(xc, xc->f, blkpos, SEEK_SET);

[11]         sectype = fgetc(xc->f);
             seclen = fstReaderUint64(xc->f);

             if ((sectype == EOF) || (sectype == FST_BL_SKIP)) {
     #ifdef FST_DEBUG
                 fprintf(stderr, FST_APIMESS "<< EOF >>\n");
     #endif
                 break;
             }

             blkpos++;
[12]         if ((sectype != FST_BL_VCDATA) && (sectype != FST_BL_VCDATA_DYN_ALIAS) && (sectype != FST_BL_VCDATA_DYN_ALIAS2)) {
                 blkpos += seclen;
                 continue;
             }

             if (!seclen) break;
         ...

```

As previously said, all blocks are scanned [10], and only the blocks with a `sectype` [11] containing VCDATA are parsed [12]. These blocks are `FST_BL_VCDATA`, `FST_BL_VCDATA_DYN_ALIAS` and `FST_BL_VCDATA_DYN_ALIAS2`.

Later on, the code extracts the time block:

```
[13]         uint64_t tsec_nitems;
             ...
             /* process time block */
             {
             unsigned char *ucdata;
             unsigned char *cdata;
             unsigned long destlen /* = tsec_uclen */; /* scan-build */
             unsigned long sourcelen /*= tsec_clen */; /* scan-build */
             int rc;
             unsigned char *tpnt;
             uint64_t tpval;
             unsigned int ti;

             if(fstReaderFseeko(xc, xc->f, blkpos + seclen - 24, SEEK_SET) != 0) break;
             tsec_uclen = fstReaderUint64(xc->f);
             tsec_clen = fstReaderUint64(xc->f);
[14]         tsec_nitems = fstReaderUint64(xc->f);
     #ifdef FST_DEBUG
             fprintf(stderr, FST_APIMESS "time section unc: %d, com: %d (%d items)\n",
                     (int)tsec_uclen, (int)tsec_clen, (int)tsec_nitems);
     #endif
             if(tsec_clen > seclen) break; /* corrupted tsec_clen: by definition it can't be larger than size of section */
             ucdata = (unsigned char *)malloc(tsec_uclen);
             if(!ucdata) break; /* malloc fail as tsec_uclen out of range from corrupted file */
             destlen = tsec_uclen;
             sourcelen = tsec_clen;

             fstReaderFseeko(xc, xc->f, -24 - ((fst_off_t)tsec_clen), SEEK_CUR);

[15]         if(tsec_uclen != tsec_clen)
                     {
                     cdata = (unsigned char *)malloc(tsec_clen);
                     fstFread(cdata, tsec_clen, 1, xc->f);

                     rc = uncompress(ucdata, &destlen, cdata, sourcelen);

                     if(rc != Z_OK)
                             {
                             fprintf(stderr, FST_APIMESS "fstReaderIterBlocks2(), tsec uncompress rc = %d, exiting.\n", rc);
                             exit(255);
                             }

                     free(cdata);
                     }
                     else
                     {
                     fstFread(ucdata, tsec_uclen, 1, xc->f);
                     }

             free(time_table);
[16]         time_table = (uint64_t *)calloc(tsec_nitems, sizeof(uint64_t));
             tpnt = ucdata;
             tpval = 0;
[17]         for(ti=0;ti<tsec_nitems;ti++)
                     {
                     int skiplen;
                     uint64_t val = fstGetVarint64(tpnt, &skiplen);
[18]                 tpval = time_table[ti] = tpval + val;
                     tpnt += skiplen;
                     }

             tc_head = (uint32_t *)calloc(tsec_nitems /* scan-build */ ? tsec_nitems : 1, sizeof(uint32_t));
             free(ucdata);
             }

```

At [14] `tsec_nitems` is read from file. Along with `tsec_clen`, `tsec_uclen` represents the size respectively of compressed and uncompressed time block data.

`tsec_nitems` represents the number of elements in the time table.

Right after these 3 fields, we have the time table block data, which is a series of 64-bit LEB128-encoded varints. This section can however be zlib-compressed if `tsec_uclen` is different from `tsec_clen` [15].

At [16] the `time_table` is allocated using `calloc`, with an element count of `tsec_nitems` and an element size of `sizeof(uint64_t)`. `calloc` internally multiplies `tsec_nitems` by `sizeof(uint64_t)`, which could lead to an integer overflow, depending on the `calloc` implementation: some implementations (for example glibc) will detect the overflow and return 0, leading to just crashing GTKWave. If the `calloc` implementation, however, doesn’t detect the overflow, `calloc` may end up allocating a very small buffer. For example on 64-bit systems, a `tsec_nitems` value of `0x2000000000000000` will lead to allocating a small buffer (again, the actual size depends on the implementation). In this case, the buffer will be too small to fit `tsec_nitems`, so the loop at [17], which extracts varints from the file and writes them in `time_table[ti]`, will eventually write out-of-bounds in the heap, with attacker-controlled values, leading to memory corruption. Because of the multi-threaded nature of GTKWave, an attacker may be able to exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code.

A special note for 32-bit systems: As `calloc` expects `size_t` arguments, and `tsec_nitems` is of type `uint64_t` [13], `tsec_nitems` will be implicitly cast to a 32-bit value. So, on 32-bit systems this issue is triggerable even if `calloc` performs overflow checks, as the casting happens before the call, leading to calling `calloc(0, 8)`.
