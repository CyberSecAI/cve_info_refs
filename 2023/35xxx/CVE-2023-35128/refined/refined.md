Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-35128:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow in the `fstReaderIterBlocks2` function of GTKWave when processing `.fst` files. Specifically, the `tsec_nitems` value read from the file is used to allocate memory for the `time_table` using `calloc`. If `tsec_nitems` is sufficiently large, the multiplication `tsec_nitems * sizeof(uint64_t)` within `calloc` can overflow, leading to a smaller than expected memory allocation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The core issue is the integer overflow within the `calloc` function, caused by a large, attacker-controlled `tsec_nitems` value.
*   **Heap-based Buffer Overflow:** When the `time_table` is allocated with a small size due to the integer overflow, subsequent writes to this array in the loop at [17] become out-of-bounds, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The software does not properly validate or sanitize the `tsec_nitems` value, allowing an attacker to control this parameter directly via a malicious `.fst` file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** The out-of-bounds write corrupts heap memory, which can cause unpredictable behavior, including application crashes or potentially arbitrary code execution. The provided crash information shows a heap-buffer-overflow as a result of the vulnerability.
*  **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The report mentions that due to the multi-threaded nature of GTKWave, an attacker may be able to exploit the memory corruption for arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious File:** The primary attack vector is a specially crafted `.fst` file containing a large `tsec_nitems` value that triggers the overflow.
*   **User Interaction:** A victim needs to open the malicious `.fst` file with GTKWave to trigger the vulnerability. This could happen by double-clicking the file, which could be received via e-mail, for example.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to create a malicious .fst file:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a .fst file with a large `tsec_nitems` value.
*   **Victim Interaction:** The attacker needs to trick a victim to open the malicious file with the vulnerable software.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is present in GTKWave version 3.3.115.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 3.3.118.
*   The vulnerability is triggered when `tsec_nitems` leads to an integer overflow, causing `calloc` to allocate a small buffer, which will then be overflowed in a subsequent write, corrupting the heap.
*   The vulnerability is also triggerable on 32-bit systems regardless of `calloc` performing overflow checks, as casting `tsec_nitems` from `uint64_t` to `size_t` (32 bits on 32-bit archs) happens before the call.
*   The provided crash information includes an AddressSanitizer report demonstrating the heap-buffer-overflow.
