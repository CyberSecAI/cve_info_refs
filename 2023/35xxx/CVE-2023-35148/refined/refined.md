The provided content relates to CVE-2023-35148.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Digital.ai App Management Publisher Plugin does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints and does not require POST requests for these endpoints.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability due to the lack of POST request requirement.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers with Overall/Read permission can connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

**Attack vectors:**
- By sending crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints.
- By tricking a user into sending malicious requests through CSRF.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker requires Overall/Read permission in Jenkins.
- The attacker needs knowledge of existing credentials IDs.
- The attacker can use CSRF to exploit the lack of POST request verification.
