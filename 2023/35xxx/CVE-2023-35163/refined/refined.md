Based on the provided information, this content is related to **CVE-2023-35163**.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that the `txId` field of a `ChainEvent` is used for duplication checks but not during the subsequent on-chain verification. This allows a malicious validator to bypass the duplication check by changing the `txId` of an existing `ChainEvent`, thus tricking the Vega network into re-processing past Ethereum events.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of proper validation of the `txId` field during on-chain verification.
- Inadequate duplication check mechanism for `ChainEvent` transactions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A malicious validator could re-process past Ethereum events, leading to:
- **Unlimited funds generation:** Replaying deposit events can create unlimited amounts of any asset.
- **Control of voting power:** Replaying stake deposit events can grant a single node excessive voting power.
- **Denial of service and reward prevention:** Replaying stake removed or signer removed events can cause validators to fall below self-stake or be removed from the multisig, preventing payouts.
- **Network disruption:** Replaying bridge stop events could stop withdrawals.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious validator with access to a validator's Vega key can submit a crafted transaction to the Vega network.
- The attacker needs to be able to access a node's Tendermint API to scrape a valid chain event transaction.
- The attacker needs to be able to modify the `txId` field of the `ChainEvent` before re-submitting the transaction.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Access to a validator's Vega key.
- Ability to scrape valid chain events from the Tendermint block data via a nodeâ€™s Tendermint API.
- Ability to craft and sign transactions for resubmission to the Vega network.
- The attacker needs to be a validator to exploit this vulnerability.
