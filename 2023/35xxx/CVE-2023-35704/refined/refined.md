Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-35704:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the `fstReaderVarint32WithSkip` function, which is used to decode LEB128 encoded variable-length integers from a file. This function uses a fixed-size stack buffer to store the bytes read from the file, and it doesn't properly check if the number of bytes in the LEB128 encoded input exceeds the buffer size.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The `fstReaderVarint32WithSkip` function allocates a 5-byte buffer on the stack. The function reads bytes from the input file until a byte with the most significant bit (MSB) set to 0 is encountered. An attacker-controlled file can provide an arbitrary number of bytes with the MSB set, overflowing the stack buffer and overwriting adjacent memory regions.
- **Lack of bounds checking:** The function does not validate that the number of bytes read from the file does not exceed the size of the stack buffer before writing to it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary code execution:** By overflowing the stack buffer, an attacker can overwrite return addresses or other critical data on the stack. This allows an attacker to gain control of the program's execution flow, leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious FST file:** An attacker can craft a malicious `.fst` file containing a specially crafted LEB128 encoded sequence that overflows the stack buffer in `fstReaderVarint32WithSkip` when the file is opened using GTKWave.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Ability to create/modify FST files:** The attacker needs to be able to create or modify a `.fst` file.
-   **Victim Interaction:** The victim needs to open the crafted `.fst` file with the vulnerable version of GTKWave. This could be achieved through social engineering or by tricking the user into opening the file.

**Additional Information:**

- The provided text also describes similar vulnerabilities in the `fstReaderVarint32` (CVE-2023-35702) and `fstReaderVarint64` (CVE-2023-35703) functions, which use 5-byte and 16-byte stack buffers respectively, and have the same out-of-bounds write vulnerability due to lack of bounds checking.
-   The vulnerability is triggered during the parsing of the FST's VCDATA section.
- The fix for this vulnerability is available in GTKWave version 3.3.118
