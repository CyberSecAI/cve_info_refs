Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-35147:

**CVE-2023-35147**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The AWS CodeCommit Trigger Plugin does not properly restrict the queue name path parameter in an HTTP endpoint.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   **Path Traversal:** The plugin allows the use of a user-controlled path parameter in an HTTP endpoint without proper sanitization. This enables the attacker to specify arbitrary file paths on the Jenkins controller file system.
    *   **Missing Authorization:** The plugin does not implement sufficient authorization checks, as an attacker with "Item/Read" permissions can access the endpoint.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with "Item/Read" permissions can read the contents of arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller file system. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, such as configuration files, secrets, or source code.
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   **Network Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited through network requests to the affected HTTP endpoint in the AWS CodeCommit Trigger plugin.
    *   **Maliciously Crafted Request:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable endpoint with a manipulated "queue name" parameter.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have "Item/Read" permissions in Jenkins.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the Jenkins controller.

**Additional Notes**

*   The advisory indicates that as of the publication date, there is no fix available for the AWS CodeCommit Trigger Plugin.
