Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2023-35152:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper escaping of user-controlled input within the `LiveTableResultPage` of the XWiki platform. Specifically, when rendering the user profile information in a LiveTable, the system doesn't sanitize the user's first name field, allowing a malicious user to inject Velocity code. This code is then executed with programming rights when the `LiveTableResultPage` is accessed, resulting in privilege escalation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Inadequate Input Sanitization:** The primary vulnerability lies in the insufficient sanitization of user input, particularly the first name field in user profiles.
*   **Velocity Template Injection:**  Attackers can insert Velocity code into their first name, which is then evaluated when the `LiveTableResultPage` is accessed.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The injected Velocity code is executed with programming rights, allowing the attacker to perform actions they would not normally be authorized to do.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A standard user can gain programming rights by injecting and executing malicious Velocity code.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** With programming rights, the attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to complete system compromise.
*   **Data Manipulation/Exposure:** Attackers could potentially modify or access sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **User Profile Modification:** An attacker changes their first name in their user profile to include malicious Velocity code.
2.  **Like Button Interaction:** The attacker clicks the "Like" button on their own user profile.
3.  **Accessing `LiveTableResultPage`:** The attacker crafts a URL to `LiveTableResultPage` that includes a parameter `eval` containing further code. When the URL is accessed, the previously injected malicious Velocity code in the user's first name is executed, along with the code passed in the URL parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have a valid user account on the XWiki platform.
*   **Basic User Permissions:** No special permissions are required beyond being a logged-in user.
*   **Knowledge of Velocity Template Language:** The attacker needs knowledge of the Velocity template language to craft malicious payloads.
*   **Ability to Modify User Profile:** Ability to modify their own user profile.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability exists because the user's first name is used directly in the `LiveTableResultPage`, which dynamically generates content based on user actions, and the document title is not sanitized.
*   The vulnerability was present in older versions of XWiki.Like.UserProfileUIX before it was moved to `LiveTableResultPage`.
*   The vulnerability was resolved in XWiki versions 14.4.8, 14.10.6, and 15.1.
*   A patch is available to correct the vulnerability.

**CVE Information:**

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2023-35152
*   **CVSS Score:** 10.0 (Critical)
*   **CWE:** CWE-95 (Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection'))
