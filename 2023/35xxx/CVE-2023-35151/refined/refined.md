Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-35151

**Description:** The vulnerability relates to email addresses being displayed in clear text in REST API responses, even when email obfuscation is enabled. Additionally, hashed passwords were also being returned in the REST API, which could make them susceptible to offline attacks.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `ModelFactory.java` class within the XWiki REST API was not correctly applying email obfuscation when serializing object properties for REST responses. Specifically, the `cleanupBeforeMakingPublic` method, responsible for obfuscating email addresses, was not consistently invoked in all scenarios. Additionally, the same method was not properly hiding password values, which resulted in them being exposed in REST responses as well.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Data Exposure:** Email addresses were being returned in plain text via the REST API, violating the intended obfuscation policy.
- **Password Exposure:** Hashed passwords were also being exposed in the REST API, which could be targeted via offline cracking attempts.
- **Inconsistent application of security policy:** The email obfuscation logic was not consistently applied.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** Attackers could obtain email addresses of users, which could be used for phishing or other malicious purposes.
- **Credential Compromise:** Exposed hashed passwords, if weak, could potentially be cracked offline, leading to account compromise.
- **Privacy Violation:** The exposure of user information violates privacy and security expectations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exposed through the REST API, which is accessible over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to access the REST API endpoint.
- No authentication is required to exploit the email exposure since the vulnerability exists on endpoints that expose user information.
- No user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details from Content:**
- The vulnerability is present in XWiki versions >= 7.3-milestone-1.
- Patched versions are 15.1, 14.10.6, and 14.4.8.
- The vulnerability is categorized as a "Blocker" bug.
- The issue is tracked under XWIKI-16138 in the XWiki Jira.
- The fix involved ensuring consistent application of the email obfuscation logic within the `cleanupBeforeMakingPublic` method in `ModelFactory.java` and not exposing passwords via the REST API.
- The fix was implemented in commit `824cd742ecf5439971247da11bfe7e0ad2b10ede`.
- The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 7.5 (High), with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
