Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in the GitHub issue:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the insecure deserialization of data using `sofa-hessian` and `fastjson` libraries in the Solon framework. Although `sofa-hessian` was intended to fix an earlier RCE issue, it can be bypassed by crafting a specific payload using `UnixPrintServiceLookup` class.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Deserialization:** The application deserializes data from HTTP requests without proper validation or sanitization, making it vulnerable to malicious payloads.
*   **Bypass of `sofa-hessian`:**  The vulnerability demonstrates that the fix using `sofa-hessian` is not sufficient to prevent RCE via deserialization.
*   **Usage of `UnixPrintServiceLookup`:** The exploit leverages the `UnixPrintServiceLookup` class to execute arbitrary commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server, potentially leading to complete compromise of the system.
*   **Data Breach:**  The attacker could access sensitive data stored on the server.
*   **System Takeover:** The attacker could take full control of the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** An attacker sends a crafted HTTP request with malicious Hessian serialized data.
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerable endpoint is the `/rpc/v1/user/getUser` which accepts the malicious data in the request body using the "application/hessian" content type.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   **Understanding of Hessian Deserialization:** The attacker needs to understand how to craft a malicious Hessian payload.
*   **Vulnerable Endpoint Access:** The attacker needs to identify and send the request to the correct vulnerable endpoint.
*   **Knowledge of Target OS:** The `UnixPrintServiceLookup` payload only works on Unix-like operating systems.

**Additional Details:**

*   The issue references an earlier issue, [issues73](https://github.com/noear/solon/issues/73), related to a previous RCE vulnerability due to `solon.serialization.hessian`.
*   The provided example code demonstrates how to generate the malicious payload.
*   The vulnerability is tested using Jdk8u92, and the application is based on an official example.
*   The fix involved disabling non-serializable classes in Hessian2Output.
