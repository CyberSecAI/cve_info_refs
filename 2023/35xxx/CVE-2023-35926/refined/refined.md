Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-35926:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The Backstage Scaffolder plugin used the `vm2` library for sandboxing its `nunjucks` templating engine. `vm2` had known past vulnerabilities and potential unfixed ones which could be exploited.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure sandboxing of the templating engine in the Scaffolder backend plugin due to the usage of `vm2`. This allowed for code injection.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A malicious actor with write access to a registered scaffolder template could manipulate the template to achieve remote code execution (RCE) on the scaffolder-backend instance.

**Attack vectors:**
- By manipulating the template YAML definition itself. This does not involve user input data.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs write access to a registered scaffolder template. This implies the attacker would have a high level of privileges within the Backstage system or have compromised an account with such permissions.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability was present in versions prior to 1.15.0 of `@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-backend`.
- The fix involves replacing `vm2` with `isolated-vm`, a library based on `v8` isolates, for sandboxing.
-  The [Backstage Threat Model](https://backstage.io/docs/overview/threat-model) recommends controlling access to scaffolder templates and performing manual reviews, which could mitigate the exploit as it's easily discoverable through manual review.
