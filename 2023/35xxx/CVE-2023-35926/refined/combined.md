These are the release notes for the v1.15.0 release of

[Backstage](https://backstage.io/).

A huge thanks to the whole team of maintainers and contributors as well as the

amazing Backstage Community for their hard work in getting this release

developed and done.

## Highlights

This release has a few important security fixes, along with a lot of squashed

bugs and exciting additions as usual! Enjoy.

### **BREAKING**: Scaffolder build requirements

The Scaffolder backend uses a sandboxing environment to run its `nunjucks`

templating in, for security reasons. This used to leverage the `vm2` library,

but in this release it has been replaced by `isolated-vm`. This significantly

improves the confidence level in the sandbox implementation since it builds upon

`v8` isolates directly. However, it comes with a cost to implementers: it is a

native dependency, and as such needs to be built during `yarn` installation, on

the exact architecture that it then executes on. For those who compile and run

Backstage on stripped-down environments, you will want to ensure that you have

the build basics present, e.g. `build-essential` or similar corresponding to

your operating system of choice. The `isolated-vm` repo has [some further

information](https://github.com/laverdet/isolated-vm#requirements) about the

build environment requirements.

There is a [CVE-2022-39266](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-39266)

that has been reported for `isolated-vm`, which applies only when using

`CachedDataOptions`. We do not use that feature at all, since it is recommended

against in the [README](https://github.com/laverdet/isolated-vm#shared-options);

doing so can lead to breakouts and calling back to the main process. Some

security tools may report that this is a vulnerability but it is safe to ignore

this through your `.snyk` policy file or similar.

### **BREAKING**: `@backstage/plugin-linguist-backend`

There have been some significant updates to the Linguist plugin, in particular

the backend and its API. One breaking change is that `LinguistBackendApi` is now

an interface rather than a class, and you should create its implementation

`LinguistBackendClient` instead.

Contributed by [@ahhhndre](https://github.com/ahhhndre) in

[#16954](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/16954)

### **BREAKING**: `@backstage/plugin-github-actions`

In order to make this plugin support GitHub enterprise as well as cloud, its

`GithubActionsClient` is updated to take an `scmAuthApi` instead of the previous

`githubAuthApi`.

Contributed by [@koalaty-code](https://github.com/koalaty-code) in

[#17781](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/17781)

### New module: Unprocessed Entities

This frontend plugin and accompanying backend module lets you peek under the

covers of your catalog instance, finding those pesky unprocessed entities that

may be stuck in limbo because of an otherwise tricky-to-debug validation issue

or similar.

Check out [the plugin’s

README](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/plugins/catalog-unprocessed-entities/README.md)

for details and installation instructions.

[#17828](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/17828)

### More movement toward Material-UI v5 and React v18 compatibility

There have been some tweaks here or there to types and the theme system to

ensure a smooth future migration toward Material-UI version 5. This should be

mostly transparent to adopters, but please let us know if you encounter any

oddities around the theme system after upgrading to this release.

To ensure your future compatibility with v5 plugins, you may want to upgrade

your theme provider to use the new unified one:

```
     Provider: ({ children }) => (
-    <ThemeProvider theme={lightTheme}>
-      <CssBaseline>{children}</CssBaseline>
-    </ThemeProvider>
+    <UnifiedThemeProvider theme={builtinThemes.light} children={children} />
     ),
```

We’ve also ensured to be more thorough with how we use `PropsWithChildren` to

ensure that there’s a smooth transition to the non-implicit children in the

React v18 types.

### New Backend System lifecycle changes

When using [the new Backend system](https://backstage.io/docs/backend-system/),

plugins are now started up concurrently instead of serially. This improves

startup times significantly in some cases.

If you were relying on feature registration order to make sure that one plugin

was completely initialized before being consumed by other plugins, we at the

same time introduced a new `addStartupHook` method to the

`coreServices.lifecycle` that you can use instead to act after all plugin inits

have completed.

At the same time, the default HTTP server implementation adds a middleware to

the top of the chain, which stalls incoming requests for a short period of time

while waiting for service startup. If it takes longer than that predefined time,

it responds with a `503 Service Unavailable` error. The end result is that as

long as startup is typically fast, callers should only see slightly higher

turnaround times for requests to services that are starting up, instead of

getting 404 errors or similar which was often the case in the past.

### Azure identity improvements

On the Azure front, there’s been work toward ensuring support for service

principals, managed identities, and workload identities.

### Resource utilization and error display for k8s pods

You can now see some resource utilization statistics and errors, where present,

for your Kubernetes pods.

[#18169](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/18169)

### Printable TechDocs

There have been some changes to the TechDocs styles, to properly handle `print`

media. This should make PDF exports and printing of documentation work better.

Let us know how it goes!

[#18007](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/18007)

### OpenAPI linting

The `backstage-repo-tools` CLI’s OpenAPI features now have a new `lint`

subcommand. This lets you automatically lint the OpenAPI schemas of plugins for

correctness and best practices.

Contributed by [@sennyeya](https://github.com/sennyeya) in

[#18185](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/18185)

### Catalog conflict events (experimental)

If you pass in an event broker to the catalog backend, it now has the

experimental ability to emit events onto the event bus describing entity

conflicts as they happen internally. This can then be observed and acted upon by

external consumers.

[#16977](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/16977)

## Security Fixes

* See the note above about the Scaffolder replacing `vm2` with `isolated-vm`.
* There were some cases where sensitive configuration settings could be seen by

  the browser. The configuration schemas have been tightened up accordingly in a

  few places to counter this.
* The TechDocs base Docker image has been upgraded to include a few security

  fixes. This will get picked up automatically for future Docker based TechDocs

  runs, after upgrading Backstage.

## Upgrade path

We recommend that you keep your Backstage project up to date with this latest

release. For more guidance on how to upgrade, check out the documentation for

# Insecure sandbox in Backstage Scaffolder plugin

High

[Rugvip](/Rugvip)
published
GHSA-wg6p-jmpc-xjmr
Jun 21, 2023

## Package

npm

@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-backend
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

< 1.15.0

## Patched versions

1.15.0

## Description

The Backstage scaffolder-backend plugin uses a templating library that requires a sandbox, as it by design allows for code injection. The library used for this sandbox so far has been `vm2`, but in light of several past vulnerabilities and existing vulnerabilities that may not have a fix, the plugin has switched to using a different sandbox library.

### Impact

A malicious actor with write access to a registered scaffolder template could manipulate the template in a way that allows for remote code execution on the scaffolder-backend instance. This was only exploitable in the template YAML definition itself and not by user input data.

### Patches

This is vulnerability is fixed in version 1.15.0 of `@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-backend`.

### Workarounds

Note that the [Backstage Threat Model](https://backstage.io/docs/overview/threat-model) states that scaffolder templates are considered to be a sensitive area that with the recommendation that you control access and perform manual reviews of changes to the scaffolder templates. The exploit is of a nature where it is easily discoverable in manual review.
