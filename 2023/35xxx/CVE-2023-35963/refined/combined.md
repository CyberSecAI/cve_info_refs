# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2023-1786

## GTKWave decompression OS command injection vulnerabilities

##### January 8, 2024

##### CVE Number

CVE-2023-35963,CVE-2023-35960,CVE-2023-35964,CVE-2023-35959,CVE-2023-35961,CVE-2023-35962

##### SUMMARY

Multiple OS command injection vulnerabilities exist in the decompression functionality of GTKWave 3.3.115. A specially crafted wave file can lead to arbitrary command execution. A victim would need to open a malicious file to trigger these vulnerabilities.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

GTKWave 3.3.115

##### PRODUCT URLS

GTKWave - <https://gtkwave.sourceforge.net>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

7.8 - CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

##### CWE

CWE-78 - Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command (â€˜OS Command Injectionâ€™)

##### DETAILS

GTKWave is a wave viewer, often used to analyze FPGA simulations and logic analyzer captures. It uses a graphical user interface to convert the traces across several file formats (`.lxt`, `.lxt2`, `.vzt`, `.fst`, `.ghw`, `.vcd`, `.evcd`) either by using the UI or its command line tools. GTKWave is available for Linux, Windows and MacOS. Trace files can be shared within teams or organizations, for example to compare results of simulation runs across different design implementations, to analyze protocols captured with logic analyzers or just as a reference when porting design implementations.

GTKWave sets up mime types for its supported extensions, so for example itâ€™s enough for a victim to double-click on a wave file received by e-mail to trigger the vulnerabilities described in this advisory.

GTKWave supports opening wave files compressed with `gzip`, `bzip2`, or `zip`. For decompression, external programs are used and executed against input files by using `popen`. This leads to trivial command injections on the input file names. The different vulnerable flows are described separately.

#### CVE-2023-35959 - GHW decompression

When `gtkwave` opens a file, the function `main_2` is called. This is a pretty long function, so weâ€™re going to highlight only the lines needed to trace the issue.

When a `.ghw`, `.ghw.gz` or `.ghw.bz2` file is opened, we enter the condition at `main.c:1771`, and `ghw_main()` is called:

```
else if (suffix_check(GLOBALS->loaded_file_name, ".ghw") || suffix_check(GLOBALS->loaded_file_name, ".ghw.gz") ||
        suffix_check(GLOBALS->loaded_file_name, ".ghw.bz2"))
    {
          GLOBALS->loaded_file_type = GHW_FILE;
[1]   if(!ghw_main(GLOBALS->loaded_file_name))
        {
        /* error message printed in ghw_main() */
        vcd_exit(255);
        }
    }

```

`GLOBALS->loaded_file_name` contains the name of the input file.

`ghw_main()` in turn calls `ghw_open()`, where `filename` is the name of the input file:

```
    ghw_open (struct ghw_handler *h, const char *filename)
    {
      char hdr[16];

[2]   h->stream = fopen (filename, "rb");
      if (h->stream == NULL)
        return -1;

[3]   if (fread (hdr, sizeof (hdr), 1, h->stream) != 1)
        return -1;

      /* Check compression layer.  */
[4]   if (!memcmp (hdr, "\x1f\x8b", 2))
        {
[5]       if (ghw_openz (h, "gzip -cd", filename) < 0)
        return -1;
          if (fread (hdr, sizeof (hdr), 1, h->stream) != 1)
        return -1;
        }
[4]   else if (!memcmp (hdr, "BZ", 2))
        {
[5]        if (ghw_openz (h, "bzip2 -cd", filename) < 0)
        return -1;
          if (fread (hdr, sizeof (hdr), 1, h->stream) != 1)
        return -1;
        }
      else
        {
          h->stream_ispipe = 0;
        }

```

At [2] the input file is opened and the first 16 bytes are read (`sizeof(hdr)`). If the file starts with a gzip or bzip2 magic [4] (`\x1f\x8b` or `BZ`), `ghw_openz()` is called, passing the filename as second argument [6].

```
    static int
    ghw_openz (struct ghw_handler *h, const char *decomp, const char *filename)
    {
      int plen = strlen (decomp) + 1 + strlen (filename) + 1;
      char *p = malloc (plen);

[6]   snprintf (p, plen, "%s %s", decomp, filename);
      fclose (h->stream);
[7]   h->stream = popen (p, "r");
      free (p);

      if (h->stream == NULL)
        return -1;

      h->stream_ispipe = 1;

      return 0;
    }

```

This function concatenates the decompression command with the input file name [6] and passes it to `popen`, which means `p` is executed as a shell command. As filename has not been sanitized and `popen` is used, this leads to a command injection via the input file name.

#### CVE-2023-35960 - `vcd_main` legacy decompression

When `gtkwave` opens a file, the function `main_2` is called. This is a pretty long function, so weâ€™re going to highlight only the lines needed to trace the issue.

When the `-L` switch is given, `gtkwave` will try to open VCD files in legacy mode, setting the `is_legacy` variable to `1` inside the `main_2` function. This will land us at `main.c:1830`:

```
    if(is_legacy)
        {
          GLOBALS->loaded_file_type = (strcmp(GLOBALS->loaded_file_name, "-vcd")) ? VCD_FILE : DUMPLESS_FILE;
[1]       vcd_main(GLOBALS->loaded_file_name);
        }

```

At [1] `vcd_main()` is called, passing the input file name as argument.

```
    #define WAVE_DECOMPRESSOR "gzip -cd "   /* zcat alone doesn't cut it for AIX */
    ...

    TimeType vcd_main(char *fname)
    {
    ...
[2] if(suffix_check(fname, ".gz") || suffix_check(fname, ".zip"))
        {
        char *str;
        int dlen;
        dlen=strlen(WAVE_DECOMPRESSOR);
        str=wave_alloca(strlen(fname)+dlen+1);
        strcpy(str,WAVE_DECOMPRESSOR);
[3]     strcpy(str+dlen,fname);
[4]     GLOBALS->vcd_handle_vcd_c_1=popen(str,"r");
        GLOBALS->vcd_is_compressed_vcd_c_1=~0;
        }

```

Inside `vcd_main()`, if the input file name ends with `.gz` or `.zip` [2], a command is built by concatenating the `WAVE_DECOMPRESSOR` string to the input file name [3] and passed to `popen` [4], which means `str` is executed as a shell command. As filename has not been sanitized and `popen` is used, this leads to a command injection via the input file name.

#### CVE-2023-35961 - `vcd_recorder_main` decompression

When `gtkwave` opens a file, the function `main_2` is called. This is a pretty long function, so weâ€™re going to highlight only the lines needed to trace the issue.

If the `-L` switch is not used we enter the block at [1].

```
    if(is_legacy)
        {
          GLOBALS->loaded_file_type = (strcmp(GLOBALS->loaded_file_name, "-vcd")) ? VCD_FILE : DUMPLESS_FILE;
          vcd_main(GLOBALS->loaded_file_name);
        }
        else
[1]     {
          if(strcmp(GLOBALS->loaded_file_name, "-vcd"))
            {
            GLOBALS->loaded_file_type = VCD_RECODER_FILE;
            GLOBALS->use_fastload = is_fastload;
            }
            else
            {
            GLOBALS->loaded_file_type = DUMPLESS_FILE;
            GLOBALS->use_fastload = VCD_FSL_NONE;
            }
[2]       vcd_recoder_main(GLOBALS->loaded_file_name);
        }

```

In this case, `gtkwave` will open VCD files using `vcd_recoder_main()` [2], passing the input file name as argument.

```
    #define WAVE_DECOMPRESSOR "gzip -cd "   /* zcat alone doesn't cut it for AIX */
    ...

    TimeType vcd_recoder_main(char *fname)
    {
    ...

[3]  if(suffix_check(fname, ".gz") || suffix_check(fname, ".zip"))
        {
        char *str;
        int dlen;
        dlen=strlen(WAVE_DECOMPRESSOR);
        str=wave_alloca(strlen(fname)+dlen+1);
        strcpy(str,WAVE_DECOMPRESSOR);
[4]     strcpy(str+dlen,fname);
[5]     GLOBALS->vcd_handle_vcd_recoder_c_2=popen(str,"r");
        GLOBALS->vcd_is_compressed_vcd_recoder_c_2=~0;
        }

```

Inside `vcd_recoder_main()`, if the input file name ends with `.gz` or `.zip` [3], a command is built by concatenating the `WAVE_DECOMPRESSOR` string to the input file name [4] and passed to `popen` [5], which means `str` is executed as a shell command. As filename has not been sanitized and `popen` is used, this leads to a command injection via the input file name.

#### CVE-2023-35962 - vcd2vzt vcd\_main decompression

When `vcd2vzt` opens a file, it calls `vcd_main()` in `vcd2vzt.c` to parse the input file, passing the input file name as first argument.

```
    #define WAVE_DECOMPRESSOR "gzip -cd "   /* zcat alone doesn't cut it for AIX */
    ...

    TimeType vcd_main(char *fname, char *lxname)
    {
    ...
[1] if((strlen(fname)>2)&&(!strcmp(fname+strlen(fname)-3,".gz")))
        {
        char *str;
        int dlen;
        dlen=strlen(WAVE_DECOMPRESSOR);
        str=(char *)wave_alloca(strlen(fname)+dlen+1);
        strcpy(str,WAVE_DECOMPRESSOR);
[2]     strcpy(str+dlen,fname);
[3]     vcd_handle=popen(str,"r");
        vcd_is_compressed=~0;

```

Inside `vcd_main()`, if the input file name ends with `.gz` [1], a command is built by concatenating the `WAVE_DECOMPRESSOR` string to the input file name [2] and passed to `popen` [3], which means `str` is executed as a shell command. As filename has not been sanitized and `popen` is used, this leads to a command injection via the input file name.

#### CVE-2023-35963 - vcd2lxt2 vcd\_main decompression

When `vcd2lxt2` opens a file, it calls `vcd_main()` in `vcd2lxt2.c` to parse the input file, passing the input file name as first argument.

```
    #define WAVE_DECOMPRESSOR "gzip -cd "   /* zcat alone doesn't cut it for AIX */
    ...

    TimeType vcd_main(char *fname, char *lxname)
    {
    ...
[1] if((strlen(fname)>2)&&(!strcmp(fname+strlen(fname)-3,".gz")))
        {
        char *str;
        int dlen;
        dlen=strlen(WAVE_DECOMPRESSOR);
        str=(char *)wave_alloca(strlen(fname)+dlen+1);
        strcpy(str,WAVE_DECOMPRESSOR);
[2]     strcpy(str+dlen,fname);
[3]     vcd_handle=popen(str,"r");
        vcd_is_compressed=~0;

```

Inside `vcd_main()`, if the input file name ends with `.gz` [1], a command is built by concatenating the `WAVE_DECOMPRESSOR` string to the input file name [2] and passed to `popen` [3], which means `str` is executed as a shell command. As filename has not been sanitized and `popen` is used, this leads to a command injection via the input file name.

#### CVE-2023-35964 - vcd2lxt vcd\_main decompression

When `vcd2lxt` opens a file, it calls `vcd_main()` in `vcd2lxt.c` to parse the input file, passing the input file name as first argument.

```
    #define WAVE_DECOMPRESSOR "gzip -cd "   /* zcat alone doesn't cut it for AIX */
    ...

    TimeType vcd_main(char *fname, char *lxname, int dostats, int doclock, int dochg, int dodict, int linear)
    {
    ...
[1] if((strlen(fname)>2)&&(!strcmp(fname+strlen(fname)-3,".gz")))
        {
        char *str;
        int dlen;
        dlen=strlen(WAVE_DECOMPRESSOR);
        str=(char *)wave_alloca(strlen(fname)+dlen+1);
        strcpy(str,WAVE_DECOMPRESSOR);
[2]     strcpy(str+dlen,fname);
[3]     vcd_handle=popen(str,"r");
        vcd_is_compressed=~0;

```

Inside `vcd_main()`, if the input file name ends with `.gz` [1], a command is built by concatenating the `WAVE_DECOMPRESSOR` string to the input file name [2] and passed to `popen` [3], which means `str` is executed as a shell command.
