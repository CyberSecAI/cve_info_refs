Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-35670:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in how legacy apps with external storage permissions can insert entries into the MediaProvider (MP).
*   Specifically, these apps can attempt to create entries for file paths located in other apps' private external storage directories.
*   This is achieved by using non-canonical paths in insertion calls to MediaProvider.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Manipulation:** The core issue is the lack of proper canonicalization (normalization) of file paths when inserting data into the MediaProvider. This allows for a path manipulation vulnerability.
*   **Access Control Bypass:** By using non-canonical paths, legacy apps are able to target other apps' private storage areas indirectly, where they normally would not have access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** While the bulletin labels it as a High severity EoP, the specifics of the elevated privileges are not detailed in the text itself. However, an attacker could potentially write to storage areas normally protected from access by their app using MediaProvider as an intermediary. The impact is likely related to gaining unauthorized write access to sensitive data or potentially causing other unexpected system behaviors by writing to arbitrary private directories.
*   **Information Disclosure:** This vulnerability could potentially lead to information disclosure by being able to observe how changes to targeted paths affect the MediaProvider. It could also be used to verify the existence of files and directories within other app's private storage areas by observing the MediaProvider's responses to manipulated insertion calls.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Application:** An attacker would need to have a malicious application installed on the target device with the legacy external storage permissions to insert content using MediaProvider.
*   **Manipulated File Path:** The malicious application needs to construct non-canonical file paths to target other apps' private directories.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Installed Application:** The attacker needs to have an application installed on the Android device, which has legacy external storage permissions. This means the user must grant the app these permissions upon installation.
*   **Knowledge of Target Paths:** The attacker needs to be able to determine the private storage paths of other applications they intend to manipulate, although this information may be easily acquired by testing.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided commit message from AOSP confirms that the fix involves canonicalizing the file paths before insertion into the MediaProvider, preventing this type of bypass from succeeding.
*   This issue is addressed in the 2023-09-01 security patch level, highlighting its importance. It is also included as part of Project Mainline's MediaProvider component, implying that the fix can be rolled out via Google Play System updates for devices running Android 10 and later, without waiting for a full system update.
