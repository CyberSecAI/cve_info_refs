GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by
Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SIMATIC MV500 products are stationary optical readers, used to reliably capture printed, lasered, drilled,
punched and dotpeen codes on a variety of different surfaces.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-46828

In libtirpc before 1.3.3rc1, remote attackers could exhaust the ﬁle descriptors of a process that uses
libtirpc because idle TCP connections are mishandled. This can, in turn, lead to an svc_run inﬁnite
loop without accepting new connections.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-1012

A memory leak problem was found in the TCP source port generation algorithm in net/ipv4/tcp.c due
to the small table perturb size. This ﬂaw may allow an attacker to information leak and may cause a

Vulnerability CVE-2022-4304

A timing based side channel exists in the OpenSSL RSA Decryption implementation which could
be sufﬁcient to recover a plaintext across a network in a Bleichenbacher style attack. To achieve a
successful decryption an attacker would have to be able to send a very large number of trial messages
for decryption. The vulnerability affects all RSA padding modes: PKCS#1 v1.5, RSA-OEAP and
RSASVE. For example, in a TLS connection, RSA is commonly used by a client to send an encrypted
pre-master secret to the server. An attacker that had observed a genuine connection between a client
and a server could use this ﬂaw to send trial messages to the server and record the time taken to
process them. After a sufﬁciently large number of messages the attacker could recover the pre-master
secret used for the original connection and thus be able to decrypt the application data sent over that
connection.

CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength

Vulnerability CVE-2022-4450

The function PEM_read_bio_ex() reads a PEM ﬁle from a BIO and parses and decodes the “name”
(e.g. “CERTIFICATE"), any header data and the payload data. If the function succeeds then the
“name_out”, “header” and “data” arguments are populated with pointers to buffers containing the
relevant decoded data. The caller is responsible for freeing those buffers. It is possible to construct
a PEM ﬁle that results in 0 bytes of payload data.
In this case PEM_read_bio_ex() will return a
failure code but will populate the header argument with a pointer to a buffer that has already been
freed. If the caller also frees this buffer then a double free will occur. This will most likely lead to
a crash. This could be exploited by an attacker who has the ability to supply malicious PEM ﬁles
for parsing to achieve a denial of service attack. The functions PEM_read_bio() and PEM_read()
are simple wrappers around PEM_read_bio_ex() and therefore these functions are also directly
affected. These functions are also called indirectly by a number of other OpenSSL functions including
PEM_X509_INFO_read_bio_ex() and SSL_CTX_use_serverinfo_ﬁle() which are also vulnerable.
Some OpenSSL internal uses of these functions are not vulnerable because the caller does not
free the header argument if PEM_read_bio_ex() returns a failure code. These locations include the
PEM_read_bio_TYPE() functions as well as the decoders introduced in OpenSSL 3.0. The OpenSSL
asn1parse command line application is also impacted by this issue.

Vulnerability CVE-2023-0215

The public API function BIO_new_NDEF is a helper function used for streaming ASN.1 data via a BIO. It
is primarily used internally to OpenSSL to support the SMIME, CMS and PKCS7 streaming capabilities,
but may also be called directly by end user applications. The function receives a BIO from the caller,
prepends a new BIO_f_asn1 ﬁlter BIO onto the front of it to form a BIO chain, and then returns the new
head of the BIO chain to the caller. Under certain conditions, for example if a CMS recipient public key
is invalid, the new ﬁlter BIO is freed and the function returns a NULL result indicating a failure. However,
in this case, the BIO chain is not properly cleaned up and the BIO passed by the caller still retains
internal pointers to the previously freed ﬁlter BIO. If the caller then goes on to call BIO_pop() on the
BIO then a use-after-free will occur. This will most likely result in a crash. This scenario occurs directly
in the internal function B64_write_ASN1() which may cause BIO_new_NDEF() to be called and will
subsequently call BIO_pop() on the BIO. This internal function is in turn called by the public API func-
tions PEM_write_bio_ASN1_stream, PEM_write_bio_CMS_stream, PEM_write_bio_PKCS7_stream,
SMIME_write_ASN1, SMIME_write_CMS and SMIME_write_PKCS7. Other public API functions
that may be impacted by this include i2d_ASN1_bio_stream, BIO_new_CMS, BIO_new_PKCS7,
i2d_CMS_bio_stream and i2d_PKCS7_bio_stream. The OpenSSL cms and smime command line
applications are similarly affected.

Vulnerability CVE-2023-0286

There is a type confusion vulnerability relating to X.400 address processing inside an X.509 Gener-
alName. X.400 addresses were parsed as an ASN1_STRING but the public structure deﬁnition for
GENERAL_NAME incorrectly speciﬁed the type of the x400Address ﬁeld as ASN1_TYPE. This ﬁeld is
subsequently interpreted by the OpenSSL function GENERAL_NAME_cmp as an ASN1_TYPE
rather than an ASN1_STRING. When CRL checking is enabled (i.e.
the application sets the
X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK ﬂag), this vulnerability may allow an attacker to pass arbitrary pointers
to a memcmp call, enabling them to read memory contents or enact a denial of service. In most cases,
the attack requires the attacker to provide both the certiﬁcate chain and CRL, neither of which need to
have a valid signature. If the attacker only controls one of these inputs, the other input must already
contain an X.400 address as a CRL distribution point, which is uncommon. As such, this vulnerability
is most likely to only affect applications which have implemented their own functionality for retrieving
CRLs over a network.
