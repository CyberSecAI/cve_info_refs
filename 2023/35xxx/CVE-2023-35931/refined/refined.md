Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-35931:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from insufficient escaping of the percentage symbol `%` when using `shescape`'s `quote`, `quoteAll`, `escape` or `escapeAll` functions with the `interpolation` option set to `true` on Windows using the Command Prompt (cmd.exe).
- Specifically, the `%` character is not properly escaped, leading to its interpretation as an environment variable reference by the command interpreter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Improper Input Sanitization:** The `shescape` library failed to properly sanitize or escape the `%` character when interpolation is enabled for cmd.exe.
- **Environment Variable Injection:** The lack of proper escaping allowed an attacker to inject environment variable references within the command being executed.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially gain read-only access to environment variables on the system where the vulnerable application is running.
- The injected environment variable could be any user-defined environment variable (like PATH) or other system environment variables, potentially exposing sensitive data.
- The example provided shows how the value of the PATH environment variable could be output using the vulnerable code.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Malicious Input:** An attacker could craft a string containing `%` followed by the name of the environment variable.
- **Vulnerable Application:** The vulnerability is triggered when the `shescape` library is used with the above-mentioned conditions (Windows, cmd.exe, interpolation enabled) and is then executed using the `child_process` module, or a similar command execution facility.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to influence the input strings that are processed by the vulnerable `shescape` library when used in a vulnerable configuration.
- The attacker does not need a high level of privilege on the system but needs to be able to supply the malicious input to a vulnerable application.
- The user/application running the code needs to be using the vulnerable `shescape` library on a Windows system using cmd.exe, with interpolation enabled.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability was addressed in `shescape` version `1.7.1`.
- The fix included escaping the `%` character by replacing it with `^%` to prevent it from being interpreted as an environment variable.
- The fix was implemented as part of the changes made in [Pull Request #982](https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/pull/982) and commit `d0fce70f987ac0d8331f93cb45d47e79436173ac`.
