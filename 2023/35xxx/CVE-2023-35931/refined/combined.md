### @ericcornelissen **[ericcornelissen](/ericcornelissen)** commented [Jun 21, 2023](#issue-1767909602) • edited Loading

Relates to [#976](https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/pull/976)

## Summary

Improve testing w.r.t. protection against injection of environment variables. Fix a bug uncovered by these new tests in escaping for CMD, which did not cover escaping for environment variables before this Pull Request.

As of this Pull Request the escaping of environment variables when using `quote(All)` is not perfect in that it adds unexpected characters to the string received by the target program. A solution for this was not found in time, but pushing out any solution for the environment variables bug is seen as more important. **EDIT**: See [#986](https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/pull/986) for a followup.

Sorry, something went wrong.

# Potential environment variable exposure on Windows with CMD

Low

[ericcornelissen](/ericcornelissen)
published
GHSA-3g7p-8qhx-mc8r
Jun 22, 2023

## Package

npm

shescape
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<1.7.1

## Patched versions

1.7.1

## Description

### Impact

This impact users of Shescape:

1. On Windows using the Windows Command Prompt (i.e. `cmd.exe`), and
2. Using `quote`/`quoteAll` or `escape`/`escapeAll` with the `interpolation` option set to `true`.

An attacker may be able to get read-only access to environment variables. Example:

```
import * as cp from "node:child_process";
import * as shescape from "shescape";

// 1. Prerequisites
const options = {
    shell: "cmd.exe",
    // Or
    shell: undefined, // Only if the default shell is CMD

    // And
    interpolation: true, // Only applies to `escape` and `escapeAll` usage
}

// 2. Attack (one of many)
const payload = "%PATH%";

// 3. Usage
let escapedPayload;

escapedPayload = shescape.quote(payload, options);
// Or
escapedPayload = shescape.quoteAll([payload], options);
// Or
escapedPayload = shescape.escape(payload, options);
// Or
escapedPayload = shescape.escapeAll([payload], options);

// And (example)
const result = cp.execSync(`echo Hello ${escapedPayload}`, options);

// 4. Impact
console.log(result.toString());
// Outputs "Hello" followed by the contents of the PATH environment variable
```
### Patches

This bug has been patched in [v1.7.1](https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/releases/tag/v1.7.1) which you can upgrade to now. No further changes are required.

### Workarounds

Alternatively, users can remove all instances of `%` from user input, either before or after using Shescape.
