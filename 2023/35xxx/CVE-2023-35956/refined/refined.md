Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2023-35956:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the `fstReaderIterBlocks2` function within GTKWave. This function is responsible for parsing VCDATA blocks within the .fst file format. The vulnerability arises from a lack of bounds checking when decompressing or copying data into the `mem_for_traversal` buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap-based buffer overflow:** Specifically, the `fastlz_decompress` function writes past the allocated buffer on the heap.
*   **Lack of bounds checking:** The decompression routines (LZ4, fastlz, and zlib) do not verify if the decompressed data will fit within the destination buffer (`mem_for_traversal`). Also, when copying data without decompression, a size check is missing.
*   **Controllable buffer size:** The size of the `mem_for_traversal` buffer is controlled by the attacker through the `mem_required_for_traversal` field in the .fst file.
*   **Controllable decompression size**: The attacker controls the `destlen` and `sourcelen` values through the crafted `.fst` file, influencing the amount of data that will be decompressed, without respect for the actual buffer size
*   **Controllable data:** The attacker also has control over the compressed data itself, meaning they can craft specific data to trigger the overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successfully exploiting this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine.
*   **Denial of Service:** A crash can be triggered leading to denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious .fst File:** The primary attack vector is a specially crafted `.fst` file.
*   **User Interaction:** The victim needs to open the malicious file using GTKWave to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Crafted FST File:** The attacker needs the ability to create or modify an .fst file with malicious data and control the size of the `mem_for_traversal` buffer and VCDATA sizes, offsets, and compression type.
*   **Delivery Method:** The attacker needs a method to deliver the malicious .fst file to the victim (e.g., email, file sharing, website download).
*   **Victim Action:** The victim must open the malicious .fst file with a vulnerable version of GTKWave.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in GTKWave versions up to 3.3.115.
*   The vulnerability is triggered in the `fstReaderIterBlocks2` function during the processing of VCDATA blocks.
*   The `chain_table` is a critical data structure, which contains offsets and lengths of the data that will be processed by the decompression and copy functions
*   The vulnerability is located in the handling of different compression types: LZ4, fastlz and zlib, and also in the case where the data is not compressed.
*   The Talos report provides a crash information with ASAN output, that clearly shows a heap-buffer-overflow due to an out-of-bounds write when reading data from the malicious file.
