NextCloud Server and NextCloud Enterprise Server provide file storage for Nextcloud, a self-hosted productivity platform. Starting in version 26.0.0 and prior to version 26.0.2, an attacker could supply a URL that redirects an unsuspecting victim from a legitimate domain to an attacker's site. Nextcloud Server and Nextcloud Enterprise Server 26.0.2 contain a patch for this issue. No known workarounds are available.
