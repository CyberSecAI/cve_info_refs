### @skjnldsv **[skjnldsv](/skjnldsv)** commented [May 11, 2023](#issue-1705191042)

Prevent the usage of unwanted redirects like

<https://nextcloud27.local/index.php/unsupported?redirect_url=aHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL25leHRjbG91ZC9zZXJ2ZXIv>

if it doesn't starts by a leading slash, it will ignore the `redirect_url` param and redirects to the cloud home

Sorry, something went wrong.

| The backport to stable26 failed. Please do this backport manually.  ``` # Switch to the target branch and update it git checkout stable26 git pull origin/stable26  # Create the new backport branch git checkout -b fix/foo-stable26  # Cherry pick the change from the commit sha1 of the change against the default branch # This might cause conflicts. Resolve them. git cherry-pick abc123  # Push the cherry pick commit to the remote repository and open a pull request git push origin fix/foo-stable26 ```  More info at <https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/developer_manual/getting_started/development_process.html#manual-backport> |

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
