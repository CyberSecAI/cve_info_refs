Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-35171

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is an open redirect flaw in the "Unsupported browser" warning page of Nextcloud. The `redirect_url` parameter in the URL was not properly validated, allowing an attacker to inject an arbitrary URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Unvalidated input: The application fails to properly validate the `redirect_url` parameter in the "Unsupported browser" warning page.
- Open redirect: The lack of input validation allows the application to redirect the user to a URL specified by the attacker.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can craft a malicious URL that, when visited by a user of a vulnerable Nextcloud instance, redirects the user to an attacker-controlled website.
- This can be used for phishing attacks where users are redirected to a fake login page to steal credentials, or to other malicious websites.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based (AV:N)
- The attacker crafts a URL containing the `redirect_url` parameter with the attacker controlled website address.
- The victim is lured into clicking on this malicious URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL.
- The attacker needs a way to trick the victim into visiting the malicious URL (e.g., through phishing or social engineering).
- The attacker does not need special privileges on the Nextcloud instance itself (PR:L).

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability is classified as moderate severity (CVSS score: 4.1).
- The vulnerability is fixed in Nextcloud Server versions 26.0.2 and later
- The vulnerability has been assigned CWE-601: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect').
-  User interaction is required (UI:R) for the attack to be successful (the user must click on the malicious link).
- The scope is changed (S:C) because the vulnerability in the Nextcloud application can potentially impact other resources beyond its scope.
