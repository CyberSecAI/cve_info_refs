Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-35057

**Root Cause:** Integer overflow during memory allocation for `value` elements within the GTKWave LXT2 parser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Integer Overflow:** The size of the buffer allocated for `lt->value[i]` is calculated as `lt->len[i] + 1`, where `lt->len[i]` is derived from the difference between `msb` and `lsb` values in the LXT2 file. By crafting specific `msb` and `lsb` values, an attacker can cause `lt->len[i]` to become a large value (e.g., `0xffffffff`), which results in an integer overflow during the size calculation. This leads to allocation of very small memory region instead of expected large region.
*   **Heap-Based Buffer Overflow:** Subsequently, when GTKWave attempts to write data into `lt->value[i]` using functions like `memset`, `memmove`, or `memcpy`, it writes beyond the bounds of the allocated buffer, causing a heap-based buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Memory Corruption:** The heap-based buffer overflow can overwrite adjacent heap memory, leading to memory corruption.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Due to the multi-threaded nature of GTKWave, the memory corruption can be exploited by an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious LXT2 File:** The vulnerability is triggered by opening a specially crafted LXT2 file. This file must contain specific values for `msb` and `lsb` within its `facgeometry` structure, leading to integer overflow during memory allocation for value array.
*   **User Interaction:** The victim needs to open the malicious LXT2 file using GTKWave, either through the GUI or command-line tools. The mime-type association of GTKWave may lead to exploitation upon opening the file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Crafting Malicious LXT2 File:** The attacker must be able to create a malicious LXT2 file with the specific `msb` and `lsb` values that trigger the integer overflow.
*   **Distribution of Malicious File:** The attacker must be able to deliver the malicious LXT2 file to the victim. This could be through email, file sharing, or other means.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability exists in the `lxt2_rd_init` and `lxt2_rd_iter_radix` functions within `lxt2_read.c`.
*   The vulnerability affects GTKWave 3.3.115.
*   The vulnerability is triggered during the parsing of the `facgeometry` structure in LXT2 files.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in GTKWave version 3.3.118.
*   The provided crash information shows that the overflow occurs at `src/helpers/lxt2_read.c:214`.
