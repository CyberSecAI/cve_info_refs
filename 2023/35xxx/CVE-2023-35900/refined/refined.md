- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to the disclosure of server version information.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Exposure of server version information. This information can be used to identify software vulnerabilities at the operating system level.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially use the disclosed server version information to determine software vulnerabilities and plan further attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** The specific attack vector is not described, but it involves accessing information from the server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be in a position to access the server and obtain the version information.
