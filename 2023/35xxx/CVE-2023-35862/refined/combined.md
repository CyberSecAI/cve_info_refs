# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

| Environment  * libcoap version: v4.3.1-162-g6f79db0 * Build System: Make * Operating System: Linux * Operating System Version: Debian GNU/Linux 11 (bullseye) * Hosted Environment: None  Problem Description There is a global-buffer-overflow bug in the `coap_parse_oscore_conf_mem` function in `src/coap_oscore.c`. Expected Behavior No crash. Actual Behavior Crash when enhanced with ASan. Steps to reproduce  1. Build `libcoap` with ASan  ``` CC=clang CFLAGS="-g -fsanitize=address" ./autogen.sh CC=clang CFLAGS="-g -fsanitize=address" ./configure --disable-doxygen --disable-manpages --enable-tests --disable-documentation --enable-examples --enable-shared CC=clang CFLAGS="-g -fsanitize=address" make -j ```  2. Compile `overflow.c` (as shown follows)  ``` clang overflow.c -I/root/libcoap/include -I/root/libcoap /root/libcoap/.libs/libcoap-3-gnutls.a  /usr/local/lib/libgnutls.so -g -fsanitize=address -o overflow  ```  3. Run `overflow` and detect ASan error  ``` ==869262==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: global-buffer-overflow on address 0x5567c1231cea at pc 0x5567c1079006 bp 0x7ffcdaa591c0 sp 0x7ffcdaa58970 READ of size 12 at 0x5567c1231cea thread T0     #0 0x5567c1079005 in MemcmpInterceptorCommon(void*, int (*)(void const*, void const*, unsigned long), void const*, void const*, unsigned long) (/root/libcoap/overflow+0x57005) (BuildId: 54eb8810f12f7eb05271c5e5354411ec106ffe25)     #1 0x5567c10794f9 in memcmp (/root/libcoap/overflow+0x574f9) (BuildId: 54eb8810f12f7eb05271c5e5354411ec106ffe25)     #2 0x5567c1128e03 in coap_parse_oscore_conf_mem /root/libcoap/src/coap_oscore.c:1849:11     #3 0x5567c112849d in coap_new_oscore_conf /root/libcoap/src/coap_oscore.c:2020:37     #4 0x5567c111ca1f in main /root/libcoap/overflow.c:24:17     #5 0x7fb67e995d09 in __libc_start_main csu/../csu/libc-start.c:308:16     #6 0x5567c105da29 in _start (/root/libcoap/overflow+0x3ba29) (BuildId: 54eb8810f12f7eb05271c5e5354411ec106ffe25)  0x5567c1231cea is located 54 bytes to the left of global variable '.str.74' defined in '/root/libcoap/src/coap_oscore.c:1790' (0x5567c1231d20) of size 14   '.str.74' is ascii string 'replay_window' 0x5567c1231cea is located 22 bytes to the left of global variable '.str.73' defined in '/root/libcoap/src/coap_oscore.c:1788' (0x5567c1231d00) of size 11   '.str.73' is ascii string 'id_context' 0x5567c1231cea is located 0 bytes to the right of global variable '.str.72' defined in '/root/libcoap/src/coap_oscore.c:1787' (0x5567c1231ce0) of size 10   '.str.72' is ascii string 'sender_id' SUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: global-buffer-overflow (/root/libcoap/overflow+0x57005) (BuildId: 54eb8810f12f7eb05271c5e5354411ec106ffe25) in MemcmpInterceptorCommon(void*, int (*)(void const*, void const*, unsigned long), void const*, void const*, unsigned long) Shadow bytes around the buggy address:   0x0aad7823e340: 00 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 00 00 00 00 04 f9 f9 f9   0x0aad7823e350: f9 f9 f9 f9 00 00 00 00 00 00 03 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9   0x0aad7823e360: 05 f9 f9 f9 06 f9 f9 f9 00 00 00 00 00 00 06 f9   0x0aad7823e370: f9 f9 f9 f9 06 f9 f9 f9 04 f9 f9 f9 00 f9 f9 f9   0x0aad7823e380: 05 f9 f9 f9 05 f9 f9 f9 00 04 f9 f9 00 00 07 f9 =>0x0aad7823e390: f9 f9 f9 f9 00 06 f9 f9 00 04 f9 f9 00[02]f9 f9   0x0aad7823e3a0: 00 03 f9 f9 00 06 f9 f9 00 01 f9 f9 00 01 f9 f9   0x0aad7823e3b0: 00 01 f9 f9 00 06 f9 f9 00 04 f9 f9 00 00 01 f9   0x0aad7823e3c0: f9 f9 f9 f9 00 00 04 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 00 00 02 f9   0x0aad7823e3d0: f9 f9 f9 f9 00 00 02 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 00 00 04 f9   0x0aad7823e3e0: f9 f9 f9 f9 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 Shadow byte legend (one shadow byte represents 8 application bytes):   Addressable:           00   Partially addressable: 01 02 03 04 05 06 07    Heap left redzone:       fa   Freed heap region:       fd   Stack left redzone:      f1   Stack mid redzone:       f2   Stack right redzone:     f3   Stack after return:      f5   Stack use after scope:   f8   Global redzone:          f9   Global init order:       f6   Poisoned by user:        f7   Container overflow:      fc   Array cookie:            ac   Intra object redzone:    bb   ASan internal:           fe   Left alloca redzone:     ca   Right alloca redzone:    cb ==869262==ABORTING  ``` Code to reproduce this issue ``` // overflow.c #include "coap3/coap_internal.h" #include "oscore/oscore.h" #include "oscore/oscore_context.h" #include <stdio.h> #include <stdlib.h> #include <string.h>  int main() {  static const char conf_data[] =     "master_secret,hex,\"0102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f10\"\n"     "master_salt,hex,\"9e7ca92223786340\"\n"     "sender_id,hex,\"\"\n"     "recipient_id,hex,\"01\"\n";   const coap_str_const_t conf = { sizeof(conf_data)-1,                                   (const uint8_t *)conf_data };   coap_context_t ctx[1];   coap_oscore_conf_t *oscore_conf;   cose_encrypt0_t cose[1];   uint8_t nonce_buffer[13];   coap_bin_const_t nonce = { 13, nonce_buffer };    memset(&ctx, 0, sizeof(ctx));   oscore_conf = coap_new_oscore_conf(conf, NULL, NULL, 0);    oscore_free_contexts(ctx);   return 0; } ``` Debug Logs ``` (gdb) b coap_oscore.c:1849 Breakpoint 1 at 0x106d39: file src/coap_oscore.c, line 1849.

| It is appreciated that you are checking the libcoap code for potential issues and giving detail to be able to reproduce the issue. This has been fixed in [#1118](https://github.com/obgm/libcoap/pull/1118) which is ready for further testing.  Note that you need to add `coap_context_oscore_server(ctx, oscore_conf);` before `oscore_free_contexts(ctx);` to your overflow.c file to prevent memory leak errors being reported. |

| [CVE-2023-35862](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-84qc-gm86-22q4 "CVE-2023-35862") claims this makes 4.3.1 vulnerable, but I think I'm right in saying oscore code wasn't even present in 4.3.1? |

| [@risicle](https://github.com/risicle) You are correct. The OSCORE code was added in sometime after 4.3.1 was released, and this issue is fixed in [#1118](https://github.com/obgm/libcoap/pull/1118) which is included in 4.3.2rc1 and later.. |
