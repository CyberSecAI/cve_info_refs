{
  "CVE-2023-35885": {
    "description": "The vulnerability stems from the fact that the file manager in CloudPanel 2 does not perform session authentication. This means that an attacker can simply insert the encrypted value of the *clp-fm* cookie with the default secret key to gain access to the file manager.",
    "root_cause": "The file manager in CloudPanel does not enforce session authentication, and it relies on an encrypted cookie for authentication.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Broken Access Control",
      "Insecure Deserialization",
       "Default Credentials"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the file manager, upload malicious files, and achieve privilege escalation.",
    "attack_vector": "By injecting a crafted, encrypted `clp-fm` cookie with the default secret key, an attacker can bypass authentication and gain access to the file manager. Further exploitation can be achieved by uploading a webshell and escalating privileges.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests with a crafted `clp-fm` cookie and the target server must be running a vulnerable version of CloudPanel. No previous access is necessary."
