            "Details": {
                "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by insufficient input validation when setting the second position for world editing operations, specifically by using the 'Infinity' keyword.",

                 "Impact": "An attacker can cause a denial-of-service by exhausting server resources. This could lead to server crashes and disrupt service availability.",
                "Attack vectors": "An authenticated user with the ability to use the WorldEdit plugin can trigger the vulnerability using the chat interface by setting positions with the `//pos1` and `//pos2` commands, with the latter using the 'Infinity' keyword.",
