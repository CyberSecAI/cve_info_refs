FastAsyncWorldEdit (FAWE) is designed for efficient world editing. This vulnerability enables the attacker to select a region with the `Infinity` keyword (case-sensitive!) and executes any operation. This has a possibility of bringing the performing server down. This issue has been fixed in version 2.6.3.
