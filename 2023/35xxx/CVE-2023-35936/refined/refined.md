Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-35936:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper handling of file paths when extracting media from URIs or when generating PDF output. Specifically, pandoc did not properly sanitize percent-encoded characters in the file paths of extracted media. It extracted the extension from the URI after resolving the percent-encoding instead of before. This could allow an attacker to write files outside the designated extraction directory, bypassing the intended security measures.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Arbitrary File Write:** The core weakness is the ability to write files to arbitrary locations on the system due to insufficient path sanitization.
- **Path Traversal:** By embedding percent-encoded path traversal sequences (e.g., `%2f%2e%2e%2f`) into the image URI, attackers can bypass directory confinement restrictions.
- **Improper Extension Handling:**  Pandoc extracted the file extension after resolving percent encoding leading to the path traversal.
- **Incomplete Path Checking:** Similar issues existed in the code for checking if the path is below the working directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Creation/Overwrite:** Attackers can create new files or overwrite existing ones on the system.
- **Potential for Code Execution:** Depending on the target directory, the attacker could potentially achieve remote code execution (RCE) by writing malicious scripts or configuration files.
- **System Compromise:** Successful exploitation could lead to a compromised system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted Image Elements in Input:** The attack vector involves using specially crafted image elements within input provided to pandoc.
- **Data URI Scheme:** Attackers can exploit the `data://` URI scheme to inject malicious payloads into the image element.
- **`--extract-media` Option:** The vulnerability is triggered when using the `--extract-media` option or when outputting to PDF format, which will cause media extraction.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to supply input to pandoc:** Attackers must have the ability to provide untrusted user input to the pandoc program, which can be controlled to contain malicious image elements.
- **Pandoc used with `--extract-media` or PDF output:** The pandoc command has to be run with the `--extract-media` option or produce PDF output
- **Low Privileges:** The attacker requires only low privileges on the system where pandoc is executed.
- **User Interaction:** User interaction is required as the user has to run the pandoc command with the malicious input

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered when processing files with crafted image elements, particularly using the `data:` URI scheme.
*   The vulnerability affects pandoc versions 1.13 to 3.1.3
*   The vulnerability was patched in version 3.1.4
*   The `--sandbox` option does not prevent the exploitation.
*  The original fix was found to be incomplete as percent encoded `%` characters (as `%25`) could still be used to trigger the vulnerability.
