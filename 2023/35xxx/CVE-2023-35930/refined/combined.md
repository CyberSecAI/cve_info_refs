# LookupResources may return partial results in v1.22.0

Low

[ecordell](/ecordell)
published
GHSA-m54h-5x5f-5m6r
Jun 26, 2023

## Package

gomod

github.com/authzed/spicedb
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

1.22.0

## Patched versions

1.22.1, 1.22.2

## Description

### Impact

Any user making a negative authorization decision based on the results of a LookupResources request with 1.22.0 is affected.

For example, using `LookupResources` to find a list of resources to allow access to be okay: some subjects that should have access to a resource may not. But if using `LookupResources` to find a list of banned resources instead, then some users that shouldn't have access may.

Generally, `LookupResources` is not and should not be used to gate access in this way - that's what the `Check` API is for. Additionally, version 1.22.0 has included a warning about this bug since its initial release.

### Workarounds

Avoid using `LookupResources` for negative authorization decisions if using `1.22.0`.

### Patches

The only affected release is [v1.22.0](https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/releases/tag/v1.22.0), and it is patched in [v1.22.2](https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/releases/tag/v1.22.2) (there is no v1.22.1 release, though there is a git tag).

### References

* [#1397](https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/pull/1397)

### CVE ID

The previous approach of having the limit tracker control the context was causing parallelized branches of the Reachable Resources to be canceled early; we were ignoring this error (incorrectly) and thus, reachable resources could return partial results.

Instead, we now manually and explicitly detach the context and cancel it explicitly when no further dispatching is needed.")`

This changes the datastore query to no longer have a limit, and instead produce a series of chunks for parallelized processing using the same parallelization code as the entrypoint cursor parallelization system.

This is done in service of performance: a single database query is faster than making multiple roundtrips.

This change also removes the limits on dispatching reachable resources and lookup resources in favor of grabbing as many results as possible and canceling dispatch once the overall limit has been reached. While this results in slightly more work being done than is necessary, it is far more performant from the caller's perspective (especially for no-limit calls), because there is no need to re-enter the reachable resources dispatch tree.

As per the above change around limits, this change also further adjusts how context cancelation functions and adds a slew of tests to cover these new cases")`
