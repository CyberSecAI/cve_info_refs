Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-35930:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how context was handled around limits in the `LookupResources` function, specifically related to parallelized branches of `ReachableResources`.
- The previous approach of having the limit tracker control the context caused parallelized branches to be canceled prematurely, which led to partial results. This was due to ignoring the cancellation error.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Partial results from `LookupResources`:**  The `LookupResources` API in version 1.22.0 could return incomplete results due to incorrect context handling, which caused early cancellation of parallel processing branches.
- This vulnerability is particularly problematic when `LookupResources` is used for negative authorization decisions, leading to potential bypasses in access control.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Incorrect authorization decisions:** If `LookupResources` was used to determine resources that a user *should not* have access to, the partial results could cause some users to incorrectly gain access to those resources. Conversely, if used to determine allowed resources, some valid permissions might be missed.
- **Bypass of access control:** The vulnerability could enable users to bypass intended access controls, as the function wouldn't identify all relevant resources to block access to.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by calling the `LookupResources` API. This is an internal API call, so attackers need to be able to trigger this call through any application functionality.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to trigger a `LookupResources` query. The attacker does not need to be on the same machine, but needs to be able to use the API to call the `LookupResources` function.

**Additional details:**
- The issue was present only in v1.22.0 of `github.com/authzed/spicedb`.
- The vulnerability was addressed in v1.22.2 (there was no v1.22.1 release).
- The fix involved explicitly detaching and canceling the context when dispatching is no longer needed, as well as parallelizing the chunked dispatches in reachable resources.
- The pull request #1397, which fixed the issue, included changes to `internal/graph/context.go`, `internal/graph/lookupresources.go`, and `internal/graph/reachableresources.go`.
