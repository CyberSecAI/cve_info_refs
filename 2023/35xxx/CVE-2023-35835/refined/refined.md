{
  "CVE-2023-35835": {
    "Root cause": "The SolaX Pocket WiFi v3 device maintains a permanent open WiFi access point without any network authentication.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Lack of network authentication for the permanent WiFi access point.",
      "Exposes a web-based configuration utility and an unauthenticated ModBus protocol interface."
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can send unauthenticated ModBus messages to the inverter, potentially changing its configuration and causing disruption.  It is anticipated that this access could be exploited to cause physical damage to the inverter and potentially other connected components.",
    "Attack vectors": "Proximity to the device within the range of the open WiFi access point.",
    "Required capabilities": "Ability to connect to the open WiFi access point."
  }
