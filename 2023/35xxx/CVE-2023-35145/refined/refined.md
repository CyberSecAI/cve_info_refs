Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2023-35145:

**CVE-2023-35145**

*   **Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*   **Affected Plugin:** Sonargraph Integration Plugin
*   **Affected Versions:** 5.0.1 and earlier
*   **Root Cause:** The Sonargraph Integration Plugin does not correctly escape the file path and project name for the Log file field form validation. This allows an attacker to inject malicious script into these fields.
*   **Weakness:** Improper output sanitization/encoding. Specifically, the plugin fails to properly sanitize user-controlled input when rendering the Log file field form validation.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser when they view the page containing the injected script. This can lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities within the Jenkins environment.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker injects malicious script by manipulating the file path and the project name in the Log file field.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to have Item/Configure permission to be able to modify the affected fields.
*  **Additional Notes:** This vulnerability is a result of an incomplete fix for a previous vulnerability (SECURITY-1775). There is no fix available as of the publication of this advisory.
