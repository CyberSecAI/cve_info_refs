Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-35162:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of the `xcontinue` parameter in the `previewactions.vm` template. This allowed users to inject arbitrary JavaScript code via a crafted URL.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (RXSS) vulnerability is present due to the unsanitized user-controlled input in the `xcontinue` parameter. This parameter was directly used in the template without proper encoding or validation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This can lead to:
*   Performing actions within the application on behalf of the user.
*   Viewing information that the user is able to view.
*   Modifying information that the user is able to modify.
*   Full compromise of the user's session.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based. An attacker crafts a malicious URL that includes a JavaScript payload in the `xcontinue` parameter. This URL is then sent to a victim, typically through social engineering or other means.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and have a victim click on it. No special privileges or positions are required. The attacker needs to induce a user to visit the crafted URL.
