Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-35844:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization in the `imageId` parameter of the `/api/v1/slack/image/:imageId` endpoint and `fileId` parameter of the `/api/v1/projects/csv/:fileId` endpoint.
- The application constructs file paths by directly appending the provided `imageId` or `fileId` parameter to `/tmp`, without proper validation or sanitization of path traversal sequences.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Path Traversal:** The primary weakness is a path traversal vulnerability, which allows an attacker to navigate outside the intended `/tmp` directory using sequences like `../` in the `imageId` or `fileId` parameters.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input (`imageId` and `fileId`), allowing malicious input to manipulate file paths.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary File Read:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server, leading to potential information disclosure. This could include sensitive files like configuration files, database credentials, or system files.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users.

**Attack vectors:**

- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious HTTP GET request to the `/api/v1/slack/image/:imageId` or `/api/v1/projects/csv/:fileId` endpoint.
- **Malicious Input:** The attacker inserts path traversal sequences (e.g., `..%2F`) within the `imageId` or `fileId` parameter to navigate to arbitrary files.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application.
- **Knowledge of Endpoint:** The attacker must be aware of the vulnerable `/api/v1/slack/image/:imageId` or `/api/v1/projects/csv/:fileId` endpoint.
- **Ability to Craft HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP GET requests with the malicious `imageId` or `fileId` parameter.

**Additional notes:**

- The vulnerability was fixed in version 0.510.3 by sanitizing the `imageId` and `fileId` parameters. This involved removing the `..` sequence from the input strings, preventing path traversal.
- The fix also introduced checks to ensure that the `imageId` starts with `slack-image` and ends with `.png`, and that `fileId` starts with `csv-` and ends with `.csv` providing an additional layer of security.
- The advisory from dw1.io provides a clear explanation of the vulnerability, a proof-of-concept `curl` command, and details about the timeline of the fix.
