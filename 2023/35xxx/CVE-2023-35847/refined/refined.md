The provided content is related to a commit that fixes a bug in MSS (Maximum Segment Size) calculation within the `picotcp` library. It does not describe a vulnerability that is related to CVE-2023-35847.

The commit message says `TCP: Fixed MSS size calculation. Set MSS lower bound.`

The code changes show that the MSS calculation logic was modified to ensure a minimum MSS value is always used.
Before the fix, if `pico_socket_get_mss` returned a value such that after subtracting TCP header size the result would be less than `PICO_TCP_MIN_MSS` the value used for `mss` would be less than this minimum. The fix ensures the mss will be set to `PICO_TCP_MIN_MSS` if it's calculated value is lower than that.

The following files were changed:
`modules/pico_tcp.c`
`modules/pico_tcp.h`

The relevant changes were made in `pico_tcp.c` in three locations: within `pico_tcp_open`, `pico_tcp_initconn` and `tcp_syn` functions, where `mss` is calculated.
In all three cases, the following change was made:
```c
 if (mtu > PICO_SIZE_TCPHDR + PICO_TCP_MIN_MSS)
   ts->mss = (uint16_t)(mtu - PICO_SIZE_TCPHDR);
 else
   ts->mss = PICO_TCP_MIN_MSS;
```
In `pico_tcp.h`, the definition of `PICO_TCP_MIN_MSS` was also changed to be equal to `64 - PICO_SIZE_TCPHDR`.

This commit fixes a bug in MSS calculation by setting a minimum MSS size, it does not introduce or fix a security vulnerability.
