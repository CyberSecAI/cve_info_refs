Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-35927

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient access control for system address books in Nextcloud when trusted servers are configured. Specifically, when two Nextcloud servers are set up as trusted servers, a malicious server could manipulate or delete vCards within the system address book of the other, due to missing read-only restrictions for remote servers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-284: Improper Access Control**: The primary weakness is the lack of proper access controls on system address books. The system incorrectly allows a trusted server to modify/delete data that should be restricted to local administrative actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Manipulation/Loss**: A malicious trusted server can modify or delete contact information (vCards) in the system address book of the vulnerable server.
- **Integrity Compromise**: This can lead to incorrect or missing information displayed in user searches and avatar menus.
- **Availability Impact**: The attack can reduce availability of accurate contact data, impacting user experience.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based**: The attack is conducted over the network, exploiting the trust relationship between configured Nextcloud servers.
- **Trusted Server Exploitation**:  The attacker needs to control a server that is configured as a "trusted server" by a vulnerable Nextcloud instance.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a Nextcloud instance that can be configured as a trusted server by a target Nextcloud instance.
- The attacker's server needs to have successfully exchanged share secrets with the victim server.
- Attacker needs to be a low-privileged user (on the malicious server), since the vulnerability does not require elevated privileges on the malicious trusted server itself.
- The user interaction is required by setting up the trusted server relationship.
