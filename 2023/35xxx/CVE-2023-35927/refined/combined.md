### @ChristophWurst **[ChristophWurst](/ChristophWurst)** commented [May 15, 2023](#issue-1709592715) • edited Loading

Mark the SAB read-only for [#19575](https://github.com/nextcloud/server/issues/19575) / [#37797](https://github.com/nextcloud/server/issues/37797) and [nextcloud/contacts#3383](https://github.com/nextcloud/contacts/issues/3383)

## Summary

Sets appropriate ACLs for the system address book. Only the dav backend writes to it. This allows clients to hide actions that are forbidden.

## TODO

* Adjust ACLs

## Description

### Impact

When two server are registered as trusted servers for each other and successfully exchanged the share secrets, the malicious server could modify or delete VCards in the system addressbook on the origin server. This would impact the available and shown information in certain places, such as the user search and avatar menu. If a manipulated user modifies their own data in the personal settings the entry is fixed again.

### Patches

It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 25.0.7 or 26.0.2

It is recommended that the Nextcloud Enterprise Server is upgraded to 19.0.13.9, 20.0.14.14, 21.0.9.12, 22.2.10.12, 23.0.12.7, 24.0.12.2, 25.0.7 or 26.0.2

### Workarounds

* Remove all trusted servers in the "Administration" > "Sharing" settings `…/index.php/settings/admin/sharing`
* Afterwards trigger a recreation of the local system addressbook with the following `occ dav:sync-system-addressbook`, see the [Using the occ command](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/stable/admin_manual/configuration_server/occ_command.html) in our documentation.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
