    "root_cause": "The `apiPrefilter` option in the `@Entity` decorator, when set to a function, was not being applied correctly to API requests for a resource by its ID.",

      "Improper access control"

    "The issue was fixed in version 0.20.6 by ensuring that the `apiPrefilter` function is properly applied when fetching a resource by ID.",
