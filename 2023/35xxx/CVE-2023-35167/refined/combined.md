# When setting EntityOptions.apiPrefilter to a function, the filter is not applied to API requests for a resource by Id

Moderate

[yoni-rapoport](/yoni-rapoport)
published
GHSA-7hh3-3x64-v2g9
Jun 20, 2023

## Package

npm

remult
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

< 0.20.6

## Patched versions

0.20.6

## Description

### Impact

If you used the [apiPrefilter](https://remult.dev/docs/ref_entity.html#apiprefilter) option of the `@Entity` decorator, by setting it to a function that returns a filter that prevents unauthorized access to data, an attacker who knows the `id` of an entity instance she is not authorized to access, can gain read, update and delete access to it.

### Patches

The issue is fixed in version 0.20.6

### Workarounds

Set the `apiPrefilter` option to a filter object instead of a function.

### References

If you're using a minor version < 0.20 and require a patch, please create an issue.

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2023-35167

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
