Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-35001:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**
   - The provided content, particularly from `security.netapp.com` and `www.openwall.com`, directly references CVE-2023-35001 and describes a vulnerability in the Linux kernel's `nf_tables` component, aligning with the official CVE description.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The root cause is an out-of-bounds read/write within the `nft_byteorder_eval` function of the Linux kernel's `nf_tables` subsystem.
   - The vulnerability stems from how byteorder expressions with size 2 are evaluated, specifically when a union with 32-bit and 16-bit members is used. The 16-bit members are aligned to 32-bit, causing out-of-bounds array accesses.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Out-of-bounds read/write:** The primary weakness is the potential to read or write data outside of the intended memory region.
   - **Incorrect data alignment:** Using a union with 32 and 16-bit members, where the 16-bit members are aligned to 32-bit boundaries, leads to an incorrect calculation of memory addresses and out-of-bounds accesses.
   - The original code used a union which is not the correct method to read/write smaller data sizes from/to a register.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - Successful exploitation can result in:
     - **Disclosure of sensitive information**: An attacker might be able to read kernel memory that contains sensitive data.
     - **Addition or modification of data**:  An attacker might be able to write to arbitrary memory locations, leading to potential data corruption or code execution.
     - **Denial of Service (DoS)**: The out-of-bounds read/write could cause a kernel crash or system instability.
   - According to one source, it could be exploited for local privilege escalation.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - The vulnerability is triggered when evaluating byteorder expressions using the `nft_byteorder_eval` function within the Linux kernel's `nf_tables`.
   - This is primarily through the `nftables` subsystem of the netfilter framework.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **Local access:** The attacker needs local access to the system.
   - **`CAP_NET_ADMIN` capability:** The attacker needs the `CAP_NET_ADMIN` capability within any user or network namespace. This is a privileged capability that allows manipulation of network settings.
   - **Specific kernel version:** The vulnerability exists in the Linux kernel version 3.13-rc1 and later, specifically with commit 96518518cc41 ("netfilter: add nftables").

**Additional Details (from analyzed content, not in CVE description):**
   - The vulnerability was discovered by Tanguy DUBROCA (@SidewayRE) from @Synacktiv working with Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative and reported as ZDI-CAN-20721.
   - The issue was addressed by using simple s32 and s16 pointers, as confirmed by the patch.
   - A discussion of the fix can be found at  [https://lore.kernel.org/netfilter-devel/20230705121515.747251-1-cascardo@canonical.com/T/](https://lore.kernel.org/netfilter-devel/20230705121515.747251-1-cascardo%40canonical.com/T/).
   - NetApp indicates that some of their products that use a vulnerable kernel version will not be patched due to End-of-Availability (EOA), and instead customers are recommended to migrate to newer versions.
   - Further analysis of the code revealed an issue where 64 bit writes were also moving forward 4 bytes instead of 8, which resulted in an overwrite of part of the previous write. This was identified, but is not part of the original CVE.

In summary, CVE-2023-35001 is a vulnerability within the Linux kernel that allows a local attacker with `CAP_NET_ADMIN` privileges to perform out-of-bounds memory access, potentially leading to sensitive information disclosure, data modification or DoS.
