The provided content relates to CVE-2023-5793.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the lack of input sanitization of the `customblock_place` parameter in the `customblock.php` file. The application directly includes the unsanitized parameter value into a JavaScript string that is later executed in the browser.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- The application was vulnerable to reflected XSS.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the victim's browser. This can lead to:
- Session hijacking
- Stealing sensitive information
- Redirecting users to malicious websites
- Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `customblock_place` GET parameter in the URL.
- An attacker could craft a malicious URL with the payload in the `customblock_place` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with the malicious payload.
- The attacker needs to entice a user into visiting that malicious link.
