Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-5758:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of the `url` parameter used in the Firefox for iOS reader mode feature. Specifically, the application failed to properly handle "javascript:" URLs passed as a parameter when entering reader mode.  The application was using a local server at `http://localhost:6571` for reader mode functionality. When a crafted URL with a `javascript:` scheme was provided as the `url` parameter to this local server's `/reader-mode/page` endpoint, it would execute the script.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS vulnerability. By crafting a malicious URL containing JavaScript code, an attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript within the context of the `localhost` domain used by the reader mode.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the Firefox for iOS reader mode. This could lead to various malicious actions, including:
    *   Stealing cookies or session tokens
    *   Redirecting the user to malicious websites
    *   Modifying the content of the page displayed in reader mode
    *   Potentially escalating privileges if other vulnerabilities exist.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted URL:** The attack vector is a specially crafted URL with a `javascript:` scheme passed to the reader mode feature via the `url` parameter.
*   **User Interaction:** The user must click on the "Reader Mode" button after visiting a malicious link to trigger the XSS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **URL Crafting:** The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious URL with an embedded JavaScript payload using the `javascript:` scheme.
*   **User Lure:** The attacker needs a way to convince a user to open the malicious link using Firefox for iOS and then activate the reader mode. This could be achieved through various methods such as phishing emails, social engineering or malicious websites.

**Additional Details:**

*   The fix implemented in Firefox for iOS version 119 includes a change that rejects URLs without a host, thus preventing the execution of the `javascript:` scheme.
*   Prior to the fix, the application was only checking for `scheme == "http" && host == "localhost" && path == "/reader-mode/page"`, which was insufficient to prevent the XSS.
*   The initial fix attempted to sanitize the URL by escaping quotes, but this was found to be insufficient because JavaScript URLs do not require quotes.
*   The vulnerability was reported by an external researcher and was eligible for a security bounty.
* The bug report includes a link to the pull request that fixed the vulnerability : `https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/firefox-ios/pull/16345`

The vulnerability is specific to the Firefox for iOS application.
