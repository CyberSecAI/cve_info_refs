**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the `formforall` shortcode.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   These scripts will execute whenever a user accesses the injected page.
*   This could lead to various malicious activities, such as:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Redirection to malicious websites
    *   Defacement of the website
    *   Data theft

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The `formforall` shortcode is used as the attack vector.
*   Attackers inject malicious JavaScript code as shortcode attributes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   Authenticated users with contributor-level permissions or higher are required. This indicates that the attacker needs an account on the WordPress site with at least contributor access.
