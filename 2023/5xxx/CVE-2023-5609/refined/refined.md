- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize and escape a parameter before outputting it back in the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the page, potentially targeting high-privilege users like administrators, leading to actions performed under their context.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by a crafted URL containing a malicious script in the `rt` parameter. The `seraph_accel_at` parameter is also required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL and trick a logged-in user, such as an administrator, to open it.
