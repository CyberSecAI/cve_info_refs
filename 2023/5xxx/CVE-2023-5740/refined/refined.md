- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes within the 'messenger' shortcode of the Live Chat with Facebook Messenger plugin.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** Authenticated attackers with contributor-level or higher permissions can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. These scripts will execute whenever a user accesses the injected page, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The 'messenger' shortcode within the Live Chat with Facebook Messenger plugin is vulnerable. Attackers inject malicious scripts through shortcode attributes.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attackers need to be authenticated users with contributor-level or higher permissions on the WordPress site.
