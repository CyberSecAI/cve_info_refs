## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Login screen manager <= 3.5.2 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings, which could allow high-privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

Put the following payload in the "Hover Title" settings of the plugin: <script>alert(/XSS/)</script>
The XSS will be triggered on the login page

### Affects Plugins
