  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin does not have authorization and CSRF checks, and it fails to sanitize user input before using it in a SQL query.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability due to lack of authorization and CSRF checks and improper input sanitization.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration (e.g., user passwords), modification, or deletion. In the provided Proof of Concept, the attacker is able to retrieve user passwords.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` without authentication.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker does not need any prior authentication or special privileges. The attacker only needs to be able to send a POST request to the vulnerable endpoint."
