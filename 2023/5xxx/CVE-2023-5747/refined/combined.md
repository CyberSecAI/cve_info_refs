Camera Vulnerability Report (CVE-2023-5747)

◼  OVERVIEW

-  Bashis,  a  Security  Researcher  at  IPVM  discovered  a  vulnerability  in  the  Hanwha  SolidEDGE

camera and reported it to the Hanwha S-CERT on September 7th, 2023.

-

The vulnerability when upgrading the WAVE server in Hanwha SolidEDGE PNV-A6081R-E series

cameras.    It is possible to run arbitrary commands due to a lack of integrity checks of the

uploaded software.

◼  AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND FIRMWARE/SOFTWARE

-

◼  RISK ANALYSIS

Review Opinion

Severity

When installing or updating the WAVE server software running on the Hanwha

SolidEDGE camera, the integrity of the update archive was not validated. The risk

arises if the WAVE software archive is modified and obtained from an unauthorized

source.    This modified software could then inject malicious commands to run

unauthorized software or tasks.    It is important to note that there have not been

any reported cases of this occurring outside of IPVM’s testing.

Note that these risks are mitigated when downloading firmware and software

directly from the official firmware distribution from Hanwha websites.

In addition, uploading any software file to a SolidEDGE camera, whether

official or modified requires that the user is authenticated to the camera.

A malicious user who does not have valid credentials to log in to the camera

will not be able to install malicious software to the camera.

◼  Solution and Required Action

-  Since  Hanwha  takes  cybersecurity  matters  seriously,  we  have  updated  the  SolidEDGE

camera firmware to check for a valid digital signature before installing or updating the

WAVE software to prevent forgery or alteration, which could include malicious command

injection.    Once the updated firmware version indicated above has been installed, all future

installations or updates performed via the web interface will check the integrity of the update

before installation, mitigating this vulnerability.    The digital signature has been added to WAVE

server software v.5.1.1.37647 and later.

-  Please update the affected models with the latest firmware and software as soon as possible.

It is recommended to use the Wisenet Device Manager tool to download & update device

firmware. Firmware can also be downloaded from Hanwha Vision websites.

-  Required actions to be performed:

1.

2.

Install camera firmware v.2.21.03 or later, released on 11/10/2023.

Install WAVE server software v.5.1.1.37647 or later, released on 11/10/2023.
