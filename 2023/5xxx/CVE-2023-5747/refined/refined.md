- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Lack of integrity checks when upgrading the WAVE server software on Hanwha SolidEDGE cameras. The camera does not validate the digital signature of the software update archive before installation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    -  Missing integrity check of software update archive.
    -  Allows execution of arbitrary commands by injecting malicious software.
-  **Impact of exploitation:**
    -  Execution of unauthorized software or tasks by injecting malicious commands.
    -  Compromise of the camera by installing malicious software.
-  **Attack vectors:**
    -  Uploading a modified WAVE software archive to the camera.
-  **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    -  The attacker needs valid credentials to log into the camera's web interface in order to upload the modified software.
    -  The attacker needs to modify the WAVE software archive from an unauthorized source.
