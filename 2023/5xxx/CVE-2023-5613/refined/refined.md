Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2023-5613:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the Super Testimonials plugin when handling user-supplied attributes within the `tpsscode` shortcode.
*   **Weaknesses:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user input, specifically the attributes passed to the `tpsscode` shortcode. It also does not adequately escape output, allowing for the injection of arbitrary web scripts.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into pages, which will execute in the browsers of users who visit those pages, leading to stored cross-site scripting (XSS).
*   **Attack Vectors:** The primary attack vector is through the `tpsscode` shortcode of the Super Testimonials plugin.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must have at least Contributor-level privileges or higher on the WordPress site.
    *   The attacker needs the ability to create or edit posts/pages where the vulnerable shortcode can be injected.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists due to a lack of proper sanitization of shortcode attributes and output escaping.
*   The vulnerable code is related to the `tpsscode` shortcode within the `tp-testimonials.php` file.
*   The vulnerability affects all versions of the Super Testimonials plugin up to and including 2.9.
*   The patch was introduced in version 3.0.

**Summary of Changes:**

The provided changeset for version 3.0 of the plugin shows that the shortcode rendering logic was modified to use `esc_attr()` on shortcode attributes and other values that get outputted in the HTML. This likely fixed the shortcode escaping issue, as indicated by the changelog entry.

The older `tp-testimonials.php` file (version 2.8) shows that it used direct variable interpolation in the shortcode output, which lead to the vulnerability.

**In summary,** the vulnerability is a stored XSS due to insufficient input validation and output escaping when handling shortcode attributes. An authenticated attacker with Contributor-level permissions or higher can inject arbitrary web scripts using the `tpsscode` shortcode, affecting all users who visit those pages.
