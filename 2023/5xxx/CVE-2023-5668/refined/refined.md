**Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes within the 'whatsapp' shortcode.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. These scripts will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page, potentially leading to:
    - Account hijacking
    - Data theft
    - Defacement of website
    - Redirection to malicious sites

**Attack vectors:**
    - The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting malicious code into the attributes of the 'whatsapp' shortcode.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Authenticated user with contributor-level or higher permissions.
    - Ability to insert shortcodes into page content.
