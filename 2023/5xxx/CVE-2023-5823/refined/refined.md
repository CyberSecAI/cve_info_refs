- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors**:  A malicious actor can craft a request that, when triggered by an authenticated user, performs an action on their behalf.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into triggering a malicious request. This doesn't require any specific access or prior knowledge other than the plugin's functionality and the lack of CSRF protection.
