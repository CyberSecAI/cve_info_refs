Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-5076:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping when handling the 'ziteboard' shortcode within the Ziteboard Online Whiteboard plugin for WordPress.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied attributes within the shortcode.
- Lack of output escaping when rendering the shortcode on a page. Specifically, the attributes `width`, `height`, `style`, `class`, and `src` are not properly escaped.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.
- When a user accesses a page containing the injected script, the malicious script will execute in their browser.
- This could lead to various malicious actions, including data theft, session hijacking, or redirection to malicious websites.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited through the `ziteboard` shortcode within the WordPress plugin.
- An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code within the shortcode attributes when creating or editing a post or page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with contributor-level access or higher. This level of access is required to create or edit pages and posts where the shortcode is utilized.
- No specific network position is required. The attack can be performed from anywhere with the required access to the WordPress site.

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerability was present in versions up to and including 2.9.9.
- The fix was introduced in version 3.0.0 of the plugin which includes sanitization and escaping of the vulnerable attributes.
- The vulnerability was fixed by applying `esc_attr()` function to the shortcode attributes, which makes the output safe against XSS attacks.
