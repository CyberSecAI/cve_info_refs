Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

*   The provided content directly relates to CVE-2023-5385, as the Wordfence article and the WordPress Trac changeset both reference this CVE ID. The vulnerability is described as a "Missing Authorization to Arbitrary Post Duplication".

**2. Root Cause of the Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a missing capability check in the `fnsf_copy_posts` function within the "Funnelforms Free" WordPress plugin. This function is intended to allow post duplication, but it lacked proper authorization controls.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authorization:** The `fnsf_copy_posts` function was accessible to authenticated users with subscriber-level permissions and above, due to the lack of a capability check. This allowed users who should not have had this privilege to duplicate arbitrary posts.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Post Duplication:** An attacker, even with low-level (subscriber) access, could duplicate any post on the WordPress site. This could potentially lead to content manipulation, unwanted data duplication, or other unintended impacts on the website's data.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is via a web request targeting the vulnerable `fnsf_copy_posts` function. 
*   The request can be sent via an authenticated user's browser.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated WordPress user, with at least subscriber-level privileges. This is a relatively low bar, as most WordPress sites allow user registration with at least subscriber access.
*   **No special skills are required beyond standard web request manipulation.**

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided Wordfence article contains a clear description of the vulnerability, impacted versions, and remediation.
*   The WordPress Trac changeset provides a patch diff that includes the fix which includes capability checks for the affected functions.
*   The vulnerability is classified as Medium severity (CVSS score 4.3)
*   The plugin versions <= 3.4 are affected.
*   The vulnerability was patched in 3.4.2 by adding a `current_user_can( 'edit_others_posts' )` check to the beginning of the `fnsf_copy_posts()` function.
