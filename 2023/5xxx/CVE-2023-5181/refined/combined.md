## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP Discord Invite < 2.5.2 - Admin+ Stored Cross Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

1. Go to the WP Discord Invite plugin settings
2. Enter the PoC `"><script>alert(1)</script>` for the various parameters
3. Save the changes and reload the page to see the XSS.
