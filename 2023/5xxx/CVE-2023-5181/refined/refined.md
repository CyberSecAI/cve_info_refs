- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress plugin "WP Discord Invite" fails to sanitize and escape user-supplied input in its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with high privileges, such as an administrator, can inject malicious scripts into the plugin's settings. These scripts will be executed in the browsers of other users who access the plugin's settings page, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities. The XSS can be triggered even when the `unfiltered_html` capability is disabled.
- **Attack vectors:** An authenticated user with administrator privileges can inject the malicious payload via the plugin's settings page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrative privileges in the WordPress site to access the plugin settings page.
