Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from Firefox not properly sanitizing cookie names, specifically allowing the inclusion of the DEL control character (0x7F) and other characters like semicolon (0x3B) and equals (0x3D), which are prohibited by the specification.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper input validation for cookie names. Firefox's `CookieCommons::CheckName()` function did not include 0x7F (DEL), 0x3B (semicolon), and 0x3D (equals) in its blacklist of illegal characters for cookie names.
- **Bypass of Cookie Parsing:** While the primary cookie parsing logic would typically prevent these characters from appearing in cookie names via HTTP headers or `document.cookie`, they could be introduced via extensions, dev tools, or the Cookie Store API.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Site Breakage:**  Cookies with invalid characters could break the functionality of websites. For example, it was specifically noted that it would break sites like instagram.com.
- **Unexpected Errors:**  The presence of these characters can lead to unexpected application logic errors on both the client and server side.
- **Potential for Subtle Errors:**  While not immediately obvious, the use of these characters could trigger subtle errors in server-side logic or other parts of the application that handle cookies.
- **Spoofing Attacks:**  In conjunction with other vulnerabilities, improperly sanitized cookies could be used in spoofing attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **`document.cookie` API:** An attacker with temporary script access to a site can set a cookie with invalid characters using the `document.cookie` API.
- **Web Extensions:** Malicious web extensions with the right permissions could use the direct "make a cookie" API to create cookies with invalid names.
- **Lower-Level APIs:**  Direct creation of cookies using lower-level APIs by browser extensions or developers through dev tools.
- **Cookie Storage Corruption:** Malicious modification of cookie storage where a misplaced semicolon can corrupt the data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Temporary Script Access:** The attacker needs to be able to inject or execute javascript on the target website to utilize the `document.cookie` API.
- **Web Extension installation:** The attacker must create and have the user install a malicious web extension with the necessary permissions
- **Developer Tools Access:**  The attacker might use developer tools to directly set cookies through low level APIs.
- **Potential Access to cookie storage:** The attacker needs a way to corrupt the cookie storage and potentially inject invalid characters
