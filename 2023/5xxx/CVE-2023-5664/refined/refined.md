Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-5664

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes within the 'ggpkg' shortcode of the Garden Gnome Package plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. These scripts execute whenever a user accesses a page containing the injected shortcode. This could lead to:
    - Session hijacking.
    - Defacement.
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites.
    - Other malicious actions within the context of the user's session.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through the `ggpkg` shortcode.
- Specifically, the `width`, `height`, and `start_node` attributes were not properly sanitized.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated WordPress user with at least "contributor" level privileges or higher.
- The attacker needs to be able to create or edit posts and pages in order to inject the malicious shortcode.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability exists within the `include/ggpackage.php` file, specifically in how the plugin processes shortcode attributes.
- Initially, the plugin used regex to validate width and height attributes, but this was not sufficient to prevent injection.
- The `start_node` attribute was also vulnerable to injection, as it was not sanitized.
- Patches were implemented in versions 2.2.7 and 2.2.9 to address the vulnerability.
    - Version 2.2.7 implemented less strict sanitization for width and height, which allowed more complex CSS.
    - Version 2.2.9 implemented stricter sanitization for start_node and properly escaped the width and height attributes.
- The vulnerable code snippet ` $html = "<div id='ggpkg_container" . $ID . "' style='width:" . esc_attr($width) . "; height:" . esc_attr($height) . "; position: relative;'>\n";` in `include/ggpackage.php` was modified to sanitize the width and height attributes using `esc_attr()`

**More Detail than CVE:**
- The provided content gives more context than the basic CVE description, outlining the specific files and code locations involved, as well as the evolution of the patches (2.2.7 less strict sanitization, 2.2.9 stricter sanitization and escaping). It also specifies the vulnerable parameters `width`, `height`, and `start_node`. It also details the necessary user roles for exploitation (contributor or higher).
