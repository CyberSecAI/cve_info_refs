{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The plugin's `neontext_box` shortcode did not sufficiently sanitize and escape user-supplied attributes, specifically the 'color' attribute.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient input sanitization",
      "Insufficient output escaping",
      "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An authenticated attacker with Contributor-level or higher permissions could inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. These scripts would execute whenever a user accesses the affected page, potentially leading to account compromise, data theft, or other malicious activity.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "By exploiting the `neontext_box` shortcode, attackers could inject malicious JavaScript within the plugin's attributes, like the 'color' attribute."
    ],
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have Contributor-level or higher permissions on the WordPress site to create or edit content containing the malicious shortcode."
  },
    "additional_notes": "The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.2 by applying `stripslashes()` to the shortcode attributes before rendering them to the page. The vulnerability was discovered by Dmitrii Ignatyev from CleanTalk Inc."
