Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-5134:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient access controls on the 'erforms_user_meta' shortcode within the Easy Registration Forms plugin. This shortcode allows retrieval of arbitrary user meta data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Shortcode Implementation:** The 'erforms\_user\_meta' shortcode lacks proper sanitization or validation of the requested user meta data. This allows an attacker to specify any user meta key and retrieve its associated value.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability results in the disclosure of potentially sensitive user metadata.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Information Access:** An attacker can gain access to sensitive user information such as private details, potentially including personal information, settings, or other data stored as user meta.
*  **Privilege Escalation (Potential):** While not explicitly stated, depending on the nature of the user meta data stored, this information could be leveraged for further attacks such as privilege escalation or targeted phishing.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Shortcode Injection:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by embedding the 'erforms\_user\_meta' shortcode in a page or post where they have sufficient permissions.
*   **Direct Access (Potentially):** The content mentions that the vulnerability is exploitable by authenticated users with subscriber level or higher permissions. If the shortcode is accessible through a public facing page, a subscriber-level account could potentially gain access to sensitive user meta information.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have a user account on the WordPress site with at least 'subscriber' level permissions.
*  **Knowledge of Shortcode:** The attacker needs to know about the existence and functionality of the vulnerable shortcode `erforms_user_meta`.
*  **Access to Page/Post editing:** The attacker needs to be able to add the shortcode in a page or post or where the shortcode is parsed.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability exists in Easy Registration Forms plugin versions up to and including 2.1.1.
*   There is no known patch available for this vulnerability as of the time of this report, and it's suggested to uninstall the affected software.
*   The Wordfence article provides a CVSS score of 4.3 (Medium).
*   The provided code snippet from `class-user.php` shows the implementation of `user_meta_for_shortcode` which is vulnerable:
```php
public function user_meta_for_shortcode($args){
	$meta_key = isset($args['key']) ? sanitize_text_field($args['key']) : '';
	if(empty($meta_key)){
		return '';
	}
	$user_id = isset($args['id']) ? sanitize_text_field($args['id']) : '';
	if(empty($user_id)){
		$user = wp_get_current_user();
		if(!empty($user->ID)){
			$user_id = $user->ID;
		}
	}
	if(empty($user_id))
		return '';
	
	$meta_value = get_user_meta($user_id,$meta_key,true);
	if(empty($meta_value)){
		return '';
	}
	if(is_array($meta_value)){
		return implode(',', $meta_value);
	}
	return $meta_value;
}
```
It lacks any checks to ensure that the meta data being accessed is not sensitive. It simply fetches and returns the meta data using `get_user_meta`
