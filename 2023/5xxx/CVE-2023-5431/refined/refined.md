Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-5431

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization and preparation of user-supplied input within the plugin's shortcode functionality. Specifically, the `type` attribute in the `[lr-slideshow]` shortcode is not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query. This allows for the injection of malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is an SQL injection flaw. The plugin constructs SQL queries by directly concatenating user-supplied input (`$Lrisg_type`) into the query string.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can exploit the SQL injection vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the WordPress database. This could include user credentials, configuration data, and other potentially confidential information.
- **Data Modification/Deletion:** An attacker could potentially modify or delete data within the database. This could have severe consequences on the integrity of the website.
- **Complete System Compromise:** In some situations, successful SQL injection attacks can even lead to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Shortcode Exploitation:** The vulnerability is exploited through the plugin's `[lr-slideshow]` shortcode. Attackers can inject malicious SQL code through the `type` attribute.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User (Subscriber+)** Attackers must have at least subscriber-level access to the WordPress site. This means they need a valid user account.
- **Ability to Post Content:** The attacker needs the capability to post content that can utilize shortcodes, either through a post, page or a custom post type with shortcode support.
- **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable parameter within the shortcode and how to construct a malicious SQL payload.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability exists in the `Lrisg_shortcode` function within the `left-right-image-slideshow-gallery.php` file.
- The vulnerable code is where the `$Lrisg_type` variable, obtained directly from the shortcode attribute, is concatenated directly into the SQL query without proper sanitization or use of prepared statements.
   ```php
   $sSql = "select Lrisg_path,Lrisg_link,Lrisg_target,Lrisg_title from ".WP_LRISG_TABLE." where 1=1";
   if($Lrisg_type <> ""){ $sSql = $sSql . " and Lrisg_type='".$Lrisg_type."'"; }
   ```

- The fix implemented in version 12.1 uses `$wpdb->prepare()` to sanitize the input
   ```php
    if($Lrisg_type <> ""){
        $sSql = $sSql . " and Lrisg_type = %s ";
        $sSql = $wpdb->prepare($sSql, $Lrisg_type);
    }
  ```

**Additional Notes:**
- The Wordfence article mentions that the vulnerability was discovered by István Márton of Wordfence.
- The plugin has been patched in version 12.1, which includes the proper use of `wpdb->prepare()` to mitigate the SQL injection risk.
