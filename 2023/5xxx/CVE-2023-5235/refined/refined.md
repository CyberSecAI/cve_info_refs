Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The plugin `Ovic Responsive WPBakery` does not properly restrict which options can be updated through its AJAX actions.
*   The plugin unserializes user input without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) / Insufficient Authorization:** Subscriber-level users can access and modify sensitive blog options (like 'users\_can\_register' and 'default\_role') via AJAX actions, which should be restricted to higher-privileged roles.
*   **Object Injection via Unsafe Deserialization:** The plugin unserializes user-controlled data, which can lead to object injection attacks if a malicious payload is provided.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker with a subscriber account can modify the `users_can_register` option to enable new user registrations and set the default role to `administrator`. This enables them to create a new administrator account, escalating their privileges to administrative level.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The unserialization vulnerability can be leveraged to achieve arbitrary code execution by injecting malicious objects (gadget chains) during unserialization.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **AJAX Requests:** Exploitation is performed by crafting malicious POST requests to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint, abusing the `ovic_vc_import_options` AJAX action.
*   **Malicious Payload:**  The attacker provides a base64 encoded serialized string as the `data` parameter in the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Subscriber Access:** The attacker needs to have at least a subscriber-level account on the WordPress site to exploit the privilege escalation vulnerability.
*   **Admin Access:**  To exploit the object deserialization vulnerability, the attacker needs to have admin-level access.

**Additional Details (Beyond CVE Description):**

*   The content provides a proof of concept (PoC) for both the privilege escalation and the object deserialization vulnerabilities, detailing the steps and the required code to trigger the vulnerabilities.
*   It clearly states the affected plugin version is `< 1.2.9`.
*   The content identifies the vulnerability types, CWE, CVSS score, and relevant OWASP top 10 category.
*   It also provides the name of the original researcher and submitter of the vulnerability.
