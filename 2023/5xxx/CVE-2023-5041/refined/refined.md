- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly sanitize query parameters to the stats REST endpoint before using them in a database query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Time-Based Blind SQL Injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can perform time-based blind SQL injection attacks on the database, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting malicious `start`, `link` parameters in a GET request to the `/wp-json/track-the-click/v1/stats` endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a logged-in user with an author role or higher. They also need a valid nonce.
