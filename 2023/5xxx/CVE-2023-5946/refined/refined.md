Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-5946:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the `current_group_id` parameter within the Digirisk WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize the `current_group_id` parameter before using it in the output, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will execute in the victim's browser when they visit a page containing the vulnerable parameter.
- This could allow the attacker to perform actions such as:
    - Stealing cookies and session tokens.
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites.
    - Modifying the content of the page.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the logged-in user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `current_group_id` GET parameter of the WordPress plugin, likely in the URL.
- An attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the malicious payload in the `current_group_id` parameter.
- The attacker then needs to trick a user into clicking on this link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and trick a user into clicking the malicious link.

**Additional details from provided content:**
- The vulnerable version of the plugin is 6.0.0.0.
- The vulnerability is patched in version 6.1.0.0.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Ala Arfaoui.
- The vulnerable code is located in `digirisk/trunk/modules/society/controller/group.controller.01.php`.
- The fix involved modifying the code to properly handle the `current_group_id` parameter.
