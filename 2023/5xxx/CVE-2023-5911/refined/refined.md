- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape user-supplied input in its settings, specifically within the "Background Color" field under "Hover Options" for custom cursors. This lack of sanitization allows malicious JavaScript code to be injected and stored in the database.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser when they access the affected settings page, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** An authenticated attacker with administrative privileges can inject malicious JavaScript code via the plugin's settings page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrative access to the WordPress site.
