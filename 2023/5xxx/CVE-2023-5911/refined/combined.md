## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP Custom Cursors <= 3.3 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

1. Add a new custom cursor.
2. Under "Hover Options" select "Snap" and for the "Background Color" add the payload: "><script>alert("xss")</script>
3. Save and see the XSS pop-up.
Before version v3.3, use the following steps:
1. Add a new custom cursor
2. Under "Hover Options" select "Shape" and for the "Background Color" add the payload: " style=animation-name:rotation onanimationstart=alert(/XSS/)//
3. Save and when you go through the process to edit the code, you will see the XSS pop-up
