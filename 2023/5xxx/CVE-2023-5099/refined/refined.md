Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-5099

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of the `src` attribute within the `csvsearch` shortcode. This allows an attacker to include and execute arbitrary local files via the `csvsearch` shortcode.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The plugin fails to sanitize the file path provided in the `src` attribute, allowing an attacker to include local files from the server.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The plugin does not validate if the provided file path is a valid CSV file or if it is a restricted file type, leading to arbitrary file inclusion.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious PHP file, the attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server. This allows full control over the website and server.
*   **Bypass Access Controls:** Allows access to sensitive files that are not intended to be accessible.
*   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Access to the server's file system could lead to the exposure of sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is triggered by using the `csvsearch` shortcode and specifying a local file path in the `src` attribute.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker must have at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site to create or edit posts and use the shortcode functionality.
*   **File System Access (Indirect):** The attacker needs to know a file path present on the server. This could be a PHP file containing malicious code, a configuration file, or any other type of file they wish to include. The attacker can potentially upload the malicious file beforehand using different plugins.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is present in versions of the "HTML filter and csv-file search" plugin up to and including version 2.7.
*   Version 2.8 of the plugin addresses this vulnerability by escaping attributes, which prevents arbitrary file inclusion.
*   The provided changelog in the plugin's readme.txt file states, "Major security fix. Attributes escaped. Cross scripting fix."
*   The fix introduces the `hk_escape_atts` function which sanitizes the src and other attributes.
