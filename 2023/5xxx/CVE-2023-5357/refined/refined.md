- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes within shortcodes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary web scripts can be injected into pages, which will execute whenever a user accesses the injected page. This allows an attacker to potentially steal cookies, redirect to malicious websites, or perform other client-side attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation occurs via shortcodes within the WordPress plugin "Instagram for WordPress". An attacker can inject malicious scripts through these shortcode attributes.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An authenticated attacker with contributor-level or higher permissions is required to inject malicious code into a page using shortcodes.
