Debian LTS Advisory DLA-3658-1                debian-lts@lists.debian.org
<https://www.debian.org/lts/security/>                      Markus Koschany
November 20, 2023                             <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : wordpress
Version        : 5.0.20+dfsg1-0+deb10u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2023-5561 CVE-2023-39999

Several security vulnerabilities have been discovered in Wordpress, a
popular content management framework, which may lead to exposure of sensitive
information to an unauthorized actor in WordPress or allowing unauthenticated
attackers to discern the email addresses of users who have published public
posts on an affected website via an Oracle style attack.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
5.0.20+dfsg1-0+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your wordpress packages.

For the detailed security status of wordpress please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/wordpress>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

WordPress does not properly restrict which user fields are searchable via the REST API.

# Email Leak Oracle Vulnerability Addressed in WordPressÂ 6.3.2

During a thorough analysis of WordPressâ€™ internals, we discovered a subtle bug that allowed unauthenticated attackers to discern the email addresses of users who have published public posts on an affectedÂ website.

If successfully exploited, attackers could gather email addresses, putting user privacy atÂ risk.

Upon identifying the vulnerability, we promptly alerted the WordPress team, who released version 6.3.2 to fix the issue. It is crucial for administrators to ensure their WordPress installations are fully updated to safeguard against thisÂ vulnerability.

WordPressâ€™ official advisory [can be foundÂ here](https://wordpress.org/news/2023/10/wordpress-6-3-2-maintenance-and-security-release/).

                 */
                $prepared_args = apply_filters( 'rest_user_query', $prepared_args, $request );
                $query = new WP_User_Query( $prepared_args );

```

The `/wpâ€‘json/wp/v2/users` REST API endpoint employed the `search` request parameter as an argument for the `WP_User_Query` constructor, enabling userâ€‘searchÂ capabilities.

```

		$search = '';
		if ( isset( $qv['search'] ) ) {
			$search = trim( $qv['search'] );
		}

		if ( $search ) {
			$leading_wild  = ( ltrim( $search, '*' ) != $search );
			$trailing_wild = ( rtrim( $search, '*' ) != $search );
			if ( $leading_wild && $trailing_wild ) {
				$wild = 'both';
			} elseif ( $leading_wild ) {
				$wild = 'leading';
			} elseif ( $trailing_wild ) {
				$wild = 'trailing';
			} else {
				$wild = false;
			}
			if ( $wild ) {
				$search = trim( $search, '*' );
			}

			$search_columns = array();
			if ( $qv['search_columns'] ) {
				$search_columns = array_intersect( $qv['search_columns'], array( 'ID', 'user_login', 'user_email', 'user_url', 'user_nicename', 'display_name' ) );
			}
			if ( ! $search_columns ) {
				if ( false !== strpos( $search, '@' ) ) {
					$search_columns = array( 'user_email' );
				} elseif ( is_numeric( $search ) ) {
					$search_columns = array( 'user_login', 'ID' );
				} elseif ( preg_match( '|^https?://|', $search ) && ! ( is_multisite() && wp_is_large_network( 'users' ) ) ) {
					$search_columns = array( 'user_url' );
				} else {
					$search_columns = array( 'user_login', 'user_url', 'user_email', 'user_nicename', 'display_name' );
				}
			}

```

However, during SQL query preparation, the `WP_User_Query::prepare_query()` defaulted to guessing the column to search based on the content of the `search` parameter. If explicit columns werenâ€™t specified in the `search_columns` query variable, attackers could leverage this to deduce a userâ€™s email address, character byÂ character.

To address this, the WordPress Security team actively listed which columns could be searched based on the current userâ€™sÂ capabilities.

### **Exploitation**

[Oracleâ€‘style attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_attack) work by iteratively probing a vulnerable system until it gives a signal that a little piece of the information probed is correct, which when done enough times can be built upon to leak sensitive information. In the current context, this means an attacker would have to send multiple pings to vulnerable WordPress sites in order to guess an email address character byÂ character.

A proof of concept will be made available on [the WPScan entry for this issue](https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/19380917-4c27-4095-abf1-eba6f913b441/) on November 3,Â 2023.

### **Timeline**

* 2023â€‘06â€‘12 â€“ Details of the vulnerability sent toÂ WordPress
* 2023â€‘10â€‘12 â€“ Patch released byÂ WordPress

## **Conclusion**

Like with any WordPress security updates, auto-updates have been activated to automatically fix this issue on sites that support it. We recommend that you check which version of WordPress your site is using, and if it hasnâ€™t been automatically updated, do so as soon as possible!

At WPScan, we work hard to make sure your websites are protected from these types of vulnerabilities. We recommend that you have a security plan for your site that includes malicious file scanning and backups. [Jetpack Security](https://jetpack.com/features/security/) is one great WordPress security option to ensure your site and visitors areÂ safe.

   This CVE correct? The other WP Core vulns are missing their CVE assignments and the description of the CVE is an XSS in an arbitrary plugin.

      Yes, this is the proper CVE. There was a glitch on our side when sending this to Mitre. Weâ€™ve since updated it, and it should eventually also update on Mitreâ€™s side. ðŸ™‚
