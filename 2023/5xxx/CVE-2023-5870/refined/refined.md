Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-5870:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an incorrect enforcement of access controls related to the `pg_signal_backend` role within PostgreSQL. Specifically, the documentation states that this role cannot signal a backend owned by a superuser. However, the code allows `pg_signal_backend` to signal background workers, including logical replication launcher, autovacuum workers and the autovacuum launcher, even when owned by a superuser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Access Control:** The vulnerability lies in the discrepancy between the documented restrictions for the `pg_signal_backend` role and its actual capabilities, allowing it to signal background processes that documentation says should be protected.
*   **Missing Superuser Backend check:** The system fails to properly verify if a process is owned by a superuser before allowing `pg_signal_backend` to signal it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Exploitation of this vulnerability could result in a denial of service, but only for the targeted background worker, especially if a non-core extension with a less resilient background worker is targeted.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL injection via a non-core extension:** An attacker needs to execute code through a non-core extension in order to signal and take down less-resilient background processes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Database User**: The attacker must be an authenticated database user.
*   **`pg_signal_backend` Role:** The attacker must have the `pg_signal_backend` role.
*   **Requires Non-Core Extension**:  Exploitation relies on the presence of a non-core extension that creates a less-resilient background worker.
*   **High privileges required**: The attacker must be a high privileged user to make use of the `pg_signal_backend` role.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects PostgreSQL versions 11 through 16.
*   The vulnerability is considered to be an "old" problem.
*  The CVE has a CVSS v3 base score of 2.2, indicating a low overall severity.
