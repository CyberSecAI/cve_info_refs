- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin stores sensitive LDAP logs in a CSV file after an administrator exports them, and this file is never removed, remaining publicly accessible.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Sensitive data exposure due to the publicly accessible log file.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthorized users can access sensitive LDAP logs, potentially exposing user credentials or other confidential information.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by accessing the log file via a known URL, `{{base_url}}/wp-content/ldap-authentication-report.csv`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to know the URL where the log file is stored. No authentication is required.
