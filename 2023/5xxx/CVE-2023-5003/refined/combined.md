## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Active Directory Integration < 4.1.10 - Unauthenticated Log Disclosure

### Description

The plugin stores sensitive LDAP logs in a buffer file when an administrator wants to export said logs. Unfortunately, this log file is never removed, and remains accessible to any users knowing the URL to do so.

### Proof of Concept

This requires the plugin's `Log Authentication Requests` setting to be set in LDAP/Active Directory Login for Intranet > Authentication Report.
Once some authentication issues were logged, and the administrator exported said logs, the resulting CSV file remains publicly accessible at the following address:
curl {{base\_url}}/wp-content/ldap-authentication-report.csv
