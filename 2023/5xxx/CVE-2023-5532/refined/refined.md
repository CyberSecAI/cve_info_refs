- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing or incorrect nonce validation on the `imgmap_save_area_title` function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) leading to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker can update the post title and inject malicious JavaScript.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a forged request and tricks a site administrator into performing an action, such as clicking a malicious link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request and trick an administrator into interacting with it (e.g., clicking a link). The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
