Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-5089:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of this vulnerability lies in the failure of certain WordPress security plugins to properly handle the `auth_redirect` function when called by the Gravity Forms plugin. Specifically, the plugins do not prevent redirection to the hidden login page when an unauthenticated user accesses a URL with the `gf_page` parameter set.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Protection Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is the bypass of the "hide login page" feature provided by security plugins. This allows unauthorized users to discover the custom login page URL.
- **Improper Input Handling:** The security plugins fail to correctly intercept and handle the `auth_redirect` function call when triggered by Gravity Forms.
- **Lack of Consistent Security:** The behavior of Gravity Forms, by default redirecting unauthenticated users to authenticate, is normal but conflicts with how the security plugins are expected to function, exposing the weakness.
- **Reliance on Obscurity:** The plugins rely on the principle of "security through obscurity" by hiding the login page, which is easily bypassed by this vulnerability, emphasizing the weakness of that approach.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Disclosure of Login Page:** The most immediate impact is the disclosure of the hidden login page URL, which was intended to be kept secret.
- **Increased Risk of Brute-Force Attacks:** By revealing the login page, the vulnerability enables attackers to directly target the login page with brute-force attacks, which the plugins were intended to prevent.
- **Potential for Account Takeover:** By discovering the login page URL, attackers are in a better position to attempt to guess valid credentials, potentially leading to a full account takeover.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** Attackers make a simple HTTP request to a WordPress site with a `gf_page` parameter. E.g. `https://target.com/?gf_page=randomstring`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No authentication required:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Knowledge of Gravity Forms Plugin:** The attacker must have knowledge that the target website is running the Gravity Forms plugin.
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires basic network access to send the crafted HTTP request to the target website.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is not in Gravity Forms itself but in how security plugins handle redirects when Gravity Forms triggers the `auth_redirect` function.
- The WordPress core team and WPScan do not consider the login page location to be sensitive information.
- The specific plugins tested were WPS Hide Login, Defender, iThemes Security, WP Hide & Security Enhancer, and Hide My WP Ghost. All were found to be vulnerable to this bypass.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Juan Pablo Gomez Postigo.
- This issue has been fixed in Defender version 4.1.0.
