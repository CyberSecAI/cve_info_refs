### Summary:
The provided content describes a vulnerability in the WP EXtra WordPress plugin, specifically a missing authorization check that allows low-privileged users to send arbitrary emails.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a missing capability check in the `register()` function of the WP EXtra plugin when handling requests to the `test-email` section. This lack of authorization allows any authenticated user, regardless of their assigned role or privileges, to access and utilize the email functionality.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing Authorization: The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper authorization checks when accessing the email sending functionality. This allows unauthorized users to trigger actions intended for administrators or more privileged roles.
- Arbitrary Email Sending: As a consequence of the missing authorization check, low-privileged authenticated users can send emails with arbitrary content to arbitrary recipients.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized Email Sending: Attackers can send arbitrary emails, potentially leading to spam campaigns, phishing attacks, or other malicious activities, originating from the affected website's server.
- Brand/Reputation Damage: The exploitation could damage the site's reputation, as emails are sent from the compromised server and domain.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network Access: The attack vector is network-based, meaning an attacker could exploit the vulnerability remotely, as long as they can log in to the affected WordPress site.
- Authenticated User: The attacker needs to be a valid user, even one with minimal privileges (e.g., subscriber).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Authenticated Access: The attacker needs to be able to log in to the target WordPress site.
- Low-Privilege User: The attacker can have a low-level user role, such as a subscriber, which is often the easiest account to acquire.

The vulnerability is present in versions of WP EXtra up to and including 6.2, and was patched in version 6.3.
