- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WassUp Real Time Analytics plugin does not properly sanitize IP addresses obtained from HTTP headers (specifically `X-Forwarded-For`). This allows unauthenticated users to inject malicious JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a logged-in administrator's browser session when the administrator views the plugin's SPY Visitors page. This could lead to account takeover, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted HTTP request with a malicious payload in the `X-Forwarded-For` header.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated and can send the malicious request from anywhere on the internet. The attacker needs to get a logged in administrator to visit the vulnerable page to trigger the XSS.
