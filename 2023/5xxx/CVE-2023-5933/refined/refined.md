Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-5933:

**Vulnerability Details**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper input sanitization of a user's full name field allows for HTML injection. Specifically, the sanitization logic does not properly handle HTML tags without closing brackets.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The `sanitize_name` function only removes complete HTML tags (e.g., `<tag>`), but it doesn't prevent tags without closing brackets (e.g., `<tag`).
    *   **Double Sanitization Bypass:** The user's full name is sanitized twice. The first sanitization doesn't fully address the issue, and the second, `simple_sanitize`, allows `<a>` and `<span>` tags with specific attributes. This combination allows the attacker to craft an `<a>` tag with attributes.
    *   **Abuse of Click Events:** The vulnerability leverages the presence of a `js-draft-toggle-button` class on elements, which triggers a PUT request when clicked within a Merge Request page. The attacker crafts a malicious `<a>` tag with this class, allowing them to make API PUT requests on behalf of the victim when the victim clicks anywhere on the transparent layer created by this tag.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary API PUT requests on behalf of the victim. This can lead to:
    *   **Project Transfer:** The provided example shows that an attacker can transfer a victim's project to a group controlled by the attacker, effectively stealing the project and gaining ownership.
    *   **Other API Abuse:** The attacker could leverage other PUT API endpoints to modify user settings, project configurations, or other data.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **User Profile Injection:**  The attacker injects the malicious HTML into their own user's full name field through the user profile settings page.
    *   **Merge Request Page:** The attack relies on the victim visiting a merge request page where the injected user name is displayed and clickable, because of the presence of a javascript event handler for `.js-draft-toggle-button` class elements.
    *  **HTML Injection:** the crafted HTML includes `fixed-top`, `tree-list-holder` and `js-draft-toggle-button` classes, and the `href` parameter is set to the attacker's chosen API request. The `fixed-top` class makes the link appear as a transparent layer over the entire page. `tree-list-holder` hides the transparent layer in other pages besides merge requests.

*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs a valid account on the GitLab instance.
    *   **Ability to Create Projects/Groups:**  The attacker needs to be able to create projects and/or groups to perform some attacks, such as transferring the project.
    *  **Interaction with a Victim:** The attacker needs to induce a victim to click on a merge request page after the exploit has been prepared to trigger the malicious PUT request.
    *   **Knowledge of the API:** The attacker needs to know the structure of the API and the PUT endpoints to exploit.

**Additional Information**

*   **Affected Versions:** All versions after 13.7 before 16.6.6, 16.7 prior to 16.7.4, and 16.8 prior to 16.8.1 are vulnerable.
*   **Reported By:** The vulnerability was reported by `yvvdwf` through the HackerOne bug bounty program.
*   **Mitigation:** The vulnerability was mitigated in GitLab versions 16.6.6, 16.7.4, and 16.8.1 by improving input sanitization.
