Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the `sfsi_save_export` function within the Social Media Share Buttons & Social Sharing Icons WordPress plugin. This function allows users to export plugin settings, which, in versions up to 2.8.5, inadvertently includes sensitive data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Sensitive Information Exposure:** The plugin's export functionality improperly includes social media authentication tokens, secrets, and app passwords. This is a critical information exposure vulnerability.
- **Inadequate Access Control:** Although the patch notes show that there was a `current_user_can('manage_options')` check added, this was not present in the vulnerable versions. It is implied that before the fix, any user, including subscribers, could export the settings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker who successfully exports the plugin settings can obtain social media authentication tokens, secrets, and app passwords, allowing them to potentially take over social media accounts connected to the website or use those credentials for other malicious activities.
- **Data Breach:** Exposure of these tokens and secrets represents a significant data breach, as it compromises the website's and potentially its users' social media accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct Access:** An attacker with access to the WordPress admin panel, even with low-level privileges such as a subscriber role, could export the settings.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a user on the WordPress site, with even a subscriber level account.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in versions up to and including 2.8.5 of the Social Media Share Buttons & Social Sharing Icons plugin.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.8.6 of the plugin.
- The `sfsi_save_export` function was modified to include nonce verification (`wp_verify_nonce`) and a user capability check (`current_user_can('manage_options')`) as part of the fix.
- The specific data exposed includes social media authentication tokens, secrets and app passwords.
