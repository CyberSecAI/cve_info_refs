Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-5250

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the plugin's improper handling of filenames within an include/require statement in PHP. Specifically, the `gf_get_template` function in `grid.plus.base.class.php` uses a user-controlled `$slug` variable to construct the path to a template file, which is then included using `include($located)`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The plugin is vulnerable to LFI because the `gf_get_template` function, accessible through a shortcode, allows an attacker to specify a file path (via the `slug` parameter) to be included by the plugin.
- **Unsanitized Input:** The plugin fails to sanitize the `$slug` parameter, which is used to construct the file path. This allows the inclusion of arbitrary files on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE):** By including PHP files with malicious content, attackers can execute arbitrary code on the server. This could lead to:
    - **Bypassing Access Controls:** Gaining unauthorized access to the system and its resources.
    - **Sensitive Data Disclosure:** Accessing and stealing sensitive data stored on the server.
    - **Complete System Compromise:** Taking full control of the server.
- **PHP Code Execution:** Attackers can force the server to execute arbitrary PHP code, which can be used to inject backdoors, modify site content, etc.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Shortcode:** The vulnerability is exploited through a shortcode, indicating that the `gf_get_template` function is likely called when a specific shortcode is processed by WordPress.
- **`slug` Parameter:** The attacker controls the `$slug` parameter in the shortcode, which allows the inclusion of arbitrary local files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User (Subscriber+):** The attacker must have at least subscriber-level access to the WordPress site. This indicates that an attacker needs a valid WordPress user account, but it does not need to be an administrator account.
- **Knowledge of Shortcode Usage:** The attacker needs to know how to use the vulnerable shortcode and the parameter that allows file inclusion.
- **Ability to Insert Shortcodes:** The attacker must be able to insert shortcodes, typically within posts, pages, or other content areas where shortcodes are processed.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerable function is located in `/core/grid.plus.base.class.php`.
- The vulnerability is present in versions up to and including 1.3.3 of the Grid Plus plugin.
- The vulnerability was patched in version 1.3.4.
- The issue was reported by István Márton from Wordfence.
- The function `gf_get_template` is vulnerable at line 19 which is where the file path is constructed using the vulnerable `$slug` parameter.
