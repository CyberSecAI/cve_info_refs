Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The plugin exposes the full server path of a file when a non-existent file is specified in the `model_url` parameter of the `vrm360` shortcode. This is due to insufficient error handling or sanitization when processing the `model_url` parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Full Path Disclosure (FPD):** The plugin reveals the server's internal file path, which is a security vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can gain knowledge of the server's file system structure, which can be useful for further attacks. This does not directly compromise the system but is considered a security risk.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by providing a non-existent file path in the `model_url` parameter of the `[vrm360]` shortcode on a WordPress page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to create or edit a WordPress page. This typically requires a user with at least the "Contributor" role or higher.
- The attacker needs to know the name of the shortcode and its parameters.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through the `[vrm360]` shortcode.
- A non-existent file path like `SA_Character.zip` is used as the value for the `model_url` parameter.
- The full path of the server is displayed in the browser's console, not directly on the webpage.
- The vulnerability is categorized as a Security Misconfiguration according to OWASP and CWE-209 (Information Exposure Through an Error Message).
