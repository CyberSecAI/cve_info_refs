- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape a parameter before using it in a SQL statement.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection (SQLI), specifically in the `wml_logs/send_mail` endpoint.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries into the database, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion. The provided proof of concept demonstrates a time-based SQL injection which can be used to extract data.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a POST request to the `/wp-json/wml/v1/wml_logs/send_mail` endpoint with a malicious `id` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have a WordPress user account with at least the Contributor role.
