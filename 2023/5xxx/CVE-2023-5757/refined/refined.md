The provided content is related to CVE-2023-5757.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The WP Crowdfunding plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape certain settings, specifically within the reward description field.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker, specifically a high-privilege user (e.g., admin), can inject malicious JavaScript code into the reward description field. When a campaign containing the malicious code is viewed, the injected script will execute in the victim's browser. This could lead to various attacks, such as:
*   Session hijacking
*   Redirecting users to malicious sites
*   Defacing the website
*   Performing unauthorized actions on behalf of the admin user.

**Attack vectors:** 
1. The attacker needs to be a high-privilege user (e.g. Admin).
2. The attacker adds a new campaign or edits an existing one.
3. The attacker injects a malicious payload within the reward description field.
4.  When the campaign page is accessed or viewed, the injected script is executed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to have administrative privileges or a similar high privilege user role on the WordPress site.
*   The attacker must be able to create or edit campaigns within the WP Crowdfunding plugin.
