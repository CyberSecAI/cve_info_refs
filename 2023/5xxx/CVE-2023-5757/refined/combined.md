## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP Crowdfunding < 2.1.8 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

1. Add a campaign and for the reward descrption enter the payload `<script>alert(1)</script>`
2. When the campaign is published, view it in the campaign list and see the alert box.

### Affects Plugins
