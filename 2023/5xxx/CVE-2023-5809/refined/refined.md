- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape user-provided input in the "description" field of categories, leading to stored XSS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with administrator privileges can inject malicious JavaScript code into the category description. This code executes when the page is rendered, allowing the attacker to perform malicious actions such as redirecting users to malicious websites, stealing cookies, or performing actions on behalf of the victim.
- **Attack vectors:** By adding a new category and including malicious javascript code within the category description.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be logged in with administrator privileges to add categories and set descriptions.
