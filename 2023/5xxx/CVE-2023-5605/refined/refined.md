The provided content is related to CVE-2023-5605.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape user-supplied input in several settings, making it vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient sanitization and escaping of settings. Specifically, the "Short URL," "Title" (under Links -> Edit Link), and "Name" (under Groups -> Edit Group) parameters are vulnerable.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with administrative privileges can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of other users who access the affected pages within the WordPress administration panel. This can lead to various malicious activities, including but not limited to session hijacking, account takeover, and defacement of the website.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the administrative interface of the WordPress plugin "URL Shortify". An administrator must edit settings parameters of the plugin by inserting malicious javascript payloads.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with high privileges, such as an administrator, to access the plugin settings and inject malicious scripts.
