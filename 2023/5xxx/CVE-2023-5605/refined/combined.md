## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# URL Shortify < 1.7.9.1 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

Multiple parameters in the plugin's settings are vulnerable to cross-site scripting.
Links -> Edit Link
- "Short URL" payload: `9onp" onmouseover=alert(3) abc="`
- "Title" payload: `KaizenCoders" onmouseover=alert(1) abc="`
Groups -> Edit Group
- "Name" payload: `title" onmouseover=alert(2) abc="`

### Affects Plugins
