Vulnerability Details

CVE ID: CVE-2023-5402

CVSS v3.1 Base Score 9.8 | Critical | CVSS:3.1/ AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

A CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management vulnerability exists that could cause a remote
code execution when the transfer command is used over the network.

CVE ID: CVE-2023-5399

CVSS v3.1 Base Score 9.8 | Critical | CVSS:3.1/ AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

A CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path
Traversal') vulnerability exists that could cause tampering of files on the personal computer
running C-Bus when using the File Command.

Note regarding vulnerability details: The severity of vulnerabilities was calculated using the
CVSS Base metrics in version 3.1 (CVSS v3.1) without incorporating the Temporal and
Environmental metrics. Schneider Electric recommends that customers score the CVSS
Environmental metrics, which are specific to end-user organizations, and consider factors such
as the presence of mitigations in that environment. Environmental metrics may refine the
relative severity posed by the vulnerabilities described in this document within a customer’s
environment.

Remediation

SpaceLogic C-Bus
Toolkit
v1.16.3 and prior

Version 1.16.4 of SpaceLogic C-Bus Toolkit includes a fix for this
vulnerability and is available for download here:

https://www.se.com/au/en/product-range/65976-spacelogic-cbus-
lighting-building-automation-system#software-and-firmware

Please reboot your PC after installation.

Version number can be seen by launching C-Bus Toolkit and
selecting “About…” option under the Help Menu

Customers should use appropriate patching methodologies when applying these patches to
their systems. We strongly recommend the use of back-ups and evaluating the impact of these
patches in a Test and Development environment or on an offline infrastructure. Contact
Schneider Electric’s Customer Care Center if you need assistance removing a patch.

If customers choose not to apply the remediation provided above, they should immediately
apply the following mitigation to reduce the risk of exploit:

•  Block TCP port 20023 to SpaceLogic C-Bus Toolkit by using the rules in the PC

firewall.

By doing this, the vulnerable commands could not then be used to compromise the PC
by an external entity as the connection and ultimately the command will not be accepted
by SpaceLogic C-Bus Toolkit.

General Security Recommendations

We strongly recommend the following industry cybersecurity best practices.

•  Locate control and safety system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and

•

isolate them from the business network.
Install physical controls so no unauthorized personnel can access your industrial control
and safety systems, components, peripheral equipment, and networks.

•  Place all controllers in locked cabinets and never leave them in the “Program” mode.
•  Never connect programming software to any network other than the network intended for

that device.

•  Scan all methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated network such as CDs, USB

drives, etc. before use in the terminals or any node connected to these networks.

•  Never allow mobile devices that have connected to any other network besides the

intended network to connect to the safety or control networks without proper sanitation.
•  Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and systems and ensure that

they are not accessible from the Internet.

•  When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks
(VPNs). Recognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the
most current version available. Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the
connected devices.

Practices document.
