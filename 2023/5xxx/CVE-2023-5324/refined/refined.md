{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by a malformed IPv6 packet with a zero-length payload and specific extension headers.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The eeroOS has insufficient input validation and does not handle zero-length IPv6 payload with hop-by-hop or destination options extension header that refers to a non-existent extension header correctly, leading to a denial-of-service condition.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The primary impact is a denial-of-service condition on the eero device's Ethernet interface. The interface stops receiving further packets. In a multi-eero setup, this can lead to a complete loss of inbound Ethernet communication. Single eero devices will fall back to WiFi communication, but this can lead to bridging loops.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is sending a crafted IPv6 packet to an eero device via the Ethernet interface. The packet can be unicast or multicast.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be on the same network as the eero device(s) or be able to route a malformed IPv6 packet to them. The attacker does not need to know the MAC or IPv6 address of the target device."
