Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2023-5868:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a memory disclosure issue in PostgreSQL's aggregate function calls. Specifically, when these functions receive arguments of "unknown" type, they might inadvertently reveal portions of server memory.
- The "unknown" type is often encountered when a string literal lacks explicit type designation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- Memory disclosure vulnerability in PostgreSQL
- Lack of proper bounds checking/handling of "unknown" type arguments passed to aggregate functions
- Potential for unintended memory exposure in server processes

**Impact of exploitation:**

- An attacker could potentially read arbitrary memory contents on the server. Although not confirmed by the reporting party, there's a possibility that this could expose sensitive or confidential information stored in the server's memory.

**Attack vectors:**

- This vulnerability can be exploited by sending specific SQL queries to the PostgreSQL server.
- An attacker must be an authenticated database user.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- An attacker needs to have valid database credentials to send the crafted SQL query to the server.
- Access can be through a local or remote connection as long as they are authenticated.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided Red Hat Security Advisories (RHSA) for CVE-2023-5868 include information about the products affected and the specific packages that address the vulnerability.
- Multiple Red Hat products, primarily those including postgresql components, were identified as vulnerable.
- The fixes for the vulnerability were included in the latest minor releases for supported PostgreSQL versions.
- The Red Hat Security Advisories indicate this is classified as an "Important" security update.

The information from Red Hat and PostgreSQL confirm that CVE-2023-5868 involves a memory disclosure issue related to how PostgreSQL handles arguments to certain aggregate functions.
