- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize user metadata before displaying it in mentions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. User-supplied input is not being escaped before being outputted in mentions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed when a user views or previews a post containing the crafted mention. This could allow an attacker to perform actions on behalf of the user, steal cookies/session data, or redirect the user to a malicious website.
- **Attack vectors:** A contributor or higher-level user can inject the malicious code into a post by crafting a specific mention that includes a payload.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have a role of Contributor or above on the WordPress site.
