## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# ActivityPub for WordPress < 1.0.0 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not escape user metadata before outputting them in mentions, which could allow users with a role of Contributor and above to perform Stored XSS attacks

### Proof of Concept

As a contributor, put the following payload in a post (the payload will have to be updated accordingly to watch the correct user and domain)
ahoy hoy @user@malicious-activitypub.site
The XSS will be trigged when viewing/previewing the post

### Affects Plugins
