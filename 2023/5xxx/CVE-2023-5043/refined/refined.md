  "CVE-2023-5043": {
    "description": "A security issue was identified in ingress-nginx where the nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/configuration-snippet annotation on an Ingress object (in the `networking.k8s.io` or `extensions` API group) can be used to inject arbitrary commands, and obtain the credentials of the ingress-nginx controller. In the default configuration, that credential has access to all secrets in the cluster.",
    "root_cause": "The `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/configuration-snippet` annotation on an Ingress object allows injection of arbitrary commands due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Validation",
       "Command Injection"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary command execution on the ingress-nginx controller, potentially leading to credential extraction and access to all secrets within the Kubernetes cluster.",
    "attack_vector": "Network",
     "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to create or modify Ingress objects within the Kubernetes cluster. This can be achieved through having low-level privileges within the cluster"
