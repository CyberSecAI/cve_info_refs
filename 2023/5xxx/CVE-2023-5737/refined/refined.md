- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly authorize some AJAX requests, allowing unauthorized users to modify plugin settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing authorization/broken access control. Specifically, the plugin fails to restrict access to the `mgdp_plugin_save_import_settings` action, allowing users with the Subscriber role or higher to modify import settings.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with a Subscriber role can modify plugin settings, such as `im_data_size_per_req` and `im_db_file_per_req`, potentially disrupting the plugin functionality.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited via crafted AJAX requests to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the `mgdp_plugin_save_import_settings` action and modified settings data.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have at least a Subscriber role on the WordPress site.
