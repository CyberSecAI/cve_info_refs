Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-5722:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how Firefox handled opaque responses within the Cache API, specifically regarding range requests and the `Vary` header.  Firefox was rejecting attempts to store 206 (Partial Content) responses in the cache, allowing an attacker to infer information about the response. Additionally, the way Firefox handled the `Vary` header allowed attackers to potentially learn its contents.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Information Leakage:**  The rejection of 206 responses allowed an attacker to probe the range of a server's response by iteratively increasing the range size. This allowed them to determine the size of an opaque response.
*   **`Vary` header leakage:** By supplying different requests, an attacker could potentially infer the contents of the `Vary` header, which dictates how a response is cached.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Opaque Response Size Disclosure:** An attacker could determine the size of an opaque response. This could indirectly reveal user state and sensitive information.
*   **`Vary` header disclosure:** An attacker could learn the contents of the `Vary` header, which could lead to further cache-related attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves a malicious website using the Cache API with cross-origin requests. An attacker would make no-cors range requests and observe whether the attempt to store the response in the cache is rejected, indicating a 206 response. This can be done iteratively to discover the full size of an opaque response.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript within a user's browser, typically by hosting a malicious webpage. The attacker does not require any special privileges on the user's machine.
