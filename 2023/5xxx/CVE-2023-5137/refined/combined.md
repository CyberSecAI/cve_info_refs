## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Simply Excerpts <= 1.4 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitize and escape some fields in the plugin settings, which could allow high-privilege users such as an administrator to inject arbitrary web scripts even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in a multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

Put the following payload in the "Read more text" setting of the plugin and save: 1"><img src=1 onerror=alert(/xss/)>

### Affects Plugins
