- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape user-controlled input in the plugin settings. Specifically, the "Read more text" setting is vulnerable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with administrative privileges can inject arbitrary web scripts into the plugin settings. This could lead to various malicious activities, such as redirecting users to malicious sites, stealing cookies, or performing actions on behalf of the administrator.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker must have administrator privileges to access the plugin's settings page and inject the malicious payload.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a high-privilege user, such as an administrator, to access the vulnerable settings and inject the malicious script. They also need to be able to save these settings.
