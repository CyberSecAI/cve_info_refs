The provided content is related to CVE-2023-5559.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress plugin "10Web Booster" fails to validate the option name provided to certain AJAX actions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Unauthenticated arbitrary option deletion:** The plugin allows unauthenticated users to delete arbitrary options from the database.
*   **Missing Authorization**: The plugin does not properly validate user authorization when processing AJAX actions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Denial of service (DoS):**  Deleting critical options can render the site unusable. As an example, changing the `nonce` parameter to `siteurl` is mentioned, which makes the site not work.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Network:** Exploitation can be performed remotely over the network.
*   **AJAX actions:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted POST request to `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with a specific `action` parameter, and a modified `nonce` parameter to control which option is deleted.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Unauthenticated user:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication or access to the WordPress backend.
*   **Network access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the target WordPress website.
