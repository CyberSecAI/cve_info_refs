## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Campaign Monitor Forms < 2.5.6 - Subscriber+ Arbitrary Options Update

### Description

The plugin does not prevent users with low privileges (like subscribers) from overwriting any options on a site with the string "true", which could lead to a variety of outcomes, including DoS.

### Proof of Concept

Once the site gets at least 25 conversions using the plugin, a notice will show up on the administration panel, to all logged-in users regardless of their roles.
By clicking on "Dismiss" button the `fca\_eoi\_dismiss` AJAX Action is invoked with two parameters: `nonce` and `option`.
The `option` parameter is not sanitized before used in this line of code:
```
# campaign-monitor-wp/includes/eoi-post-types.php
1938┆ if ( update\_option( $option, 'true' ) ) {
```
Since there are no additional privilege checks in the AJAX action's callback function, this means an attacker with Subscriber+ role can actually set any WordPress options with the value `true`.
The possibility to use only the `true` value limits the possibility to perform standard attacks like modifying site URL, default role for new users, and so on, but it is easy to use to create a denial of service by overwriting plugins'/themes' or WordPress' own options.
