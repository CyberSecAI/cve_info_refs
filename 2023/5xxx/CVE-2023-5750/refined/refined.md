{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin does not sanitize and escape a parameter before outputting it back into the page, leading to a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a vulnerable user's browser, potentially gaining access to sensitive information or performing actions on behalf of the user. This could be used against high privilege users such as admin.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious URL that includes a JavaScript payload in the `hash` parameter, which is then reflected in the page output.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL and trick a user (ideally an admin) into visiting it. The attacker does not need to be authenticated."
