Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-5412

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:**
- The `Image horizontal reel scroll slideshow` plugin for WordPress, in versions up to 13.2, is vulnerable to SQL injection.
- The vulnerability exists due to insufficient escaping of user-supplied parameters within the plugin's shortcode and a lack of proper preparation of the SQL query. Specifically, the `Ihrss_type` parameter is not sanitized before being used in the SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The plugin directly incorporates user-provided input (`Ihrss_type` from the shortcode) into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to:
    - **Data extraction:** Sensitive information from the database can be accessed.
    - **Data modification:** The attacker could potentially alter or delete data in the database.
    - **Full compromise:** In some scenarios, it could lead to complete compromise of the WordPress site and its server, depending on database user permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Shortcode:** The vulnerability is exploitable through the plugin's shortcode, specifically by manipulating the `type` attribute.
- **Authenticated Users:** The vulnerability is accessible to authenticated attackers with subscriber-level permissions or higher.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to have an account on the WordPress site with at least subscriber-level access.
- **Shortcode Usage:** The attacker needs to be able to insert shortcodes into content, which is generally a capability available to content creators, such as authors, editors and admin roles.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to know that the `type` parameter in the shortcode is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was patched in version 13.3 of the plugin.
- The provided code diffs show the change where the vulnerable query was modified to use `$wpdb->prepare()` which mitigates SQL Injection.
- The vulnerable code is located in the function `Ihrss_shortcode()`.
- The vulnerable line is `$sSql = $sSql . " and Ihrss_type='" . $Ihrss_type . "'";`, which was changed to `$sSql = $sSql . " and Ihrss_type = %s ";` and `$sSql = $wpdb->prepare($sSql, $Ihrss_type);`
