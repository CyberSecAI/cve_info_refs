Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the identified vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** SQL Injection vulnerability in EcShop v4.1.1.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Unsanitized input in the `goods_id` parameter within the `order.php` admin page leads to SQL injection. Specifically, the code fails to properly sanitize the `goods_id[0]` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially extract sensitive database information, as evidenced by the successful use of sqlmap to retrieve database data. This could lead to the compromise of user data, order information, and other sensitive information.
- The attacker may be able to modify the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `admin/order.php` page.
- The attacker injects SQL code through the `goods_id[0]` parameter via a POST request.
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted POST request including vulnerable parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be logged into the backend of the EcShop application.
- The attacker needs the ability to capture and modify HTTP requests (using a tool like Burp Suite).
- The attacker needs to be able to use an SQL injection testing tool like sqlmap or manually craft the attack payload.
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of the application's structure and parameters.
