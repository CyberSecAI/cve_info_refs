- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing authentication check in the WebSocket channel used for the Check Point IoT integration.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Missing Authentication for Critical Function (CWE-306). The WebSocket channel returns asset data without requiring authentication.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker with knowledge of the underlying system can extract limited asset information.
- **Attack vectors:** Network access to the vulnerable web management interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Network access to the Guardian or CMC web interface and knowledge of the underlying system to exploit the WebSocket channel. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the system.
