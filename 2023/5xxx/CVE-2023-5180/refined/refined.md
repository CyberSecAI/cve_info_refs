    "cve": "CVE-2023-5180",
    "description": "An issue was discovered in Open Design Alliance Drawings SDK before 2024.12. A corrupted value of number of sectors used by the Fat structure in a crafted DGN file leads to an out-of-bounds write. This can allow attackers to cause a crash, potentially enabling a denial-of-service attack (Crash, Exit, or Restart) or possible code execution.",
