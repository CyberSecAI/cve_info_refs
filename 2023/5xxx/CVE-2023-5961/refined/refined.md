**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network (AV:N):** The vulnerability can be exploited over a network.
- **Low Attack Complexity (AC:L):** The attack is relatively easy to execute.
- **User Interaction Required (UI:R):** The attacker needs to trick a user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious page to trigger the attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker can be unauthenticated (PR:N) and needs to trick a user into interacting with a crafted request.

**Additional Details:**
