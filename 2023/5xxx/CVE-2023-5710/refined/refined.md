{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The System Dashboard plugin for WordPress lacks proper authorization checks on the `sd_constants()` function, which is accessible via an AJAX action.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Missing authorization leading to information disclosure. The vulnerability allows any authenticated user, even with subscriber-level access, to access sensitive data through the `sd_constants()` function.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An authenticated attacker can obtain sensitive information, such as database credentials.",
  "Attack vectors": "An authenticated user, with at least subscriber-level access, can send a crafted AJAX request to the vulnerable `sd_constants()` function.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be an authenticated user on the WordPress site with at least subscriber level access."
