- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly authorize settings updates or escape settings values.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin's settings, which will be executed in the browsers of users visiting the affected website. This can lead to various attacks, including stealing user cookies/session, redirecting to malicious sites, or performing actions on behalf of the victim user.
- **Attack vectors:**  A crafted POST request to the `/wp-json/mvx_catalog/v1/save_enquiry` endpoint, setting arbitrary settings.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated. They can send the malicious request from any location on the internet. The target site needs to have the "Catalog Mode" activated for the exploit to work.
