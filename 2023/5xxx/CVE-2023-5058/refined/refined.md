Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-5058:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from flaws in the image parsing libraries within the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) firmware. These libraries are responsible for processing logo image files displayed during the early boot phase. Specifically, the vulnerability exists in the processing of user-supplied splash screens during system boot.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  Insecure image parsing: The core issue lies in the way UEFI firmware parses image files, making it susceptible to specially crafted malicious images.
-  Lack of proper input validation: The parsing libraries do not adequately validate image files, allowing malicious files to trigger vulnerabilities.
-  Bypass Secure Boot mechanism: By exploiting the vulnerability in the DXE phase, attackers can bypass the Secure Boot mechanism.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  Denial of Service (DoS): A malicious image can cause a denial-of-service attack, disrupting the normal boot process.
-  Arbitrary Code Execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary code in the UEFI DXE phase by supplying a malicious image, allowing the attacker to gain control over the system.
-  Modification of UEFI settings: Successful exploitation can lead to access and modification of high-privileged UEFI settings, allowing for system compromise.
-  Compromise System Integrity: The attacker can compromise system integrity by bypassing the Secure Boot mechanism.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  Malicious Splash Screen: Attackers can introduce a malicious image file that will be processed as the splash screen during the boot process.
-  Firmware Update: An attacker can create a malicious firmware update containing a corrupted image.
-  PCI Flashing: Exploitation can occur during PCI flashing with a firmware update.
-  Supply-chain Attacks: Due to the nature of UEFI supply-chains, vulnerabilities can be introduced in a variety of ways including integration of shared libraries.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-  Local Privileged Access: The attacker needs local privileged access to the system to modify the boot logo or update the firmware.
-  Ability to modify the ESP partition: The attacker needs to be able to modify the ESP (EFI system partition) which stores the boot logo.
-  Ability to create firmware updates: The attacker needs to be able to create or modify firmware update files.

**Additional Notes:**
-  The vulnerability is part of a larger set of vulnerabilities dubbed "LogoFAIL" that affect multiple vendors and their products.
-  Phoenix Technologies acknowledges that the vulnerability exists in their Phoenix SecureCore™ Technology™ 4 firmware.
-  Affected vendors are working with customers to provide fixes.
