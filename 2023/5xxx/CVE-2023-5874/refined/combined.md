## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Popup box < 3.8.6 - Admin+ Stored XSS in Popup Settings

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

1. Add a new Popup
2. In the "Popups > Settings" section, add the PoC `"><script>alert(92)</script>` for any of the "Close Button" parameters.
3. Save and navigate back to the popups and see the XSS.
