- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to sanitize and escape certain settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:**  A high-privilege user, such as an admin, can inject malicious scripts that will be executed when other users view the affected content. This could lead to arbitrary actions on the user's behalf, session hijacking, or other malicious behavior.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to be a high-privilege user (e.g. admin) who can access the quiz settings page. The attacker injects the malicious script in the quiz title field. When other users navigate to the quiz overview page, the stored XSS payload is triggered.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have administrative privileges within the WordPress site to access the plugin settings and create or modify quizzes.
