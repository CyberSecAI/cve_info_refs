Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the Featured Image Caption WordPress plugin. Specifically, the plugin does not properly sanitize the `caption_text` and `source_text` fields when saving the meta box data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The lack of sanitization allows attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts into the caption and source text fields. These scripts are then stored in the database and executed when a user accesses the affected page.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute malicious JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as:
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Stealing user cookies and session data
    - Defacing the website
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack vectors:**
- **Shortcode and Post Meta:** The vulnerability is exploitable through the plugin's shortcode and post meta. An attacker can insert malicious scripts within the caption or source text fields via the meta box in a post.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authenticated Contributor+ Access:** Attackers need to have at least contributor-level permissions in WordPress to be able to edit posts and inject the malicious code through the meta box.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerable code is located in the `MetaBox.php` file.
- The fix involves using `wp_kses()` to sanitize the `caption_text` and `source_text` and `esc_url_raw()` for the URL.
- The vulnerability affects versions up to and including 0.8.10 of the Featured Image Caption plugin.
- The patched version is 0.8.11.
