- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Deserialization of untrusted data. The plugin deserializes data from the 'wpsimplegallery\_gallery' post meta via 'wpsgallery' shortcode.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** PHP Object Injection due to the deserialization of untrusted input.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject a PHP object. If a POP chain is present via another plugin or theme, this can lead to arbitrary file deletion, sensitive data retrieval, or code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing the 'wpsgallery' shortcode, which deserializes data from the 'wpsimplegallery\_gallery' post meta.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Authenticated users with Contributor-level permissions or higher can exploit the vulnerability. An additional POP chain is required to achieve code execution.
