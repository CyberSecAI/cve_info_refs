- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Seraphinite Accelerator plugin fails to validate the URL used for redirection, allowing any authenticated user to be redirected to an arbitrary URL.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Open redirect vulnerability due to insufficient URL validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can redirect authenticated users to malicious websites, potentially leading to phishing attacks or other forms of social engineering.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a specific URL with the malicious redirect URL in the `redir` parameter and making a logged-in user access it. The vulnerable URL is `https://example.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=seraph_accel_act&fn=acceptEula&redir=MALICIOUS_URL`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to entice an authenticated user to click on the crafted URL. No specific user role is mentioned, implying that any authenticated user is vulnerable.
