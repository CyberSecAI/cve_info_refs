**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-5051

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the `form_id` attribute within the `callrail_form` shortcode.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.
- These scripts execute whenever a user accesses the compromised page.
- This could lead to various malicious activities, including but not limited to, data theft, session hijacking, or redirecting users to malicious sites.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker leverages the `callrail_form` shortcode and its vulnerable `form_id` attribute.
- The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code as the value of the `form_id` attribute.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least contributor-level permissions on the WordPress site.
- They need the ability to create or edit posts/pages and use shortcodes.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in the `callrail_form_shortcode_handler` function within the `callrail.php` file of the CallRail Phone Call Tracking plugin.
- Specifically, the `form_id` attribute from the shortcode is not properly sanitized before being used in the output, allowing for XSS injection.
- The vulnerable code is located at `callrail-phone-call-tracking/tags/0.5.2/callrail.php#L174`.
- The fix is implemented in version 0.5.3 by using `esc_attr()` to sanitize the `form_id` value before using it. This change is located in `callrail-phone-call-tracking/trunk/callrail.php`
- The fix was introduced in changeset `2982876`

**Additional Notes:**
