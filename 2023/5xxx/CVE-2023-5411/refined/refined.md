Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-5411:

**1. Verification:**
   - The provided content, particularly from Wordfence, directly references CVE-2023-5411 and describes a vulnerability in Funnelforms Free <= 3.4, which aligns with the provided CVE description.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The vulnerability stems from a **missing authorization check** within the `fnsf_af2_save_post` function of the Funnelforms Free plugin. This allows unauthorized modification of post data.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Missing Authorization:** The core issue is the absence of proper checks to verify if a user has sufficient permissions to modify post data through the `fnsf_af2_save_post` function.
   - **Insecure direct object reference:** Authenticated users can directly submit POST requests to modify post data without proper authorization.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
    - An attacker with subscriber-level permissions or higher can **modify certain post values**.
    -  While the impact is somewhat limited due to fixed values passed to `wp_update_post`, attackers can still alter some aspects of the posts and potentially compromise them.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
    - **Network:** The attack can be carried out remotely over a network.
    - **HTTP POST Request:** Exploitation involves sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the vulnerable `fnsf_af2_save_post` function.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    -   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have a user account on the WordPress site, even with basic subscriber-level permissions.
    -   **Knowledge of vulnerable function:** The attacker needs to know which function is vulnerable ( `fnsf_af2_save_post` ) and how to call it with malicious parameters.

**Additional Details (From Provided Content):**
   -  The Wordfence content explicitly mentions that the vulnerability is a "Missing Authorization to Post Modification," further emphasizing that the root cause lies in insufficient authorization controls.
   -  The vulnerable function is `fnsf_af2_save_post`
   -  The fix was implemented in version 3.4.2
