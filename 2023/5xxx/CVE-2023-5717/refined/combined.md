perf: Disallow mis-matched inherited group readsBecause group consistency is non-atomic between parent (filedesc) and children
(inherited) events, it is possible for PERF\_FORMAT\_GROUP read() to try and sum
non-matching counter groups -- with non-sensical results.
Add group\_generation to distinguish the case where a parent group removes and
adds an event and thus has the same number, but a different configuration of
events as inherited groups.
This became a problem when commit fa8c269353d5 ("perf/core: Invert
perf\_read\_group() loops") flipped the order of child\_list and sibling\_list.
Previously it would iterate the group (sibling\_list) first, and for each
sibling traverse the child\_list. In this order, only the group composition of
the parent is relevant. By flipping the order the group composition of the
child (inherited) events becomes an issue and the mis-match in group
composition becomes evident.
That said; even prior to this commit, while reading of a group that is not
equally inherited was not broken, it still made no sense.
(Ab)use ECHILD as error return to indicate issues with child process group
composition.
