{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin does not properly validate file extensions when uploading files to attach to emails.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Inadequate file extension validation",
     "Arbitrary file upload"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote code execution (RCE). An attacker can upload and execute arbitrary PHP code on the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "By sending a POST request to the `/wp-json/wml/v1/wml_logs/send_mail` endpoint with a crafted request including a PHP file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have a contributor or higher role and be able to send requests to the WordPress REST API. The provided PoC uses a nonce obtained from the server, suggesting that an attacker could potentially obtain the nonce with an authenticated session, either by stealing it or having a valid session in place."
