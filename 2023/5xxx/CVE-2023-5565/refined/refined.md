- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes within the 'shortmenu' shortcode.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. These scripts will execute whenever a user accesses a page containing the injected code, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation occurs through the use of the 'shortmenu' shortcode with maliciously crafted attributes.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Authenticated attackers with contributor-level or higher permissions can exploit the vulnerability.
