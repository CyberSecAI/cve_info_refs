- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper encoding when rewriting the email before delivery.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The email delivery agent in Proofpoint Enterprise Protection does not properly encode HTML in the email subject, allowing injection of unencoded HTML into the email body.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated attacker can inject arbitrary HTML into the email body. This could potentially be used for phishing attacks, or to inject malicious scripts if email clients render the HTML content. The impact is rated as low integrity impact.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker sends an email with maliciously crafted HTML in the email subject.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker can be unauthenticated, and can send emails to a vulnerable system.
