Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the `ipushpull_page` shortcode of the "Live updates from Excel" WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape shortcode attributes, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into pages. This code executes when a user visits the compromised page.
- This can lead to:
    - Stealing user session cookies, allowing account hijacking.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.
    - Other malicious activities within the context of the user's browser.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through the plugin's `ipushpull_page` shortcode.
- An attacker injects malicious JavaScript within the shortcode attributes.
- When the shortcode is rendered on a page, the injected script executes within the user's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have at least contributor-level permissions on the WordPress site. This allows them to create or edit posts/pages where shortcodes can be included.
- **Knowledge of Shortcode Attributes:** The attacker must know the `ipushpull_page` shortcode and its exploitable attributes to craft a malicious payload.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects versions up to and including 2.3.2 of the "Live updates from Excel" plugin.
- The vulnerability was patched in version 2.3.3.
- The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Alex Thomas of Wordfence.
- The `sanitise_input` function in the plugin's code was intended for sanitization, but it was not sufficient to prevent the XSS vulnerability.
- The provided code snippets show the vulnerable `add_embed_markup` function where the shortcode attributes are extracted.
