Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2023-5363:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in the way OpenSSL processes key and Initialization Vector (IV) lengths when using the `EVP_EncryptInit_ex2()`, `EVP_DecryptInit_ex2()`, or `EVP_CipherInit_ex2()` functions. The issue is that the OSSL_PARAM array, which can specify key and IV lengths, is processed *after* the key and IV have already been established. This late processing means that any changes to key or IV lengths specified within the OSSL_PARAM array are not applied as intended.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Incorrect Parameter Handling**: The primary weakness is that the library does not correctly apply key and IV length parameters when provided through the OSSL_PARAM array during initialization of cryptographic contexts.
- **IV Truncation/Overrun**: When the IV length is modified via the OSSL_PARAM array, the IV can be either truncated or overread, leading to incorrect IV values. Similarly, the key can be truncated or overread.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Loss of Confidentiality:** For certain cipher modes like CCM, GCM, and OCB, truncation of the IV can lead to IV reuse. This is particularly critical when following NIST SP 800-38D section 8.2.1 for deterministic IV construction, as the counter portion could be truncated. IV reuse can result in loss of confidentiality.
- **Incorrect Results:** Both truncation and overruns of the key or IV will produce incorrect encryption/decryption results and could cause application failure. In some cases, this might even lead to a memory exception.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the vulnerable API calls: `EVP_EncryptInit_ex2()`, `EVP_DecryptInit_ex2()`, or `EVP_CipherInit_ex2()`. An attacker would need to control the parameters passed to these functions, specifically the OSSL_PARAM array to specify incorrect key or IV lengths.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Control over API parameters:** An attacker needs to have the capability to influence the parameters passed to vulnerable functions. This usually involves the ability to supply parameters to the application or system using the affected OpenSSL library.
- **No special privileges or user interaction:** The vulnerability can be triggered without requiring special privileges or user interaction.

**Affected Ciphers and Modes:**
The following ciphers and cipher modes are impacted: RC2, RC4, RC5, CCM, GCM, and OCB.

**Specific Notes:**
- The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.
- The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are also not affected because the issue resides outside of the FIPS provider boundary.
- The vulnerability exists in OpenSSL versions 3.0 and 3.1.

**Mitigation:**
- Upgrade to OpenSSL 3.0.12 (for 3.0 users) or 3.1.4 (for 3.1 users) to address the vulnerability. The fix involves processing key and IV length parameters from the OSSL_PARAM array earlier in the initialization process.

**Severity:**
The issue is rated as "Moderate" severity due to the specific circumstances required to exploit this, and the fact that it is likely that application developers would have spotted the issue during testing, as decryption would fail. However, if an application *is* vulnerable, the impact is very serious.
