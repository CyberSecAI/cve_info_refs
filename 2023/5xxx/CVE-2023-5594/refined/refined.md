- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper validation of the server's certificate chain within the SSL/TLS protocol scanning feature. Specifically, an intermediate certificate signed using the MD5 or SHA1 algorithm was incorrectly considered trusted.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Failure to properly validate certificate chains, leading to acceptance of certificates signed with obsolete and insecure algorithms (MD5, SHA1).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A browser on a system with the affected ESET product and its secure traffic scanning feature enabled could be tricked into trusting a site secured with a certificate signed using MD5 or SHA1. This could allow an attacker to perform man-in-the-middle attacks or serve malicious content through a seemingly secure connection.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attacks that involve the use of a malicious certificate chain with an intermediate certificate signed with MD5 or SHA1.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be in a position to intercept or manipulate network traffic and present the victim with a certificate chain containing a vulnerable intermediate certificate. The attacker also needs a server with a certificate that chains to the malicious intermediate certificate. The attacker does not need user interaction and can exploit from a remote location.
