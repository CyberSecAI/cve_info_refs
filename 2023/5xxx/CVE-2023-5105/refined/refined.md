The provided content is related to CVE-2023-5105.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the file download logic of the "Frontend File Manager" plugin, allowing a user with "Editor+" privileges to bypass intended restrictions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Path traversal: The vulnerability is classified as a path traversal issue.
- Inadequate access control: The plugin fails to properly restrict access to file download functionality, allowing unauthorized access.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to download arbitrary files from the server, including sensitive files like `wp-config.php`.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves manipulating the `wpfm_dir_path` and `wpfm_file_url` parameters associated with a file entry within the plugin to point to a different file on the server.
- The attacker needs to have a role of Editor+ or higher to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the "Editor+" role or higher.
- The attacker needs to be able to create a new post with the `[ffmwp]` shortcode, and upload a file.
- The attacker needs to be able to access and modify plugin settings using the WordPress admin panel.
