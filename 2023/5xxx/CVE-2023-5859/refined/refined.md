Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2023-5859:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an "Incorrect security UI" within the Picture-in-Picture (PiP) feature of the Chromium browser. This indicates a flaw in how the user interface presents security-related information or permissions when using PiP mode.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Security UI:** The core weakness lies in the flawed design or implementation of the security UI related to PiP. This likely means that users are not adequately informed about the security implications of actions or are not presented with clear choices related to permissions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The provided information does not detail the exact impact, but based on the description as "Incorrect security UI", it could potentially lead to:
    *   **Bypassed security prompts:** A malicious website could use the flawed UI to trick the user into granting unintended permissions or making security-critical actions that would otherwise be blocked.
    *   **User confusion and security fatigue**: A poor security UI could result in users making choices that are not beneficial for their security.
    *   **Information disclosure**: While not explicitly stated, it is possible that an incorrect UI could leak information about the PiP context.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through a malicious website or web application that leverages the Picture-in-Picture feature in a way that exposes the flawed security UI.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to:
    *   Control a website or web application accessed by the victim.
    *   Use the PiP feature in a way that triggers the vulnerable security UI
*   The attacker does not require any special access other than a regular web server and the ability to craft content for it. The attack is possible from a remote location, as it uses web technologies, and no local access is required.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is rated as "low" severity by Chromium team and Fedora update.
*   This vulnerability has been addressed in Chromium version 119.0.6045.105, as well as 119.0.6045.123, and it is advisable to update to the latest versions to prevent exploitation.
*   The information is also available in the Red Hat Bugzilla entries and security advisories from Debian and Gentoo, confirming that it is a vulnerability that is generally known.

In summary, CVE-2023-5859 involves a flaw in how Chromium presents the security UI for its Picture-in-Picture mode, which an attacker can exploit via a malicious website. The severity is considered low.
