Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2023-5387:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a missing authorization check in the `fnsf_af2_trigger_dark_mode` function within the Funnelforms Free plugin. This function is responsible for enabling or disabling the dark mode setting of the plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Missing Authorization Check:** The primary vulnerability lies in the absence of a capability check before executing the `fnsf_af2_trigger_dark_mode` function. This allows unprivileged users to modify the plugin's dark mode setting.
*   **Insecure AJAX Endpoint:** The plugin uses an AJAX endpoint without properly validating user permissions, making the dark mode setting toggle vulnerable to unauthorized access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Modification of Data:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to change the plugin's dark mode settings without proper authorization.
*   **Limited Impact:** While the impact is not critical as it only involves toggling a plugin setting, it demonstrates a potential security flaw within the plugin which could be exploited for higher impact vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to have at least subscriber-level access to the WordPress site to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have a valid user account on the WordPress site with at least subscriber-level permissions.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the WordPress site.
*   **Technical Proficiency:** Some knowledge of how WordPress plugins and AJAX calls work is required to craft the necessary request.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability was patched in version 3.4.2 of the Funnelforms Free plugin.
*   The affected function is `fnsf_af2_trigger_dark_mode`, which can be triggered by sending a `POST` request to the WordPress AJAX endpoint with the action set to this function name and with the `state` parameter that can be `true` or `false`, which enables or disables dark mode respectively.
*   A nonce check was also missing for this request in versions <= 3.4, so no authentication validation was taking place.
