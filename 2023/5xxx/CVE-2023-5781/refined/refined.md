Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to the described vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability stemming from the direct concatenation of user-supplied input (`$DELETE_STR`) into a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, where malicious SQL code can be injected into the database query.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code fails to sanitize or validate the `$DELETE_STR` parameter before using it in the SQL query.
*   **Direct SQL Query Construction:** The vulnerability occurs because the code directly builds the SQL query by string concatenation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can potentially access, modify, or delete sensitive data stored in the database.
*   **Database Manipulation:** Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to unauthorized actions on the database.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  Attackers can extract database schema, table names, and data through blind SQL injection techniques, as demonstrated in the provided POC.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Parameter:** The attack vector is through the `$DELETE_STR` parameter within the `delete_webmail.php` script. The injection is achieved by manipulating this parameter in an HTTP request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web application.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to know about the vulnerable `delete_webmail.php` endpoint and the vulnerable parameter `$DELETE_STR`.
*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker must be able to manipulate HTTP request parameters to inject SQL code via the `$DELETE_STR` parameter.
*   **(Potentially) Ability to send crafted HTTP requests**: Based on the described attack vector, the attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests that reach the vulnerable endpoint.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Specific versions affected:** The vulnerability affects Tongda OA versions v2017 and below v11.10.
*   **Bypass Technique:** The attacker uses a bypass technique because of the presence of closed parentheses within the query structure.
*   **Blind SQL Injection:** The provided text describes how to use cartesian product blind SQL injection to extract information from the database.
*   **Time-Based Blind SQLi:** The attacker uses time-based blind SQL injection by injecting a payload to cause a delay if a condition is met to extract information from the database.
*  **Specific payload examples** The document included specific examples of payloads for identifying the first character of the database name.
