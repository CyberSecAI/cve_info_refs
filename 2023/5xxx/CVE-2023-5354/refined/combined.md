## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Awesome Support < 6.1.5 - Reflected Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape a parameter before outputting it back in the page, leading to a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting which could be used against high privilege users such as admin.

### Proof of Concept

Visit the following URL as an admin user, with any valid ticket ID. Press the access key combination to trigger XSS (e.g. Ctrl+Alt+X on Firefox on MacOS).
https://example.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=TICKET\_ID%22+accessKey%3DX+onclick%3Dalert%28%2Fxss%2F%29+%22&action=edit
