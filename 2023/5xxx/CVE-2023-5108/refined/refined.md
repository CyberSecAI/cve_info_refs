- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape a parameter (`nsl_id`) before using it in a SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection (SQLi) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or unauthorized access to the database.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious SQL query within the `nsl_id` parameter during the export to CSV process.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Requires a high-privilege user such as an administrator to initiate the export to CSV action and intercept the request to inject the malicious SQL.
