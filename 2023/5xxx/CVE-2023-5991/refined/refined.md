- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress plugins do not validate file paths provided via user input and lack proper CSRF and authorization checks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Path Traversal (CWE-22): Allows access to files and directories outside the intended directory.
    - Lack of authorization checks: Allows unauthenticated users to perform actions.
    - Missing CSRF protection: Enables attackers to perform unauthorized actions by tricking users.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Arbitrary File Download: Attackers can download sensitive files from the server.
    - Arbitrary File Deletion: Attackers can delete arbitrary files on the server.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - HTTP GET requests with specific parameters `filename` and `mphb_action`
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Unauthenticated user, no special privileges are required.
