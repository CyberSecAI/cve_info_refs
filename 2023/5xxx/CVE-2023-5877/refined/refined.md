{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin lacks authorization and authentication for requests to its affiliate-toolkit-starter/tools/atkp_imagereceiver.php endpoint.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Unauthenticated SSRF vulnerability due to missing authorization and authentication.",
    "Insufficient filtering of RFC1918 addresses.",
     "Hardcoded pathname for site key file.",
     "The site key file may be accessible by unauthenticated users."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Unauthenticated visitors can make requests to arbitrary URLs, including RFC1918 private addresses, leading to a Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) issue. This can be used to potentially access internal resources or trigger actions on the internal network.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a request to the vulnerable endpoint with a crafted 'image' and 'hash' parameter. The 'image' parameter contains the target URL (base64 encoded) and the 'hash' parameter is a calculated hash based on the image URL and a site key.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker does not require any authentication to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker must have knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint URL and the method to calculate the hash parameter, which can be determined from the plugin's source code."
