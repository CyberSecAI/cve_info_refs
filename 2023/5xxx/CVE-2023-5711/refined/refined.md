### CVE-2023-5711

Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check in the `sd_php_info()` function within the System Dashboard plugin for WordPress. This function is hooked via an AJAX action, and it fails to verify if the user has the necessary privileges to access it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authorization:** The core issue is the absence of a capability check before executing the `sd_php_info()` function. This allows unauthorized users to call it.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The `sd_php_info()` function outputs sensitive system information via PHP's `phpinfo()`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An authenticated attacker can gain access to sensitive system information that is normally restricted to administrators. This information can be used to further exploit the system, or gather information that could help them in other attacks

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **AJAX Action:** The vulnerability is exposed through an AJAX action hooked to the `sd_php_info()` function.
*   **Authenticated Access:** Attackers must be authenticated users to exploit this vulnerability, but they do not need to have administrator level access. Subscriber level access or higher is sufficient.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have an account on the WordPress site. Subscriber-level access is sufficient.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker can be remote.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in all versions of the System Dashboard plugin up to and including version 2.8.7.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 2.8.8.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Dmitrii Ignatyev - CleanTalk Inc.
