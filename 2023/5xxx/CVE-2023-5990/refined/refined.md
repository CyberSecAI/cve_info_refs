Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-5990:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection in the Funnelforms Free WordPress plugin. Specifically, the plugin's AJAX actions for deleting and duplicating forms are not protected against CSRF attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSRF:** The plugin fails to implement proper CSRF checks for form deletion and duplication actions. This allows a malicious actor to craft requests that, when triggered by an authenticated administrator, will perform unintended actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Form Manipulation:** Attackers can force a logged-in administrator to delete or duplicate forms within the plugin without their consent. This could lead to data loss, disruption of functionality, and potential manipulation of form data or user interactions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page containing a form with the specific parameters needed to trigger the delete or duplicate action.
- This malicious HTML page is delivered to a logged-in WordPress administrator (typically via a link, email, or other social engineering methods).
- When the administrator loads the malicious HTML in their browser, the hidden form is automatically submitted via javascript to the vulnerable AJAX endpoint.
- If the administrator has an active and valid session with the WordPress instance, the request executes and the targeted action (delete or duplicate) is performed by the plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to create HTML pages:** The attacker must be able to create and host a malicious HTML page containing the CSRF attack code.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in WordPress administrator into opening the malicious HTML page in their browser.
- **Target must be logged into WordPress:** The administrator must be logged into their WordPress admin panel. The CSRF attack relies on an authenticated session of the victim.

**Additional Details:**
- The specific AJAX endpoints vulnerable are `af2_fnsf_delete_posts` for deletion and `af2_fnsf_copy_posts` for duplication.
- The PoC provided shows how to create HTML pages that would delete or duplicate forms based on form ID using a hidden form and Javascript.
- The vulnerability is present in versions of Funnelforms Free prior to 3.4.2.
- The CVSS score is 4.3 (Medium), with the following metrics: AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N
