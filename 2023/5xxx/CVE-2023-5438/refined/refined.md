Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-5438

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of sufficient escaping on user-supplied parameters and insufficient preparation of the SQL query within the `wp image slideshow` plugin's shortcode functionality.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
* **SQL Injection:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-provided input passed through the shortcode, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the database queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation can allow attackers to extract sensitive information from the WordPress database.
* **Data Modification/Deletion:**  The SQL injection vulnerability may also allow attackers to modify or delete data within the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Shortcode:** The vulnerability is triggered through the plugin's shortcode functionality, which is used to display image slideshows.
* **Malicious Input:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code through the `type` attribute of the shortcode.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least subscriber-level privileges or higher.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerable code is located in the `wpis_shortcode` function within `wp-image-slideshow.php`.  Specifically, the code constructs a SQL query using user-supplied input from the shortcode's `type` attribute without proper sanitization.

```php
$wpis_type = $atts['type'];
//...
$sSql = "select wpis_path,wpis_link,wpis_target,wpis_title from ".WP_wpis_TABLE." where 1=1";
if($wpis_type <> ""){ $sSql = $sSql . " and wpis_type='".$wpis_type."'"; }
```

The fix involves using `$wpdb->prepare()` to properly sanitize the user-supplied value before incorporating it into the SQL query:

```php
if($wpis_type <> ""){
    $sSql = $sSql . " and wpis_type= %s ";
    $sSql = $wpdb->prepare($sSql, $wpis_type);
}
```
This change was introduced in version 12.1 of the plugin.

**Summary:** This vulnerability allows authenticated users to inject SQL queries into the database through the pluginâ€™s shortcode feature, potentially leading to data breaches and unauthorized modifications.
