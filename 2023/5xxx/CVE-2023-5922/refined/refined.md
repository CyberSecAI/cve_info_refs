  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin does not validate user permissions when accessing posts via an AJAX action (and REST endpoint, currently disabled in the plugin).",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR), Broken Access Control",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Unauthenticated users can access arbitrary draft, private, and password-protected posts/pages content.",
  "Attack vectors": "By sending a POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the action `wpr_get_page_content` and the `wpr_compare_page_id` parameter specifying the ID of the target post.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the WordPress site, and does not require authentication."
