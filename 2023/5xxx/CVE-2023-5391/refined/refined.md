- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Deserialization of untrusted data. The application does not properly validate data during deserialization, allowing an attacker to send a crafted packet containing malicious serialized data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data. This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious code by sending crafted serialized data to the application.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote code execution, allowing an attacker to gain access and/or control of the targeted system.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specifically crafted network packet to the vulnerable application. The attacker can do this remotely.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need any authentication or privileges to exploit the vulnerability. They only need to send a specially crafted network packet to the affected software.
