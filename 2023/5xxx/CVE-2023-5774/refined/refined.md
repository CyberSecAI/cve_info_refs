Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-5774:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the Animated Counters WordPress plugin's shortcode functionality.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user input before rendering it on the page. Specifically, attributes within the shortcode are vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into pages containing the vulnerable shortcode.
- This code executes whenever a user accesses the infected page.
- Successful exploitation allows attackers to:
    - Hijack user sessions.
    - Steal cookies.
    - Redirect users to malicious websites.
    - Perform other client-side attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the plugin's shortcode.
- An attacker includes malicious JavaScript within the shortcode attributes when creating or editing content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be an authenticated user on the WordPress site.
- Requires at least "Contributor" level permissions, which allows them to create/edit posts or pages and add shortcodes.

**Additional Notes**

- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.8 of the plugin.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Dmitrii Ignatyev from CleanTalk Inc.
- The fix involved replacing `stripslashes()` with `filter_var($atts[...], FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING)` for sanitization.
