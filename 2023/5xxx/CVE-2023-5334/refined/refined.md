Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the 'WP Responsive header image slider' plugin when processing the 'sp\_responsiveslider' shortcode attributes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied attributes in the `sp_responsiveslider` shortcode, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary web scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successfully injected malicious scripts will execute in the context of the victim's browser when they visit a page containing the vulnerable shortcode. This could result in:
    *   Data theft, session hijacking, or malicious redirects
    *   Unauthorized actions on the victim's behalf
    *   Defacement of the website
    *   Other malicious activities

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Shortcode Injection:** Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code through the attributes of the `sp_responsiveslider` shortcode.
*   **Stored XSS:** The injected script is stored in the database and executed whenever the page containing the shortcode is accessed by a user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated WordPress user with at least "Contributor" level privileges or higher. This is because contributor role allows creation of posts/pages which can include shortcodes.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability is present in versions of the plugin up to and including 3.2.1.
*   The provided code snippet from `responsive_headerimageslider.php` shows the shortcode handling function `sp_responsiveslider_shortcode` but does not include any sanitization of the attributes being used within the generated HTML.
