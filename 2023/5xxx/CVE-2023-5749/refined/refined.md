- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The EmbedPress plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape user input before outputting it on the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts that are then executed in the victim's browser, potentially leading to account compromise or other malicious actions. This is especially dangerous when high-privilege users, such as administrators, are targeted.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered when a logged-in user (e.g., an admin) opens a page containing crafted HTML code. This code includes a form that, upon submission, includes malicious JavaScript code in the `password` and `post_id` parameters within the `admin-ajax.php` request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to craft a specific HTML page or inject the HTML code into a page that a logged-in user will then visit. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the WordPress site.
