Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is due to an excessive memory consumption issue introduced in HashiCorp Vault Enterprise versions 1.15.0, 1.14.3, and 1.13.7.
- Inbound client requests triggering a policy check create a logger that is never removed from memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Unbounded memory consumption: The failure to remove the logger from memory on policy checks leads to a continuous increase in memory usage.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): A large number of requests that trigger policy checks will consume memory until the operating system triggers out-of-memory processes causing a DoS.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network requests: The vulnerability is triggered by inbound client requests to the Vault server.
- Policy checks: The requests need to trigger a policy check which causes the memory leak.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access: The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the Vault server.
- No special privileges are required as the vulnerability is triggered by any request that is processed against a policy.

**Additional Information:**
- This issue is more prevalent in Vault Enterprise.
- The memory growth is proportional to the volume of requests.
- NetApp products incorporate HashiCorp Vault Enterprise, but none of their products are affected by this vulnerability.

**Affected Versions:**
- HashiCorp Vault Enterprise versions: 1.15.0 prior to 1.15.2, 1.14.3 prior to 1.14.6, and 1.13.7 prior to 1.13.10.
