- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not validate a parameter (`url`) before making a request to it via `wp_remote_get()`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can make requests to internal or external resources that the server has access to, potentially leading to information disclosure, access to internal services, or denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: By sending a crafted URL parameter (`url`) to the vulnerable endpoint `http://example.com/index.php?fl_asst_image_proxy&url=<malicious_url>`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have a user role of Editor or above to exploit this vulnerability.
