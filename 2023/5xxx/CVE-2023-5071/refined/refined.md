Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-5071:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping when processing the attributes of the `sitekit_iframe` shortcode. Specifically, while the `src` attribute is sanitized using `esc_url()`, other attributes were not properly sanitized or escaped.
- Prior to version 1.5, the plugin did not remove attributes starting with 'on' (like `onload`, `onmouseover`, `onclick` etc.).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The plugin was vulnerable to stored XSS because arbitrary HTML attributes, including those containing malicious JavaScript, could be injected into the `<iframe>` tag through the `sitekit_iframe` shortcode attributes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into a page.
- When a user visits a page containing the injected iframe shortcode with malicious attributes, the attacker's script will be executed in the user's browser.
- This could allow the attacker to perform actions like stealing cookies, redirecting the user to malicious websites, or performing other malicious actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker leverages the `sitekit_iframe` shortcode.
- By injecting malicious attributes such as `onload` or other event handlers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site.
- **Ability to Create Content:** The attacker needs the capability to create or edit posts or pages.
- **Inject Shortcode:** The attacker needs to be able to use the `sitekit_iframe` shortcode within that content.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.5 by removing all attributes starting with `on` from the `<iframe>` tag.
- The fix was implemented by checking if the attribute starts with `on` using `strpos(strtolower($attr), 'on') !== 0` and excluding such attributes.
- The vulnerability was publicly disclosed on August 28, 2023.

This analysis aligns with the CVE description which states it's an Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting').
