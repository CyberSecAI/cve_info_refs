{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The libnbd library had a flaw in how it handled responses from an NBD server when using the 32-bit nbd_block_status() API with a server sending 64-bit extended headers. Specifically, when the server replied with a 64-bit flag, the 32-bit API caused an assertion failure leading to a crash instead of returning an error.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of server responses with 64-bit flags when using a 32-bit API.",
       "Lack of proper error handling, leading to an assertion failure."
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious NBD server could cause a denial of service (DoS) by crashing the libnbd client application.",
    "attack_vectors": "A malicious NBD server sends a 64-bit flag in response to a NBD_CMD_BLOCK_STATUS request, triggering an assertion failure and crash in libnbd client if it uses the 32-bit API.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to control or impersonate an NBD server to send the malicious response.",
	"additional_details": "The vulnerability is triggered by the client application using the 32-bit nbd_block_status() API when the server sends a 64-bit flag value. Using the 64-bit version of the API avoids the vulnerability, however the issue exists in versions after 1.17.4 of libnbd, prior to the patch. The issue is not triggered if the client connects to a known-good server using TLS."
