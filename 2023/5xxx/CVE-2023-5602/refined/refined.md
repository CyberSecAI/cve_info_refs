Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-5602

**Root Cause:** Missing or incorrect nonce validation in several AJAX action functions within the "Social Media Share Buttons & Social Sharing Icons" WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The plugin fails to properly validate nonces for several AJAX actions, allowing malicious requests to be processed.

**Impact of Exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker can potentially modify plugin settings or data by tricking an administrator into performing an action, such as clicking a malicious link. This could lead to unauthorized changes to the website configuration.

**Attack Vectors:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious request targeting one of the vulnerable AJAX actions. This crafted request is then delivered to an administrator, typically by convincing them to click a link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated on the target website.
- The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in administrator to perform an action like clicking a link, which then triggers the forged request.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects all versions of the plugin up to and including 2.8.5.
- The vulnerability was patched in version 2.8.6 by adding the missing nonce validation.
- The vulnerable functions include `sfsi_save_export`, `sfsi_installDate`, `sfsi_currentDate`, `sfsi_showNextBannerDate`, `sfsi_cycleDate`, `sfsi_loyaltyDate`, `sfsi_banner_global_pinterest`, `sfsi_banner_global_firsttime_offer`, `sfsi_banner_global_social`, `sfsi_banner_global_load_faster`, `sfsi_banner_global_shares`, `sfsi_banner_global_gdpr`, `sfsi_banner_global_http` and `sfsi_banner_global_upgrade`.
