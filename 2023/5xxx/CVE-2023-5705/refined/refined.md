Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the `vk_filter_search` shortcode in the VK Filter Search plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-provided input, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts that are stored in the database and executed when a user views the affected page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary web scripts within the context of a user's browser. This can lead to various malicious actions, including:
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Stealing session cookies or other sensitive information.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user.
    *   Defacing the website.
    *   Other malicious activities

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Shortcode Injection:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts via the `vk_filter_search` shortcode by including a crafted `class_name` attribute.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Contributor+ Access:** Attackers must have at least contributor-level privileges on the WordPress site to be able to create or edit posts/pages and inject the malicious shortcode.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerable code is located in the `class-vk-filter-search-shortcode.php` file, specifically in the `add_search_form_shortcode` function.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.3.2 of the plugin by implementing proper output escaping using `wp_kses()` on the shortcode output.
*   The specific vulnerable code is in the following line: `$form_before_html = '<form class="vk-filter-search vkfs' . $class_name . '" method="get" action="' . home_url( '/' ) . '">';`
*   The fix can be seen in this changeset: `https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/2983339/vk-filter-search#file1`
