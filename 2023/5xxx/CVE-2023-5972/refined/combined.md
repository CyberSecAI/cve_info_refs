| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2248189#c0)  Alex    2023-11-06 19:19:26 UTC  ``` Two similar flaws in the Linux Kernel found. From v6.2-rc1 to v6.6-rc6two null pointer dereference vulnerabilities in nf_tables could happen. The first vulnerability is in nft_inner_init() in nft_inner.c. The NFTA_INNER_NUM netlink attribute is accessed At (0) without checking its presence before, so it may be NULL。 The second vulnerability is in nft_expr_inner_parse(), which is quite similar to the first one. The NFTA_EXPR_NAME netlink attribute is not checked before accessing it.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2248189#c2)  Alex    2023-11-23 15:29:40 UTC  ``` Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2251249](show_bug.cgi?id=2251249 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2023-5972 kernel: The NFTA_INNER_NUM and NFTA_EXPR_NAME netlink attributes accessed without checking its presence in nft_inner.c [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2248189#c3)  Justin M. Forbes    2023-11-28 18:15:30 UTC  ``` This was fixed for Fedora with the 6.5.9 stable kernel updates.   ``` |  |
