Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-5368:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**

*   The provided content from `freebsd.org` and `dfir.ru` directly references `CVE-2023-5368` and discusses a vulnerability in the `msdosfs` driver, which is related to FAT file systems.
*   The content from `security.netapp.com` also mentions `CVE-2023-5368` and that multiple NetApp products incorporate FreeBSD.
*   Therefore, the content is **relevant** to the specified CVE.

**2. Vulnerability details:**

*   **Root cause:** When using the `truncate` or `ftruncate` system calls to extend a file's size on a `msdosfs` (FAT) file system, the additional space is populated with unallocated data from the underlying disk instead of zero bytes.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** The `msdosfs` driver incorrectly handles file truncation by exposing data from the disk that should have been zeroed, violating a POSIX requirement for increased file size to be filled with null bytes. Specifically, extending the file size within the boundary of a fileâ€™s last cluster will expose the slack space of that cluster.
*   **Impact:** A user with write access to files on a mounted msdosfs file system can read unintended data, potentially revealing previously deleted files or other sensitive information from the disk.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The vulnerability is triggered through the use of `truncate` or `ftruncate` system calls.
    *   An unprivileged user with write access to files on a mounted msdosfs file system can exploit this.
*   **Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker requires local access to the system.
    *   The attacker needs write permissions to a file on a mounted `msdosfs` file system.
    *   No network access is required for this attack.

**3. Additional technical details:**

*   The vulnerability specifically occurs when extending a file's size within the boundary of its last cluster, rather than when the driver allocates a new cluster to serve the file size increase.
*   The vulnerability also exists in OpenBSD.
*   The vulnerability is described as a data disclosure issue.

**4. Remediation:**
*   The vulnerability can be mitigated by upgrading to a patched version of FreeBSD.
*   The FreeBSD security advisory suggests using the `freebsd-update` utility for binary patching or applying source code patches and recompiling the kernel.
*  NetApp indicates that none of their products are affected.

**5. CVSS Score:**

*   The provided NetApp advisory includes a CVSS v3.1 score: 6.5 (Medium)
*   Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

This translates to:
    *   Attack Vector: Network
    *   Attack Complexity: Low
    *   Privileges Required: Low
    *   User Interaction: None
    *   Scope: Unchanged
    *   Confidentiality: High
    *   Integrity: None
