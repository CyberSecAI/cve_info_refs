- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress Backup & Migration plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape some user-controlled parameters.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin's settings, which can then be executed in the browsers of other users when they access the affected pages. This could lead to a variety of malicious activities, including stealing session cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or performing administrative actions on their behalf.
- **Attack vectors**: By sending a crafted POST request to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint with malicious JavaScript code embedded in the `settings_data[im_db_file_per_req]` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - In vulnerable versions prior to 1.4.4, a user with a role as low as 'Subscriber' can trigger the vulnerability.
    - In version 1.4.4, an administrative user must execute the exploit.
