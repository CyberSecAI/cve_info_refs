- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize the custom shipping phone field on the checkout form.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of a victim's browser when an administrator views the order details page in the WordPress admin panel. This could lead to session hijacking, account takeover, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker crafts a malicious payload and inserts it into the "telephone" field during the checkout process.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An unauthenticated attacker can place an order on the vulnerable WooCommerce site and insert the malicious payload. A victim needs to visit the order details page in the admin panel.
