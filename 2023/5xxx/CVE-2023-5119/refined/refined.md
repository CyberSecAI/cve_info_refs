The provided content is related to CVE-2023-5119.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The plugin does not properly sanitize the `redirect-url` field in the form submission settings.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of sanitization of user-supplied input in the `redirect-url` field.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker with high privileges (e.g., administrator) can inject arbitrary web scripts.
- The injected script will execute whenever anyone submits the form. This can lead to various malicious actions, such as:
    - Stealing user session cookies
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Performing actions on behalf of users
    - Defacing the website
    - Any other actions possible via client-side scripting

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs to have admin or other high-level privileges to access the Forminator form settings.
- The attacker modifies the "Redirect user to a URL" option in the after submission behavior by injecting malicious javascript in the redirect URL.
- The malicious script executes when any user submits the form.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attacker needs to be an administrator or a high-privileged user of the WordPress website.
- The attacker needs access to the Forminator plugin's settings page.
