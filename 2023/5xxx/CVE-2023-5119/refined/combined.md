## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Forminator and Forminator Pro < 1.27.0 - Admin+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not properly sanitize the redirect-url field in the form submission settings, which could allow high-privilege users such as an administrator to inject arbitrary web scripts even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in a multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

Select the "Redirect user to a URL" in the after submission behaviour, and use the following URL:
javascript:alert(document.domain)
The payload will trigger whenever anybody submits the form.

### Affects Plugins
