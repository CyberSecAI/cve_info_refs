  "CVE-2023-5822": {
    "description": "The Drag and Drop Multiple File Upload - Contact Form 7 plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to insufficient file type validation in the 'dnd_upload_cf7_upload' function in versions up to, and including, 1.3.7.3. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible. This can be exploited if a user authorized to edit form, which means editor privileges or above, has added a 'multiple file upload' form field with '*' acceptable file types.",
    "root_cause": "Insufficient file type validation in the `dnd_upload_cf7_upload` function.",
     "weaknesses": [
      "Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload",
      "Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type"
    ],
    "impact": "Unauthenticated attackers can upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server, potentially leading to remote code execution.",
    "attack_vector": "Network",
     "required_capabilities": "Unauthenticated access to the vulnerable endpoint.",
    "additional_information": "This vulnerability is triggered when a multiple file upload form field is configured to accept any file type ('*'). An attacker can upload any file, bypassing file type restrictions when using the vulnerable plugin."
