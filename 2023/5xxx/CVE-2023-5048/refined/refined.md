Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-5048

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the `id` attribute within the `Contact_Form_Builder` shortcode.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Attackers can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.
- These scripts execute when a user accesses the compromised page.
- This could lead to unauthorized actions, data theft, or further malicious activity within the victim's WordPress site.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerability is triggered through the `Contact_Form_Builder` shortcode.
- Specifically, the `id` attribute within the shortcode is vulnerable.
- Attackers inject malicious JavaScript code through this attribute.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- Authenticated attacker with Contributor level or higher permissions. This means the attacker needs to have an account on the WordPress site with at least contributor privileges to create or edit posts/pages.

**Technical Details from the Source Code:**

- The code snippet `'<form name="contactform'  .  $id  .  '" ... id="contactform'  .  $id  .  '" ... >'` from `CFMViewForm_maker.php` shows the vulnerable point where the `$id` variable is directly inserted into the HTML `id` attribute of the form tag, without proper sanitization or escaping.

**Additional Notes:**

- The Wordfence article mentions that there's no known patch available for this vulnerability, suggesting that users should take mitigation steps, including potentially uninstalling the plugin.
- The Wordfence Intelligence Vulnerability Database API can be used to query and utilize this vulnerability data.

The provided information indicates that this is a Stored XSS vulnerability due to a lack of sanitization of the `id` parameter, in a shortcode, making it possible for authenticated users with contributor permissions to inject arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the web application.
