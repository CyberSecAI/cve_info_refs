Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The History Log by click5 plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape a parameter (`source_id`) before using it in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The lack of sanitization of the `source_id` parameter allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query.
- **Time-Based Blind SQL Injection:** The vulnerability is a blind SQL injection, meaning the attacker does not get direct output from the database but can infer information based on the time taken by the query to execute, using functions like `SLEEP()`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Exposure:** While the provided Proof of Concept demonstrates a time-based blind SQL injection, a successful exploit could allow an attacker to extract sensitive data from the database.
- **Potential Data Manipulation/Deletion:**  The attacker could potentially modify or delete data within the database.
- **Compromise of the Application:** The attacker could gain control of the database and potentially the application, depending on the database user privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered via an AJAX request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php`.
- **`source_id` Parameter:** The vulnerable parameter is `source_id`, which is sent as part of the POST request's form data.
- **`wp_ajax_sbi_feed_saver_manager_delete_source` action hook:** The AJAX request uses the `sbi_feed_saver_manager_delete_source` action hook.
- **`click5_sbi_instagram_delete_source` Function:** The SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `click5_sbi_instagram_delete_source` function of the History Log plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Admin Access:** The attacker needs administrative privileges to access the relevant functionality within WordPress to exploit this vulnerability (as indicated by "Admin+ Time-Based Blind SQL Injection" in the title).
- **Interaction with Smash Balloon Social Photo Feed Plugin:** The attacker needs to have the Smash Balloon Social Photo Feed plugin installed and configured as the vulnerable code is executed when interacting with that plugin's features.
- **Ability to Send HTTP POST Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to craft and send HTTP POST requests to the target WordPress instance.

**Additional Notes:**
- **Fixed in Version 1.0.13:** The vulnerability is stated as fixed in version 1.0.13 of the History Log by click5 plugin.
- **OWASP A1: Injection:** The vulnerability is classified under OWASP's top 10 for "Injection" vulnerabilities, which is a category for vulnerabilities arising from injecting malicious code into an application.
- **CWE-89:** The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) ID associated with the vulnerability is CWE-89 which relates to Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection').
- **CVSS Score:** The CVSS score of 4.1 (Medium) highlights the moderate severity of the vulnerability based on the identified characteristics.
