Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause is the direct concatenation of the `$PLAN_ID` parameter into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The code is vulnerable to SQL injection because it directly incorporates user-supplied data into an SQL query. Specifically, the `$PLAN_ID` parameter is concatenated without any checks or escaping.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database compromise:** An attacker could manipulate SQL queries. This allows them to potentially retrieve sensitive data, modify or delete data, or even gain control of the database server itself. The included screenshot demonstrates a time-based injection which indicates an ability to read data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The attacker manipulates the `$PLAN_ID` parameter in an HTTP request sent to the `general/hr/recruit/plan/delete.php` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable endpoint. This usually involves sending a web request to a target web server hosting the affected application.
- No authentication information is mentioned in the provided text, so it is unclear whether an attacker would need to have an authenticated session or not.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in Access OA version v11.10 or earlier.
- The vulnerable code is in `general/hr/recruit/plan/delete.php`.
- The vulnerability is due to a lack of sanitization and parameterization of the `$PLAN_ID` parameter.
- The provided PoC uses a time-based blind SQL injection technique and it aims to verify the SQL injection vulnerability through the `DATABASE()` function.
- The code is vulnerable due to the direct concatenation of the parameter in the SQL statement, and the parenthesis closure can be bypassed.
