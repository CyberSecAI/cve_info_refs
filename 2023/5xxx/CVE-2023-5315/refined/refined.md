- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient escaping of user-supplied parameters and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query. Specifically, the plugin's shortcode allows for SQL injection due to a lack of proper sanitization and escaping of the input parameters within the SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database by appending additional SQL queries.
- **Attack vectors**: By exploiting the plugin's shortcode, authenticated users (with subscriber-level or higher permissions) can inject malicious SQL code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be an authenticated user with subscriber-level permissions or higher.
