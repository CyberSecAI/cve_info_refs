- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient input validation in the `prohibited_branch_checks` method, specifically the failure to block branch names containing `_/` which allowed bypassing previous fixes related to malicious branch names.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the ability to create a branch with a specific name pattern `_/main`, leading to inconsistencies between the repository content displayed in the UI and the content that is cloned.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can manipulate the repository content that users see in the UI to display safe content, while the actual repository clone will contain malicious code. This could lead to supply chain attacks or other security issues by tricking users into trusting malicious repositories.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is carried out by creating a branch with a specifically crafted name pattern which bypasses the existing security measures and allows for injection of malicious code into the repository.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have write access to the repository in order to create and push the malicious branch. They also need to be able to create or modify the default branch for the project.
