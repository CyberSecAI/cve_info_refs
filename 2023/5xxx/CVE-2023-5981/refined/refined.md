Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2023-5981:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The root cause is a timing side-channel vulnerability in the RSA-PSK key exchange within the GnuTLS library. This vulnerability exists because the response times to malformed ciphertexts in the RSA-PSK ClientKeyExchange differ from the response times of ciphertexts with correct PKCS#1 v1.5 padding.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Timing Side-Channel:** The vulnerability arises from the fact that the time taken to process different RSA-PSK ciphertexts varies based on whether they are correctly padded or malformed. This timing difference can be observed by an attacker.
*   **Incomplete Fix:** A previous fix for this vulnerability was found to be incomplete, leaving the timing side-channel still exploitable (as indicated by CVE-2024-0553).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Leakage:** An attacker can potentially observe the timing differences and use that information to deduce sensitive information, potentially leading to the leakage of sensitive data.
*   **Bypass authentication:** In the context of TLS 1.3 with session tickets, a MitM attacker could bypass authentication and decrypt older conversations. In TLS 1.2, the same attack is possible with session resumption, which is still widely used.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network-Based:** The attack can be performed remotely via network traffic.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle:** A man-in-the-middle attacker is required to observe and manipulate the ciphertext.
*   **Malicious Server:**  A hostile server can also exploit this vulnerability in the client.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** An attacker must have the ability to intercept and manipulate TLS network traffic between the client and server.
*   **Timing Measurements:**  The attacker must be capable of precisely measuring the timing differences in the responses from the server.
*   **MitM Position:** The attacker must be in a position to act as a man-in-the-middle.
*   **Knowledge of Messages:** An attacker needs to observe a few hundred to a few thousand signatures of known messages.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is described as a "moderate" severity by Red Hat Product Security.
*   The issue primarily affects the TLS ciphertext processing during RSA-PSK key exchange.
*   The fix was initially included in GnuTLS version 3.8.2 but found to be incomplete, requiring further patching in later versions.
*   Red Hat Security Advisories (RHSAs) like RHSA-2024:0319, RHSA-2024:0399, RHSA-2024:0451, and RHSA-2024:0533 address this vulnerability in Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

This extracted information is more detailed than the official CVE description which only states that it is a timing side-channel in the RSA-PSK authentication.
