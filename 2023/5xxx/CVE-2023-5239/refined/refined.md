- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin retrieves client IP addresses from HTTP headers, including `X-Forwarded-For`, which can be easily manipulated by an attacker.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: IP spoofing vulnerability, where the plugin uses client-provided headers to determine IP addresses instead of relying on the server-provided source IP.
- **Impact of exploitation**: By spoofing their IP address, attackers can bypass brute-force protection mechanisms that rely on IP blocking.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by sending HTTP requests with a forged `X-Forwarded-For` header, which the plugin uses to determine client IP address.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the WordPress site. They do not need any special privileges or a user account.
