- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Non-image attachments in confidential issues, epics, and merge requests were accessible without authentication, unlike the content of the items themselves.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Inadequate access control for file attachments associated with confidential issues, epics, and merge requests.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exposure of sensitive information contained within attachments to unauthorized users, potentially leading to security risks.
- **Attack vectors:** Accessing the file attachments directly through their URLs, without needing to authenticate to view the confidential items.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to know or guess the URL of the attachment. The attacker does not require to be authenticated or be a member of the project to access the attachments.
