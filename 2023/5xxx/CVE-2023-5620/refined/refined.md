- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when saving certain plugin options, allowing unauthenticated users to inject malicious JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The plugin allows unauthenticated users to modify certain settings using the `admin-post.php` endpoint, which is then displayed to administrators when they browse related settings pages.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of an administrator's browser session when the admin views the vulnerable settings page. This can lead to account compromise or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:**  An unauthenticated user can send a crafted POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-post.php` with malicious JavaScript in specific parameter values.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker only needs network access to the WordPress site. They do not need any prior authentication or privileges.
