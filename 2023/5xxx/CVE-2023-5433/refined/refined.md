The provided content relates to CVE-2023-5433.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient escaping of user-supplied parameters and a lack of proper preparation in existing SQL queries within the Message Ticker WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability via the plugin's shortcode.
- Insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input.
- Lack of proper preparation of SQL queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows authenticated attackers (with subscriber-level permissions or higher) to inject malicious SQL queries into the existing queries. This could be leveraged to:
- Extract sensitive information from the database.
- Potentially modify or delete data within the database, leading to complete compromise of the WordPress site.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `message-ticker` shortcode, specifically the `group` attribute.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be an authenticated user with subscriber-level permissions or higher on the target WordPress site.
- The attacker needs to be able to insert shortcodes into the content of a page or post.
