Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The `CITS Support svg, webp Media and TTF,OTF File Upload` WordPress plugin does not properly sanitize uploaded SVG files. This allows for the inclusion of malicious code within the SVG file.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** The plugin is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Specifically, the lack of sanitization on uploaded SVG files allows for the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute malicious JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers when they view the uploaded SVG. This can lead to various impacts, such as session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement, or redirection to malicious websites.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves uploading a specially crafted SVG file containing an XSS payload to the WordPress media library.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker with the Author role or higher can upload files. This allows the attacker to upload the malicious SVG.

**Technical Details**
The provided proof of concept shows an example of an SVG file with an embedded Javascript alert:
```
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
<polygon id="triangle" points="0,0 0,50 50,0" fill="#009900" stroke="#004400"/>
<script type="text/javascript">alert("xss");</script>
</svg>
```
When a user views this file, the javascript will be executed.
