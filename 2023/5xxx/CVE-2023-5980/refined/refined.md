- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings. Specifically, the plugin allows high privilege users, such as administrators, to input unescaped data into plugin settings which is then rendered in the administrative dashboard.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The lack of proper sanitization and escaping of user-supplied input in the plugin settings leads to this vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to actions such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirection.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker needs to have administrative access to the WordPress dashboard. The attacker then inputs malicious JavaScript code in the plugin settings (e.g., in the "Blacklist" item name), which will then be stored and executed when that part of the admin dashboard is loaded.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker must have administrator-level access to the WordPress site to modify the plugin settings.
