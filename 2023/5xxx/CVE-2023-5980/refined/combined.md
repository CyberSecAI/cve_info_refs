## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# BSK Forms Blacklist < 3.7 - Admin+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

1. In the plugin settings (ex: "Blacklist"), add a new item with the list name: "><script>alert(1)</script>
2. Save the item and see the XSS.
