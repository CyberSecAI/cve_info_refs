Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2023-5059:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing DICOM files in Sante FFT Imaging software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-Bounds Read (CWE-125):** The software does not properly validate the data from DICOM files, leading to an out-of-bounds read. This occurs when the program attempts to access memory locations outside the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially read sensitive information from memory.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker could execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process. This allows them to take control of the system or perform other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered by processing specially crafted DICOM files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The vulnerability is not exploitable remotely. An attacker needs to have local access to the system running the vulnerable software and be able to provide a malicious DICOM file.
*   **User Interaction:** The user must open or process a malicious DICOM file.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Products:** Sante FFT Imaging versions v1.4.0 and prior
*   **CVSS Score:** 7.8 (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
*   **Mitigation:** The vendor has released an updated version (v1.4.1) that addresses the vulnerability.
*  **Researcher:** Michael Heinzl reported this vulnerability to CISA.
