Root cause of vulnerability: Insufficient permission check in the wpas_edit_reply function.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The plugin does not correctly authorize the wpas_edit_reply function, allowing users to edit posts for which they do not have permission. This is a broken access control vulnerability.

Impact of exploitation: An attacker can edit posts they shouldn't have access to.

Attack vectors: An attacker can send a POST request to /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php with the action wpas_edit_reply and a chosen reply_id, along with desired reply content, even with a low-privileged account like a subscriber.

Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to have a valid account on the vulnerable WordPress site (e.g., a subscriber account). They can then exploit the vulnerability by sending a crafted POST request to the server.
