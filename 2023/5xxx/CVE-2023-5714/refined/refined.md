Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-5714:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content from Wordfence directly references CVE-2023-5714 and describes a vulnerability in the "System Dashboard" plugin. The description provided by Wordfence aligns with the vulnerability information as it concerns missing authorization in the `sd_db_specs()` function, which is a detail that is also evident in the provided source code. This confirms the relevance of the content to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of the Vulnerability:**
   - The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check on the `sd_db_specs()` function within the System Dashboard plugin. This function retrieves database key specifications.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    - **Missing Authorization:** The core weakness is the lack of a proper capability check before executing the `sd_db_specs()` function. This means any authenticated user, even with low-level permissions (such as a subscriber), can trigger this function.
    - **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability allows unauthorized access to sensitive database schema information.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

    - **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can retrieve database key specifications by exploiting this vulnerability.
        -  This can give them insight into the structure of the database.
        - This information can be potentially used to identify more vulnerable code, find SQL injection points, understand data storage patterns, or obtain sensitive data with additional exploitation techniques.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
    - The attack vector is through an AJAX call to the vulnerable `sd_db_specs()` function. The Wordfence report mentions "AJAX action", which the source code confirms is a hook for `wp_ajax_sd_db_specs`, without the permission check.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    - **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated WordPress user with at least subscriber-level access. This means anyone with a basic account on the affected WordPress site can exploit this vulnerability, making it low barrier to entry.
    - **Network Access:** The attack occurs through network requests to the WordPress site.

**Additional Information from the Content**

*   The provided code from `class-system-dashboard-admin.php` confirms the existence of the `sd_db_specs` function at line 474 and shows its call via an AJAX endpoint without authorization check.
*   The Wordfence description provides information about the plugin version affected (`<= 2.8.7`) and the fixed version (`2.8.8`).
*   Wordfence provides additional context about the vulnerability (missing authorization).
*   Wordfence specifies the CVE vector as CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N

In summary, the content provides relevant details about CVE-2023-5714. The root cause is a missing authorization check, allowing low-privileged authenticated users to access database key specification data via a public AJAX endpoint. This can have security implications by allowing an attacker to learn sensitive information about the database structure and open the door to further compromise.
