YSAR-23-0003: Denial-of-Service Vulnerability in STARDOM

Overview:
A denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability has been found in STARDOM. Yokogawa has identified the
range of affected products in this report.
Review the report and confirm which products are affected to implement security measures for the
overall systems. Please consider applying the countermeasures as needed.

Affected Products:

• STARDOM FCN/FCJ R1.01 - R4.31

Vulnerability:
This vulnerability may allow to a remote attacker to cause a denial-of-service condition to the FCN/FCJ
controller by sending a crafted packet. While sending the packet, the maintenance homepage of the
controller could not be accessed. Therefore, functions of the maintenance homepage, changing
configuration, viewing logs, etc. are not available. But the controller’s operation is not stopped by the
condition.

• Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400)

CVE-2023-5915
CVSS v3 Base score: 5.3
CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L

Countermeasures:
Please apply the following mitigations. A patch software for the vulnerability is not provided.

• By using the packet filter function* of the FCN/FCJ controller, only allow connection from trusted hosts.
• Take measures against the network so that an attacker cannot send a malicious packet.

Yokogawa strongly recommends all customers to establish and maintain a full security program, not only for
the vulnerability identified in this YSAR. Security program components are: Patch updates, Anti-virus,
Backup and recovery, zoning, hardening, whitelisting, firewall, etc. Yokogawa can assist in setting up and
running the security program continuously. For considering the most effective risk mitigation plan, as a
starting point, Yokogawa can perform a security risk assessment.

Patching is by far the best protection against this vulnerability being exploited, but if for example for
operational reason, patching is not possible. Yokogawa specialist can consult on the best course of action.

* Revision up FCN/FCJ basic software to R4.20 or later for using the function.
When Yokogawa service personnel perform revision up, those charges are borne by the customer.

1.  Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

https://www.first.org/cvss/
CVSS is a common language for scoring IT vulnerabilities independent from any vendors.  It
provides an open framework for communicating the characteristics and impacts of IT vulnerabilities,
scaling it in numeric scores.
The CVSS scores described in this report are provided “AS IS.”  Yokogawa has no guarantee over
the scores, and the severity caused by the vulnerabilities have to be judged by the users
considering the security measures equipped with the overall systems.

This vulnerability may allow to a remote attacker to cause a denial-of-service condition to the FCN/FCJ controller by sending a crafted packet. While sending the packet, the maintenance homepage of the controller could not be accessed. Therefore, functions of the maintenance homepage, changing configuration, viewing logs, etc. are not available. But the controller's operation is not stopped by the condition.

### 3.4 RESEARCHER

Roman Ezhov of Kaspersky reported this vulnerability to Yokogawa.

## 4. MITIGATIONS

Yokogawa has released the following mitigations for users to implement:

* By using the packet filter function\* of the FCN/FCJ controller, only allow connection from trusted hosts.
* Take measures against the network so that an attacker cannot send a malicious packet.

Yokogawa strongly recommends all users to establish and maintain a full security program, not only for the vulnerability identified in this YSAR. Security program components are: Patch updates, Anti-virus, Backup and recovery, zoning, hardening, whitelisting, firewall, etc. Yokogawa can assist in setting up and running the security program continuously. For considering the most effective risk mitigation plan, as a starting point, Yokogawa can perform a security risk assessment.

\*Revision up FCN/FCJ basic software to R4.20 or later for using the function.

More details can also be found in Yokogawa's security advisory report number [YSAR-23-0003.](https://web-material3.yokogawa.com/1/35463/files/YSAR-23-0003-E.pdf)

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are [not accessible from the internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.
* When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/ics-recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems). Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for [proactive defense of ICS assets](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Cybersecurity_Best_Practices_for_Industrial_Control_Systems.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems) in the technical information paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time.
