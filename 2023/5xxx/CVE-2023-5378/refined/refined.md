Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-5378

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is improper neutralization of input during web page generation, leading to a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This means that user-provided data is not properly sanitized before being displayed on a web page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored XSS (Cross-site Scripting):** The primary vulnerability is a Stored XSS. This type of vulnerability occurs when malicious scripts are injected and stored within the application's database or file system. The scripts are then executed when a user visits the affected page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the vulnerable application.
- **Privilege Escalation:** A successful exploit can lead to the creation of a new administrator account.
- **Full Website Compromise:** With a new administrator account, an attacker can gain complete control over the website.
- **Data Theft/Manipulation:** The attacker may potentially steal sensitive data or modify data on the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Non-authenticated User:** The vulnerability can be exploited by any non-registered user, if they know the administrative panel address.
- **Malicious Script Injection:** An attacker injects malicious code into the application through an unspecified input field of the administrative panel, likely within content/data management areas of the CMS.
- **Administrator Browser Execution:** The injected malicious script is executed within the browser of an administrator when they visit the affected part of the website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Knowledge of Admin Panel:** The attacker needs to know the address of the administrative panel.
- **Ability to Inject Script:** The attacker must be able to insert the malicious script into an input field that is not properly sanitized.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability does not require any authentication, meaning a non-registered user can exploit it.

**Affected Software:**
- **SmodBIP:** All versions are vulnerable.
- **MegaBIP:** All versions up to and including 4.36.2 are vulnerable.
- It is also noted that MegaBIP 5.08 was tested and found not vulnerable.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by CERT Polska during their own research.
- The vulnerability is present in both MegaBIP (currently maintained) and SmodBIP (out-of-support) CMS software.
- SmodBIP is no longer supported and has known issues with new servers and changing regulations. Users of SmodBIP are advised to migrate to MegaBIP.
