- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) checks on some of its admin pages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability, allowing an attacker to trick a logged-in administrator into performing unwanted actions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can make a logged-in admin delete all products in the plugin's catalog.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL that, when accessed by a logged-in admin, triggers the deletion of all products.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into accessing the malicious URL. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
