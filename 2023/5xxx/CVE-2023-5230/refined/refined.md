- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes when using the `tm_woo_wishlist_table` shortcode.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages that will execute when a user accesses the injected page. This could lead to various malicious activities such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker with contributor-level permissions or higher can inject malicious scripts by including them in the attributes of the `tm_woo_wishlist_table` shortcode.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least contributor-level permissions to insert malicious shortcodes into pages.
