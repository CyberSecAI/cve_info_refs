The provided content is related to CVE-2023-5340.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin unserializes user input via an AJAX action available to unauthenticated users. This allows for PHP Object Injection if a suitable gadget is present on the blog.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unauthenticated PHP Object Injection via insecure deserialization.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution by injecting malicious objects.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the `action` parameter set to `fdm_update_cart_item` and the malicious serialized payload in the `options` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to send a crafted POST request to the vulnerable endpoint; no authentication is required.
