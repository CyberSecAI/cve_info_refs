- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin allows uploading files with the "phar" extension, which can contain malicious PHP code. This, combined with the ability to directly access the uploaded file via a URL, allows for Remote Code Execution (RCE).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unrestricted file upload, specifically allowing the "phar" extension and direct access to uploaded files via URL, leading to insecure code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server with the same permissions as the web server user, potentially leading to full compromise of the server.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote, over the web interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have at least Author-level privileges in the WordPress instance, allowing them to upload files via the plugin's interface. The attacker needs to be able to access the WordPress site and its file system.
