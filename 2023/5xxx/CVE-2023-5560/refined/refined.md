- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize and escape the `X-Forwarded-For` header before outputting its content on the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the page that will be executed by a high-privileged user when they visit the `/wp-admin/index.php?page=useronline` page. This can lead to the attacker taking over the administrator account and the website.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted HTTP request with a malicious script in the `X-Forwarded-For` header.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An unauthenticated user can trigger the vulnerability. The attack requires a high-privileged user to visit a specific page in the admin panel.
