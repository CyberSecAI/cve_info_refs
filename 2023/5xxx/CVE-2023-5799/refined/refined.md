- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin lacks proper authorization checks when deleting a package, allowing users with the "Contributor" role and above to delete posts that do not belong to them.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Incorrect authorization, broken access control.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary post deletion, which can lead to loss of data and potentially disrupt the functionality of the website.
- **Attack vectors:** An authenticated user with Contributor role or higher can send a crafted POST request to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint, with the `action` parameter set to `tp_extra_package_remove`, the `package_id` set to the ID of the post to be deleted, and a valid nonce.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have a WordPress user account with at least "Contributor" role privileges.
