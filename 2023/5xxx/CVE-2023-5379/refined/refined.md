  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "When an AJP request exceeds the `max-header-size` attribute in the `ajp-listener`, JBoss EAP closes the TCP connection without returning an AJP response.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of AJP requests exceeding `max-header-size` leading to connection closure without response.",
      "mod_proxy_cluster marks JBoss EAP as an error worker when the connection is closed by backend without an AJP response, ceasing further forwarding."
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious user can repeatedly send requests exceeding the `max-header-size`, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The JBoss EAP instance will be marked as an error worker and stop forwarding requests.",

      "Sending crafted AJP requests that exceed the configured `max-header-size`."
    ],
