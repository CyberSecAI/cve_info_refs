Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** File Upload Vulnerability

**Root Cause:** The Byzro Networks Smart S45F multi-service security gateway intelligent management platform has an unrestricted file upload vulnerability within the `/useratte/userattestation.php` endpoint.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Unrestricted File Upload:** The application does not properly validate or sanitize uploaded files, allowing an attacker to upload arbitrary files, including executable code.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The vulnerability exists in the `/useratte/userattestation.php` page. The file upload form does not properly validate user inputs, including the `web_img` field, which allows for the upload of arbitrary file types.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Server Compromise:** By uploading malicious files, attackers can gain the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server.
- **Business Impact:** This could lead to a complete compromise of the system, potentially affecting business operations and data integrity.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is exploited using a POST request to `/useratte/userattestation.php`.
- **Multipart Form Data:** The attack uses a multipart/form-data request to upload the malicious file.
- **Filename:** The uploaded file is named `1.php`, suggesting the attacker is attempting to execute PHP code.
- **Web Interface:** The attack is performed through a vulnerable web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable device at the IP address `103.121.164.62:8443`.
- **Credentials:** The attacker needs the default administrator credentials, which are `admin/admin`.
- **Ability to Craft HTTP Request:** The attacker needs to be able to construct a crafted HTTP POST request containing the malicious payload.
- **Browser or similar tool:** The attacker needs a browser or a tool to send crafted requests.

**Additional Details:**

- The provided PoC (Proof of Concept) demonstrates how an attacker can upload a PHP file containing `<?php phpinfo()?>`, which, if executed on the server, would reveal server configuration information. The PoC shows how to bypass the authentication and upload a file.
- The provided screenshots confirm successful upload and subsequent access to the uploaded file through the URL `<https://103.121.164.62:8443/upload/2.php>`.

**Summary:**

This content provides detailed information about a file upload vulnerability in the Byzro Networks Smart S45F device. It goes beyond the basic description in a standard CVE by including a detailed PoC, including the vulnerable path, HTTP request details, and screenshots of successful exploitation.
