- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `le_ecred_reconf_req` function in the L2CAP (Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol) component of Zephyr RTOS. The vulnerability arises because the function calculates `chan_count` based on the length of the input buffer (`buf->len`) without proper validation against the maximum allowed channels (`L2CAP_ECRED_CHAN_MAX_PER_REQ`).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - **Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121)**: The `chans` array, located on the stack, is accessed based on the `chan_count` value. If `chan_count` exceeds the maximum allowed number of channels, it leads to an out-of-bounds write, corrupting adjacent stack memory.
    - **Out-of-bounds write**: Writing to memory outside the allocated buffer of `chans` array when `chan_count > L2CAP_ECRED_CHAN_MAX_PER_REQ`.
    - **Lack of proper input validation**: The function does not properly check the length of the input buffer (`buf->len`) against the maximum allowed channels, allowing the `chan_count` to potentially exceed the maximum limit.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - **Arbitrary code execution**: By overflowing the stack, an attacker could potentially overwrite return addresses or other critical data, leading to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the Bluetooth stack.
    - **Denial of Service (DoS)**: The overflow could lead to a crash of the Bluetooth stack, making the device unable to communicate over Bluetooth.
    - **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability impact**: The vulnerability can cause a loss of confidentiality (Low), a high impact on data integrity, and a high impact on the system's availability.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - **Adjacent Network**: An attacker needs to be within the Bluetooth communication range of the vulnerable device to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - An attacker needs to be within Bluetooth range of the vulnerable device.
    - The attacker needs to be able to send a specifically crafted L2CAP Enhanced Credit Based Flow Control Reconfiguration Request (`le_ecred_reconf_req`) that contains a crafted buffer length that would trigger the overflow.
    - The attacker does not require any user interaction or privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
