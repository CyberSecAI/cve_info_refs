- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WPB Show Core WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) due to the lack of proper input validation on the `path` parameter in the `download-file.php` script.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can force the server to make requests to arbitrary URLs, potentially leading to internal network scanning, accessing internal services, or retrieving sensitive data from other servers. In the provided example, an attacker could potentially retrieve AWS metadata.
- **Attack vectors:** By sending a GET request to the `wpb-show-core/download-file.php` endpoint with a crafted `path` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need authentication to exploit this vulnerability.
