{
  "Title": "Improper Path Sanitization in JSON Datasource Plugin",
  "CVE ID": "CVE-2023-5123",
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Inadequate sanitization of the dashboard-supplied path parameter in the JSON datasource plugin.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Path traversal vulnerability"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include path traversal characters (../) in the path parameter, leading to requests to paths outside the configured sub-path on the configured endpoint. If the plugin is configured to point back at the Grafana instance itself, it can lead to privilege escalation by compelling an administrator to make requests to Grafana administrative API endpoints with their credentials.",
  "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the path parameter in a dashboard query, an attacker can send requests to unauthorized locations on the configured endpoint.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be an editor of a Grafana dashboard and be able to create a dashboard referencing the vulnerable datasource and include path traversal characters in the query. If the datasource is configured to point back to the Grafana instance itself, an administrator viewing a malicious dashboard panel can be compromised."
