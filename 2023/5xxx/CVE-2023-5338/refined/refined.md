- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes within shortcodes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Authenticated attackers with contributor-level permissions or higher can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. These scripts will execute whenever a user accesses the injected page, potentially leading to malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation occurs through the use of vulnerable shortcodes in the Theme Blvd Shortcodes plugin. Attackers inject malicious scripts as shortcode attributes.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Attackers must be authenticated with contributor-level or higher permissions within the WordPress site.
