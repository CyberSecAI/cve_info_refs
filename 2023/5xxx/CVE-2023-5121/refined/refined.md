Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-5121

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the backup path parameter within the admin settings of the "Migration, Backup, Staging – WPvivid" plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when setting the backup path, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin's settings. This code will be stored in the database and executed whenever a user views the relevant settings pages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that will execute in the browsers of other users who access the affected pages.
*   **Data Theft:** The scripts could potentially steal session cookies or other sensitive information.
*   **Account Takeover:** In some cases, XSS can be used to perform actions on behalf of the user, potentially leading to privilege escalation and account takeover.
*   **Website Defacement:** The scripts could be used to deface the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited through the WordPress administrative interface, specifically by modifying the backup path setting within the WPvivid plugin's configuration.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker must be authenticated as a WordPress administrator or higher level user.
*   **Access to Settings:** The attacker must have access to modify the settings of the WPvivid plugin.
*   **Multi-site or unfiltered_html disabled:** The vulnerability is limited to multi-site installations or installations with the 'unfiltered_html' capability disabled.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability exists in versions of the "Migration, Backup, Staging – WPvivid" plugin up to and including 0.9.89.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 0.9.90.
*   The provided patch notes show changes to multiple files, which includes a change in the plugin version number, admin scripts, display, core backup and restore functions, upload cleaner settings, etc.
*   The patch includes changes to how the plugin handles zero dates (0000-00-00) in the database to avoid issues when restoring the database on servers that do not allow zero dates.
