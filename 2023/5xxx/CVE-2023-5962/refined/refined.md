Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2023-5962:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the "Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm" (CWE-327).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the use of a weak cryptographic algorithm within the ioLogik E1200 Series web server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can potentially gain unexpected authorization by exploiting this cryptographic flaw. This can lead to a compromise of the confidentiality of sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is network-based (AV:N) and requires low privileges (PR:L), meaning the attacker needs to have some level of access to the system but does not need to be a highly privileged user.
* The attack does not require user interaction.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs to be on the network and have some level of access to the vulnerable device.
*   The attacker does not need to trick a user into taking any action, as indicated by the low UI (User Interaction) score.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The affected products are the ioLogik E1200 Series with firmware version v3.3 and prior.
*   The vulnerability is remotely exploitable but requires some level of access, unlike CVE-2023-5961 which is remotely exploitable without requiring prior authorization.
*   The CVSS v3.1 score for this vulnerability is 6.5, which is considered a medium-severity vulnerability.
*   Moxa recommends contacting their technical support for the security patch.

**In summary, CVE-2023-5962 involves a weak cryptographic algorithm in Moxa's ioLogik E1200 series that allows an attacker with some level of network access to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data.**
