The provided content is related to CVE-2023-5141.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The plugin does not sanitize and escape the `inserted_count` parameter before outputting it back in the page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists due to the lack of input sanitization and output escaping.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser. This could lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of the website
    - Malicious redirects
    - Other malicious actions

**Attack vectors:**
The attacker can craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload in the `inserted_count` parameter. The attacker then tricks a logged-in administrator into opening the URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to convince a logged-in administrator to open the malicious URL. The attacker does not need to be authenticated themselves.
