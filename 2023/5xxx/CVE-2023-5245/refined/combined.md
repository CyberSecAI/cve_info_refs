# XRAY-532656 - MLeap Path Traversal RCE

CVE-2023-5245
| CVSS 7.5

 JFrog Severity:medium

Discovered By**David Fadida**of the JFrog Security Research Team

Published 15 Nov, 2023 | Last updated 15 Nov, 2023

## [Summary](#summary)

Using MLeap for loading a saved model (zip archive) can lead to path traversal/arbitrary file creation and possibly remote code execution.

## [Component](#component)

[ml.combust.mleap.mleap-tensorflow](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/ml.combust.mleap/mleap-tensorflow)

## [Affected versions](#affected-versions)

[0.18.0,0.23.0], Fixed in 0.23.1

## [Description](#description)

`FileUtil.extract()` enumerates all zip file entries and extracts each file without validating whether file paths in the archive are outside the intended directory.

When creating an instance of `TensorflowModel` using the `saved_model` format and an exported TensorFlow model, the `apply()` function invokes the vulnerable implementation of `FileUtil.extract()`.

Arbitrary file creation can directly lead to code execution

## [PoC](#poc)

Example of a vulnerable usage of MLeap -

```
package example

import ml.combust.mleap.core.types._
import ml.combust.mleap.tensor.Tensor
import ml.combust.mleap.tensorflow.TensorflowModel
import org.tensorflow

import java.nio.file.{Files, Paths}

object LoadModelFromZip extends App {
  // Read zip file
  def readZipFileAsByteArray(filePath: String): Array[Byte] = {
    val fileBytes = Files.readAllBytes(Paths.get(filePath))
    fileBytes
  }
  // Stub
  val _file = "/models/malicious.zip"
  val modelAsBytes = readZipFileAsByteArray(_file)
  // Create a model from zip file
  val model = TensorflowModel(
        inputs = Seq(
          ("InputA", TensorType.Float()), ("InputB", TensorType.Float())
        ),
        outputs = Seq(("MyResult", TensorType.Float())),
        format = Option("saved_model"),
        modelBytes = modelAsBytes
      )
  // Invoke FileUtil.extract()
  model.apply(Tensor.create(Array(2.0, 1.0, 34.0), Seq(-1)))
}

```

| [@jsleight](https://github.com/jsleight), I'm not familiar with this project, but this scala code is also used by the PyPi hosted project?  If so, I'd expect the affected ecosystems in the security advisory to include all ecosystems where the project's vulnerable code can be used. This appears to be PyPi and Maven.  The reason is that when a developer imports the PyPi package into their project, security tools will not flag it as vulnerable because it's not listed as an affected ecosystem.  I appreciate your response & any clarifications. |

| The pypi package can end up using the scala code, however users would need to explicitly install the scala package into their spark jvm. The scala code is not bundled within the python package. I /think/ you could only upgrade the scala package it would still be compatible with the old python package but not contain the CVE (don't remember 100% off hand if there were any changes to the python side in the v0.23.1 release, would need to consult the release notes)  So in a pure technical sense, the pypi artifact does not contain a CVE, though I can understand the perspective that it is strongly related -- and certainly we would recommend that people upgrade both the scala and python together.  I'll defer to [@srmish-jfrog](https://github.com/srmish-jfrog) about how they usually tag CVE's for artifacts split across languages in this manner. |
