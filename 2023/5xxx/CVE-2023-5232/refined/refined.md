- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes within the 'icon' shortcode of the Font Awesome More Icons plugin.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An authenticated attacker with Contributor or higher level permissions can inject malicious web scripts into pages. When other users access these pages, the scripts will execute in their browsers. This could lead to account compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited through the 'icon' shortcode. Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code as shortcode attributes within a post or page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have at least Contributor-level access to the WordPress site to create or edit pages/posts where the malicious shortcode can be inserted.
