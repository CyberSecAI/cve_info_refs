Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-5362:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the 'spice\_post\_slider' shortcode of the Carousel, Recent Post Slider and Banner Slider WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user input when handling shortcode attributes. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that will be stored in the database and executed whenever a user views a page containing the injected shortcode.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web scripts into pages, which are then executed in the browsers of users viewing those pages.
*   **Compromise of User Accounts:** Malicious scripts can potentially be used to steal user session cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other actions that could lead to further compromise of user accounts.
*   **Website Defacement:** The injected scripts can be used to deface the website.
*   **Malware Distribution:** The XSS can be leveraged to distribute malware to website visitors.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Shortcode Injection:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code through the attributes of the `spice_post_slider` shortcode.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user with at least Contributor level permissions within the WordPress site.
*   **Ability to create or edit content:** The attacker needs to have the capability to add or modify content where shortcodes can be inserted.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability affects versions of the Carousel, Recent Post Slider and Banner Slider plugin up to and including version 2.0.
*   **Patched Version:** The vulnerability is fixed in version 2.1. Users should update to this or a later version to mitigate the risk.
*   The vulnerable code is located in `spice-post-slider/include/view/shortcode.php`. Specifically, the output of attributes like `sps_navigation_style` (line 102 in the provided code snippets) is not properly escaped before being used in the generated HTML/JavaScript.
*   The vulnerable code utilizes `esc_html()` for the shortcode attributes where `esc_attr()` should be used.

This vulnerability allows for persistent, or stored XSS, which is generally considered to be more serious than reflected XSS because the injected payload remains on the server and can affect multiple users.
