**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The WP Post Columns plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied attributes within the `column` shortcode. This lack of sanitization and output escaping allows for the injection of arbitrary web scripts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious web scripts into pages, which will execute when a user accesses the compromised page. This can lead to various impacts, such as user session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, or defacement of the website.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting malicious shortcode attributes for the `column` shortcode of the WP Post Columns plugin.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be authenticated with contributor-level permissions or higher.
