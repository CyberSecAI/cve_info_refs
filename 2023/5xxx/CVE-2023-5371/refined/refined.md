{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The RTPS dissector in Wireshark has a memory leak.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Memory leak in the RTPS dissector.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can cause Wireshark to consume excessive CPU resources by injecting a malformed packet onto the network or by convincing a user to open a malformed packet capture file.",
  "Attack vectors": "Injecting malformed packets onto the wire or opening a malformed packet trace file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker can either inject a malformed network packet or provide a malformed packet capture file to a user."
