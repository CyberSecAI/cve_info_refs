- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes within the Simple Shortcodes plugin.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Authenticated attackers with contributor-level or higher permissions can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. These scripts will execute whenever a user accesses the affected page.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploiting the plugin's shortcode functionality by injecting malicious scripts into shortcode attributes.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with contributor-level permissions or higher on the WordPress site.
