    "CVE": "CVE-2023-5557",
    "description": "A weakness in the tracker-miners sandbox allows a maliciously-crafted file to gain code execution outside the sandbox if the tracker-extract process has first been compromised by a separate vulnerability. This affects all versions of tracker-miners prior to 3.3.2, 3.4.5, 3.5.3, and 3.6.1, and additionally affects tracker 1.12.  This affects all versions of RHEL 8 and RHEL 9.",
