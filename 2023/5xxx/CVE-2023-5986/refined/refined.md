- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A CWE-601 URL Redirection to Untrusted Site vulnerability exists, which can be exploited to cause an open redirect.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability allows attackers to cause the software's web application to redirect to a chosen domain after successful login, by providing a URL-encoded input. This open redirect can be chained with a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability described in CVE-2023-5987.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The open redirect vulnerability, combined with an XSS vulnerability (CVE-2023-5987), could lead to an account takeover or the execution of code in the user's browser.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based. An attacker provides a crafted, URL-encoded input to the web application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No specific attacker capabilities or positions are mentioned other than the ability to send crafted requests to the vulnerable web application. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
