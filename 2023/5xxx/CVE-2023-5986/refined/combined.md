Vulnerability Details

CVE ID: CVE-2023-5986

CVSS v3.1 Base Score 8.2 | High | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:N

A CWE-601 URL Redirection to Untrusted Site vulnerability exists that could cause an open-
redirect vulnerability leading to a cross site scripting attack. By providing a URL-encoded input
attackers can cause the software’s web application to redirect to the chosen domain after a
successful login is performed.

CVE ID: CVE-2023-5987

CVSS v3.1 Base Score 6.1 | Medium | CVSS:3.1 AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

A CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (Cross-site Scripting)
vulnerability that could cause a vulnerability leading to a cross site scripting condition where
attackers can have a victim’s browser run arbitrary JavaScript when they visit a page containing
the injected payload.

Note regarding vulnerability details: The severity of vulnerabilities was calculated using the
CVSS Base metrics in version 3.1 (CVSS v3.1) without incorporating the Temporal and
Environmental metrics. Schneider Electric recommends that customers score the CVSS
Environmental metrics, which are specific to end-user organizations, and consider factors such
as the presence of mitigations in that environment. Environmental metrics may refine the
relative severity posed by the vulnerabilities described in this document within a customer’s
environment.

We strongly recommend the following industry cybersecurity best practices.

•  Locate control and safety system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and

isolate them from the business network.

•

Install physical controls so no unauthorized personnel can access your industrial control
and safety systems, components, peripheral equipment, and networks.

•  Place all controllers in locked cabinets and never leave them in the “Program” mode.
•  Never connect programming software to any network other than the network intended for

that device.

•  Scan all methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated network such as CDs, USB

drives, etc. before use in the terminals or any node connected to these networks.
•  Never allow mobile devices that have connected to any other network besides the

intended network to connect to the safety or control networks without proper sanitation.
•  Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and systems and ensure that

they are not accessible from the Internet.

•  When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks
(VPNs). Recognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the
most current version available. Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the
connected devices.

For more information refer to the Schneider Electric Recommended Cybersecurity Best
Practices document.
