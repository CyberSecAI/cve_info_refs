**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-5162

**Description:** The Options for Twenty Seventeen plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via the `social-links` shortcode.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the `social-links` shortcode.

  - Session hijacking
  - Defacement of the website
  - Redirection to malicious websites
  - Arbitrary actions performed on behalf of the victim
  - Data theft

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is the `social-links` shortcode, which allows a contributor-level or higher user to embed arbitrary JavaScript.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have an account with at least "Contributor" level permissions on the WordPress site.
- The attacker must be able to create or edit posts or pages that support shortcodes.
