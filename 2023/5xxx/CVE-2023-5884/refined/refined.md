- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Word Balloon plugin does not adequately protect against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks when deleting avatars.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability. The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection for the avatar deletion action.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker can trick a logged-in administrator into deleting arbitrary avatars by getting them to click on a crafted link.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious link that, when clicked by an authenticated admin, triggers the deletion of an avatar. The victim needs to be logged into the WordPress admin dashboard.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a link. The attacker does not need any user level access to WordPress.
