## Analysis of CVE-2023-5712

Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**1. Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check within the `sd_global_value()` function of the System Dashboard plugin for WordPress. This function is accessible via an AJAX action.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Missing Authorization Check**: The core vulnerability lies in the absence of proper capability checks within the `sd_global_value()` function. This allows any authenticated user, even with minimal permissions, to access data they should not be able to retrieve.
- **Information Disclosure**:  The lack of authorization leads to an information disclosure vulnerability, as attackers can gain access to sensitive global value information.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Access**: Authenticated attackers with subscriber-level access (or higher) can retrieve sensitive global value information. This may include configuration settings, internal system data, or other sensitive information stored in the plugin.
- **Potential for Further Attacks**: Information disclosure may aid attackers in crafting further exploits.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

- **AJAX Action**: The `sd_global_value()` function is accessible through an AJAX action, making it vulnerable to attacks by authenticated users.
- **Network**: This is a network-based vulnerability, as it can be exploited via HTTP requests to the server.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authenticated User**: Attackers need to have an authenticated account on the WordPress site.
- **Low Privilege Level**: The vulnerability can be exploited with subscriber-level access, which is a very low privilege level.
- **Network Access**: Attackers need to be able to make HTTP requests to the WordPress website.
