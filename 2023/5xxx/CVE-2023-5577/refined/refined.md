Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-5577

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping when handling user-supplied attributes within the `wpbitly` shortcode of the Bitly's WordPress plugin. Specifically, the `wpbitly_shortlink` function (lines 202-243) in `class-wp-bitly-shortlink.php` does not properly sanitize the `text` and `title` attributes before using them in the output, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. Malicious code injected through the shortcode attributes is saved in the database and executed in the browsers of users who visit the page containing the crafted shortcode.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Web Script Execution:** Attackers can inject arbitrary JavaScript code, leading to various malicious actions including:
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites.
    - Stealing cookies or session information.
    - Modifying content on the page.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Shortcode Injection:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code within the `text` or `title` attributes of the `wpbitly` shortcode.
- **Exploitation through crafted shortcodes:** The injected shortcode is then rendered on a page, triggering the XSS vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Contributor+ Access:** The attacker must have at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site. This level of access allows the attacker to create and edit posts or pages where they can insert the malicious shortcode.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code is in the `wpbitly_shortlink` function within `class-wp-bitly-shortlink.php`. Specifically, the `text` and `title` attributes are directly used within the `sprintf` function without sufficient sanitization or escaping before being outputted via `apply_filters('the_shortlink'...)`.

**Patch:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 2.7.2 of the plugin. Users are advised to update to this version or later.
- The fix involves proper sanitization or escaping of the shortcode attributes before they are used in the output.
