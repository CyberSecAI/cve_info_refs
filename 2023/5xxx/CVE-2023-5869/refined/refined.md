{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow that occurs during the modification of SQL array values in PostgreSQL. This lack of proper overflow checks can lead to a buffer overrun, allowing authenticated database users to write arbitrary data to memory.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow leading to a buffer overrun."
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution or memory disclosure. An attacker could leverage this to execute arbitrary code or read a wide range of server memory by manipulating array values.",
    "attack_vectors": "Authenticated database users can exploit the vulnerability by modifying SQL array values.",
     "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be an authenticated database user."
