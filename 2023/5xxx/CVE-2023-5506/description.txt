The ImageMapper plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized loss of data due to a missing capability check on the 'imgmap_delete_area_ajax' function in versions up to, and including, 1.2.6. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to delete arbitrary posts and pages.
