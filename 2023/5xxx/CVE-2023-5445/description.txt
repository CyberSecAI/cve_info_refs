An open redirect vulnerability in ePolicy Orchestrator prior to 5.10.0 CP1 Update 2, allows a remote low privileged user to modify the URL parameter for the purpose of redirecting URL request(s) to a malicious site. This impacts the dashboard area of the user interface. A user would need to be logged into ePO to trigger this vulnerability. To exploit this the attacker must change the HTTP payload post submission, prior to it reaching the ePO server.
