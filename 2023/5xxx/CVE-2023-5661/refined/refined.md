**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the `socialfeed` shortcode of the Social Feed WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied attributes when processing the `socialfeed` shortcode.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web scripts into pages that use the vulnerable shortcode.
- These scripts will execute whenever a user accesses the injected page.
- Potential impacts include but are not limited to:
    - Account compromise
    - Data theft
    - Redirection to malicious sites
    - Defacement of the website

**Attack vectors:**
- The `socialfeed` shortcode is the primary attack vector. Malicious code can be inserted through the shortcode's attributes.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Authenticated users with author-level permissions or higher are required to exploit this vulnerability.
- They must be able to create or edit pages/posts and insert the `socialfeed` shortcode with malicious attributes.
