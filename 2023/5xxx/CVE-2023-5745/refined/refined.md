- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes within the 'text-blocks' shortcode.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary web scripts can be injected into pages, and these scripts will execute whenever a user accesses the injected page. This could lead to various malicious activities, such as stealing user session data, redirecting users to malicious sites, or defacing web pages.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by injecting malicious code via the 'text-blocks' shortcode attributes.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Authenticated attackers with author-level permissions or higher are required to exploit this vulnerability.
