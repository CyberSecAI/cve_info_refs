Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-5436:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is due to insufficient escaping of user-supplied parameters and lack of proper preparation in SQL queries within the "Vertical marquee" WordPress plugin. Specifically, the `vm_group` parameter passed to the shortcode function `vm_shortcode` and `verticalmarquee` was not properly sanitized before being used in the SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection.  The plugin directly incorporates the `$vm_group` parameter from the shortcode into the SQL query without sanitization or using prepared statements, which allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
*   **Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command:** This describes the nature of SQL injection, where special characters in user-provided data aren't neutralized, thus altering the intended SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Extraction:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database by injecting SQL queries that target specific tables or columns.
*   **Potential for Further Exploitation:** Depending on database permissions, attackers might be able to modify or delete data, potentially leading to further compromise of the WordPress site.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Shortcode:** The vulnerability is triggered via the plugin's shortcode. The `vm_group` attribute of the shortcode is used to inject SQL code.
*   **Authenticated Users:** The attack can be carried out by authenticated users, even those with subscriber-level permissions or higher.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **WordPress Account:** The attacker needs to have an account on the WordPress site with at least subscriber-level privileges to use the shortcode functionality.
*   **Knowledge of Shortcode and SQL:** The attacker needs to be aware of the plugin's shortcode parameters and be able to craft malicious SQL injection payloads.

**More Details than CVE description:**

*   The provided content from Wordfence and the plugin's Trac details exactly where the vulnerability lies:
    *   The vulnerable code is in the `vm_shortcode` and `verticalmarquee` functions within the `vertical-marquee-plugin.php` file.
    *   Specifically, the SQL queries constructed in these functions, used to fetch data based on the `vm_group`, are vulnerable due to the lack of sanitization.
*   The fix implemented in version 7.2 is also shown:
     * The `vm_group` parameter is now passed to the `$wpdb->prepare()` function before being used in the SQL query. This prevents SQL injection by correctly escaping and sanitizing the parameter.
* The Wordfence content also includes CVSS score and vector, and other useful metadata.
