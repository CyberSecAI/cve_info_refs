Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is insufficient sanitization and lack of proper preparation of user-supplied input used in SQL queries within the "Image vertical reel scroll slideshow" WordPress plugin. Specifically, the `ivrss_type` parameter, passed through the plugin's shortcode, is directly embedded into SQL queries without proper escaping or sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The plugin is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the direct inclusion of the `ivrss_type` shortcode attribute into SQL queries without proper sanitization or use of parameterized queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Breach:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database queries, potentially allowing them to extract sensitive information, including user credentials, and other data stored in the WordPress database.
*   **Data Modification:** Successful exploitation might also allow the attacker to modify or delete data within the database.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** Depending on the database configuration and permissions, an attacker could potentially gain full control over the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The primary attack vector is via the plugin's shortcode `[ivrss-gallery ...]`. Specifically, the `type` attribute of the shortcode, which corresponds to the `ivrss_type` variable in the plugin's code, can be manipulated to inject SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with a minimum of subscriber-level access to a WordPress site where this plugin is installed.
*   **Shortcode Usage:** The attacker needs to be able to create content (posts, pages, etc.) that includes the vulnerable shortcode and control the `type` attribute to inject SQL.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Vulnerable Versions:** All versions of the "Image vertical reel scroll slideshow" plugin up to and including version 9.0 are vulnerable.
*   **Patch:** The vulnerability is patched in version 9.1 of the plugin, which uses `wpdb->prepare` to sanitize the input before executing the SQL queries.
*  **Specific Code Locations:** The vulnerability exists in the `ivrss` function called directly, and the `ivrss_shortcode` function when called using a shortcode, specifically:
    -  `image-vertical-reel-scroll-slideshow.php` line 67: Where the direct concatenation of $ivrss_type into the SQL query is present.
    -  `image-vertical-reel-scroll-slideshow.php` line 270: Where the direct concatenation of $ivrss_type into the SQL query is present when called as a shortcode.

This vulnerability allows attackers with low-level access to potentially gain significant access and control over a WordPress site's database, making it a critical security issue.
