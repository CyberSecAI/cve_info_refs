| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2006347#c0)  Marian Rehak    2021-09-21 14:07:48 UTC  ``` It is possible that VMs can send ICMPv6 Neighbor Advertisement packets to mis-direct traffic to them. It needs to first send packet with correct IP address in the nd_target field and quickly after that send packet with spoofed IP address.  Reference:  [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2005408](show_bug.cgi?id=2005408)   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=2006347#c7)  Sandro Bonazzola    2022-05-03 15:12:18 UTC  ``` Any update?   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=2006347#c15)  Robb Gatica    2023-09-26 20:16:36 UTC  ``` Created openvswitch tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2240831](show_bug.cgi?id=2240831 "CLOSED ERRATA - openvswitch: openvswitch don't match packets on nd_target field [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=2006347#c16)  Flavio Leitner    2023-09-29 19:34:23 UTC  ``` I don't have access to the original bug ([bz#2005408](show_bug.cgi?id=2005408)). It seems this problem has been solved by the commit below: <https://github.com/openvswitch/ovs/commit/489553b1c21692063931a9f50b6849b23128443c>  Do you have a reproducer to verify the fix?

First, there was a bug which we resolved with commit  <https://github.com/openvswitch/ovs/commit/61a1f14b26be12b5643f00e1fa24f08f5ff418ee> which also addresses one issue with matching an nd_target - that of an overbroad match. That is probably what could be considered as the bigger security issue because it would make IPv6 packet movement able to be controlled by a malicious attacker who knows what the rules look like.  Second, there is an issue with the OpenFlow spec that doesn't specify required matching on both icmp_type and icmp_code, rather it only specifies icmp_type as the required match - however, that is really a bug. ICMP type and code are required to properly flag a neighbor discovery packet. Our products, and most products afaik will generate matches on both icmp_type and icmp_code, so for most deployments, it won't likely be hit. However, I recently did post a possible workaround to the ovs security mailing list and we are debating the right way to implement the workaround. Unfortunately, because it is really an issue with the spec, we need to make a decision and hope that a future version of the spec doesn't make our fix incompatible, so there is some discussion.  When the icmp_type + icmp_code masking patch gets accepted, I'll update this bz.   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=2006347#c21)  Aaron Conole    2023-10-31 20:54:45 UTC  ``` Correction - the correct commit is:  <https://github.com/openvswitch/ovs/commit/489553b1c21692063931a9f50b6849b23128443c>   ``` |  |

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : openvswitch
Version        : 2.10.7+ds1-0+deb10u5
CVE ID         : CVE-2023-5366
Debian Bug     :

A flaw was found in Open vSwitch that allows ICMPv6 Neighbor
Advertisement packets between virtual machines to bypass OpenFlow rules.
This issue may allow a local attacker to create specially crafted
packets with a modified or spoofed target IP address field that can
redirect ICMPv6 traffic to arbitrary IP addresses.

For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
2.10.7+ds1-0+deb10u5.

We recommend that you upgrade your openvswitch packages.

For the detailed security status of openvswitch please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/openvswitch>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

Subject: [ADVISORY] CVE-2023-5366: Open vSwitch: OpenFlow match on Neighbor
 Discovery Target may be ignored

Description
===========

In multiple versions of Open vSwitch, if OpenFlow rules on a switch
contain a match on a Target Address (nd_target) of Neighbor Discovery
IPv6 packets (Neighbor Solicitation or Neighbor Advertisement) without
also matching on ICMPv6 Code (icmp_code or icmpv6_code) field being
zero, the match on the Target Address can be ignored and the specified
actions may be executed for a packet with a different Target Address.

This constitutes vulnerability if such OpenFlow rules are used in order
to provide Neighbor Discovery anti-spoofing protection.  For example,
the following set of rules may allow packets with any nd_target, even
though it should only allow packets with the 2001::1 Target:

  priority=10 icmp6,icmpv6_type=136,nd_target=2001::1 actions=<allow>
  priority=0  icmp6 actions=drop

The issue is caused by the difference between the OpenFlow specification
that only lists ICMPV6 TYPE=135 or ICMPV6 TYPE=136 as a prerequisite for
the IPV6_ND_TARGET and datapath implementations that treat ICMPV6_CODE=0
as a requirement for a packet to have the Target Address option.  This
leads to creation of an overly broad datapath flow that matches packets
regardless of the Target Address value.

Triggering the issue depends on the order in which packets are seen
by the switch.

Open vSwitch versions 2.1 and newer are affected.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned CVE-2023-5366 identifier to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

For any affected version of Open vSwitch, adding an icmpv6_code=0 match
to an OpenFlow rule will mitigate the issue.  For example:

 priority=10 icmp6,icmpv6_type=136,icmpv6_code=0,nd_target=2001::1 \
	     actions=<allow>
 priority=0  icmp6 actions=drop

'icmpv6_code' corresponds to OXM_OF_ICMPV6_CODE staring with OF1.2
or NXM_OF_ICMPV6_CODE Nicira Extension before that.

Fix
===

Patches to fix this vulnerability in Open vSwitch 2.17 and newer has been
applied to the appropriate branches:

 * 3.2.x:
   <https://github.com/openvswitch/ovs/commit/7570744c5add3a91b468c4ffa5bc73ef1f5bb18a>
 * 3.1.x:
   <https://github.com/openvswitch/ovs/commit/d3f9eab1abbb6a11c2a166472c184f54fd740bf1>
 * 3.0.x:
   <https://github.com/openvswitch/ovs/commit/a6c0a3deb268f34faef0062e2c05ece563d50ecb>
 * 2.17.x:
   <https://github.com/openvswitch/ovs/commit/e235a421fbdb0c70176e8a3bef13bf7e2056cbc1>

The original patch is located at:
  <https://mail.openvswitch.org/pipermail/ovs-dev/2024-February/411701.html>

Note for those performing selective patch backports:

  The following change is a prerequisite for the fix and must also be
  applied for the fix to work correctly:
    <https://github.com/openvswitch/ovs/commit/489553b1c21692063931a9f50b6849b23128443c>

Recommendation
==============

We recommend that users of Open vSwitch apply the respective patches,
or upgrade to a known patched version of Open vSwitch.  These include:

 * 3.2.2
 * 3.1.4
 * 3.0.6
 * 2.17.9

However, while patches are enough to fix the issue, checking both the
ICMPv6 Code and Type is *the correct way* to validate Neighbor Discovery
packets according to RFC 4861.  With this in mind, we recommend that
users follow the mitigation strategy even with the patches applied,
i.e. add an extra match criteria on 'icmpv6_code' field.

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.
