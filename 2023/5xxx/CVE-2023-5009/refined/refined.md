Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how GitLab handles the execution of scan execution policies. After a previous fix that switched the check from git history to merge history, a bypass was found allowing attackers to execute pipelines as other users by abusing the policy project history. The fallback to the MR author for the pipeline creator is the root cause that enables the bypass.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Fallback to MR Author:** GitLab falls back to using the MR author as the pipeline creator when a security bot user is removed from a project. This creates a scenario where an attacker can control who runs the pipeline by manipulating the MR.
2.  **External User Manipulation:** An external user with maintainer rights in a project with an existing SAST scan policy can remove the security bot and add a malicious runner, thereby executing policy pipelines as the user who created the policy.
3.  **Direct Transfer Spoofing:** By using direct transfer and spoofing the MR author of a policy project, an attacker can force the pipeline to run as any user on the instance.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality:** The attacker can gain access to private projects of the victim user by using the leaked `CI_JOB_TOKEN`.
*   **Integrity:** The attacker can trigger pipelines on the victim's projects and add variables to these pipelines.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** An external user can potentially gain access to internal projects via the victim's `CI_JOB_TOKEN`.
*   **Arbitrary User Pipeline Execution:** The attacker can run pipelines as any user on the instance by spoofing MR authors during policy project import.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Malicious Runner:** An attacker adds a malicious runner to a project.
2.  **Policy Project Manipulation:** An attacker manipulates the policy project's history using direct transfer.
3.  **Removal of Security Bot:** An attacker removes the security bot user from the project to force fallback.
4.  **Direct Import Abuse:** An attacker can import a spoofed policy project via direct transfer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **GitLab Instance Access:** The attacker needs access to a self-hosted GitLab instance.
*   **Attacker Account:** The attacker needs an account on GitLab.com.
*   **Maintainer Role:** For the external user attack, the attacker needs to be a maintainer in a project with a SAST scan policy.
*   **Runner Setup:** The attacker needs to set up a runner with shell executor and can add it to victim project to execute arbitrary code.
*   **Spoofing Capabilities**:  The attacker needs the ability to create a user with the victim's email on a separate instance and import projects via direct transfer and spoof MR authorship.
