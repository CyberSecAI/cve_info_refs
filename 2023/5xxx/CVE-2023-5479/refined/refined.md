Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-5479:

**Summary:**
CVE-2023-5479 is a vulnerability affecting Chromium-based browsers (including Google Chrome and potentially Microsoft Edge through its underlying Chromium engine) and QtWebEngine, a library used to render web content in applications. This vulnerability is related to "Inappropriate implementation in Extensions API" according to the Chrome release blog. The Gentoo security advisories (GLSAs) also indicate that a number of other vulnerabilities, including Use-After-Free and Heap-Buffer-Overflow, are also fixed.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is described as an "Inappropriate implementation in Extensions API" which suggests a flaw in how the browser handles interactions with extensions. However, details of the implementation are not provided, making it difficult to pinpoint the exact coding error.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Inappropriate implementation:** The core issue is a flaw in the Extensions API's implementation, this could be related to error handling, permission management, or other extension related functionality.
- The content also mentions additional vulnerabilities fixed along with CVE-2023-5479, such as use-after-free (in multiple components), and heap-buffer-overflow. These are separate issues, but they are fixed in the same releases.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The impact is described as "Medium" severity in the Chrome release blog.
- The Gentoo advisories state that the "worst of which can lead to remote code execution", suggesting a severe impact, though CVE-2023-5479 itself might not be the specific vulnerability leading to RCE directly.
- Other potential impacts could include denial of service or information disclosure.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is "remote," meaning an attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely, likely by crafting malicious web content.
-  The specific method of triggering the Extensions API vulnerability is not detailed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to deliver malicious web content to a vulnerable user, meaning they could do this via a compromised website, malicious ads, or a phishing attack.

**Additional Details**
-  The Gentoo advisories list specific affected package versions for Chromium, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and QtWebEngine. Users of these packages need to upgrade to the specified unaffected versions.
- The Gentoo advisories also include links to many other CVEs that are fixed in the same updates. The update is not just related to CVE-2023-5479.

In summary, CVE-2023-5479 is an "Inappropriate implementation" vulnerability in the Extensions API of Chromium based browsers and QtWebEngine, which could allow for malicious actors to cause security issues. The fix for this vulnerability is included in a larger update that address other security issues.
