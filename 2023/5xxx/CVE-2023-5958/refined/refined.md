- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly escape email message content before displaying it in the backend.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unauthenticated Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of highly privileged users (e.g. administrators) when they view email logs, potentially leading to account compromise or further malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can send an email using a contact form that uses the `wp_mail` function, including a malicious JavaScript payload within the email message. Then, by visiting the email logs section of the plugin (/wp-admin/admin.php?page=postman_email_log) and clicking 'View' next to the affected record, the XSS payload will be executed in the admin user's browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability. They only need to be able to send an email that will be logged by the plugin and to get an administrator to visit the email log.
