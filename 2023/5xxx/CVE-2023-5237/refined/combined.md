## More than a Password Day 2024

### OWASP is securing the web! Enable MFA today!

Please follow the instructions in the [More than a Password Day 2024 news article](https://owasp.org/blog/2024/11/12/more-than-a-password-day-2024.html) to enable multi-factor authentication on your OWASP account.

[![More than a Password Day 2024](/pages/events/featured/guidance_part_1.png)](https://owasp.org/blog/2024/11/12/more-than-a-password-day-2024.html)

## Use password-free authentication

Simpler to use and far more secure than passwords, passkeys use cryptographic to prove that you are you.

[![More than a Password Day 2024](/pages/events/featured/guidance_part_2.png)](https://owasp.org/blog/2024/11/12/more-than-a-password-day-2024.html)

## Secure your email account

Email is the most common form of resetting your password. Add extra security to deter access to your accounts:

* Strong password (long, randomly generated and unique)
* Multi-factor authentication / two-step verification

[![More than a Password Day 2024](/pages/events/featured/guidance_part_3.png)](https://owasp.org/blog/2024/11/12/more-than-a-password-day-2024.html)

## Add layers of security

Additional security measures can help prevent phishing and other attacks, if used in addition to your password.

* A hardware security key (or token)
* An authenticator app

[![More than a Password Day 2024](/pages/events/featured/guidance_part_4.png)](https://owasp.org/blog/2024/11/12/more-than-a-password-day-2024.html)

## Use a password manager

* Using a password manager means you can use strong, randomly generated, harder to guess passwords.
* Use a strong, memorable password manager password.

[![More than a Password Day 2024](/pages/events/featured/guidance_part_5.png)](https://owasp.org/blog/2024/11/12/more-than-a-password-day-2024.html)

## Use a technique or passphrases to pick passwords

* Use “three random words” or passphrases to pick passwords that are easier to remember but hard to guess.

[![More than a Password Day 2024](/pages/events/featured/guidance_part_6.png)](https://owasp.org/blog/2024/11/12/more-than-a-password-day-2024.html)

## Hacked? Move fast to change passwords

Your passwords should be changed immediately if:

* One of your devices is compromised
* If an online site or service you use is hacked

Using random unique passwords with a password manager means you only need to change breached passwords. Many password managers can help you identify which passwords need changing.

[![More than a Password Day 2024](/pages/events/featured/more_than_password_day.png)](https://owasp.org/blog/2024/11/12/more-than-a-password-day-2024.html)

CleanTalk is a Cloud security service that protects your website from online threats and provides you great security instruments to control your website security. We provide detailed security stats for all of our security features to have a full control of security. All security logs are stored in the cloud for 45 days.

Security FireWall by CleanTalk is a free plugin which works with the premium Cloud security service cleantalk.org. This security plugin as a service https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software\_as\_a\_service.

Malware always becomes a headache for site owners. If you don’t regularly check for malware, it will be able to work insensibly a lot of time and damage your reputation. If you prevent malware attacks before they happen, you will be able to save your resources.

What is malware and why does it matter to your business? Malware is malicious code that performs actions for hackers. If your site has been infected with malware it will be able a problem for customer trust and their personal details. First, you need to scan your site to confirm the malware exists. The next step you should fix all files with malware.

#### Limit Login Attempts

Limit Login Attempts – is a part of brute-force protection and security firewall.

Security Firewall has a limit for requests to your website (by default 1000 requests per hour, so you can change it) and if any IP exceed this threshold it will be added to security firewall for next 24 hours. It allows you to break some of the DDoS attacks.

#### Brute Force Protection

It adds a few seconds delay for any failed attempt to login to WordPress admin area. WordPress Security & Firewall by CleanTalk makes access to your website more secure. Service will check your security log once per hour and if some IP’s have 10 and more attempts to log in per hour, then these IP’s will be banned for next 24 hours.

*Security Audit Log* keeps track of actions in the WP Dashboard to let you know what is happening on your blog.

With the Security Audit Log is very easy to see user activity in order to understand what changes have done and who made them.

Security Audit Log shows who logged in and when and how much time they spent on each page.

#### Security Traffic Control

CleanTalk security Traffic Control will track every single visitor no matter if they are using JavaScript or not and provides many valuable traffic parameters.

Another option in Security Traffic Control – “Block user after requests amounts more than” – blocks access to the site for any IP that has exceeded the number of HTTP requests per hour. If this number of requests will be exceeded, this IP will be added to the Security FireWall Black List for 24 hours.

#### Security Firewall

To enhance the security of your site, you can use the CleanTalk Security FireWall, which will allow you to block access by HTTP/HTTPS to your website for individual IP addresses, IP networks and block access to users from specific countries. Use personal BlackList to block IP addresses with a suspicious activity to enhance the WordPress security.

Security FireWall may significantly reduce the risk of hacking and reduces the load on your web server.

CleanTalk Security is fully compatible with the most popular VPN services.

Also, CleanTalk security supports all search engines Google, Bing, Yahoo, Baidu, MSN, Yandex and etc.

#### Security Malware Scanner

Scans WordPress files for hacker files or code for hacker code.

Security Malware Scanner runs manually in the settings. All of the results will send in your Security CleanTalk Dashboard with the details and you will be able to investigate them and see if that was a legitimate change or some bad code was injected.

CleanTalk Antivirus protects your website from viruses and deletes infected code from files. Antivirus scans not only WP core, it will check all of the files on your WordPress. Heuristics antivirus scan allows finding malware/viruses code by bad php constructions.

CleanTalk Security has a “Feedback System” for analyzing suspicious files. This is the client-server feature in CleanTalk Security that allows sending suspicious files from the WordPress backend to CleanTalk cloud.

Security Malware Scanner shows a list of suspicious files and you can view code that was indicated as bad. If you don’t have programming experience and don’t know, is there security issue or not, you will be able to send some files to CleanTalk and we will check them for malware code. After checking we will send you an email notification with results, is there viruses or not.

Every day, CleanTalk Security Malware Scanner will check new files and files that have been changed from the last scanning.

Please, look at our guide How malware file analysis works.

[About Scanner Feedback System](https://cleantalk.org/help/files-analysis "About Scanner Feedback System")

#### Security Malware Heuristic Check

This option allows you to check files of plugins and themes with heuristic analysis. Probably it will find more than you expect.

#### Security Malware scanner to find SQL Injections

The CleanTalk Security Malware Scanner allows you to find code that allows performing SQL injection. It is this problem that the scanner solves.

#### Scanner of known vulnerabilities

Plugin checks installed plugins and themes for known (published) vulnerabilities. If finds vulnerable plugin/theme, it sends an Email notification and shows data in the WordPress Dashboard.

#### Web Application FireWall (WAF) for WordPress Security Plugin

The main purpose of Web Application FireWall (WAF) is real-time protection from unauthorized access, even if there are critical known/unknown vulnerabilities.

Security Web Application FireWall catches all requests to your website and checks HTTP parameters that include: SQL Injection, Cross Site Scripting (XSS), uploading files from non-authorised users, PHP constructions/code, the presence of malicious code in the downloaded files.

In addition to effective information security and information security applications are required to know what is quality of protection and CleanTalk Security has logged all blocked requests that allow you to know and analyze accurate information. You can see your Cleantalk Security Logs in your Control panel. https://cleantalk.org/my/logs\_firewall

CleanTalk’s research team updates WAF database each time as we find a vulnerability, it means plugin’s users get protection even against unpublished vulnurebilites.

[About Security Web Application Firewall](https://cleantalk.org/help/security-waf "About Web Application Firewall")

#### Improve your website security with Two Factor Authentication

It requires a bit of your time but Two Factor (2 Step) Authentication immediately gives a much higher level of security.

With your first authorization, the CleanTalk Security plugin remembers your browser and you won’t have to input your authorization code every time anymore. However, if you started to use a new device or a new browser then you are required to input your security authorization code. CleanTalk security plugin will remember your browser for 30 days.

#### Change the URL of the wp-login page

This option helps you change the default wp-login URL. Hackers use scripts for massive brute-force attacks, and since most sites use a default login page URL, hackers configure scripts for such URLs. When you change the URL of the authorization page, hackers will not have the opportunity to perform brute-force attacks in scripts in automatic mode.

To enable the option, go to the WP Dashboard plugin settings -> Settings -> Security by CleanTalk -> General Settings and check box Change address to login script. Then add a new URL and click Save Settings.

This option does not change files and does not rewrite URLs in system files. To return the address of the default authorization page, it is enough to disable the option in the plugin settings or set a new value.

If you are using caching plugins, then you need to add a new authorization page in the caching exceptions.

#### Can I use CleanTalk Security and Wordfence together

Sure, you can use CleanTalk Security and Wordfence. Quite often we get question from our customers, will there be a conflict between CleanTalk and Wordfence? We tested CleanTalk Security and Wordfence working together and they work without any conflicts.

#### Email Notifications when administrators are logged in

We added this option to our security plugin. Now you can receive notifications if you want to know about an unauthorized entrance to your WP Dashboard.

Notification will be sent only when a user was able to authorize entering login and password. If you are logged into the admin panel from the saved session, then the alert won’t be sent.

You can enable the option “Receive notifications for admin authorizations in your CleanTalk Dashboard. Choose “Site Security” in the “Services” menu, then click “Settings”.

#### Can CleanTalk Security protect from DDoS?

Security FireWall can mitigate HTTP/HTTPS DDoS attacks. When an intruder makes GET requests to attack your website, Security FireWall blocks all requests from bad IP addresses. If your website under DDoS attack you will be able to add IPs to your personal BlackList to block all Post and GET requests.

#### `Send additional HTTP headers` option

There are several additional http-headers which added to the every http-requests by the plugin if this option is enabled:

– “X-Content-Type-Options” improves the security of your site (and your users) against some types of drive-by-downloads.

– “X-XSS-Protection” header improves the security of your site against some types of XSS (cross-site scripting) attacks.

– “Strict-Transport-Security” response header (often abbreviated as HSTS) informs browsers that the site should only be accessed using HTTPS, and that any future attempts to access it using HTTP should automatically be converted to HTTPS.

– “Referrer-Policy” make the `Referer` http-header transferring more strictly.

#### File System Watcher feature

File system Watcher monitors changes in the file system. This allows to quickly respond to a site infection by tracking which files were affected. The Watcher makes file system snapshots as often as one hour and show difference up to seven days time frame.

## FAQ

### Why are they attacking me?

Hackers want to get access to your website and use it to get backlinks from your site to improve their site’s PageRank or redirect your visitors to malicious sites or use your website to send spam and viruses or other attacks.These attacks can damage your reputation with readers and commentators if you fail to tackle it.

   2.1 Address 10.10.10.10 is local address and it’s in blacklist constantly. So address YOUR\_WEBSITE/?security\_test\_ip=10.10.10.10 will works everytime.
3. Make sure that you saw page with the blocking message.
4. FireWall works properly, if it is not, see item 4 of the list.

### How does malware scanner work?

Malware scanner will check and compare with the original WP files and show you what files were changed, deleted or added. Malware scanner could be used to find an added code in WP files. On your Malware Security Log page, you will see the list of all scans that were performed for your website. The CleanTalk Cloud saves the list of the found files for you to know where to look them for.

### How to start malware scanner?

At the moment malware scanner may be started one time per day and manually.

To start malware scanner go to the WordPress Admin Page —> Settings —> Security by CleanTalk —> “Malware Scanner” tab —> Perform Scan.

Give the Malware Scanner some time to check all necessary files on your website.

### Is it free or paid?

The plugin is free. But the plugin uses CleanTalk cloud security service. You have to register an account and then you will receive a free trial to test. When the trial (on CleanTalk account) is finished, you can renew the subscription for 1 year or deactivate the Security by CleanTalk plugin.

If you haven’t got access key, the plugin will work and you will have logs only on the plugin settings page for last 20 requests.

### What happens after the end of the trial period?

The plugin will fully perform its functions after the end of the trial period and will protect your website from brute force attacks and will keep Action Log in your WP Dashboard, but the number of entries in the log will be limited to the last 20 entries/24 hours. Also, you will receive a short daily security report to your email.

Premium version allows to storage all logs for 45 days in the CleanTalk Dashboard for further analysis.

### Brute Force security for WordPress

Brute force attack is an exhaustive password search to get full access to an Administrator account. Passwords are not the hard part for hackers taking into account the quantity of sent password variants per second and the big amount of IP-addresses.

Brute force attack is one of the most security issues as an intruder gets full access to your website and can change your code. Consequences of these break-ins might be grievous, your website could be added to the [botnet] and it could participate in attacks to other websites, it could be used to keep hidden links or automatic redirection to a suspicious website. Consequences for your website reputation might be very grievous.

### Why is the CleanTalk Security Plugin Added to the Must Use Section?

This is required for the Security FireWall to function properly. Plugins that are placed in this section are being launched first, so it is very important that the Security FireWall is launched before any plugins and hooks. Thus, hacker requests will be stopped before they can get access to any site code.

## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Memberlite Shortcodes < 1.3.9 - Contributor+ Stored XSS via Shortcode

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back in the page, which could allow users with a role as low as contributor to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks which could be used against high privilege users such as admin.

### Proof of Concept

[memberlite\_banner align='" onmouseover="alert(/XSS/)"' background="primary" title="Primary Banner"]
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla ultrices, nibh et iaculis lobortis, leo orci efficitur libero, non pharetra libero sem non lectus. Integer sit amet leo vel quam elementum scelerisque vel ac arcu.
[/memberlite\_banner]

# CVE-2023-4297 – Mmm Simple File List <= 2.3 - Subscriber+ Arbitrary Directory Listing (LFI)

You are here: [Home](https://research.cleantalk.org/) » CVE-2023-4297 – Mmm Simple File List

During the security assessment of the **Mmm Simple File List plugin**, a critical vulnerability was unearthed in **versions up to 2.3**. This vulnerability allowed an attacker to bypass the plugin’s directory restrictions, potentially accessing and listing files outside the WordPress root directory. This issue could be exploited by a user with **Subscriber privileges**.

## **Main info:**

## **Timeline**

| July 17, 2023 | Plugin testing and vulnerability detection in the **Mmm Simple File List** plugin have been completed |
| --- | --- |
| July 17, 2023 | I contacted the author of the plugin and provided a vulnerability PoC with a description and recommendations for fixing |
| November 5, 2023 | The author has closed a plugin |
| November 7, 2023 | Registered **CVE-2023-4297** |

## **Discovery of the Vulnerability**

When testing the plugin, an opportunity was found to bypass directories in the plugin’s **shortcode and view which files are in a particular OS folder**. There is no ban on exiting the wordpress root directory. This can all be done through a user with **Subscriber privileges**

## **Understanding of LFI attack’s**

**LFI, or Local File Inclusion**, is a web application vulnerability that allows an attacker to include files on a server through the web browser. In the context **of the Mmm Simple File List plugin, LFI** meant that an attacker could access files outside the expected directory, breaching the plugin’s intended file access limitations.

## **Exploiting the LFI Vulnerability**

The **LFI vulnerability in the Mmm Simple File List plugin** could be exploited by manipulating the plugin’s shortcode parameters. By modifying these parameters, an attacker could traverse directories and gain access to files located in unintended locations. This technique could potentially lead to unauthorized access to sensitive files, including system configuration files, databases, or even critical application data.

> **POC** **shortcode**:
>
> *[MMFileList folder=”../../../../../../../../../../home” format=”table” types=”” class=”” headings=””]*
>
> \_\_\_

**The Mmm Simple File List LFI vulnerability** posed a significant risk to websites using this plugin. In real-world scenarios, a malicious user with **Subscriber privileges** could leverage this vulnerability to:

* Access sensitive configuration files, which might contain credentials, API keys, or other confidential information.
* View and potentially exfiltrate critical data stored outside the web root directory.
* Gain insights into the server’s file structure, potentially identifying other targets for exploitation.

This could result in data breaches, loss of confidential information, or even compromise the entire web server.

## ****Recommendations for Improved Security****

To enhance security and prevent **LFI vulnerabilities in WordPress plugins**, developers should:

* Implement proper input validation and output encoding to restrict file inclusion to legitimate locations.

## **Timeline**

| September 19, 2023 | Plugin testing and vulnerability detection in the **Memberlite Shortcodes** plugin have been completed |
| --- | --- |
| September 19, 2023 | I contacted the author of the plugin and provided a vulnerability PoC with a description and recommendations for fixing |

| October 9, 2023 | Registered **CVE-2023-5237** |

## **Discovery of the Vulnerability**

During a comprehensive assessment of the **Memberlite Shortcodes plugin**, a critical vulnerability was uncovered. This vulnerability enables threat actors to execute **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** attacks by leveraging a shortcode within a new post. This security flaw has the potential to result in an account takeover, particularly when exploited by a contributor.

## **Understanding of Stored XSS attack’s**

**Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** is a type of security vulnerability where malicious scripts are injected into a web application and subsequently stored for later execution when accessed by other users. Although typically associated with HTTP headers, **XSS can also be achieved through shortcodes**. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to insert malicious code, such as JavaScript, into a shortcode within a post.

## **Exploiting the Stored XSS**

Exploiting the **Stored XSS vulnerability** in the **Memberlite Shortcodes plugin** involves an attacker, with contributor-level privileges, inserting malicious code within a shortcode in a new post. This code can include payloads designed to steal user data, hijack sessions, or perform actions on behalf of the compromised contributor account. Attackers can craft posts to entice users to view them, thereby triggering the execution of the malicious script.

> **POC** **shortcode**:
>
> *[memberlite\_banner align='” onmouseover=”alert(/XSS/)”‘ background=”primary” title=”Primary Banner”] Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla ultrices, nibh et iaculis lobortis, leo orci efficitur libero, non pharetra libero sem non lectus. Integer sit amet leo vel quam elementum scelerisque vel ac arcu. [/memberlite\_banner]*
>
> This shortcode must be contained in the new post’s

The potential risks associated with **CVE-2023-5237** are significant. An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability can:

* Execute arbitrary code within the context of other users’ browsers.
* Steal sensitive data like cookies or session information.
* Gain unauthorized access to the compromised contributor’s account.
* Impersonate contributors to perform malicious actions on the website.

In a real-world scenario, envision an attacker leveraging this vulnerability to compromise a contributor’s account on a website utilizing the **Memberlite Shortcodes plugin**. By embedding a malicious shortcode in a post, they can execute an XSS attack on anyone who views the manipulated content. This could result in unauthorized account access, data breaches, and damage to the website’s reputation.

## ****Recommendations for Improved Security****

To mitigate the risks posed by **CVE-2023-5237** and enhance the overall security of WordPress websites using the **Memberlite Shortcodes plugin**, consider the following recommendations:

* **Update the plugin:** Ensure the Memberlite Shortcodes plugin is updated to the latest version, which should include a patch to address this vulnerability.
* **Input validation and sanitization:** Implement rigorous input validation and data sanitization to prevent the injection of malicious code through shortcodes or other user inputs.
* **Least privilege principle:** Restrict the capabilities and permissions of contributors and other user roles to minimize the potential impact of a compromised account.
* **Regular security audits:** Conduct routine security audits and penetration testing to proactively identify and address vulnerabilities.
* **User awareness and education:** Educate contributors and administrators about potential security threats and best practices for securely using and managing plugins and shortcodes.

> By adhering to these recommendations, website administrators can significantly reduce the risk of **Stored XSS** attacks via shortcodes and enhance the overall security posture of their WordPress installations.

I’m co-author of the Memberlite Shortcodes plugin. We wrote this plugin in preparation for releasing our open source Memberlite Theme into the theme repository here on WordPress.org.
Using a separate plugin for certain theme features allows us to add more technical tools to our project, without overloading the main theme. This plugin also allows site owners to make use of certain features in the Memberlite Theme without having to totally migrate away from their current theme.

[![CVE-2024-12280 – WP Customer Area <= 8.2.4 – Event Log Deletion via CSRF – POC](https://research.cleantalk.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/New_1_not_safe-1.png "CVE-2024-12280 – WP Customer Area <= 8.2.4 – Event Log Deletion via CSRF – POC")](https://research.cleantalk.org/cve-2024-12280/ "CVE-2024-12280 – WP Customer Area <= 8.2.4 – Event Log Deletion via CSRF – POC")

WP Customer Area is a versatile and modular WordPress plugin designed to provide a private content management solution. With features like sharing files and pages with specific users or groups, it has become a preferred choice for managing confidential content in WordPress websites. However, in version 8.2.4 and earlier, a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability was discovered, which allows unauthorized users to delete event logs without proper authentication.

This vulnerability poses a significant risk, as logs often contain critical records of user actions and system events. Attackers exploiting this vulnerability could erase these logs, effectively covering their tracks and compromising a site’s ability to identify malicious activities. Notably, the plugin is now discontinued, emphasizing the importance of transitioning to alternative solutions.

Icegram Engage, a popular WordPress plugin for creating opt-ins, subscription forms, and campaigns, has been found to contain a critical Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, CVE-2024-12302. This flaw allows attackers with editor-level access to inject malicious JavaScript into the settings of a campaign, which is then executed when the campaign is accessed. The injected script could be used to hijack an admin session or create a backdoor admin account, leading to full site compromise. With over 30,000 active installations, this vulnerability represents a serious threat to WordPress websites using Icegram Engage.
