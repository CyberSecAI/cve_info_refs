    "https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-5237"
  ],
  "details": "The vulnerability lies in the `memberlite_banner` shortcode, specifically the `align` attribute. The plugin fails to properly sanitize or escape this attribute before rendering it in the output. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code, such as `onmouseover=\"alert(/XSS/)\"`, which will be executed when a user hovers over the banner. The vulnerability is present in versions prior to 1.3.9. The provided Proof of Concept shortcode is:\n\n`[memberlite_banner align='\" onmouseover=\"alert(/XSS/)\"' background=\"primary\" title=\"Primary Banner\"]\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla ultrices, nibh et iaculis lobortis, leo orci efficitur libero, non pharetra libero sem non lectus. Integer sit amet leo vel quam elementum scelerisque vel ac arcu.\n[/memberlite_banner]`\n\nThis XSS vulnerability is categorized as CWE-79 and OWASP A7: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The CVSS score is 5.9 (Medium)."
