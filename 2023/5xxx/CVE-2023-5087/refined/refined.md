- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The PageLayer plugin fails to sanitize user-supplied input within the "Header, Body and Footer" code text areas, allowing malicious JavaScript to be injected.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker with author-level privileges or higher to inject malicious JavaScript into the header, body or footer of posts. When a user views an affected post, the injected script is executed within their browser session. This could lead to a wide range of malicious activities such as session hijacking, data theft, or further compromise of the affected site and its visitors.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker needs to have at least author privileges in order to create a post and edit it using the PageLayer page builder. Then, they need to access the "Advanced" tab and insert the malicious javascript within the "Header, Body and Footer" section.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have author privileges or higher on the WordPress site that is using a vulnerable version of the plugin.
