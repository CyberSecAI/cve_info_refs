## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Ninja Forms < 3.6.34 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitize and escape its label fields, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored XSS attacks. Only users with the unfiltered\_html capability can perform this, and such users are already allowed to use JS in posts/comments etc however the vendor acknowledged and fixed the issue

### Proof of Concept

1. Install and activate the Ninja Forms WordPress
2. As an admin with the unfiltered\_html capability, create a new form.
3. In the form settings, add a new text field.
4. In the field label, enter the following code: <img src=x onerror=alert(1)>, or Name<a href=javascript:alert(/XSS-1/) onfocus=alert(/XSS-2/) autofocus>ClickME, maybe</a>
5. Save the form.
The XSS will be triggered when viewing the form in the frontend, as well as when editing the form in the backend

## Release Updates – Saturday Drive X Edition

Our engineering team has been hard at work pushing core updates and working on an exciting new project. So make sure you are running the latest version of Ninja Forms to access these fixes.

### Ninja Forms Logo, Saturday Drive Summit Edition[Ninja Forms – Core](https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/ninja-forms.zip)

#### **Version 3.6.28 (July 6, 2023 )**

We fixed a problem that was preventing users from being able to delete 😱 forms in the software.

#### **Version 3.6.27 & Version 3.6.26 ( July 4, 2023 )**

We made sure that the software checks the versions of the tools it uses and makes sure they are the required ones. We’ve also made some security improvements to protect your data:

* We made a technical adjustment to ensure that our software can work with PHP 7.
* We’ve put in measures to stop unauthorized users from downloading data that you have collected.
* We’ve stopped the possibility of harmful scripts (a type of coded instruction) from being run through labels on the dashboard. These fixes were reported by Sayandeep Dutta.
* We’ve also stopped harmful scripts from being run through labels that users see. These fixes were reported by Jonathon Zamora & WordPress.org.
* We’ve put measures in place to stop too much extra data from being sent through automated form submissions, which can clutter up your data.
* We’ve put measures in place to stop users from accessing and changing things they aren’t supposed to in the software.
