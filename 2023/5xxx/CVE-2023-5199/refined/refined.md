- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The 'php-to-page' shortcode in the PHP to Page WordPress plugin allows for the inclusion of local files due to improper control of filenames in include/require statements.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Local File Inclusion (LFI), leading to potential Remote Code Execution (RCE).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can include local files and potentially execute code on the server.  This can lead to complete compromise of the affected system.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered through the 'php-to-page' shortcode.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated user with subscriber-level permissions or higher. Subscriber users might need to poison log files or find ways to upload a file to achieve RCE. Users with author permissions or higher can directly upload files.
