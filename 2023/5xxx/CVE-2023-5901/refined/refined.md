The provided content relates to CVE-2023-5901.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The commit `44d8bde60eb2575fd4087b76540aec9b49389e23` on `pkp/pkp-lib` removes SVG from the list of allowed file types for public uploads. This indicates that a vulnerability existed related to SVG file uploads.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability was the allowance of SVG files for upload. SVG files can contain embedded scripts, which can be executed by a web browser, potentially leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The commit addresses the issue by removing "svg" from allowed file types.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could upload a malicious SVG file containing javascript which, when viewed by another user, would result in the execution of the script. This could lead to various malicious activities, such as stealing cookies, session hijacking, or redirecting to malicious sites.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the file upload functionality where users can upload public files, such as images for categories or user profiles.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need to have an account with the ability to upload public files.
