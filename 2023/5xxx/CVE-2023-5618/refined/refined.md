  "CVE-2023-5618": {
    "description": "The Modern Footnotes plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's shortcode in versions up to, and including, 1.4.16 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
    "root_cause": "Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes within the plugin's shortcode.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages, which will execute when a user accesses the affected page. This could lead to various malicious activities, such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious websites.",
    "attack_vector": "By exploiting the plugin's shortcode with crafted attributes, an attacker can inject malicious scripts into the website's content.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with contributor-level permissions or higher."
