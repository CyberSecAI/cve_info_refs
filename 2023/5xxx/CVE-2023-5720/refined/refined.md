Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-5720:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from Quarkus's improper sanitization of artifacts created using the Gradle plugin. This results in build system information being left in the final application artifacts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Information Disclosure:** The core issue is that sensitive build environment information is not stripped from the application. This exposes potentially sensitive details about the build system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An attacker could exploit this flaw to access potentially sensitive information about the build system from within the application. While the exact nature of this information isn't explicitly detailed, it could reveal paths, environment variables, usernames, versions etc of the build environment. This can be used to further attack the affected environment.

**Attack Vectors:**

- An attacker would need to have access to the application artifacts in order to access this information. This can be done by accessing the deployed application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the built application.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Quarkus versions 3.0.0.CR1 and later.
- The bug report mentions this is related to the Gradle plugin.
- Red Hat Bugzilla has marked this bug as "High" priority and "High" severity.
