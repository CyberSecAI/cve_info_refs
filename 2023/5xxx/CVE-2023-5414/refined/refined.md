Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-5414

**Description:** The Icegram Express plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to a directory traversal issue.

**Root Cause:** The `show_es_logs` function in the `class-email-subscribers-logs.php` file does not properly sanitize the `log_file` parameter, allowing an attacker to specify arbitrary file paths.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Directory Traversal:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to traverse the file system outside the intended log directory due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input (`$_POST['log_file']`).
*   **Arbitrary File Read:** By manipulating the `log_file` parameter, an attacker can force the application to read the contents of any file accessible to the web server process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can read sensitive information contained in files on the server. This includes configuration files, database credentials, and potentially files belonging to other users/sites on the same server (in shared hosting environments).
*  **Potential for Further Compromise:** Access to sensitive data like database credentials could lead to further attacks, including complete compromise of the application and/or server.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted POST request containing a `log_file` parameter with a path traversal sequence (e.g., `../../../../etc/passwd`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated Administrator Access:** The attacker needs to be logged in as an administrator (or higher privileged user) on the WordPress site to exploit the vulnerability.

**Technical Details**

*   The vulnerable code snippet is within the `show_es_logs` function of `class-email-subscribers-logs.php`.
*   The code retrieves the log file name from the `$_POST['log_file']` parameter and uses `sanitize_text_field` before using it in `file_get_contents()`. However, `sanitize_text_field` is insufficient to prevent path traversal.
*   The `file_get_contents` function is then used to read the contents of the specified file.
*   The vulnerability exists because the code directly concatenates the sanitized (but still vulnerable) filename with `IG_LOG_DIR` and uses it in `file_get_contents`, without validating if the sanitized filename is within the expected directory.
*   The fix involves validating if the requested log file is within the allowed log files, before reading the file.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The Wordfence article mentions that this issue was addressed in version 5.6.24 of the plugin.
*   The vulnerability is rated as critical, with a CVSS score of 9.1, due to the potential for high impact to confidentiality and integrity
