## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Photos and Files Contest Gallery – Contact Form < 21.2.8.1 - Unauthenticated Stored XSS via HTTP Headers

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some parameters, which could allow unauthenticated users to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks via certain headers.

### Proof of Concept

1. Use a proxy such as BurpSuite to add the following header to all requests:
X-Forwarded-For: 11.11.11.11<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>
2. Create a gallery and add its shortcode to a page.
3. As an unauthenticated user, upload an image to the gallery from the frontend.
4. As an administrator, click on "Contest Gallery" in the sidebar and click "Edit Gallery" on the gallery entry to trigger the XSS.

# CVE-2023-5307 – Photos and Files Contest Gallery – Contact Form < 21.2.8.1 – Unauthenticated Stored XSS via HTTP Headers

You are here: [Home](https://research.cleantalk.org/) » CVE-2023-5307 – Photos and Files Contest Gallery – Contact Form < 21.2.8.1 – Unauthenticated Stored XSS via HTTP Headers

During testing of the plugin, a vulnerability was discovered that allows you to cause a **Stored XSS vulnerability** on behalf of an unauthorized user, which will lead to an increase in privileges to the administrator role. The vulnerability is caused by **X-Forward-For Header Injection**.

## **Main info:**

## **Timeline**

| September 29, 2023 | Plugin testing and vulnerability detection in the **Photos and Files Contest Gallery – Contact Form** plugin have been completed |
| --- | --- |
| September 29, 2023 | I contacted the author of the plugin and provided a vulnerability PoC with a description and recommendations for fixing |
| October 5, 2023 | The author has released a fix update |
| October 9, 2023 | Registered **CVE-2023-5307** |

## **Discovery of the Vulnerability**

During the rigorous testing of the **Photos and Files Contest Gallery – Contact Form plugin**, a critical vulnerability was identified. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to trigger a **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** vulnerability, subsequently elevating their privileges to the administrator role. The root cause of this vulnerability lies in **X-Forwarded-For Header Injection**.

## **Understanding of Stored XSS attack’s**

Unauthenticated Stored XSS via HTTP Headers refers to a security flaw where malicious code is injected into a web application’s HTTP headers, typically without requiring authentication. When this manipulated header is processed by the application, the injected script is stored in a database or server and later executed when other users visit the affected page.

For instance, consider a scenario where an attacker crafts a malicious HTTP header:

> **GET** /vulnerable-page HTTP/1.1
> Host: example.com
> **X-Forwarded-For**: <script>alert(‘XSS Attack!’);</script>
>
> Example of XSS via Header injection

When this request is sent to the vulnerable page, the payload is stored on the server. Subsequently, when other users access the page, the injected script executes, displaying an alert with the message **“XSS Attack!”**.

## **Exploiting the Stored XSS**

Exploiting the **Unauthenticated Stored XSS vulnerability** in the Photos and **Files Contest Gallery – Contact Form** plugin involves an attacker manipulating the **X-Forwarded-For HTTP header** to inject malicious code. This injected code could include payloads designed to steal user credentials, hijack sessions, or perform actions on behalf of an administrator. Since this vulnerability doesn’t require authentication, attackers can target the vulnerable page directly.

> **POC**:
>
> X-Forwarded-For: 11.11.11.11<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>
>
> This header must be contained in the request body

The potential risks associated with **CVE-2023-5307** are substantial. An attacker can gain unauthorized access to administrator privileges, potentially leading to complete control of the website. The consequences of such an attack could **include data breaches, content manipulation, and reputational damage**.

In a real-world scenario, imagine an attacker exploiting this vulnerability to elevate their privileges to that of an administrator on a website utilizing the ***Photos and Files Contest Gallery – Contact Form plugin. By injecting malicious code via the X-Forwarded-For header***, the attacker can execute arbitrary actions with the highest level of access. This could lead to website compromise, unauthorized content alterations, and data exfiltration.

## ****Recommendations for Improved Security****

To mitigate the risks posed by **CVE-2023-5307** and enhance the overall security of websites utilizing the **Photos and Files Contest Gallery – Contact Form plugin**, consider the following recommendations:

* **Update the plugin:** Promptly update the plugin to the latest version (21.2.8.1 or later), which should include a patch to address this vulnerability.
* **Input validation and sanitization:** Implement stringent input validation and data sanitization practices to prevent malicious code injection through HTTP headers.
* **Regular security assessments:** Conduct routine security audits and penetration testing to proactively identify and address vulnerabilities.
* **HTTP header security:** Configure your web server and application to sanitize and validate incoming HTTP headers effectively.
* **User education:** Educate administrators and developers about potential security threats, emphasizing best practices for header security and the importance of timely plugin updates.

> By adhering to these recommendations, website administrators can significantly reduce the risk of ***Unauthenticated Stored XSS attacks via HTTP headers*** and enhance the overall security posture of their web applications.

You are here: [Home](https://research.cleantalk.org/) » CVE-2023-5307 – Photos and Files Contest Gallery – Contact Form < 21.2.8.1 – Unauthenticated Stored XSS via HTTP Headers

During testing of the plugin, a vulnerability was discovered that allows you to cause a **Stored XSS vulnerability** on behalf of an unauthorized user, which will lead to an increase in privileges to the administrator role. The vulnerability is caused by **X-Forward-For Header Injection**.

## **Main info:**

## **Timeline**

| September 29, 2023 | Plugin testing and vulnerability detection in the **Photos and Files Contest Gallery – Contact Form** plugin have been completed |
| --- | --- |
| September 29, 2023 | I contacted the author of the plugin and provided a vulnerability PoC with a description and recommendations for fixing |
| October 5, 2023 | The author has released a fix update |
| October 9, 2023 | Registered **CVE-2023-5307** |

## **Discovery of the Vulnerability**

During the rigorous testing of the **Photos and Files Contest Gallery – Contact Form plugin**, a critical vulnerability was identified. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to trigger a **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** vulnerability, subsequently elevating their privileges to the administrator role. The root cause of this vulnerability lies in **X-Forwarded-For Header Injection**.

## **Understanding of Stored XSS attack’s**

Unauthenticated Stored XSS via HTTP Headers refers to a security flaw where malicious code is injected into a web application’s HTTP headers, typically without requiring authentication. When this manipulated header is processed by the application, the injected script is stored in a database or server and later executed when other users visit the affected page.

For instance, consider a scenario where an attacker crafts a malicious HTTP header:

> **GET** /vulnerable-page HTTP/1.1
> Host: example.com
> **X-Forwarded-For**: <script>alert(‘XSS Attack!’);</script>
>
> Example of XSS via Header injection

When this request is sent to the vulnerable page, the payload is stored on the server. Subsequently, when other users access the page, the injected script executes, displaying an alert with the message **“XSS Attack!”**.

## **Exploiting the Stored XSS**

Exploiting the **Unauthenticated Stored XSS vulnerability** in the Photos and **Files Contest Gallery – Contact Form** plugin involves an attacker manipulating the **X-Forwarded-For HTTP header** to inject malicious code. This injected code could include payloads designed to steal user credentials, hijack sessions, or perform actions on behalf of an administrator. Since this vulnerability doesn’t require authentication, attackers can target the vulnerable page directly.

> **POC**:
>
> X-Forwarded-For: 11.11.11.11<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>
>
> This header must be contained in the request body

The potential risks associated with **CVE-2023-5307** are substantial. An attacker can gain unauthorized access to administrator privileges, potentially leading to complete control of the website. The consequences of such an attack could **include data breaches, content manipulation, and reputational damage**.

In a real-world scenario, imagine an attacker exploiting this vulnerability to elevate their privileges to that of an administrator on a website utilizing the ***Photos and Files Contest Gallery – Contact Form plugin. By injecting malicious code via the X-Forwarded-For header***, the attacker can execute arbitrary actions with the highest level of access. This could lead to website compromise, unauthorized content alterations, and data exfiltration.

## ****Recommendations for Improved Security****

To mitigate the risks posed by **CVE-2023-5307** and enhance the overall security of websites utilizing the **Photos and Files Contest Gallery – Contact Form plugin**, consider the following recommendations:

* **Update the plugin:** Promptly update the plugin to the latest version (21.2.8.1 or later), which should include a patch to address this vulnerability.
* **Input validation and sanitization:** Implement stringent input validation and data sanitization practices to prevent malicious code injection through HTTP headers.
* **Regular security assessments:** Conduct routine security audits and penetration testing to proactively identify and address vulnerabilities.
* **HTTP header security:** Configure your web server and application to sanitize and validate incoming HTTP headers effectively.
* **User education:** Educate administrators and developers about potential security threats, emphasizing best practices for header security and the importance of timely plugin updates.

> By adhering to these recommendations, website administrators can significantly reduce the risk of ***Unauthenticated Stored XSS attacks via HTTP headers*** and enhance the overall security posture of their web applications.

## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Photos and Files Contest Gallery – Contact Form < 21.2.8.1 - Unauthenticated Stored XSS via HTTP Headers

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some parameters, which could allow unauthenticated users to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks via certain headers.

### Proof of Concept

1. Use a proxy such as BurpSuite to add the following header to all requests:
X-Forwarded-For: 11.11.11.11<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>
2. Create a gallery and add its shortcode to a page.
3. As an unauthenticated user, upload an image to the gallery from the frontend.
4. As an administrator, click on "Contest Gallery" in the sidebar and click "Edit Gallery" on the gallery entry to trigger the XSS.

## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Photos and Files Contest Gallery – Contact Form < 21.2.8.1 - Unauthenticated Stored XSS via HTTP Headers

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some parameters, which could allow unauthenticated users to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks via certain headers.

### Proof of Concept

1. Use a proxy such as BurpSuite to add the following header to all requests:
X-Forwarded-For: 11.11.11.11<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>
2. Create a gallery and add its shortcode to a page.
3. As an unauthenticated user, upload an image to the gallery from the frontend.
4. As an administrator, click on "Contest Gallery" in the sidebar and click "Edit Gallery" on the gallery entry to trigger the XSS.

### Affects Plugins

Purchased the PRO version of this plugin and have found it to be exactly what I was looking for. There is nothing out there like it! The backend is extensive and after about 15 minutes of playing around with it, I was able to create and customize the look, feel and function to exactly what I wanted.
In addition, the support was amazing when needed. Very quick and efficient. The creator also updates the plugin often which I love. Always improving it! Would highly recommend!

Lot of very good futures with tons of option, BUT: The UI is terrible at the back- and front end too:- design comes from ages of Netscape Navigator- incredible long options pages without tabs- can’t manage default settings- in the free version can’t hide pro options, what’s have very frustrating green backgroundI spent hours for testing, but I can’t find setting of upload qty limitation – maybe thanks for the ui.This plugin need deep knowledge, but the documentation is very-very pure.This plugin is very potent, but in this form useless for our photoclub.Sorry. We will not buy the pro (and not use the free too).

I started this year with the second Rigid Inflatable Boat Photo Contest based on the plugin. The reasons are:
Adequate after sales support: fast response and always correct solutions.
Client-centered
The jury members find it easy to vote and comment.
A few remarks:
As an admin the UI needs some getting used to.
There are many ways to sort but I would really like to sort alphabetically as well.
The search function needs some attention, it can be more accurate.
Overall
I’ve searched for plugins to have a competition on my website and this one ticks all the boxes for me. Congrats to the developers and the helpdesk.

# CVE-2023-5307 – Photos and Files Contest Gallery – Contact Form < 21.2.8.1 – Unauthenticated Stored XSS via HTTP Headers

You are here: [Home](https://research.cleantalk.org/) » CVE-2023-5307 – Photos and Files Contest Gallery – Contact Form < 21.2.8.1 – Unauthenticated Stored XSS via HTTP Headers

During testing of the plugin, a vulnerability was discovered that allows you to cause a **Stored XSS vulnerability** on behalf of an unauthorized user, which will lead to an increase in privileges to the administrator role. The vulnerability is caused by **X-Forward-For Header Injection**.

## **Main info:**

| Plugin Security Certification by CleanTalk |  |

## **Timeline**

| September 29, 2023 | Plugin testing and vulnerability detection in the **Photos and Files Contest Gallery – Contact Form** plugin have been completed |
| --- | --- |
| September 29, 2023 | I contacted the author of the plugin and provided a vulnerability PoC with a description and recommendations for fixing |
| October 5, 2023 | The author has released a fix update |
| October 9, 2023 | Registered **CVE-2023-5307** |

## **Discovery of the Vulnerability**

During the rigorous testing of the **Photos and Files Contest Gallery – Contact Form plugin**, a critical vulnerability was identified. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to trigger a **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** vulnerability, subsequently elevating their privileges to the administrator role. The root cause of this vulnerability lies in **X-Forwarded-For Header Injection**.

## **Understanding of Stored XSS attack’s**

Unauthenticated Stored XSS via HTTP Headers refers to a security flaw where malicious code is injected into a web application’s HTTP headers, typically without requiring authentication. When this manipulated header is processed by the application, the injected script is stored in a database or server and later executed when other users visit the affected page.

For instance, consider a scenario where an attacker crafts a malicious HTTP header:

> **GET** /vulnerable-page HTTP/1.1
> Host: example.com
> **X-Forwarded-For**: <script>alert(‘XSS Attack!’);</script>
>
> Example of XSS via Header injection

When this request is sent to the vulnerable page, the payload is stored on the server. Subsequently, when other users access the page, the injected script executes, displaying an alert with the message **“XSS Attack!”**.

## **Exploiting the Stored XSS**

Exploiting the **Unauthenticated Stored XSS vulnerability** in the Photos and **Files Contest Gallery – Contact Form** plugin involves an attacker manipulating the **X-Forwarded-For HTTP header** to inject malicious code. This injected code could include payloads designed to steal user credentials, hijack sessions, or perform actions on behalf of an administrator. Since this vulnerability doesn’t require authentication, attackers can target the vulnerable page directly.

> **POC**:
>
> X-Forwarded-For: 11.11.11.11<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>
>
> This header must be contained in the request body

The potential risks associated with **CVE-2023-5307** are substantial. An attacker can gain unauthorized access to administrator privileges, potentially leading to complete control of the website. The consequences of such an attack could **include data breaches, content manipulation, and reputational damage**.

In a real-world scenario, imagine an attacker exploiting this vulnerability to elevate their privileges to that of an administrator on a website utilizing the ***Photos and Files Contest Gallery – Contact Form plugin. By injecting malicious code via the X-Forwarded-For header***, the attacker can execute arbitrary actions with the highest level of access. This could lead to website compromise, unauthorized content alterations, and data exfiltration.

## ****Recommendations for Improved Security****

To mitigate the risks posed by **CVE-2023-5307** and enhance the overall security of websites utilizing the **Photos and Files Contest Gallery – Contact Form plugin**, consider the following recommendations:

* **Update the plugin:** Promptly update the plugin to the latest version (21.2.8.1 or later), which should include a patch to address this vulnerability.
* **Input validation and sanitization:** Implement stringent input validation and data sanitization practices to prevent malicious code injection through HTTP headers.
* **Regular security assessments:** Conduct routine security audits and penetration testing to proactively identify and address vulnerabilities.
* **HTTP header security:** Configure your web server and application to sanitize and validate incoming HTTP headers effectively.
* **User education:** Educate administrators and developers about potential security threats, emphasizing best practices for header security and the importance of timely plugin updates.

> By adhering to these recommendations, website administrators can significantly reduce the risk of ***Unauthenticated Stored XSS attacks via HTTP headers*** and enhance the overall security posture of their web applications.

CleanTalk is a Cloud security service that protects your website from online threats and provides you great security instruments to control your website security. We provide detailed security stats for all of our security features to have a full control of security. All security logs are stored in the cloud for 45 days.

Security FireWall by CleanTalk is a free plugin which works with the premium Cloud security service cleantalk.org. This security plugin as a service https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software\_as\_a\_service.

Malware always becomes a headache for site owners. If you don’t regularly check for malware, it will be able to work insensibly a lot of time and damage your reputation. If you prevent malware attacks before they happen, you will be able to save your resources.

What is malware and why does it matter to your business? Malware is malicious code that performs actions for hackers. If your site has been infected with malware it will be able a problem for customer trust and their personal details. First, you need to scan your site to confirm the malware exists. The next step you should fix all files with malware.

#### Limit Login Attempts

Limit Login Attempts – is a part of brute-force protection and security firewall.

Security Firewall has a limit for requests to your website (by default 1000 requests per hour, so you can change it) and if any IP exceed this threshold it will be added to security firewall for next 24 hours. It allows you to break some of the DDoS attacks.

#### Brute Force Protection

It adds a few seconds delay for any failed attempt to login to WordPress admin area. WordPress Security & Firewall by CleanTalk makes access to your website more secure. Service will check your security log once per hour and if some IP’s have 10 and more attempts to log in per hour, then these IP’s will be banned for next 24 hours.

*Security Audit Log* keeps track of actions in the WP Dashboard to let you know what is happening on your blog.

With the Security Audit Log is very easy to see user activity in order to understand what changes have done and who made them.

Security Audit Log shows who logged in and when and how much time they spent on each page.

#### Security Traffic Control

CleanTalk security Traffic Control will track every single visitor no matter if they are using JavaScript or not and provides many valuable traffic parameters.

Another option in Security Traffic Control – “Block user after requests amounts more than” – blocks access to the site for any IP that has exceeded the number of HTTP requests per hour. If this number of requests will be exceeded, this IP will be added to the Security FireWall Black List for 24 hours.

#### Security Firewall

To enhance the security of your site, you can use the CleanTalk Security FireWall, which will allow you to block access by HTTP/HTTPS to your website for individual IP addresses, IP networks and block access to users from specific countries. Use personal BlackList to block IP addresses with a suspicious activity to enhance the WordPress security.

Security FireWall may significantly reduce the risk of hacking and reduces the load on your web server.

CleanTalk Security is fully compatible with the most popular VPN services.

Also, CleanTalk security supports all search engines Google, Bing, Yahoo, Baidu, MSN, Yandex and etc.

#### Security Malware Scanner

Scans WordPress files for hacker files or code for hacker code.

Security Malware Scanner runs manually in the settings. All of the results will send in your Security CleanTalk Dashboard with the details and you will be able to investigate them and see if that was a legitimate change or some bad code was injected.

CleanTalk Antivirus protects your website from viruses and deletes infected code from files. Antivirus scans not only WP core, it will check all of the files on your WordPress. Heuristics antivirus scan allows finding malware/viruses code by bad php constructions.

CleanTalk Security has a “Feedback System” for analyzing suspicious files. This is the client-server feature in CleanTalk Security that allows sending suspicious files from the WordPress backend to CleanTalk cloud.

Security Malware Scanner shows a list of suspicious files and you can view code that was indicated as bad. If you don’t have programming experience and don’t know, is there security issue or not, you will be able to send some files to CleanTalk and we will check them for malware code. After checking we will send you an email notification with results, is there viruses or not.

Every day, CleanTalk Security Malware Scanner will check new files and files that have been changed from the last scanning.

Please, look at our guide How malware file analysis works.

[About Scanner Feedback System](https://cleantalk.org/help/files-analysis "About Scanner Feedback System")

#### Security Malware Heuristic Check

This option allows you to check files of plugins and themes with heuristic analysis. Probably it will find more than you expect.

#### Security Malware scanner to find SQL Injections

The CleanTalk Security Malware Scanner allows you to find code that allows performing SQL injection. It is this problem that the scanner solves.

#### Scanner of known vulnerabilities

Plugin checks installed plugins and themes for known (published) vulnerabilities. If finds vulnerable plugin/theme, it sends an Email notification and shows data in the WordPress Dashboard.

#### Web Application FireWall (WAF) for WordPress Security Plugin

The main purpose of Web Application FireWall (WAF) is real-time protection from unauthorized access, even if there are critical known/unknown vulnerabilities.

Security Web Application FireWall catches all requests to your website and checks HTTP parameters that include: SQL Injection, Cross Site Scripting (XSS), uploading files from non-authorised users, PHP constructions/code, the presence of malicious code in the downloaded files.

In addition to effective information security and information security applications are required to know what is quality of protection and CleanTalk Security has logged all blocked requests that allow you to know and analyze accurate information. You can see your Cleantalk Security Logs in your Control panel. https://cleantalk.org/my/logs\_firewall

CleanTalk’s research team updates WAF database each time as we find a vulnerability, it means plugin’s users get protection even against unpublished vulnurebilites.

[About Security Web Application Firewall](https://cleantalk.org/help/security-waf "About Web Application Firewall")

#### Improve your website security with Two Factor Authentication

It requires a bit of your time but Two Factor (2 Step) Authentication immediately gives a much higher level of security.

With your first authorization, the CleanTalk Security plugin remembers your browser and you won’t have to input your authorization code every time anymore. However, if you started to use a new device or a new browser then you are required to input your security authorization code. CleanTalk security plugin will remember your browser for 30 days.

#### Change the URL of the wp-login page

This option helps you change the default wp-login URL. Hackers use scripts for massive brute-force attacks, and since most sites use a default login page URL, hackers configure scripts for such URLs. When you change the URL of the authorization page, hackers will not have the opportunity to perform brute-force attacks in scripts in automatic mode.

To enable the option, go to the WP Dashboard plugin settings -> Settings -> Security by CleanTalk -> General Settings and check box Change address to login script. Then add a new URL and click Save Settings.

This option does not change files and does not rewrite URLs in system files. To return the address of the default authorization page, it is enough to disable the option in the plugin settings or set a new value.

If you are using caching plugins, then you need to add a new authorization page in the caching exceptions.

#### Can I use CleanTalk Security and Wordfence together

Sure, you can use CleanTalk Security and Wordfence. Quite often we get question from our customers, will there be a conflict between CleanTalk and Wordfence? We tested CleanTalk Security and Wordfence working together and they work without any conflicts.

#### Email Notifications when administrators are logged in

We added this option to our security plugin. Now you can receive notifications if you want to know about an unauthorized entrance to your WP Dashboard.

Notification will be sent only when a user was able to authorize entering login and password. If you are logged into the admin panel from the saved session, then the alert won’t be sent.

You can enable the option “Receive notifications for admin authorizations in your CleanTalk Dashboard. Choose “Site Security” in the “Services” menu, then click “Settings”.

#### Can CleanTalk Security protect from DDoS?

Security FireWall can mitigate HTTP/HTTPS DDoS attacks. When an intruder makes GET requests to attack your website, Security FireWall blocks all requests from bad IP addresses. If your website under DDoS attack you will be able to add IPs to your personal BlackList to block all Post and GET requests.

#### `Send additional HTTP headers` option

There are several additional http-headers which added to the every http-requests by the plugin if this option is enabled:

– “X-Content-Type-Options” improves the security of your site (and your users) against some types of drive-by-downloads.

– “X-XSS-Protection” header improves the security of your site against some types of XSS (cross-site scripting) attacks.

– “Strict-Transport-Security” response header (often abbreviated as HSTS) informs browsers that the site should only be accessed using HTTPS, and that any future attempts to access it using HTTP should automatically be converted to HTTPS.

– “Referrer-Policy” make the `Referer` http-header transferring more strictly.

#### File System Watcher feature

File system Watcher monitors changes in the file system. This allows to quickly respond to a site infection by tracking which files were affected. The Watcher makes file system snapshots as often as one hour and show difference up to seven days time frame.

## FAQ

### Why are they attacking me?

Hackers want to get access to your website and use it to get backlinks from your site to improve their site’s PageRank or redirect your visitors to malicious sites or use your website to send spam and viruses or other attacks.These attacks can damage your reputation with readers and commentators if you fail to tackle it.

2. Type address YOUR\_WEBSITE/?security\_test\_ip=ANY\_IP\_FROM\_BLACK\_LIST

   2.1 Address 10.10.10.10 is local address and it’s in blacklist constantly. So address YOUR\_WEBSITE/?security\_test\_ip=10.10.10.10 will works everytime.
3. Make sure that you saw page with the blocking message.
4. FireWall works properly, if it is not, see item 4 of the list.

### How does malware scanner work?

Malware scanner will check and compare with the original WP files and show you what files were changed, deleted or added. Malware scanner could be used to find an added code in WP files. On your Malware Security Log page, you will see the list of all scans that were performed for your website. The CleanTalk Cloud saves the list of the found files for you to know where to look them for.

### How to start malware scanner?

At the moment malware scanner may be started one time per day and manually.

To start malware scanner go to the WordPress Admin Page —> Settings —> Security by CleanTalk —> “Malware Scanner” tab —> Perform Scan.

Give the Malware Scanner some time to check all necessary files on your website.

### Is it free or paid?

The plugin is free. But the plugin uses CleanTalk cloud security service. You have to register an account and then you will receive a free trial to test. When the trial (on CleanTalk account) is finished, you can renew the subscription for 1 year or deactivate the Security by CleanTalk plugin.

If you haven’t got access key, the plugin will work and you will have logs only on the plugin settings page for last 20 requests.

### What happens after the end of the trial period?

The plugin will fully perform its functions after the end of the trial period and will protect your website from brute force attacks and will keep Action Log in your WP Dashboard, but the number of entries in the log will be limited to the last 20 entries/24 hours. Also, you will receive a short daily security report to your email.

Premium version allows to storage all logs for 45 days in the CleanTalk Dashboard for further analysis.

### Brute Force security for WordPress

Brute force attack is an exhaustive password search to get full access to an Administrator account. Passwords are not the hard part for hackers taking into account the quantity of sent password variants per second and the big amount of IP-addresses.

Brute force attack is one of the most security issues as an intruder gets full access to your website and can change your code. Consequences of these break-ins might be grievous, your website could be added to the [botnet] and it could participate in attacks to other websites, it could be used to keep hidden links or automatic redirection to a suspicious website. Consequences for your website reputation might be very grievous.

### Why is the CleanTalk Security Plugin Added to the Must Use Section?

This is required for the Security FireWall to function properly. Plugins that are placed in this section are being launched first, so it is very important that the Security FireWall is launched before any plugins and hooks. Thus, hacker requests will be stopped before they can get access to any site code.
