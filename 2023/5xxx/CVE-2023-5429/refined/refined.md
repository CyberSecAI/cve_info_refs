Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-5429

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient escaping of user-supplied parameters and a lack of sufficient preparation in the SQL query within the Information Reel plugin's shortcode functionality. Specifically, the `IR_type` parameter was not sanitized before being used in the SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The plugin is vulnerable to SQL injection, which allows attackers to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database queries. This is due to the lack of proper sanitization/parameterization of the `IR_type` parameter when constructing the SQL query. Specifically, the code was concatenating the user-provided value directly into the SQL query string.
- The vulnerable code is located in the function `IR_Show_Widget` in `information-reel.php` prior to the fix:
```php
128	$sSql = "select IR_path,IR_link,IR_target,IR_title,IR_desc from ".WP_IR_TABLE." where 1=1 and IR_status='YES'";
129	if($IR_type <> "" )
130	{
131	    $sSql = $sSql . " and IR_type='".$IR_type."'";
132	}
```

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database by injecting malicious SQL queries.
- **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could modify or delete data in the database.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers might be able to gain higher privileges or take control of the WordPress site.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Shortcode:** The vulnerability is exploited through the plugin's shortcode, specifically by manipulating the `group` attribute, which is mapped to the `IR_type` variable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least subscriber-level permissions.
- **Knowledge of the Plugin Shortcode:** The attacker needs to know how to use the shortcode and its parameters to inject SQL code.
- **Ability to Insert Shortcodes:** The attacker needs the ability to insert shortcodes in posts or pages or any other content area.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerable code was fixed by using `$wpdb->prepare()` to sanitize the input.
```php
131	   $sSql = $sSql . " and IR_type = %s ";
132     $sSql = $wpdb->prepare($sSql, $IR_type);
```
- The vulnerability was present in versions up to and including 10.0 of the Information Reel plugin.
- The fix was included in version 10.1.
- The Wordfence report references the specific vulnerable code lines in the plugin's files, as well as the commit that patched the issue.
