- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes within the 'advMenu' shortcode.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. These scripts will execute whenever a user accesses the injected page.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploiting the 'advMenu' shortcode by injecting malicious scripts through user-supplied attributes.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be an authenticated user with contributor-level or higher permissions.
