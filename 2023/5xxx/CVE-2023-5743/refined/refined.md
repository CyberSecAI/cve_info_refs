- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes in the `telnumlink` shortcode.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages, which will execute when a user accesses the injected page. This could lead to various malicious actions, such as redirecting users to phishing sites, stealing cookies, or performing unauthorized actions on behalf of the user.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered via the `telnumlink` shortcode of the Telephone Number Linker WordPress plugin. The attacker needs to be able to create or edit posts/pages.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Authenticated attacker with contributor-level or higher permissions in WordPress. They need the ability to create or edit content that uses shortcodes.
