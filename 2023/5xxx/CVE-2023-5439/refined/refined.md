Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-5439

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient escaping of user-supplied parameters and lack of sufficient preparation in the SQL query within the `Wp photo text slider 50` plugin. Specifically, the `type` attribute in the `[wp-photo-slider]` shortcode is not sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The plugin is vulnerable to SQL injection because the `type` parameter from the shortcode is directly included in the SQL query without proper sanitization or use of prepared statements, leading to an exploitable vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Exfiltration:** Attackers can use the SQL injection to extract sensitive information from the database by injecting arbitrary SQL queries.
- **Data Manipulation:** The vulnerability could potentially allow attackers to modify or delete data in the database.
- **Complete Compromise:** In severe cases, successful exploitation could lead to complete compromise of the WordPress database and potentially the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Shortcode Injection:** The attack is carried out by crafting a malicious `[wp-photo-slider]` shortcode with a manipulated `type` parameter.
- **Authenticated Users:** The attacker must be an authenticated user with at least subscriber-level permissions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have an account on the WordPress site with at least subscriber-level permissions.
- The attacker needs to insert the malicious shortcode into a post or page.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerable code is located in the `wp_50_show_shortcode` function within the `wp-photo-text-slider-50.php` file.
- The SQL query is constructed using string concatenation, which incorporates the unsanitized `wp_50_type` variable derived from the shortcode's `type` attribute.
-  The fix implemented in version 8.1 uses `$wpdb->prepare()` to sanitize the input and prevent the SQL injection vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

- The Wordfence article provides a CVSS score of 8.8, categorizing it as a "High" severity vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was publicly disclosed on October 30, 2023, and patched in version 8.1 of the plugin.
- The provided changeset shows that the vulnerable code used string concatenation, while the fixed version employs `$wpdb->prepare()` for secure query construction.

This detailed breakdown should provide a comprehensive understanding of the vulnerability described in CVE-2023-5439.
