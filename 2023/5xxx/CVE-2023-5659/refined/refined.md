Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the `interact-quiz` shortcode.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-provided input within shortcode attributes, allowing attackers to inject malicious web scripts that are then stored in the database. These scripts are executed when a user accesses a page containing the injected shortcode.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
*   **Potential for Malicious Actions:** This could lead to various malicious activities, including:
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Stealing session cookies or other sensitive information.
    *   Modifying the content of the webpage.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the logged-in user.
    *   Defacing websites

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Shortcode Injection:** The vulnerability is triggered through the `interact-quiz` shortcode. An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the attributes of this shortcode.
*   **Authenticated Users:** The attack requires an authenticated user with contributor-level permissions or higher to be able to add malicious shortcodes into posts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **WordPress Account:** The attacker needs a WordPress account with at least contributor-level permissions to create or edit posts and inject shortcodes.
*   **Knowledge of Shortcode:** The attacker needs to know how to use the `interact-quiz` shortcode and manipulate its attributes to include malicious code.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability exists in all versions of the "Interact: Embed A Quiz On Your Site" plugin up to and including 3.0.7.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 3.1 of the plugin.
*   The `interact-embed` shortcode is also present but is not specified in the CVE description as being vulnerable.
