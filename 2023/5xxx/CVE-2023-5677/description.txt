Brandon
Rothel from QED Secure Solutions has found that the VAPIX API tcptest.cgi
did not have a sufficient input validation allowing for a possible remote code
execution. This flaw can only be exploited after authenticating with an
operator- or administrator-privileged service account. The impact of exploiting
this vulnerability is lower with operator-privileges compared to
administrator-privileges service accounts. Axis has released patched AXIS OS
versions for the highlighted flaw. Please refer to the Axis security advisory
for more information and solution.
