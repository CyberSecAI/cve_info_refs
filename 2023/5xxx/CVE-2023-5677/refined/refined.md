- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient input validation in the VAPIX API tcptest.cgi.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Remote code execution vulnerability due to lack of input validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  Remote code execution. The impact is lower with operator-privileges compared to administrator-privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered through the VAPIX API tcptest.cgi.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Remote access to the vulnerable API endpoint. The required privileges to exploit this vulnerability is unspecified but the impact is lower with operator-privileges compared to administrator-privileges.
