- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress Google XML Sitemap for Images plugin lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor could force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact varies on a case-by-case basis.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious actor can craft a request that, when triggered by an authenticated user, performs actions within the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick an authenticated user into performing an action, such as clicking on a malicious link or visiting a compromised website. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to perform the CSRF attack.
