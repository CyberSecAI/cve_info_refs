Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- In version 15 of the `angular-server-side-configuration` package, the environment variable detection was widened to the entire project, relative to the `angular.json` file. This change caused the tool to search for environment variable usages in all files within the project, instead of just the intended environment files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability lies in the fact that environment variables intended for a backend/service, which might contain sensitive information, could be detected and written to the `ngssc.json` file during the build process. This file is then used to populate variables in the `index.html` file, potentially exposing these sensitive environment variables to the client-side application.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information, such as:
    - Internal application details, like used services or tools.
    - Secrets that are also available on the deployed environment, such as API keys, database credentials, or other sensitive configurations.
- The vulnerability is more severe in monorepo setups where a frontend Angular application shares the same repository with a Node.js backend or other services.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based. An attacker doesn't need to be physically present to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker doesn't require any privileges or user interaction to exploit this vulnerability. The exposure happens when the application is built and deployed.
- The attacker needs to be able to view the `index.html` file.
