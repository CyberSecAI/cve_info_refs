…ern ([#75](https://github.com/kyubisation/angular-server-side-configuration/pull/75))

With version 15, the behavior of the environment variable lookup changed to try to find occurrences in the whole workspace. This could lead to a potential information disclosure vulnerability, by exposing environment variables meant for a backend/Node.js application.
This PR mitigates this possibility, by restricting the lookup path of environment variables to `sourceRoot` of the related angular.json project and excluding files having `server` in their name (a common pattern for universal apps).

|  |  | ## Changes with version 15.1 |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | With the change in version 15 to search all files for environment variables, a potential |
|  |  | information disclosure vulnerability was introduced, as unintended environment variables might |
|  |  | be exposed. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | You might be affected, if you use environment variables in your angular.json workspace that expose |
|  |  | application internals (like used services/tools) or secrets that are also available on the |
|  |  | deployed environment (e.g. a monorepo that also contains a Node.js backend, which is deployed in |
|  |  | the same system/container/pod as the frontend bundle). |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | This should have little to no impact, if you only have a simple angular.json workspace without |
|  |  | a backend component. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | With 15.1 this risk is mitigated, as the lookup path is restricted by adding an option |
|  |  | `searchPattern` which defaults to `{sourceRoot}/\*\*/!(\*server\*).ts` (only search `sourceRoot` |
|  |  | of the related angular.json project and exclude files with `server` in the name). |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ## Changes with version 15 |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | With version 15 of the Angular CLI, environment files are no longer generated by default. In |
|  |  | order to adapt, using `ng add angular-server-side-configuration` will try to add the import in |
|  |  | either `app.module.ts`, `app.components.ts` or `main.ts` depending on availability. The ngssc |
|  |  | builder will also now search all files for environment variable usages instead of just the |
|  |  | defined environment file. Due to this, the `ngsscEnvironmentFile` option can be removed. |
|  |  | either `environment.prod.ts`, `environment.ts`, `app.module.ts`, `app.components.ts` or `main.ts` |
|  |  | depending on availability. The ngssc builder will also now search all files for environment |
|  |  | variable usages instead of just the defined environment file. Due to this, the |
|  |  | `ngsscEnvironmentFile` option can be removed. |

* add searchPattern as an option and restrict default search pattern ([#75](https://github.com/kyubisation/angular-server-side-configuration/issues/75)) ([d701f51](https://github.com/kyubisation/angular-server-side-configuration/commit/d701f51260637a84ede278e248934e0437a7ff86))

### Bug Fixes

* use correct path for environment files in ng-add ([421b3ff](https://github.com/kyubisation/angular-server-side-configuration/commit/421b3ff3bc81ba263d975adf8478136397215a85))

## Security Notice

With the change in version 15 to search all files for environment variables, a potential information disclosure vulnerability was introduced, as unintended environment variables might be exposed.

You might be affected, if you use environment variables in your angular.json workspace that expose application internals (like used services/tools) or secrets that are also available on the deployed environment (e.g. a monorepo that also contains a Node.js backend, which is deployed in the same system/container/pod as the frontend bundle).

This should have little to no impact, if you only have a simple angular.json workspace without a backend component.

With 15.1 this risk is mitigated, as the lookup path is restricted by adding an option searchPattern which defaults to {sourceRoot}/\*\*/!(*server*).ts (only search sourceRoot of the related angular.json project and exclude files with server in the name).

# angular-server-side-configuration information disclosure vulnerability in monorepo with node.js backend

Critical

[kyubisation](/kyubisation)
published
GHSA-gwvm-vrp4-4pp5
Mar 24, 2023

## Package

npm

angular-server-side-configuration
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

>= 15.0.0, < 15.1.0

## Patched versions

15.1.0

## Description

### Impact

angular-server-side-configuration detects used environment variables in TypeScript (.ts) files during build time of an Angular CLI project. The detected environment variables are written to a ngssc.json file in the output directory.

During deployment of an Angular based app, the environment variables based on the variables from ngssc.json are inserted into the apps index.html (or defined index file).

With version 15 the environment variable detection was widened to the entire project, relative to the angular.json file from the Angular CLI. In a monorepo setup, this could lead to environment variables intended for a backend/service to be detected and written to the ngssc.json, which would then be populated and exposed via index.html.

This has NO IMPACT, in a plain Angular project that has no backend component.

### Patches

Vulnerability has been mitigated in 15.1.0, by adding an option `searchPattern` which restricts the detection file range by default.

```
# Update via npm
npm update angular-server-side-configuration
## Or more specific
npm install angular-server-side-configuration@15.1.0

# Update via pnpm
pnpm update angular-server-side-configuration
## Or more specific
pnpm add angular-server-side-configuration@15.1.0

# Update via yarn
yarn update angular-server-side-configuration
## Or more specific
yarn add angular-server-side-configuration@15.1.0
```
### Workarounds

Manually edit or create ngssc.json or run a script after ngssc.json generation

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
