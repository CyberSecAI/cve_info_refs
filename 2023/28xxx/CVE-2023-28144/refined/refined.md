Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2023-28144.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from the `elevate_perf_privileges.sh` script in Hotspot, which is intended to temporarily elevate privileges to allow performance profiling. The script uses `chown` to change the ownership of a temporary file to root, then back to the original user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Insecure File Handling:** The script takes an arbitrary path as input for the temporary file, without any validation. This allows an attacker to provide a path to any file on the system, including files owned by root, for example `/etc/shadow`.
- **Uncontrolled `chown` Calls:** The script uses `chown` to change ownership of a file first to root and then to the original user.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The combination of arbitrary path input and the `chown` calls allows any local user to take ownership of any file on the system, including files owned by root.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Local Root Exploit:** By providing the path to a root-owned file, such as `/etc/shadow`, an unprivileged user can take ownership of the file, potentially leading to a local root exploit. Although the initial intention is to elevate user privileges to enable profiling capabilities, the method used inadvertently allows any user with access to the system to modify the ownership of critical system files.
- **Arbitrary File Ownership Change:** Even without directly leading to root access, an attacker could simply change the ownership of any file, disrupting the system.
- **Abuse of Polkit:** If Polkit authentication policies are relaxed to avoid authentication prompts, this exploit becomes very easily accessible to all local users.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** An attacker needs local access to the system to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Arbitrary File Path:** The attacker can specify an arbitrary path to a file on the system through the first argument to the `elevate_perf_privileges.sh` script.
- **Polkit Configuration (Optional):** The vulnerability can be exploited by any local user if Polkit authentication requirements are relaxed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local User:** The attacker must be a local user on the system where Hotspot is installed.
- **No Elevated Privileges Required:** The attacker does not require initial root privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Basic Knowledge of File Paths:** The attacker needs to know or guess the path to a file to exploit.
- **Ability to Run Hotspot:** The attacker needs to be able to run the Hotspot application which internally executes the vulnerable script.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is present from version v1.3.0 of Hotspot onward.
- The vulnerability exists regardless of the authentication method used (kauth, pkexec, kdesudo, kdesu).
- The original intention is that `elevate_perf_privileges.sh` is executed as root after some authentication is successful but, the vulnerability in the script allows for abuse by any local user if Polkit policies are relaxed.

The provided document also details the timeline of disclosure and proposed fixes which involve replacing the current approach with `pkexec` and using pipes instead of temporary files.
