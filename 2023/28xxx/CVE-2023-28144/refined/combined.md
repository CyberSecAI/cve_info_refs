# ChangeLog for hotspot v1.5.0

The hotspot v1.5.0 release is finally here 🎉

It comes packed with a wealth of code cleanups, bug fixes and new functionality.

Most notably, the disassembly view has been further improved with better searching,

highlighting and faster performance.

Furthermore, we reworked the authentication mechanism to allow `perf record` get

run directly with elevated priveleges via `pkexec`, obsoleting the error prone

old mechanism (see also <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28144>).

We now also fully support Qt6 and KF6, while keeping compatibility with Qt5

and KF5. The AppImage below is still build with Qt5 but it might be the last

time that we do this. The next version might become Qt6 only.

Many thanks to the various contributors that help build this software, both

by writing code as well as reporting bugs.

Happy profiling everyone 🚀

[v1.4.0 - better disassembly view and more](/KDAB/hotspot/releases/tag/v1.4.0)

This feature release contains close to 400 commits since the last stable v1.3.0 release. It comes with its usual assorted list of bug fixes and performance improvements. Additionally, there are some new noteworthy features:

* a greatly improved disassembly view with a godbolt-like source code annotation

  [![Screenshot_20221202_225019](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57207/205396114-039f5d09-a8a6-4022-96a7-83ee2692913f.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57207/205396114-039f5d09-a8a6-4022-96a7-83ee2692913f.png)
* the self cost columns for tracepoints are now hidden by default, as they would always show 0 except for the function that contains the tracepoint. the inclusive cost column is much more useful
* more flexible window layouting with KDDockWidgets
* you can export and import data from hotspot in a custom format that is efficient to load and self-contained, meaning exported data can be read on any other machine with hotspot and does not require access to the original client application code for unwinding anymore

  *note:* this feature is broken in this release when using the AppImage, see [#441](https://github.com/KDAB/hotspot/issues/441) and stay tuned for a 1.4.1 release that will contain a fix for this issue
* analysis data can be grouped by thread, process or CPU
* demangling for the D programming language
* a new frequency page that shows how often certain events got measured, which can also indicate the CPU frequency scaling when `cycles` are measured
* new GitHub actions based CI and continuous AppImage build

[v1.3.0 - performance improvements, zstd compression and rust demangling support](/KDAB/hotspot/releases/tag/v1.3.0)

Hotspot became much faster at interpreting data for large complex applications: Analyzing `perf.data` files for `firefox` e.g. with its monster `libxul` is now magnitudes faster than it was previously.

On top of that, we now properly support analysis of zstd compressed data files, i.e. those obtained via `perf record -z`. This feature easily reduces the size of the `perf.data` files by one to two orders of magnitude.

The timeline has been improved and now shows tick marks on the time axes, as well as smart time unit prefixes when zoomed in.

Additionally, hotspot can now demangle `rustc` symbols. And finally the perfparser submodule was updated with tons of fixes and improvements, such as better support for fork-based parallelism.

Fixed issues in this release:

* [#116](https://github.com/KDAB/hotspot/issues/116): Unable to widen "Symbol" column in Top Down view
* [#173](https://github.com/KDAB/hotspot/issues/173): Feature Request: Support gksu for "Profile System" in AppImage
* [#189](https://github.com/KDAB/hotspot/issues/189): better formatting of times and trace costs in flamegraph and tooltips
* [#190](https://github.com/KDAB/hotspot/issues/190): fix time formatting
* [#192](https://github.com/KDAB/hotspot/issues/192): Loading a trace is much slower in 1.2 than in 1.1
* [#197](https://github.com/KDAB/hotspot/issues/197): Perfparser exits with code 1 (TCP Socket error) when opening a perf.data file
* [#205](https://github.com/KDAB/hotspot/issues/205): feature: open editor on function
* [#220](https://github.com/KDAB/hotspot/issues/220): group threads by process
* [#224](https://github.com/KDAB/hotspot/issues/224): android simpleperf support
* [#230](https://github.com/KDAB/hotspot/issues/230): Timeline part takes too much space
* [#234](https://github.com/KDAB/hotspot/issues/234): Profile system is broken
* [#236](https://github.com/KDAB/hotspot/issues/236): README required dependencies (QT5) out of date with master branch cmake
* [#237](https://github.com/KDAB/hotspot/issues/237): proper rust symbol demangling
* [#239](https://github.com/KDAB/hotspot/issues/239): enable rust demangling for appimages

[v1.2.0 - adds off-CPU profiling support](/KDAB/hotspot/releases/tag/v1.2.0)

Hotspot can now be used to analyze off-CPU time, i.e. time where your application is switched out and not running. This can be used to find heavy lock contention, synchronous I/O wait time and more. The record page offers a simple check box to enable this feature. If you run `perf record` directly from the command line and only use hotspot to visualize the results, make sure to pass the following flags:

```
perf record --call-graph dwarf -e cycles -e sched:sched_switch --switch-events --sample-cpu ...

```

The record page in hotspot now also has the capability to elevate your user permissions temporarily using `kdesu`, to allow recording of e.g. off-CPU data even as non-root.

The v1.2.0 release also adds quite a few bug fixes, performance improvements and also some other new features. Notable is the addition of a per-CPU core event timeline, which depends on the `--sample-cpu` flag being passed to `perf record`. Furthermore, you can now filter events by symbols: Right click on any of the data tables or views and then select the 'filter in/out by symbol` action.

Hey all,

I have the pleasure to finally announce the availability of hotspot v1.1.0. Hotspot is a GUI for Linux perf. Right now, it's a drop-in replacement for (parts of) `perf report`. It aims to be easier to use, but comes with powerful features to analyze the profiler data. This release adds

* event time line with advanced filtering capabilities
* record page to run perf on newly launched applications or to attach to running processes
* AppImage for easier consumption, esp. on older distros

Subject: Security issue in Hotspot elevate_perf_privileges.sh (CVE-2023-28144)

Hello list,

this report is about a possible security vulnerability I found in the Hotspot
[1] project.

An openSUSE packager for hotspot requested a review of a Hotspot update to
version 1.4.1. This version contained a newly added D-Bus helper and Polkit
authentication. During the review I found a vulnerability in the helper script
`elevate_perf_privileges.sh` that is likely not exploitable by default, but
could easily become a local root exploit when Polkit configuration is changed
or an alternative authentication mechanism with weak authentication
requirements is used.

[1]: <https://github.com/KDAB/hotspot.git>
[2]: <https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1208808>

Introduction
============

Hotspot is a GUI application for doing performance profiling anylsis
based on Linux performance counters. This report is about the v1.4.1 version
tag in the upstream repository.

The Issue
=========

Hotspot temporarily changes Linux Kernel sysctl settings and permissions of
the `debugfs` and `tracefs` file systems to allow running the GUI application
as unprivileged users. The issue is related to privilege escalation logic
which is carried out by the `elevate_perf_privileges.sh` script. This script
is invoked as root via a range of potential mechanisms like pkexec, kdesu or a
D-Bus based KDE kauth authentication helper. The mechanism is selected during
runtime with a prioritization of kauth > pkexec > kdesudo > kdesu.

The script receives the path to a temporary file which is by default safely
created in /tmp via the `QTemporaryFile` class in "src/perfrecord.cpp:142".
The script contains the following logic during early startup:

```sh
    if [ ! -z "$1" ]; then
        olduser=$(stat -c '%u' "$1")
        chown "$(whoami)" "$1"
        echo "rewriting to $1"
        # redirect output to file, to enable parsing of output even when
        # the graphical sudo helper like kdesudo isn't forwarding the text properly
        $0 2>&1 | tee -a "$1"
        chown "$olduser" "$1"
        exit
    fi
```

The two `chown` invocations on the temporary file result in a temporary change
of the ownership of the temporary file to root, which is originally owned by
the unprivileged user. It changes ownership of the provided path first to
`root`, then reexecutes itself, then changes ownership back to the original
user.

This offers the following attack vectors:

- giving ownership of an arbitrary file to root
- giving ownership of an arbitrary file to the unprivileged user

The script accepts arbitrary paths and doesn't check where the file is located
and what its ownership is. Thus the path can also be a file in any other
directory. Therefore even without having to win a race condition or using a
symlink attack, an attacker can simply specify a path to an already existing
file owned by root e.g. /etc/shadow, which will in the end be owned by the
unprivileged user.

It can be argued that this script can only be invoked as root if the root
password has been supplied to kdesu, pkexec or the Kauth framework and thus
requires root privileges in the first place. Since the Polkit authentication
framework is likely used though, there is a certain chance that users or
integrators want to get rid of the "annoying" authentication dialog and change
the Polkit policy to something like "yes" for active users to make the
elevation work out of the box. In this case all locally logged in users could
trigger the exploit without authenticating as root.

Potential Fix
=============

I recommended to upstream to replace the currently overly complex privilege
escalation logic, that potentially uses a range of alternate privilege
escalation mechanisms, by a single clean approach like using `pkexec`. Towards
the helper script subprocess Pipes should be used for consuming the output
instead of passing a temporary file path to it. This way the problematic
`chown` calls will no longer be needed.

At the moment no proper is available and upstream will require more time to
address the issue. Using Polkit and the default upstream Polkit policy there
should not be immediate danger, but users need to be aware that relaxing the
authentication requirements in any way gives way to the local root exploit.

Upstream added a commit [3] that allows to "opt-in" the risky authentication
feature during build time.

[3]: <https://github.com/KDAB/hotspot/commit/65a246ce9196462081483fd07d97678dcfe36b9c>

Further Hardening
=================

The privileged operations that the script currently performs are the
following:

    sysctl -wq kernel.kptr_restrict=0 kernel.perf_event_paranoid=-1
    mount -o remount,mode=755 /sys/kernel/debug
    mount -o remount,mode=755 /sys/kernel/debug/tracing

Granting world read access to the debug and tracing file systems is a
bit coarse grained. Sadly these kernel file systems don't support ACL
entries. If that would be possible then temporarily adding a dedicated ACL for
the unprivileged user would have been a viable approach.

I recommended to upstream to investigate the option to use a dedicated hotspot
group that is granted access to the file systems. Furthermore there might be a
possibility to use the capability `CAP_PERFMON` in conjunction with the lower
level `perf` tool to obtain the necessary privileges.

Affectedness and CVE Assignment
===============================

The problematic use of `chown` in the helper script has been introduced in the
upstream commit 3b4682565f0e53f903f3ad0f3f2c0f236d382efb [4] and has been
present since release v1.3.0.

I decided to request a CVE for this issue even though it is likely not
exploitable by default, because of the simplicity of exploiting it and the
complexity of the overall privilege escalation logic in Hotspot. Mitre
assigned CVE-2023-28144 for the issue.

Timeline
========

2023-03-09: I contacted the main upstream author about the vulnerability,
            offering coordinated disclosure.
2023-03-10: The upstream author agreed to publishing the issue without
            embargo time, because there will be no proper fix available in
            the short term. Users should be made aware of the issue right now.

            We discussed various security aspects of the current code and
            potential remedies and improvements.
2023-03-13: I received the CVE from Mitre and started publishing the available
            information.
