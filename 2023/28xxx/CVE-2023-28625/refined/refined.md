Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2023-28625:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a NULL pointer dereference within the `mod_auth_openidc` module when the `OIDCStripCookies` directive is enabled. Specifically, when a crafted `Cookie` header is supplied to the server, the module attempts to process the cookie string. When the cookie string is malformed or contains unexpected values (e.g. no '=' sign), the parsing logic fails to check for null values correctly, leading to the null pointer dereference.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The core vulnerability is a classic NULL pointer dereference, which occurs when the code attempts to access memory through a pointer that is not pointing to a valid object/memory location.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability results in a segmentation fault, causing the Apache webserver process to crash. By repeatedly sending a specially crafted cookie header, an attacker can trigger multiple crashes and effectively cause a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based. An attacker sends a malicious HTTP request with the crafted `Cookie` header to a vulnerable web server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** An attacker does not need any authentication or special privileges to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server, so the attacker could be outside of the network

**Additional Details:**

-   The vulnerability is triggered when the `OIDCStripCookies` directive is enabled in the Apache configuration.
-   The vulnerability exists in versions of mod_auth_openidc from 2.0.0 up to and including 2.4.13.1
-   Version 2.4.13.2 and later are patched.

This vulnerability is rated as "moderate" due to the limited impact of a DoS. The fix involves adding a check to prevent the null pointer dereference in the cookie parsing function.
