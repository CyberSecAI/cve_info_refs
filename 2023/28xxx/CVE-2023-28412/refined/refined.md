**1. Verification:**

The provided CISA advisory specifically mentions CVE-2023-28412 with the description matching the vulnerability described below.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** Observable Response Discrepancy. The Snap One OvrC cloud servers return information about a device when provided with a MAC address.
*   **Weakness:** The server does not validate or restrict access based on the MAC address. Supplying the server with a random MAC address returns device information.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can enumerate device MAC addresses and obtain information about the devices from the OvrC cloud.
*   **Attack Vector:** Network-based. An attacker can send requests to the OvrC cloud servers with arbitrary MAC addresses.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker does not need any special privileges or access. They need to send requests to the cloud server. The attacker would need to know or be able to guess the MAC address of the devices being targeted.

**3. Additional Information:**

*   The CISA advisory provides a more detailed description of the vulnerability, its impact, and how it can be exploited compared to a typical CVE description.
*   The advisory also mentions a CVSS v3.1 score of 5.3 and a v4 score of 6.9 for this vulnerability.

*   The advisory indicates that the vulnerability is fixed in OvrC Pro version 7.3 and higher.

**In summary, CVE-2023-28412 is an information disclosure vulnerability where an attacker can query the Snap One OvrC cloud servers for information about devices by using their MAC addresses.**
