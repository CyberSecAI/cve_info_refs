Root cause of vulnerability: The graphql-java parser, being a recursive-descent parser, could build up a call stack that exceeds the JVM's stack limit when processing deeply nested grammar rules, leading to a stack overflow exception.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The parser did not have a limit on the depth of grammar rules, making it vulnerable to stack overflow attacks. This is due to the nature of recursive-descent parsing.

Impact of exploitation: A specially crafted GraphQL query with excessive nesting could cause a stack overflow exception, leading to a denial of service (DoS) by crashing the JVM.

Attack vectors: An attacker could send a malicious GraphQL query or schema with deeply nested grammar rules to the graphql-java parser.

Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker would need to be able to submit GraphQL queries or schemas to an application that uses the vulnerable graphql-java library.
