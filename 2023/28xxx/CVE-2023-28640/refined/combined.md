A vulnerability in Apiman has been disclosed that you need to be aware of and respond to.
It has CVE ID [CVE-2023-28640](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-28640).

## Details

Due to a missing permissions check, an attacker with an authenticated Apiman Manager account may be able to gain access to API keys they do not have permission for if they correctly guess the URLs for the non-permitted resource. The URL includes Organisation ID, Client ID, and Client Version of the targeted non-permitted resource, and each of these can have arbitrary values.

While not trivial to exploit, it could be achieved by brute-forcing or guessing common names.

Access to the non-permitted API Keys could allow use of other users' resources without their permission.
Whether this is possible in practice depends on the specifics of configuration, such as whether an API key is the only form of security.

## Implications

* A malicious account-holder may be able to get access to an API key they do not have permission for by guessing/fuzzing private URLs in someone elseâ€™s organisation.
  + If successful, the key could be used to access APIs that the user does not have permissions for, if the API Key is the only form of security.* This vulnerability is only in the Apiman Manager, it does **NOT** relate directly to the Apiman Gateway.

## Actions to take

* Upgrade to Apiman 3.1.0.Final/3.1.1.Final (or later). The issue is fixed in this version. No special actions should be required when upgrading from 3.0.0.Final.* If you are unable to upgrade your version of Apiman, contact to your [Apiman support provider](/support.html) for advice/long-term support.

## Package

maven

io.apiman:apiman-manager-api-rest-impl
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

3.0.0.Final

## Patched versions

3.1.0.Final

## Description

### Impact

Due to a missing permissions check, an attacker with an authenticated Apiman Manager account may be able to gain access to API keys they do not have permission for if they correctly guess the URL. The URL includes Organisation ID, Client ID, and Client Version of the targeted non-permitted resource, and each of these can have arbitrary values.

While not trivial to exploit, it could be achieved by brute-forcing or guessing common names.

Access to the non-permitted API Keys could allow use of other users' resources without their permission (depending on the specifics of configuration, such as whether an API key is the only form of security).

### Patches

Apiman 3.1.0.Final and later resolves this issue.

### Workarounds

Only provide Apiman Manager accounts to known users, do not allow anonymous/unknown users to create an Apiman Manager account.

Note that this does **not** affect the Apiman Gateway.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
