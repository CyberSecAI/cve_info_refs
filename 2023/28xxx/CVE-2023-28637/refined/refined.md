Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper security measures in the AWS Redshift data source implementation within DataEase. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize or validate user-supplied input for the database connection string, allowing a malicious user to inject arbitrary parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure Deserialization/Remote Code Execution:** The core vulnerability lies in the ability to inject malicious parameters into the database connection string. By manipulating the `dataBase` field with a specially crafted string, an attacker can force the application to use a malicious `socketFactory` using `org.springframework.context.support.ClassPathXmlApplicationContext`. This can be used to load a remote XML configuration file, leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The application does not properly validate or sanitize the `database` field, allowing the injection of the malicious `socketFactory` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the DataEase application. This can lead to complete system compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is performed through a network request.
*   **Web Interface:** The attacker leverages the application's web interface to configure the malicious datasource settings via the `POST /datasource/validate/` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have a valid user account within the DataEase application. It is stated that "a normal user can handle the data source," meaning the attacker does not require administrative or other elevated privileges.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the DataEase server.
*   **Ability to Serve Remote Resource:** The attacker needs to host a malicious XML configuration file on a server accessible to the DataEase server.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided content includes a Proof of Concept (POC) with a crafted HTTP POST request and a sample XML configuration file that demonstrates the remote code execution.
*   The vulnerability specifically targets the AWS Redshift data source within the application.
*   The exploit leverages the `socketFactory` and `socketFactoryArg` parameters within the JDBC connection string.
*   The fix is included in version 1.18.5 of DataEase.
