- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds write.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write due to insufficient input validation in IOSurfaceAccelerator.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An application may be able to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: An application can exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to run a malicious application on a vulnerable device.
