Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2023-28709:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The fix for CVE-2023-24998 was incomplete.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  The vulnerability lies in how Apache Tomcat handles request parameters and uploaded parts when the `maxParameterCount` is reached using query string parameters.
- Specifically, if non-default HTTP connector settings were used such that the `maxParameterCount` could be reached using query string parameters, and a request was submitted with exactly `maxParameterCount` parameters in the query string, the limit for uploaded request parts could be bypassed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit could lead to a denial of service (DoS).

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP requests with a specific number of query string parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to send a crafted HTTP request with exactly maxParameterCount parameters in the query string.
- No specific attacker privileges are mentioned, suggesting a remote attack.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Apache Tomcat versions 11.0.0-M2 to 11.0.0-M4, 10.1.5 to 10.1.7, 9.0.71 to 9.0.73, and 8.5.85 to 8.5.87.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" severity by Apache.
- NetApp has also identified this vulnerability in its products and has released an advisory (NTAP-20230616-0004).
- Debian has released a security update (DSA-5521-1) for tomcat10 to address this and other vulnerabilities.
- The Gentoo security advisory (GLSA 202305-37) indicates that the vulnerability is remotely exploitable with a low severity.
