Subject: CVE-2023-28709 Apache Tomcat - Fix for CVE-2023-24998 was
 incomplete

CVE-2023-28709 Apache Tomcat - Fix for CVE-2023-24998 was incomplete

Severity: Moderate

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
Apache Tomcat 11.0.0-M2 to 11.0.0-M4
Apache Tomcat 10.1.5 to 10.1.7
Apache Tomcat 9.0.71 to 9.0.73
Apache Tomcat 8.5.85 to 8.5.87

Description:
The fix for CVE-2023-24998 was incomplete. If non-default HTTP connector
settings were used such that the maxParameterCount could be reached
using query string parameters and a request was submitted that supplied
exactly maxParameterCount parameters in the query string, the limit for
uploaded request parts could be bypassed with the potential for a denial
of service to occur.

Mitigation:
Users of the affected versions should apply one of the following
mitigations:
- Upgrade to Apache Tomcat 11.0.0-M5 or later
- Upgrade to Apache Tomcat 10.1.8 or later
- Upgrade to Apache Tomcat 9.0.74 or later
- Upgrade to Apache Tomcat 8.5.88 or later

Package        : tomcat10
CVE ID         : CVE-2023-28709 CVE-2023-41080 CVE-2023-42795 CVE-2023-44487
                 CVE-2023-45648

Several security vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Tomcat
servlet and JSP engine.

CVE-2023-28709

    Denial of Service. If non-default HTTP connector settings were used such
    that the maxParameterCount could be reached using query string parameters
    and a request was submitted that supplied exactly maxParameterCount
    parameters in the query string, the limit for uploaded request parts could
    be bypassed with the potential for a denial of service to occur.

CVE-2023-41080

    Open redirect. If the ROOT (default) web application is configured to use
    FORM authentication then it is possible that a specially crafted URL could
    be used to trigger a redirect to an URL of the attackers choice.

CVE-2023-42795

    Information Disclosure. When recycling various internal objects, including
    the request and the response, prior to re-use by the next request/response,
    an error could cause Tomcat to skip some parts of the recycling process
    leading to information leaking from the current request/response to the
    next.

CVE-2023-44487

    DoS caused by HTTP/2 frame overhead (Rapid Reset Attack)

CVE-2023-45648

    Request smuggling. Tomcat did not correctly parse HTTP trailer headers. A
    specially crafted, invalid trailer header could cause Tomcat to treat a
    single request as multiple requests leading to the possibility of request
    smuggling when behind a reverse proxy.

For the stable distribution (bookworm), these problems have been fixed in
version 10.1.6-1+deb12u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your tomcat10 packages.

For the detailed security status of tomcat10 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/tomcat10>
