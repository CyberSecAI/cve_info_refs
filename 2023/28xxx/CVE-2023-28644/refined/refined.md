Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-28644:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way Nextcloud handles fetching references (likely URLs) when resolving opengraph links. Specifically, the system does not impose sufficient restrictions on the size and type of content being downloaded. This lack of restrictions allows the server to potentially saturate its bandwidth for an extended period of time.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Unrestricted Content Download:** The system downloads content without checking the content-type or content-length.
- **Lack of Size and Type Limits:** Absence of limits on the size of downloaded content and the acceptable content types.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  An attacker can cause a denial of service by providing a link to a very large file or to a resource that will cause excessive resource consumption on the server due to the lack of size limits.
- **Server Performance Degradation:** Server performance can significantly degrade due to the heavy bandwidth consumption during content download.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, meaning an attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely through a crafted link.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Low Privileges:** The attacker requires low privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
- **User Interaction:** The attack requires some user interaction to trigger the vulnerability, such as a user clicking on a malicious link or a user attempting to render content containing such a link.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is associated with the opengraph link provider feature in Nextcloud.
- The fix for the vulnerability involves adding restrictions on content-type and content-size when downloading to resolve with the opengraph link provider.
- A patch for this vulnerability is included in Nextcloud Server version 25.0.3.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 5.7 and is rated as "Moderate" severity.
-  The identified weakness is related to CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption).
