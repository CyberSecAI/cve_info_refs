### @julien-nc **[julien-nc](/julien-nc)** commented [Jan 5, 2023](#issue-1520596379)

This makes a HEAD request before the GET one and skips links if either:

* content-type is not `text/html`
* or content-length is more than 5 MB

Another approach would be to use the [stream Guzzle option](https://docs.guzzlephp.org/en/stable/request-options.html#stream) when performing the GET request to avoid the extra HEAD request and either:

1. stop reading the body after a size limit

   I don't know if it makes sense since we probably can't properly parse a partial html content.
2. directly check the size and type from the headers and skip bad links even before reading the body.

   I don't know if the headers are retrieved before downloading/streaming the body.

What do you think?

Sorry, something went wrong.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
