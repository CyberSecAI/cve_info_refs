Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2023-28472:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The application did not set the `Secure` and `HTTPOnly` attributes for the `ccmPoll` cookies.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing `Secure` and `HTTPOnly` attributes on `ccmPoll` cookies.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  An attacker could potentially gain access to the cookie through a man-in-the-middle attack (if the `Secure` flag isn't set) or through cross-site scripting (XSS) if the `HTTPOnly` flag isn't set, potentially leading to session hijacking.

**Attack vectors:**
- Man-in-the-middle attack (if the `Secure` flag isn't set).
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) attack (if the `HTTPOnly` flag isn't set).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic (for MitM) or execute JavaScript on the victim's browser (for XSS).
- The attacker needs to trick a user into visiting a malicious page to trigger the vulnerability.
- User interaction is required.
- The attacker does not need admin level privileges to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Concrete CMS versions below 9.2.
- The fix involves updating the Survey Block Controller to support the `concrete.session.cookie.cookie_secure` value for the `ccmPoll` cookie, allowing developers to enable secure cookies.
- The Concrete CMS Security team scored this 3.4 with CVSS v3.1 vector [AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N]
