Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2023-28502:

**Root Cause:**

*   A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `udadmin_server` service. This occurs when the service copies a user-supplied username and password into fixed-size stack buffers using the `u2strcpy` function, which does not perform bounds checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stack buffer overflow:** The `u2strcpy` function is used without validating the length of the input strings, leading to a buffer overflow when the username or password exceeds the buffer size on the stack.
*   **Lack of bounds checking:** The `u2strcpy` function lacks bounds checking, allowing data to be written past the end of the allocated stack buffer.
*   **Password encoding bypass:** The password is encoded by inverting every bit after the `strcpy` operation. This allows null bytes to be included in the overflow which would otherwise be impossible due to null termination of strings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation can overwrite parts of the stack, including the return address. This allows an attacker to redirect the program's execution flow and achieve remote code execution.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The `udadmin_server` typically runs as root, meaning a successful exploit can grant the attacker root privileges on the target system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is accessible remotely via the UniRPC network protocol. An attacker can send a crafted message containing an overly long username or password to trigger the overflow.
*   **Pre-authentication:** The vulnerability can be exploited before authentication to the service occurs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network access:** The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the target system running the vulnerable `udadmin_server` service, typically listening on TCP port 31438.
*   **Knowledge of the UniRPC protocol:** The attacker needs to be able to communicate using the UniRPC protocol, specifically to send the required initial messages including service name.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the `main` function of `udadmin.c`, specifically around lines 803 and 805.
*  The `rpcEncrypt` function, which negates every byte in the password, allows the inclusion of NUL bytes in the password string. Normally, `strcpy()` based overflows are hard to exploit since NUL bytes terminate strings and user mode addresses all contain NUL bytes.

**Summary**
The content provides detailed technical information about the vulnerability, the root cause, affected components and the impact of the exploitation. It confirms a stack buffer overflow vulnerability in `udadmin_server` service due to insecure usage of `u2strcpy`, leading to pre-authentication remote code execution as root.
