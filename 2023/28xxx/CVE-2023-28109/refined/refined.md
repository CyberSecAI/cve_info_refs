Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-28109:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from an improperly configured Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy in the `play-with-docker` application. The CORS configuration was too permissive, allowing any origin with a suffix matching a specific domain to bypass the policy.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insecure CORS Configuration:** The application used `strings.HasSuffix` to validate origins, allowing any subdomain of `play-with-docker.com`, `play-with-kubernetes.com`, `docker.com`, and `play-with-go.dev` to bypass CORS restrictions, instead of only allowing the specified domains. This is a flaw in the logic of the allowed origin validator.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Authorization Bypass:** By crafting an HTTP request with a malicious origin (e.g., `evil-play-with-docker.com`), an attacker could bypass the CORS policy.
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could retrieve basic user information. The specific user information is not specified, but given the context, it would likely relate to the users of the vulnerable application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- **Origin Header Manipulation:**  The attack is performed by setting a malicious value in the `Origin` HTTP request header.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- The attacker needs to control the `Origin` header of the HTTP request.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is located within the `handlers/bootstrap.go` file.
- The vulnerable code uses `strings.HasSuffix` instead of exact domain matching to determine allowed origins.
- The fix replaces `strings.HasSuffix` with `strings.Contains`, and adds full domain names in the list, so the domain matching works correctly.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" severity.
- The issue was patched in the latest version of the software.
- The vulnerability was reported by `cokeBeer` and fixed by `marcosnils`.
- This vulnerability is also associated with CWE-639 ("Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key").
