  "CVE-2023-28629": {
    "description": "GoCD versions before 23.1.0 are vulnerable to a stored XSS vulnerability, where pipeline configuration with a malicious [pipeline label configuration](https://docs.gocd.org/current/configuration/pipeline_labeling.html) can affect browser display of pipeline runs generated from that configuration. An attacker that has permissions to configure GoCD pipelines could include JavaScript elements within the label template, causing a XSS vulnerability to be triggered for any users viewing the Value Stream Map or Job Details for runs of the affected pipeline, potentially allowing them to perform arbitrary actions within the victim's browser context rather than their own.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data used to generate pipeline labels. An attacker can insert arbitrary HTML/Javascript code in the label template of a pipeline which will be reflected in the UI.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Stored XSS"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary Javascript code within the browser of a user viewing the Value Stream Map or Job Details pages, potentially leading to session hijacking or other unauthorized actions within the application.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attack vector is through the GoCD application itself. An attacker modifies pipeline configuration, and the malicious code is executed when other users interact with affected pipeline runs."
     ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to have low level privileges to configure GoCD pipelines.  No user interaction required to be impacted."
  }
