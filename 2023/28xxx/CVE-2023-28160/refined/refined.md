Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2023-28160:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Firefox handles redirects to web extension files. When a redirect occurs to a publicly accessible file within a web extension, the browser was incorrectly translating the URL to the actual local file path on the system instead of maintaining the `moz-extension://` URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Local Path Disclosure:** The primary weakness is the exposure of the local file path. The browser was leaking sensitive information about the location of the extension files on the user's system.
- **Incorrect URL Handling:** The core of the problem is the incorrect URL translation during redirects, which bypasses the intended abstraction of `moz-extension://` URLs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Leakage:** The main impact is the leakage of the local path to web extension files. This is a moderate security issue, since it could reveal internal structure and potentially assist in targeted attacks.
- **Fingerprinting:** While the path information may not directly lead to arbitrary code execution or data theft, it can be used for fingerprinting the user's system, particularly on Android where the structure might be more consistent and revealing than on desktop systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Redirect to Web Extension:** An attacker needs to initiate a redirect to a file within a web extension using a URL that is accessible via the `moz-extension://` protocol.
- **Fetching via Web API:** A script uses the `fetch` API to trigger the redirect to the web extension file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **JavaScript Execution:** The attacker needs the ability to execute JavaScript within a browser context.
- **Web Extension Awareness:** The attacker has to be aware of a web extension with accessible files that can be referenced through `moz-extension://` URLs.
- **Network Access:** Ability to initiate a fetch request through HTTP or other network protocol.
- **No User Interaction:** This vulnerability can be exploited without direct user interaction beyond simply visiting a malicious website or running a malicious script.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is more severe on Android because, until a fix in [bug 1535365](/show_bug.cgi?id=1535365), extensions often run in-process. This means that the local file paths are directly exposed and not abstracted by a sandboxed environment.
- The fix involved using `NS_GetFinalChannelURI` in the `FetchDriver`, which correctly maintains the `moz-extension://` URL during redirects.
- The bug report also specifies that this bug is related to [CVE-2023-29538](/show_bug.cgi?id=1685403) where a similar issue was observed, but the fix for that did not address this issue.
- Severity was initially rated as S2 but was later changed to S3 due to a better understanding of the impact, it being a path disclosure rather than a direct remote code execution vulnerability.
- It was fixed in Firefox 111 and marked as 'wontfix' for older versions of Firefox, including ESR102, 109, and 110.
