The provided content is related to CVE-2023-28683.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Phabricator Differential Plugin does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
XML External Entity (XXE) injection.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Attackers can control the coverage report file contents for the 'Post to Phabricator' post-build action, causing Jenkins to parse a crafted XML document. This allows for the extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.

**Attack vectors:**
Attackers control the content of the coverage report file used by the 'Post to Phabricator' post-build action.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs the ability to control the coverage report file content. This typically involves having some level of access to the Jenkins environment to modify or create the report.
