Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2023-28409:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an "Unrestricted upload of file with dangerous type." This means the plugin does not properly validate the type of file being uploaded, allowing potentially harmful file types to be uploaded.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type:** The core weakness is the lack of proper validation on file uploads, which makes it possible for attackers to upload files that could be malicious.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A remote, unauthenticated attacker can upload unintended files to the server. While the impact is rated as "low" for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability in the CVSS v3 score, this can have severe consequences, including:
    *   **Website Defacement:** Attackers could upload files that can replace or alter the content of the website, leading to defacement.
    *   **Malware Distribution:** Uploading malicious scripts or executable files to the server that could be used to infect other visitors.
    *   **Data Corruption:** In specific scenarios, uploaded malicious file could also result in data corruption.
    *   **Further Compromise:** Attackers could upload files that would allow them to further compromise the website or server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Attack:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely without needing any prior authentication to the web application.
*   **File Upload Mechanism:** The attack is executed by abusing the file upload feature of the MW WP Form plugin.

**Mitigation:**

*   The vulnerability is mitigated by updating to the latest version of the plugin (v4.4.3).

**Summary:**

CVE-2023-28409 allows an unauthenticated attacker to upload arbitrary files by abusing a lack of file type validation in the MW WP Form plugin. This could lead to website defacement, malware distribution, and further compromise.
