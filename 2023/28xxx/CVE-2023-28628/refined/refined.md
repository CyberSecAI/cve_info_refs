Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-28628:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from an incorrect regular expression (`authority-regex`) used in the `lambdaisland/uri` library for parsing the authority component of a URI. Specifically, the regex did not properly handle backslashes (`\`) within the username part of the authority.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary vulnerability is the incorrect parsing of the URI authority due to the flawed regex. This leads to misinterpretation of the host portion of the URI.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Bypassing Host Restrictions:** An attacker can craft a malicious URL that, when parsed by the vulnerable library, returns an incorrect host. This can be exploited to bypass host-based access control or security policies that rely on the correct parsing of the authority.
- **Incorrect Origin:** The library returns the wrong authority, leading to incorrect origin information being used, potentially impacting security decisions in systems relying on the parsed result.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based. An attacker sends a specially crafted URL to an application using the vulnerable `lambdaisland/uri` library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to supply a URL to a system that uses the vulnerable `lambdaisland/uri` library.
- No special privileges are required.
- Some user interaction might be required, as a user might need to click a crafted URL, but automated scenarios where URLs are processed are also vulnerable

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability is in the `authority-regex` defined in `src/lambdaisland/uri.cljc`.
- The flawed regex is: `\A(([^:]\*)(:(.\*))?@)?([^:]\*)(:(\d\*))?\z`
- It doesn't consider backslashes in the username part of the authority (`([^:]\*)` part before the `@` sign).
- A payload like `https://example.com\\@google.com` is incorrectly parsed, returning `google.com` as the host, whereas it should be `example.com`.
- The fix involves modifying the regex to treat a backslash in the authority as a delimiter and start of the path section. This change is reflected in the updated regex: `\A(([^:/?#]+):)?(//([^/?#\\]\*))?([^?#]\*)?(\?([^#]\*))?(#(.\*))?\z`
- The vulnerability is similar to CVE-2020-8910.
