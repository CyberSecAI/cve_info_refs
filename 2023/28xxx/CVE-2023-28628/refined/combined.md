# `authority-regex` returns the wrong authority

Moderate

[plexus](/plexus)
published
GHSA-cp4w-6x4w-v2h5
Mar 27, 2023

## Package

maven

lambdaisland/uri
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

<= 1.13.95

## Patched versions

1.14.120

## Description

### Summary

`authority-regex` allows an attacker to send malicious URLs to be parsed by the `lambdaisland/uri` and return the wrong authority. This issue is similar to [CVE-2020-8910](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vh5w-fg69-rc8m "CVE-2020-8910").

### Details

[uri/src/lambdaisland/uri.cljc](https://github.com/lambdaisland/uri/blob/d3355fcd3e235238f4dcd37be97787a84e580072/src/lambdaisland/uri.cljc#L9)

Line 9
in
[d3355fc](/lambdaisland/uri/commit/d3355fcd3e235238f4dcd37be97787a84e580072)

|  | (def authority-regex #?(:clj #"\A(([^:]\*)(:(.\*))?@)?([^:]\*)(:(\d\*))?\z" |
| --- | --- |

This regex doesn't handle the backslash (`\`) character in the username correctly, leading to a wrong output.

**Payload:** `https://example.com\\@google.com`

The returned host is `google.com`, but the correct host should be `example.com`.

`urllib3` (Python) and `google-closure-library` (Javascript) return `example.com` as the host. Here the correct (or current) regex used by `google-closure-library`:

<https://github.com/google/closure-library/blob/0e567abedb058e9b194a40cfa3ad4c507653bccf/closure/goog/uri/utils.js#L189>

### PoC

```
(ns poc.core)
(require '[lambdaisland.uri :refer (uri)])

(def myurl "https://example.com\\@google.com")

(defn -main
  []
   (println myurl)
   (println (:host (uri myurl)))
)

```
### Impact

The library returns the wrong authority, and it can be abused to bypass host restrictions.

### Reference

WHATWG Living URL spec, section 4.4 URL Parsing, host state: <https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#url-parsing>

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
