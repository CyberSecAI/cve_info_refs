 Root cause of vulnerability:
 The `overlay` driver in Moby (Docker) dynamically and lazily defines kernel configuration for VXLAN networks. The iptables rules that prevent encrypted overlay networks from accepting unencrypted packets are not created until a peer is available.
 

 Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
 - Encrypted overlay networks accept cleartext VXLAN datagrams when there is no peer to communicate with, violating the expected security guarantees.
 - The vulnerability stems from a missing authentication mechanism on encrypted overlay networks when there's a single endpoint.
 

 Impact of exploitation:
 - An attacker can inject arbitrary Ethernet frames into an encrypted overlay network by encapsulating them in VXLAN datagrams.
 - This can lead to a denial of service (DoS) attack or other escalations by smuggling packets into the overlay network.
 - Since many database protocols and internal APIs may not have secondary encryption, this vulnerability exposes them to potential data leaks and unauthorized access.
 

 Attack vectors:
 - The attack vector is network-based. An attacker can send crafted VXLAN packets to the affected system.
 

 Required attacker capabilities/position:
 - The attacker needs to be on the network where the vulnerable Moby/Docker instance is operating.
 - They do not require any special privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
 - The attacker needs to craft VXLAN packets with the VNI corresponding to an encrypted overlay network.
 

 Additional details:
 - The `xt_u32` kernel module is required for filtering packets based on the VXLAN ID (VNI). If the module is missing, the vulnerability will be present.
 - The fix involves ensuring iptables rules are present from the start to prevent unauthenticated or unencrypted traffic.
 - Mitigation includes deploying 'pause' containers for each encrypted overlay network, or disabling overlay networks in a single-node cluster and using bridge networks instead.
