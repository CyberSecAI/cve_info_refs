The provided content is related to CVE-2023-28873, as it describes a stored XSS vulnerability in Seafile, although the CVE ID is requested and not assigned. The advisory ID is usd-2022-0032, and it provides more detail than a typical CVE description.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The markdown editor in Seafile does not properly filter javascript URIs within the `href` attribute of `<a>` tags.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79).
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of a user's browser when the user views a wiki page or other content where the crafted link is present and clicks on the link. This could lead to various malicious actions, such as session hijacking, data theft, or defacement.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted link injected via the markdown editor's `href` attribute, which is then stored on the server.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs the ability to create or edit content using the markdown editor within Seafile, such as a wiki page or a file. They do not require any special privileges or access beyond that. They need to create a malicious link by injecting a Javascript URI.
