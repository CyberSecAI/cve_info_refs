Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-28643:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a cache collision issue when a recipient receives multiple shared folders with the same name. When memory caching is enabled, the system incorrectly uses the same cache key for shared folders with identical names. Consequently, the second shared folder overwrites the first one in the recipient's view, rather than creating a new entry, potentially causing the recipient to lose access to previous shares with the same name.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Cache Collision:** The primary weakness is the incorrect caching mechanism that leads to collisions when handling shared folders with identical names. The cache key does not differentiate between shared folders from different senders.
-   **Missing Renaming:** The system fails to automatically rename subsequent shared folders with the same name, such as appending "(2)", "(3)" etc., which would differentiate them for the receiving user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Data Loss:** Recipients may lose access to shared folders because newer shares with the same name overwrite older ones in the user interface, giving a false sense that the old folder was replaced.
-   **Potential for Malicious File Injection:** The issue could potentially be exploited to inject malicious files into a user's shared folder by an attacker creating and sharing a folder with the same name as an existing, legitimate share. The recipient may be unaware that they are accessing a different folder than the one they expected.
-  **Confusion and Misinformation:** Users may be confused and potentially misled about the origin and content of shared folders, possibly leading to issues such as data loss due to overwriting or executing malicious content.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Network:** The attack is network-based, involving multiple users sharing folders through the Nextcloud platform.
-   **Low Complexity:** Exploiting this vulnerability has low complexity, requiring basic user interaction to share folders.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Low Privileges:** An attacker needs low privileges and a user account on the Nextcloud instance.
-   **Ability to Share:** The attacker needs to be able to share folders with other users.
-   **Knowledge of Existing Shares:** An attacker could attempt to exploit this by knowing the name of folders that a specific user has received as a share. This is not strictly necessary though, the impact can also occur by accident when two different users share a folder with the same name to one recipient.
-   **Memory Caching Enabled:** The attack relies on the target system having memory caching enabled.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue was originally reported on the Nextcloud help forum and then as a GitHub issue.
- The vulnerability is addressed by modifying the cache key to prevent collisions.
- Patched versions were released for both Nextcloud Server and Nextcloud Enterprise.
