## Description

![@aslfv](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47825274?v=4&size=48)[aslfv](https://github.com/aslfv)opened [on Sep 11, 2022](https://github.com/nextcloud/server/issues/34015#issue-1368883194)
### ⚠️ This issue respects the following points: ⚠️

* This is a **bug**, not a question or a configuration/webserver/proxy issue.
* This issue is **not** already reported on Github *(I've searched it)*.
* Nextcloud Server **is** up to date. See [Maintenance and Release Schedule](https://github.com/nextcloud/server/wiki/Maintenance-and-Release-Schedule) for supported versions.
* Nextcloud Server **is** running on 64bit capable CPU, PHP and OS.
* I agree to follow Nextcloud's [Code of Conduct](https://nextcloud.com/contribute/code-of-conduct/).

### Bug description

When two or more (sending) users share a folder with the same (receiving) user, that receiving user will only see the folder of the latest (sending) user under the "shared" folder, without necessarily being aware of it. The other folders will only reappear if the receiving user renames the folder seen.

The issue was originally raised at <https://help.nextcloud.com/t/shared-folder-with-same-name-starts-override-each-other-at-recipient-view/142574/3>.

IMHO this is a critical bug, which could pose a major digital security risk that could be exploited to inject malicious files in another user's folder.

But irrespective of this, users that share their (default) folders should not have to worry about name collisions.

### Steps to reproduce

1.Alice shares her "Document" folder with Charly => Charly sees Alice's "Document" folder

2.Bob shares his "Document" folder with Charly => Charly only sees Bob's "Document" folder.

3.Mallory shares his "Document" folder, which contains malware with Charly => Charly only sees Mallory's "Document" folder and may believe this is still Alice's Document folder.

### Expected behavior

Charly should see all three folders: Alice's, Bob's and Mallory's "Document" folders, which may be renamed as "Document (Alice)", "Document (Bob)" and "Document (Mallory)" respectively.

### Installation method

Community Docker image

### Operating system

Fedora 36

### PHP engine version

PHP 8.0

### Web server

Apache (supported)

### Database engine version

PostgreSQL

### Is this bug present after an update or on a fresh install?

### Are you using the Nextcloud Server Encryption module?

Encryption is Enabled

### What user-backends are you using?

* Default user-backend *(database)*
* LDAP/ Active Directory
* SSO - SAML
* Other

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
