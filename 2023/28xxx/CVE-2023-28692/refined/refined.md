- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WP Abstracts plugin for WordPress, in versions 2.6.3 and earlier, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This means that user-supplied data is not properly sanitized or encoded before being included in the output of the webpage.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can inject scripts, including redirects, advertisements, and other HTML, into the website. This malicious script will be executed when users visit the site.
- **Attack vectors:** Malicious scripts are injected into the website, potentially through the plugin's input fields or other areas where user-provided content is displayed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need the ability to inject the malicious script into the vulnerable component of the website, specifically in the WP Abstracts plugin, requiring administrator privilege.
