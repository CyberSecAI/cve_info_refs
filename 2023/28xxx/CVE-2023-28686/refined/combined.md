Dino before 0.2.3, 0.3.x before 0.3.2, and 0.4.x before 0.4.2 allows
attackers to modify the personal bookmark store via a crafted message. The
attacker can change the display of group chats or force a victim to join a
group chat; the victim may then be tricked into disclosing sensitive
information.

| Thinking about it, I'm not entirely sure the 0.3.2 change is correct. Since 0.3.0-r1 was stabilized. Looking for some feedback here how to handle it properly. Probably that means I can't bump it and can't remove it but need to patch it? And add additionally the 0.4.2 and only once that is stabilized I can remove/bump the 0.3.0-r1 one? |

| Probably that means I can't bump it and can't remove it but need to patch it?  It is up to the maintainers discretion. Dino's source diff from 0.3.0 to 0.3.2 looks sufficiently small and the CVE fix warrants a straight to stable bump IMHO. |

Insufficient message sender validation in Dino

CVE-2023-28686

Published: Thu Mar 23, 2023
·
Last updated: Fri Mar 24, 2023

### Severity

Medium (5.3): AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N

### Affected versions

* Release version 0.4.0 and 0.4.1
* Release version 0.3.0 and 0.3.1
* Release version 0.2.2 and earlier
* Nightly version 0.4.1-13-g6690d8e4 and earlier

### Fixed versions

* Release version 0.4.2
* Release version 0.3.2
* Release version 0.2.3
* Nightly version 0.4.1-14-gef8fb0e9

### Description

It was discovered that when a Dino client receives a specifically crafted
message from an unauthorized sender, it would use information from that
message to add, update or remove entries in the user’s personal bookmark
store without requiring further user interaction.

This vulnerability allows the attacker to change how group chats are
displayed or to force a user to join or leave an attacker-selected
groupchat. This can be used to trick the user to reveal sensitive
information to the attacker.

### Advice

All deployments should upgrade to a fixed version or apply the patch
from commit ef8fb0e94ce79d5fde2943e433ad0422eb7f70ec.

### Credits

Many thanks to Kim Alvefur for discovering and reporting this issue.

# 2.3. Understanding a Bug[¶](#understanding-a-bug "Link to this heading")

The core of Bugzilla is the screen which displays a particular
bug. Note that the labels for most fields are hyperlinks;
clicking them will take you to context-sensitive help on that
particular field. Fields marked \* may not be present on every
installation of Bugzilla.

*Summary:*

A one-sentence summary of the problem, displayed in the header next to
the bug number.

*Status (and Resolution):*

These define exactly what state the bug is in—from not even
being confirmed as a bug, through to being fixed and the fix
confirmed by Quality Assurance. The different possible values for
Status and Resolution on your installation should be documented in the
context-sensitive help for those items.

*Alias:*

A unique short text name for the bug, which can be used instead of the
bug number.

*Product and Component*:

Bugs are divided up by Product and Component, with a Product
having one or more Components in it.

*Version:*

The “Version” field usually contains the numbers or names of released
versions of the product. It is used to indicate the version(s) affected by
the bug report.

*Hardware (Platform and OS):*

These indicate the computing environment where the bug was
found.

*Importance (Priority and Severity):*

The Priority field is used to prioritize bugs, either by the assignee,
or someone else with authority to direct their time such as a project
manager. It’s a good idea not to change this on other people’s bugs. The
default values are P1 to P5.

The Severity field indicates how severe the problem is—from blocker
(“application unusable”) to trivial (“minor cosmetic issue”). You
can also use this field to indicate whether a bug is an enhancement
request.

*\*Target Milestone:*

A future version by which the bug is to
be fixed. e.g. The Bugzilla Project’s milestones for future
Bugzilla versions are 4.4, 5.0, 6.0, etc. Milestones are not
restricted to numbers, though—you can use any text strings, such
as dates.

*Assigned To:*

The person responsible for fixing the bug.

*\*QA Contact:*

The person responsible for quality assurance on this bug.

*URL:*

A URL associated with the bug, if any.

*\*Whiteboard:*

A free-form text area for adding short notes and tags to a bug.

*Keywords:*

The administrator can define keywords which you can use to tag and
categorise bugs—e.g. `crash` or `regression`.

*Personal Tags:*

Unlike Keywords which are global and visible by all users, Personal Tags
are personal and can only be viewed and edited by their author. Editing
them won’t send any notifications to other users. Use them to tag and keep
track of sets of bugs that you personally care about, using your own
classification system.

*Dependencies (Depends On and Blocks):*

If this bug cannot be fixed unless other bugs are fixed (depends
on), or this bug stops other bugs being fixed (blocks), their
numbers are recorded here.

Clicking the Dependency tree link shows
the dependency relationships of the bug as a tree structure.
You can change how much depth to show, and you can hide resolved bugs
from this page. You can also collapse/expand dependencies for
each non-terminal bug on the tree view, using the [-]/[+] buttons that
appear before the summary.

*Reported:*

The person who filed the bug, and the date and time they did it.

*Modified:*

The date and time the bug was last changed.

*CC List:*

A list of people who get mail when the bug changes, in addition to the
Reporter, Assignee and QA Contact (if enabled).

*Ignore Bug Mail:*

Set this if you want never to get bugmail from this bug again. See also
[Email Preferences](preferences.html#emailpreferences).

*\*See Also:*

Bugs, in this Bugzilla, other Bugzillas, or other bug trackers, that are
related to this one.

*Flags:*

A flag is a kind of status that can be set on bugs or attachments
to indicate that the bugs/attachments are in a certain state.
Each installation can define its own set of flags that can be set
on bugs or attachments. See [Flags](#flags).

*\*Time Tracking:*

This form can be used for time tracking.
To use this feature, you have to be a member of the group
specified by the timetrackinggroup parameter. See
[Time Tracking](editing.html#time-tracking) for more information.

Orig. Est.:

This field shows the original estimated time.

Current Est.:

This field shows the current estimated time.
This number is calculated from `Hours Worked`
and `Hours Left`.

Hours Worked:

This field shows the number of hours worked.

Hours Left:

This field shows the `Current Est.` -
`Hours Worked`.
This value + `Hours Worked` will become the
new Current Est.

%Complete:

This field shows what percentage of the task is complete.

Gain:

This field shows the number of hours that the bug is ahead of the
`Orig. Est.`.

Deadline:

This field shows the deadline for this bug.

*Attachments:*

You can attach files (e.g. test cases or patches) to bugs. If there
are any attachments, they are listed in this section. See
[Attachments](editing.html#attachments) for more information.

*Additional Comments:*

You can add your two cents to the bug discussion here, if you have
something worthwhile to say.

## 2.3.1. Flags[¶](#flags "Link to this heading")

Flags are a way to attach a specific status to a bug or attachment,
either `+` or `-`. The meaning of these symbols depends on the name of
the flag itself, but contextually they could mean pass/fail,
accept/reject, approved/denied, or even a simple yes/no. If your site
allows requestable flags, then users may set a flag to `?` as a
request to another user that they look at the bug/attachment and set
the flag to its correct status.

A set flag appears in bug reports and on “edit attachment” pages with the
abbreviated username of the user who set the flag prepended to the
flag name. For example, if Jack sets a “review” flag to `+`, it appears
as Jack: review [ + ].

A requested flag appears with the user who requested the flag prepended
to the flag name and the user who has been requested to set the flag
appended to the flag name within parentheses. For example, if Jack
asks Jill for review, it appears as Jack: review [ ? ] (Jill).

You can browse through open requests made of you and by you by selecting
My Requests from the footer. You can also look at open requests
limited by other requesters, requestees, products, components, and flag names.
Note that you can use ‘-’ for requestee to specify flags with no requestee
set.

### 2.3.1.1. A Simple Example[¶](#a-simple-example "Link to this heading")

A developer might want to ask their manager,
“Should we fix this bug before we release version 2.0?”
They might want to do this for a *lot* of bugs,
so they decide to streamline the process. So:

1. The Bugzilla administrator creates a flag type called blocking2.0 for bugs
   in your product. It shows up on the Show Bug screen as the text
   blocking2.0 with a drop-down box next to it. The drop-down box
   contains four values: an empty space, `?`, `-`, and `+`.
2. The developer sets the flag to `?`.
3. The manager sees the blocking2.0
   flag with a `?` value.
4. If the manager thinks the feature should go into the product
   before version 2.0 can be released, they set the flag to
   `+`. Otherwise, they set it to `-`.
5. Now, every Bugzilla user who looks at the bug knows whether or
   not the bug needs to be fixed before release of version 2.0.

### 2.3.1.2. About Flags[¶](#about-flags "Link to this heading")

Flags can have four values:

`?`

A user is requesting that a status be set. (Think of it as ‘A question is being asked’.)

`-`

The status has been set negatively. (The question has been answered `no`.)

`+`

The status has been set positively.
(The question has been answered `yes`.)

`_`

`unset` actually shows up as a blank space. This just means that nobody
has expressed an opinion (or asked someone else to express an opinion)
about the matter covered by this flag.

### 2.3.1.3. Flag Requests[¶](#flag-requests "Link to this heading")

If a flag has been defined as requestable, and a user has enough
privileges to request it (see below), the user can set the flag’s status to
`?`. This status indicates that someone (a.k.a. “the requester”) is asking
someone else to set the flag to either `+` or `-`.

If a flag has been defined as specifically requestable,
a text box will appear next to the flag into which the requester may
enter a Bugzilla username. That named person (a.k.a. “the requestee”)
will receive an email notifying them of the request, and pointing them
to the bug/attachment in question.

If a flag has *not* been defined as specifically requestable,
then no such text box will appear. A request to set this flag cannot be made
of any specific individual; these requests are open for anyone to answer. In
Bugzilla this is known as “asking the wind”. A requester may ask the wind on
any flag simply by leaving the text box blank.

### 2.3.1.4. Attachment Flags[¶](#attachment-flags "Link to this heading")

There are two types of flags: bug flags and attachment flags.

Attachment flags are used to ask a question about a specific
attachment on a bug.

Many Bugzilla installations use this to
request that one developer review another
developer’s code before they check it in. They attach the code to
a bug report, and then set a flag on that attachment called
review to
review? reviewer@example.com.
reviewer@example.com is then notified by email that
they have to check out that attachment and approve it or deny it.

For a Bugzilla user, attachment flags show up in three places:

1. On the list of attachments in the Show Bug
   screen, you can see the current state of any flags that
   have been set to `?`, `+`, or `-`. You can see who asked about
   the flag (the requester), and who is being asked (the
   requestee).
2. When you edit an attachment, you can
   see any settable flag, along with any flags that have
   already been set. The Edit Attachment
   screen is where you set flags to `?`, `-`, `+`, or unset them.
3. Requests are listed in the Request Queue, which
   is accessible from the My Requests link (if you are
   logged in) or Requests link (if you are logged out)
   visible on all pages.

### 2.3.1.5. Bug Flags[¶](#bug-flags "Link to this heading")

Bug flags are used to set a status on the bug itself. You can
see Bug Flags in the Show Bug and Requests
screens, as described above.

Only users with enough privileges (see below) may set flags on bugs.
This doesn’t necessarily include the assignee, reporter, or users with the
editbugs permission.

| [Description](#c0)  Michael Vetter    2023-03-24 07:58:57 UTC  ``` It was discovered that when a Dino client receives a specifically crafted message from an unauthorized sender, it would use information from that message to add, update or remove entries in the user’s personal bookmark store without requiring further user interaction.  This vulnerability allows the attacker to change how group chats are displayed or to force a user to join or leave an attacker-selected groupchat. This can be used to trick the user to reveal sensitive information to the attacker.  <https://dino.im/security/cve-2023-28686/>  Reproducible: Always ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Michael Vetter    2023-03-24 08:01:02 UTC  ``` I will send a pull request to update to 0.4.2 and will check to update 0.3.1 to 0.3.2 or remove it completely.  Seems I can't assign the bug to myself though. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Sam James   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2023-03-24 08:02:31 UTC  ``` (The summary rules are a bit silly - it's because we do the "first fixed versions in tree" in there.

When are those going to be fixed?](#cve-severity-assessment)- [What does local (remote) mean?](#localremote)

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2181356#c0)  Pedro Sampaio    2023-03-23 20:09:05 UTC  ``` ### Affected software  Dino (Instant Messenger) - <https://dino.im/>  ### Severity  Medium (5.3): AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N  ### Affected versions - Release version 0.4.0 and 0.4.1 - Release version 0.3.0 and 0.3.1 - Release version 0.2.2 and earlier - Nightly version 0.4.1-13-g6690d8e4 and earlier  ### Fixed versions - Release version 0.4.2 - Release version 0.3.2 - Release version 0.2.3 - Nightly version 0.4.1-14-gef8fb0e9  ### Description  It was discovered that when a Dino client receives a specifically crafted message from an unauthorized sender, it would use information from that message to add, update or remove entries in the user's personal bookmark store without requiring further user interaction.  This vulnerability allows the attacker to change how group chats are displayed or to force a user to join or leave an attacker-selected groupchat. This can be used to trick the user to reveal sensitive information to the attacker.  ### Advice  All deployments should upgrade to a fixed version or apply the patch from commit ef8fb0e94ce79d5fde2943e433ad0422eb7f70ec.  ### Credits  Many thanks to Kim Alvefur for discovering and reporting this issue.  ### Links  - <https://dino.im/security/cve-2023-28686/> - <https://github.com/dino/dino/commit/ef8fb0e> - <https://github.com/dino/dino/releases/tag/v0.4.2> - <https://github.com/dino/dino/releases/tag/v0.3.2> - <https://github.com/dino/dino/releases/tag/v0.2.3> - <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-28686>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2181356#c1)  Pedro Sampaio    2023-03-23 20:09:18 UTC  ``` Created dino tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2181357](show_bug.cgi?id=2181357 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2023-28686 dino: Insufficient message sender validation [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2181356#c2)  Product Security DevOps Team    2023-03-24 00:06:30 UTC  ``` This CVE Bugzilla entry is for community support informational purposes only as it does not affect a package in a commercially supported Red Hat product.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2181356#c0)  Pedro Sampaio    2023-03-23 20:09:05 UTC  ``` ### Affected software  Dino (Instant Messenger) - <https://dino.im/>  ### Severity  Medium (5.3): AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N  ### Affected versions - Release version 0.4.0 and 0.4.1 - Release version 0.3.0 and 0.3.1 - Release version 0.2.2 and earlier - Nightly version 0.4.1-13-g6690d8e4 and earlier  ### Fixed versions - Release version 0.4.2 - Release version 0.3.2 - Release version 0.2.3 - Nightly version 0.4.1-14-gef8fb0e9  ### Description  It was discovered that when a Dino client receives a specifically crafted message from an unauthorized sender, it would use information from that message to add, update or remove entries in the user's personal bookmark store without requiring further user interaction.  This vulnerability allows the attacker to change how group chats are displayed or to force a user to join or leave an attacker-selected groupchat. This can be used to trick the user to reveal sensitive information to the attacker.  ### Advice  All deployments should upgrade to a fixed version or apply the patch from commit ef8fb0e94ce79d5fde2943e433ad0422eb7f70ec.  ### Credits  Many thanks to Kim Alvefur for discovering and reporting this issue.  ### Links  - <https://dino.im/security/cve-2023-28686/> - <https://github.com/dino/dino/commit/ef8fb0e> - <https://github.com/dino/dino/releases/tag/v0.4.2> - <https://github.com/dino/dino/releases/tag/v0.3.2> - <https://github.com/dino/dino/releases/tag/v0.2.3> - <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-28686>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2181356#c1)  Pedro Sampaio    2023-03-23 20:09:18 UTC  ``` Created dino tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2181357](show_bug.cgi?id=2181357 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2023-28686 dino: Insufficient message sender validation [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2181356#c2)  Product Security DevOps Team    2023-03-24 00:06:30 UTC  ``` This CVE Bugzilla entry is for community support informational purposes only as it does not affect a package in a commercially supported Red Hat product.

Subject: [CVE-2023-28686] Insufficient message sender validation in Dino

### Affected software

Dino (Instant Messenger) - <https://dino.im/>

### Severity

Medium (5.3): AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N

### Affected versions
- Release version 0.4.0 and 0.4.1
- Release version 0.3.0 and 0.3.1
- Release version 0.2.2 and earlier
- Nightly version 0.4.1-13-g6690d8e4 and earlier

### Fixed versions
- Release version 0.4.2
- Release version 0.3.2
- Release version 0.2.3
- Nightly version 0.4.1-14-gef8fb0e9

### Description

It was discovered that when a Dino client receives a specifically
crafted message from an unauthorized sender, it would use information
from that message to add, update or remove entries in the user's
personal bookmark store without requiring further user interaction.

This vulnerability allows the attacker to change how group chats are
displayed or to force a user to join or leave an attacker-selected
groupchat. This can be used to trick the user to reveal sensitive
information to the attacker.

### Advice

All deployments should upgrade to a fixed version or apply the patch
from commit ef8fb0e94ce79d5fde2943e433ad0422eb7f70ec.

### Credits

Many thanks to Kim Alvefur for discovering and reporting this issue.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-5379-1                   security@debian.org
<https://www.debian.org/security/>                     Salvatore Bonaccorso

Package        : dino-im
CVE ID         : CVE-2023-28686
Debian Bug     : 1033370

Kim Alvefur discovered that insufficient message sender validation in
dino-im, a modern XMPP/Jabber client, may result in manipulation of
entries in the personal bookmark store without user interaction via a
specially crafted message. Additionally an attacker can take advantage
of this flaw to change how group chats are displayed or force a user to
join or leave an attacker-selected groupchat.

For the stable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.2.0-3+deb11u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your dino-im packages.

For the detailed security status of dino-im please refer to its security
tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/dino-im>

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://www.debian.org/security/>

| [Description](#c0)  Michael Vetter    2023-03-24 07:58:57 UTC  ``` It was discovered that when a Dino client receives a specifically crafted message from an unauthorized sender, it would use information from that message to add, update or remove entries in the user’s personal bookmark store without requiring further user interaction.  This vulnerability allows the attacker to change how group chats are displayed or to force a user to join or leave an attacker-selected groupchat. This can be used to trick the user to reveal sensitive information to the attacker.  <https://dino.im/security/cve-2023-28686/>  Reproducible: Always ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Michael Vetter    2023-03-24 08:01:02 UTC  ``` I will send a pull request to update to 0.4.2 and will check to update 0.3.1 to 0.3.2 or remove it completely.  Seems I can't assign the bug to myself though. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Sam James   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2023-03-24 08:02:31 UTC  ``` (The summary rules are a bit silly - it's because we do the "first fixed versions in tree" in there. Do wonder about changing it but it is what it is for now.) ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Larry the Git Cow   gentoo-dev  2023-03-24 08:44:33 UTC  ``` The bug has been referenced in the following commit(s):  <https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/gentoo.git/commit/?id=3bdb0c07287e6e7a8dfc2f84297be4452212fe03>  commit 3bdb0c07287e6e7a8dfc2f84297be4452212fe03 Author:     Michael Vetter <jubalh@iodoru.org> AuthorDate: 2023-03-24 08:24:20 +0000 Commit:     Florian Schmaus <flow@gentoo.org> CommitDate: 2023-03-24 08:44:13 +0000      net-im/dino: bump 0.4.1 → 0.4.2 and 0.3.0-r1 → 0.3.2          Addresses CVE-2023-28686.
