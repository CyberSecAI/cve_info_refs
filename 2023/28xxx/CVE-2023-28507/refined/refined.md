{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `unirpcd` service attempts to decompress an LZ4 compressed packet body using `LZ4_decompress_safe`. The decompression function does not properly handle invalid compressed data, interpreting it as a need for a larger output buffer. This results in repeated buffer expansion attempts with `realloc`, ultimately leading to excessive memory consumption.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of invalid input by the LZ4 decompression function.",
      "Unbounded memory allocation when decompression fails, leading to memory exhaustion."
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service due to memory exhaustion. A sustained attack can consume a large amount of server resources.",
    "attack_vectors": [
        "Sending a specially crafted, invalid LZ4 compressed packet to the `unirpcd` service."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable service. No authentication is needed for this vulnerability."
