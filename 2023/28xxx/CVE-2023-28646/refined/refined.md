Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-28646:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from the way the Nextcloud Android app handles activity restarts when an activity extending `AuthenticatorActivity` is running as `singleTask`. In such cases, the `PassCodeManager.onActivityResumed` method is called twiceâ€”once during `onResume` and again during `onNewIntent`. This double invocation could be exploited to bypass the app's PIN protection. Specifically, third-party apps generating deep links can trigger this behavior, allowing access to meta information of the app.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of activity lifecycle events (`onResume`, `onNewIntent`) within the `PassCodeManager`, specifically with `singleTask` activities derived from `AuthenticatorActivity`.
- Insufficient validation on how activities are launched via deep links or similar methods.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker with physical access to an unlocked device can bypass the Nextcloud Android app's PIN protection.
- This bypass grants access to sensitive meta-information such as:
    - Sharer and sharee details.
    - Activity logs related to files.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector involves a third-party app generating deep links that trigger the vulnerable activity.
- The attacker needs physical access to the unlocked device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Physical access to the unlocked Android device.
- Ability to generate or use a malicious third-party app capable of creating relevant deep links.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is specific to activities extending `AuthenticatorActivity` and configured to run as `singleTask`.
- The fix involves adding logic to avoid counting the same activity twice in `PassCodeManager`.
- The vulnerability is rated as low severity, with a CVSS score of 3.7.
- The issue was addressed in version 3.24.1 of the Nextcloud Android app.
- The vulnerability is classified under CWE-287 (Improper Authentication).
