Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-28446:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper ANSI code filtering when displaying interactive permission prompts for `op_spawn_child` and `op_kill` actions in Deno. The program displaying the prompt does not sanitize ANSI escape sequences which allows a malicious program to manipulate and clear parts of the permission prompt and replace it with arbitrary text.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper input sanitization: The Deno runtime does not filter ANSI escape codes when displaying permission prompts.
- Prompt spoofing: Malicious programs can use ANSI escape sequences to clear lines in the prompt and inject their own crafted messages to deceive the user.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Permission Prompt Spoofing:** An attacker can replace the legitimate prompt shown to a user, specifically manipulating the "Requested by" line.
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** By spoofing the prompt, a malicious program can trick a user into granting run permissions for a different command than the user intended to allow, leading to arbitrary command execution.
- **Bypass Security Mechanism:** This circumvents Deno's interactive permission model which is designed to prevent arbitrary command execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- Exploitation occurs when a Deno program requests execution of another program, and Deno displays the permission prompt.
- Specifically, the `op_spawn_child` and `op_kill` operations are vulnerable, as the prompt for these does not sanitize ANSI control characters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious Deno program that includes ANSI escape sequences and perform a call to `op_spawn_child` or `op_kill`.
- The attacker needs the user to run the malicious program and interact with the spoofed prompt by granting the "run" permission.
-  Exploitation is possible on systems with interactive prompts enabled and not on headless servers.
