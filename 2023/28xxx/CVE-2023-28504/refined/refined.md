Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2023-28504:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `U_rep_rpc_server_submain()` function within the `libunidata.so` library. This occurs when the username and password fields, received as part of the authentication process, are copied into stack-based buffers using the insecure `u2strcpy` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- Stack buffer overflow: The `u2strcpy` function does not perform bounds checking when copying data into the stack buffers, leading to a potential overflow.
- Unsafe function: The use of `u2strcpy`, a wrapper around `strcpy`, is inherently unsafe due to the lack of bounds checking.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- Pre-authentication remote code execution: A successful exploit can allow an attacker to overwrite the stack, including the return address, leading to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the `root` user (pre-authentication because it occurs before successful authentication)
-  The vulnerable function is used to authenticate users in multiple RPC services, making the vulnerability exploitable through multiple RPC endpoints.

**Attack vectors:**

- Network-based: Attackers can send specially crafted packets to the vulnerable RPC services (repconn and udsub) to trigger the overflow.
- The vulnerability is present in the `libunidata.so` library which is shared by multiple RPC services making it exploitable across multiple endpoints.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- Network access to the affected service (specifically TCP port 31438 by default) is required.
- No prior authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted message.
