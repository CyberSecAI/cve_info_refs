Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-28119:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the usage of `flate.NewReader` without limiting the size of the input during decompression of SAML requests and responses. This allows an attacker to send a specially crafted compressed payload that, when decompressed, expands to a very large size, leading to excessive memory consumption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unrestricted Deflate Decompression:** The code doesn't impose any limits on the size of data being decompressed by `flate.NewReader`.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability allows an attacker to trigger excessive memory consumption, potentially crashing the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service:** An attacker can cause the server to crash by sending multiple requests with large compressed payloads.
- **Resource Exhaustion:** The server's memory resources can be exhausted, impacting availability of the service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The attacker sends crafted HTTP requests containing compressed data to the vulnerable endpoints.
- **SAML Request/Response:** The vulnerability is present during the processing of compressed SAML requests and responses.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the target server.
- **Knowledge of SAML Protocol:** The attacker needs to understand how to send SAML requests with compressed payloads.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be triggered without requiring prior authentication.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix introduces a `saferFlateReader` that limits the amount of data that can be decompressed to 10MB.
- The vulnerability is present in versions prior to 0.4.13 of the `crewjam/saml` Go library.
- The commit `8e9236867d176ad6338c870a84e2039aef8a5021` introduces the fix.
- The vulnerability was reported by nszetei.
- The advisory is GHSA-5mqj-xc49-246p.
