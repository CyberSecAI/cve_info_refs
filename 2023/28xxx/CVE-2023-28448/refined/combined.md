Add missing bounds check to FamStructWrapper::deserialize

```
An issue was discovered in the `Versionize::deserialize`
implementation provided by the `versionize` crate for
`vmm_sys_utils::fam::FamStructWrapper`, which can lead to out of
bounds memory accesses. Objects of this type are used to model
structures containing C-style flexible array members [1]. These
structures contain a memory allocation that is prefixed by a header
containing the size of the allocation.

Due to treating the header and the memory allocation as two objects,
`Versionize`'s data format stores the size of the allocation twice:
once in the header and then again as its own metadata of the memory
allocation. A serialized `FamStructWrapper` thus looks as follows:

+------------------------------------------------------------+\
| header (containing length of flexible array member `len1`) |\
+------------------------------------------------------------+\
+---------------------------------------+-----------------------+
| length of flexible array member`len2` | array member contents |
+---------------------------------------+-----------------------+

During deserialization, the library separately deserializes the
header and the memory allocation. It allocates `len2` bytes of
memory, and then prefixes it with the separately deserialized header.
Since `len2` is an implementation detail of the `Versionize`
implementation, it is forgotten about at the end of the deserialize
`function`, and all subsequent operations on the `FamStructWrapper`
assume the memory allocated to have size `len1`. If deserialization
input was malformed such that `len1 != len2`, then this can lead to
(safe) functions on Â´FamStructWrapper` to read past the end of
allocated memory (if `len1 > len2`).

The issue was corrected by inserting a check that verifies that these
two lengths are equal, and aborting deserialization otherwise.

An issue was discovered in the `Versionize::deserialize` implementation provided by the `versionize` crate for `vmm_sys_utils::fam::FamStructWrapper`, which can lead to out of bounds memory accesses. Objects of this type are used to model structures containing C-style flexible array members [[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexible_array_member)].

Due to treating the header and the memory allocation as two objects, `Versionize`'s data format stores the size of the allocation twice: once in the header and then again as its own metadata of the memory allocation. A serialized `FamStructWrapper` thus looks as follows:

```
+------------------------------------------------------------++---------------------------------------+-----------------------+

containing the size of the allocation.

Due to treating the header and the memory allocation as two objects,
`Versionize`'s data format stores the size of the allocation twice:
once in the header and then again as its own metadata of the memory
allocation. A serialized `FamStructWrapper` thus looks as follows:

+------------------------------------------------------------+\
| header (containing length of flexible array member `len1`) |\
+------------------------------------------------------------+\
+---------------------------------------+-----------------------+
| length of flexible array member`len2` | array member contents |
+---------------------------------------+-----------------------+

During deserialization, the library separately deserializes the
header and the memory allocation. It allocates `len2` bytes of
memory, and then prefixes it with the separately deserialized header.
Since `len2` is an implementation detail of the `Versionize`
implementation, it is forgotten about at the end of the deserialize
`function`, and all subsequent operations on the `FamStructWrapper`
assume the memory allocated to have size `len1`. If deserialization
input was malformed such that `len1 != len2`, then this can lead to
(safe) functions on Â´FamStructWrapper` to read past the end of
allocated memory (if `len1 > len2`).

The issue was corrected by inserting a check that verifies that these
two lengths are equal, and aborting deserialization otherwise.

```
An issue was discovered in the `Versionize::deserialize`
implementation provided by the `versionize` crate for
`vmm_sys_utils::fam::FamStructWrapper`, which can lead to out of
bounds memory accesses. Objects of this type are used to model
structures containing C-style flexible array members [1]. These
structures contain a memory allocation that is prefixed by a header
containing the size of the allocation.

Due to treating the header and the memory allocation as two objects,
`Versionize`'s data format stores the size of the allocation twice:
once in the header and then again as its own metadata of the memory
allocation. A serialized `FamStructWrapper` thus looks as follows:

+------------------------------------------------------------+\
| header (containing length of flexible array member `len1`) |\
+------------------------------------------------------------+\
+---------------------------------------+-----------------------+
| length of flexible array member`len2` | array member contents |

# Versionize::deserialize implementation for FamStructWrapper<T> is lacking bound checks, potentially leading to out of bounds memory accesses

## Package

cargo

versionize
([Rust](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arust))

## Affected versions

## Patched versions

0.1.10

## Description

### Impact

An issue was discovered in the `Versionize::deserialize` implementation provided by the `versionize` crate for `vmm_sys_util::fam::FamStructWrapper`, which can lead to out of bounds memory accesses.

### Patches

The impact started with version 0.1.1. The issue was corrected in version 0.1.10 by inserting a check that verifies, for any deserialized header, the lengths of compared flexible arrays are equal and aborting deserialization otherwise.

### Workarounds

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
