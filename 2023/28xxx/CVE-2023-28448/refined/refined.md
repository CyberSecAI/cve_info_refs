Based on the provided information, this content relates to CVE-2023-28448.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `Versionize::deserialize` implementation for `vmm_sys_utils::fam::FamStructWrapper` in the `versionize` crate does not properly validate the length of flexible array members during deserialization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of bounds check when deserializing `FamStructWrapper`, specifically when handling the size of the flexible array member. The library deserializes the header and the memory allocation separately, storing the size of the allocation twice (`len1` in the header and `len2` as metadata). It allocates `len2` bytes of memory but later uses `len1` for operations, leading to out-of-bounds reads if `len1` is greater than `len2`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Out-of-bounds memory access, potentially leading to memory corruption or denial-of-service. Although the provided text states "safe functions" are involved, it still poses a potential security risk due to the memory access.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malformed deserialization input. An attacker can manipulate the serialized data such that the length of the flexible array member in the header (`len1`) differs from the actual allocated size (`len2`).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide malformed input to the deserialization function of `FamStructWrapper`. No specific privileges or user interaction is required, the attack vector is local.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in versions prior to 0.1.10 of the `versionize` crate.
- The fix involves adding a check during deserialization to ensure that `len1` and `len2` are equal, aborting if they are not.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 5.7 (Moderate).
