Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-28079:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Insecure File and Folder Permissions within PowerPath for Windows.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Weak folder and file permissions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Privilege escalation allowing a regular (non-admin) user to execute arbitrary code in the context of NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. This provides the attacker with the highest level of access on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access to the vulnerable system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- A regular user (non-administrator) account on the system where PowerPath for Windows is installed.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability stems from overly permissive file and folder permissions in PowerPath for Windows. A local, non-admin user can leverage these weak permissions to escalate their privileges and execute code with system-level authority (NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM).

**Affected versions:**
PowerPath for Windows versions 7.0, 7.1, and 7.2

**Remediated Versions:**
PowerPath for Windows version 7.2 P01
