SSA-322980: Denial of Service Vulnerability in SIPROTEC 5 Devices

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 7.5

2023-04-11
2024-05-14
V1.4

SUMMARY

SIPROTEC 5 devices contain a null pointer dereference vulnerability in the web service. This could allow
an attacker to send unauthenticated maliciously crafted http request that could cause denial of service
condition of the device.

Siemens has released new versions for several affected products and recommends to update to the
latest versions. Siemens is preparing further fix versions and recommends specific countermeasures for
products where fixes are not, or not yet available.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Block access to port 4443/tcp e.g. with an external firewall
• Disable web service using port 4443 for SIPROTEC 5 if it is not needed

Product-specific remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

Operators of critical power systems (e.g. TSOs or DSOs) worldwide are usually required by regulations
to build resilience into the power grids by applying multi-level redundant secondary protection schemes.
It is therefore recommended that the operators check whether appropriate resilient protection measures
are in place. The risk of cyber incidents impacting the grid’s reliability can thus be minimized by virtue
of the grid design. Siemens strongly recommends applying the provided security updates using the
corresponding tooling and documented procedures made available with the product. If supported by
the product, an automated means to apply the security updates across multiple product instances may
be used. Siemens strongly recommends prior validation of any security update before being applied,
and supervision by trained staff of the update process in the target environment. As a general security
measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access with appropriate mechanisms (e.g.
firewalls, segmentation, VPN). It is advised to configure the environment according to our operational
guidelines in order to run the devices in a protected IT environment.

Recommended security guidelines can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/gridsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SIPROTEC 5 and SIPROTEC 4 devices provide a range of integrated protection, control, measurement,
and automation functions for electrical substations and other fields of application.

VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

This chapter describes all vulnerabilities (CVE-IDs) addressed in this security advisory. Wherever
applicable, it also documents the product-specific impact of the individual vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability CVE-2023-28766

Affected devices lack proper validation of http request parameters of the hosted web service. An
unauthenticated remote attacker could send specially crafted packets that could cause denial of service
condition of the target device.

WORKAROUNDS

AND
MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to reduce the risk:

* Block access to port 4443/tcp e.g. with an external firewall
* Disable web service using port 4443 for SIPROTEC 5 if it is not needed

Product-specific remediations or mitigations can be found in the section
[Affected Products and Solution](#affected-products-section).

Please follow the [General Security Recommendations](#general-recommendations).

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

Operators of critical power systems (e.g. TSOs or DSOs) worldwide are usually required by regulations to build resilience into the power grids by applying multi-level redundant secondary protection schemes. It is therefore recommended that the operators check whether appropriate resilient protection measures are in place. The risk of cyber incidents impacting the grid's reliability can thus be minimized by virtue of the grid design.
Siemens strongly recommends applying the provided security updates using the corresponding tooling and documented procedures made available with the product. If supported by the product, an automated means to apply the security updates across multiple product instances may be used. Siemens strongly recommends prior validation of any security update before being applied, and supervision by trained staff of the update process in the target environment.
As a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access with appropriate mechanisms (e.g. firewalls, segmentation, VPN). It is advised to configure the environment according to our operational guidelines in order to run the devices in a protected IT environment.

Recommended security guidelines can be found at:

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SIPROTEC 5 and SIPROTEC 4 devices provide a range of integrated protection, control, measurement, and automation functions for electrical substations and other fields of application.

VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

[Un-/Collapse All](#/)

This chapter describes all vulnerabilities (CVE-IDs) addressed in this security advisory.
Wherever applicable, it also documents the product-specific impact of the individual vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability CVE-2023-28766

Affected devices lack proper validation of http request parameters of the hosted web service.
An unauthenticated remote attacker could send specially crafted packets that could cause denial of service condition of the target device.
