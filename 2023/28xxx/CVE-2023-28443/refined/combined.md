* fix(api): redact header cookie

This is a quick PoC for a fix. I am not sure if it's the best answer and have not added tests yet. If we feel good about it, I can add tests and open a PR. Please let me know how you'd like to proceed!

* cleaner

* rework to handle multiple inputs and add unit tests

* Added same redacting logic for teh response set-cookie

# CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File

Moderate

[br41nslug](/br41nslug)
published
GHSA-8vg2-wf3q-mwv7
Mar 23, 2023

## Package

npm

directus
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

9.23.1

## Patched versions

9.23.3

## Description

### Summary

CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File discovered in v9.23.1. The `directus_refresh_token` is not redacted properly from the log outputs and can be used to impersonate users without their permission.

### Details

Using `v9.23.1`, I am seeing that the `directus_refresh_token` is not properly redacted as indicated by

[directus/api/src/logger.ts](https://github.com/directus/directus/blob/7c479c5161639aac466c763b6b958a9524201d74/api/src/logger.ts#L13)

Line 13
in
[7c479c5](/directus/directus/commit/7c479c5161639aac466c763b6b958a9524201d74)

|  | paths: ['req.headers.authorization', `req.cookies.${env.REFRESH\_TOKEN\_COOKIE\_NAME}`], |
| --- | --- |

I'm classifying this as a security vulnerability because if someone has access to the log outputs, for example with a shared Cloud account or Splunk implementation, they could exchange the refresh token using `/auth/refresh` for an access token and use the token to perform actions on behalf of an unsuspecting user. This situation creates issues with accountability and non-repudiation because we can no longer have confidence that actions taken in the application were authorized or even performed by the logged-in user.

A couple of examples of this are:

* A disgruntled employee deletes all of the data to get even with a target team member before logging off on their last day
* Under the guise of their unsuspecting boss, a mischievous engineer uploads *questionable* images that get displayed on internal or external facing content sites

The list could go on but I think these communicate the risk of an internal threat that has access to this information 😆

### PoC

1. Set `LOG_STYLE="raw"` and run Directus v9.23.1
2. Log in to the application
3. Look at the shell output and see that `directus_refresh_token` is logged

   > Note: This is different from the standard `raw` output format. I intentionally ran this with `npx directus start | pino-pretty` so logs would be easier to read. It can also be reproduced by running `npx directus start` alone.

4. Exchange the `directus_refresh_token` for an `access_token`

   ```
    curl -X POST \
      'http://0.0.0.0:8055/auth/refresh' \
      --header 'Accept: */*' \
      --header 'Cookie: directus_refresh_token=$shh'
   ```

### Impact

Because this can be used to exploit other threats related to [CWE-284: Improper Access Control](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html) I rank it with a Moderate severity. An insider with knowledge of this could do many mischievous things and get away with them for a long time without victims knowing about it.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N
