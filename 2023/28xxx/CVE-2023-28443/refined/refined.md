Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-28443:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause lies in the insufficient redaction of sensitive information, specifically the `directus_refresh_token`, from log outputs. The logging mechanism was configured to redact certain fields, but the refresh token was not included, leading to its exposure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File:** The primary weakness is the logging of sensitive refresh tokens.
- **CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor:** This vulnerability allows unauthorized access to sensitive data through log files.
- **CWE-212: Insufficiently Protected Credentials:** The refresh token is a credential that is not adequately protected in the log output.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Account Impersonation:** An attacker who gains access to the logs can use the exposed `directus_refresh_token` to obtain a valid access token via the `/auth/refresh` endpoint, allowing them to impersonate a user.
- **Unauthorized Actions:** Once impersonated, the attacker can perform any action on behalf of the victim, including data deletion, modification, and other malicious activities.
- **Lack of Accountability:** Due to the impersonation, it becomes difficult to trace actions back to the actual user, creating issues with accountability and non-repudiation.
- **Internal Threat:** The vulnerability poses a significant risk from internal threats, where a malicious employee or insider can exploit the exposed tokens.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Log File Access:** The primary attack vector is gaining access to the system's log files.
- **Network Access to Logs:** This could be through access to shared cloud accounts or third-party logging services (e.g., Splunk) where logs are stored.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to Logs:** The attacker must have access to the log files containing the unredacted refresh tokens. This could be via compromised accounts, internal access, or access to shared logging systems.
- **Knowledge of `/auth/refresh` endpoint:** The attacker needs to know how to use the `directus_refresh_token` to obtain an `access_token`.
- **High privileges:** The CVSS score indicates that high privileges may be required, likely relating to access to the log files. The impact however, can be achieved through an insider.
- **User Interaction:** While the initial compromise does not need user interaction, the attacker would need to use the refresh token to impersonate a user (User interaction is also required for a user to log in and generate a refresh token in the logs in the first place).

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in Directus version 9.23.1 and was fixed in version 9.23.3.
- The fix involved implementing a redaction mechanism for cookies, including the `access_token` and the `directus_refresh_token`.
- The vulnerable code was in `api/src/logger.ts`.
- A proof-of-concept (PoC) was provided demonstrating the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is rated as having a "Moderate" severity due to the potential for unauthorized actions and the possible use of the vulnerability to exploit other access control issues.

The vulnerability is described in detail with a proof of concept.
