{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Improper quoting of columns in the `getByUuid` and `exists` methods of the UUID DAO model.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection (CWE-89)"
    ],
    "impact": "Theoretically, it is possible to inject custom SQL if the developer uses these methods with input data without proper validation, relying on the DAO class's auto-quoting feature.",
    "attack_vectors": "By providing a malicious UUID string to the vulnerable methods.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to influence the input to the `getByUuid` and `exists` methods. High privileges are required to access and exploit the vulnerability.",
    "details": "The original code used direct string concatenation to build the SQL query, which is vulnerable to SQL injection. The fix replaces this with a query builder, which properly handles parameter binding and type casting."
