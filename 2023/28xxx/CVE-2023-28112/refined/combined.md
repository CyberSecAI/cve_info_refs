# SSRF protection missing for some FastImage requests

Moderate

[jomaxro](/jomaxro)
published
GHSA-9897-x229-55gh
Mar 17, 2023

## Package

Discourse
(Discourse)

## Affected versions

stable <= 3.1.0; beta <= 3.1.0.beta2; tests-passed <= 3.1.0.beta2

## Patched versions

stable >= 3.1.0; beta >= 3.1.0.beta3; tests-passed >= 3.1.0.beta3

## Description

### Impact

Some user provided URLs were being passed to FastImage without SSRF protection.

Insufficient protections could enable attackers to trigger outbound network connections from the Discourse server to private IP addresses.

This affects any site running the tests-passed or beta branches <= 3.1.0.beta2.

### Patches

The issue is patched in the latest beta and tests-passed version of Discourse.

### Workarounds

None.

### Severity

Moderate

5.9

# CVSS overall score

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N
