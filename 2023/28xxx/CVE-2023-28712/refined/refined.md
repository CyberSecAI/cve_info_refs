The provided content is related to CVE-2023-28712.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Osprey Pump Controller versions prior to release 20230518 contain an improper neutralization of special elements used in a command ('command injection') vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Command Injection (CWE-77): The application fails to sanitize user-controlled input before using it in a command. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to gain system access with `www-data` permissions. This could lead to unauthorized data modification, disruption of operations, or full control of the device.

**Attack vectors:**
- Unauthenticated command injection vulnerability through unspecified interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker can be remote (over a network).
- Low attack complexity.
- No user interaction required.
- No prior authentication required.
