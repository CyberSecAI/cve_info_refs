# Improper neutralization in an SQL query

Critical

[clotairer](/clotairer)
published
GHSA-vfmq-w777-qvcf
Apr 18, 2023

## Package

Shoppingfeed
(PrestaShop)

## Affected versions

1.4.0

## Patched versions

1.8.3

## Description

SQL injection vulnerability found in the module "Shoppingfeed Prestashop Plugin (Feed&Order)" (aka shoppingfeed) for PrestaShop from 1.4.0 to 1.8.2. (1.8.3 fix the issue) allow a remote attacker to gain privileges.

## Description

From 1.4.0 to 1.8.2 (1.8.3 fix the issue), a sensitive SQL call in `ShoppingfeedToken::findByToken()` can be executed with a trivial http call and exploited to forge a blind SQL injection throught the POST or GET submitted variable `token`.

## Possible malicious usage

* Technical and personal data leaks
* Obtain admin access
* Remove all data of the linked PrestaShop
* Display sensitives tables to front-office to unlock potential admin’s ajax scripts of modules protected by token on the ecosystem

## Patch

```
--- a/modules/shoppingfeed/classes/ShoppingfeedToken.php
+++ b/modules/shoppingfeed/classes/ShoppingfeedToken.php
@@ -138,7 +138,7 @@ public function findByToken($token)
         $query = (new DbQuery())
             ->select('*')
             ->from(self::$definition['table'])
-            ->where("content = '$token'")
+            ->where('content = "' . pSQL($token) . '"')
         ;

         return Db::getInstance(_PS_USE_SQL_SLAVE_)->getRow($query);
```

[See also](https://github.com/shoppingflux/module-prestashop/pull/209/files)

## Other recommandations

* It’s recommended to upgrade the module beyond 1.8.3.
* Upgrade PrestaShop beyond 1.7.8.8 (and 8.0.1) to disable multiquery executions (separated by “;”).
* Change the default database prefix ps\_ by a new longer arbitrary prefix. Nethertheless, be warned that this is useless against blackhat with DBA senior skill because of a design vulnerability in DBMS
* Activate OWASP 942’s rules on your WAF (Web application firewall), be warned that you will probably break your backoffice and you will need to pre-configure some bypasses against these set of rules.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
