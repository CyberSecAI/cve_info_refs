Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described under CVE-2023-28153:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a flaw in the Kiddoware Kids Place Parental Control Android app's design, where a child user can bypass app restrictions without the parent's knowledge. This bypass is achieved by manipulating Android's settings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Bypass of Restrictions:** The core vulnerability lies in the ability of a child to disable the app's restrictions by exploiting Android settings (Safe Mode boot, disabling "Display over other apps" permission).
*   **Lack of Notification:** The app fails to notify parents when restrictions are disabled, leaving the bypass undetected unless the parent manually checks the dashboard.
*   **Reversibility of Bypass:**  A child can re-enable the permission, making it difficult for parents to notice that the bypass ever occurred.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Circumvention of Parental Controls:**  Children can bypass restrictions on app usage, accessing content or apps that parents have intended to block.
*   **Unmonitored Activity:** Parents remain unaware that their child's activity is no longer restricted.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Physical Access to Device:** The child needs physical access to their Android device.
*   **Manipulation of Android Settings:** The child needs to be able to boot into Android Safe Mode and manipulate app permissions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Child User:** The attacker is the child user of the device with parental controls.
*   **Basic Technical Knowledge:** The child needs some basic understanding of Android settings, such as how to access Safe Mode and modify permissions.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is specifically triggered by disabling the "Display over other apps" permission.
*   The parent app's dashboard does not provide a real-time notification to the parent when this bypass occurs, requiring manual checking.
*   The vendor was notified about this vulnerability and provided a patch.
