Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-28114:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `cilium-cli` tool, when used to configure cluster mesh functionality, incorrectly specified the mount point for the etcd data directory in the init container of the `clustermesh-apiserver` deployment. This caused the `etcd` user permissions configurations to be ignored, effectively disabling authorization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Volume Mount:** The `MountPath` for the `etcd-data-dir` volume was incorrectly set to `etcd-data-dir` instead of `/var/run/etcd`.
- **Missing Authorization Enforcement:** Due to the incorrect mount, the init containerâ€™s actions, specifically configuring `etcd` user permissions, were not applied to the correct `etcd` data directory.
- **Disabled Etcd Authorization:**  This resulted in `etcd` authorization being effectively disabled for the cluster mesh.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker with access to valid keys and certificates for a compromised `etcd` cluster could modify the state in that `etcd` cluster.
- This could lead to unauthorized data modification or other malicious activities within the cluster.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited when `cilium-cli` is used to configure a cluster mesh.
- The attacker needs to have compromised a valid key and certificate for the affected etcd cluster.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have adjacent network access to the etcd cluster.
- The attacker needs to have obtained valid keys and certificates for the `etcd` cluster that has its authorization disabled by cilium-cli.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is specific to the `cilium-cli` tool, not the Cilium Helm charts, therefore users who deployed with helm are not affected.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" severity with a CVSS score of 4.8.
- The vulnerability was fixed in `cilium-cli` version 0.13.2.
- The fix involved correcting the volume mount specification in the `clustermesh.go` file.
- The CVE is associated with CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges.
