# `cilium-cli` disables etcd authorization for clustermesh clusters

Moderate

[aanm](/aanm)
published
GHSA-6f27-3p6c-p5jc
Mar 21, 2023

## Package

cilium-cli
(Cilium)

## Affected versions

< 0.13.2

## Patched versions

0.13.2

## Description

### Impact

`cilium-cli`, when used to configure cluster mesh functionality, can remove the enforcement of user permissions on the `etcd` store used to mirror local cluster information to remote clusters.

Due to an incorrect mount point specification, the settings specified by the `initContainer` that configures `etcd` users and their permissions are overwritten when using `cilium-cli` to configure a cluster mesh. An attacker who has already gained access to a valid key and certificate for an `etcd` cluster compromised in this manner could then modify state in that `etcd` cluster.

### Patches

This issue is patched in `cilium-cli` 0.13.2

All previous versions of `cilium-cli` are affected. Users who have set up cluster meshes using the Cilium Helm chart are not affected.

### Workarounds

Use Cilium's [Helm charts](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/cilium/cilium) to create your cluster instead.

### Acknowledgements

The Cilium community has worked together with members of Isovalent to prepare these mitigations. Special thanks to Marco Iorio for investigating and fixing the issue.

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please reach out on [Slack](https://docs.cilium.io/en/latest/community/community/#slack).

As usual, if you think you found a related vulnerability, we strongly encourage you to report security vulnerabilities to our private security mailing list: security@cilium.io - first, before disclosing them in any public forums. This is a private mailing list where only members of the Cilium internal security team are subscribed to, and is treated as top priority.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

```
This commit fixes an incorrect volume mount specification for the init
container of the clustermesh-apiserver deployment created through
'cilium clustermesh enable', that caused the operations performed in the
init container itself to be disregarded.
