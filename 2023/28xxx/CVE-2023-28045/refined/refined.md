The provided document contains information about **CVE-2023-28045**, which affects Dell CloudIQ Collector version 1.10.2. Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a **missing encryption of sensitive data** within Dell CloudIQ Collector version 1.10.2.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The primary weakness is the lack of encryption for sensitive data, which could allow unauthorized access if the data is exposed.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data. The CVSS score indicates a high confidentiality impact and a low integrity impact
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is Adjacent (AV:A), indicating that the attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the target system.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker with low privileges (PR:L) is required to exploit the vulnerability. No user interaction (UI:N) is required for exploitation, and the scope (S:U) is unchanged (meaning the vulnerability impacts only the vulnerable component).

**Summary:**

The document details a medium-severity vulnerability in Dell CloudIQ Collector version 1.10.2, caused by a lack of encryption for sensitive data. An attacker on the same network segment with low privileges can potentially exploit this to gain unauthorized access to data. The affected version is 1.10.2 and the remediated version is 1.10.17.
