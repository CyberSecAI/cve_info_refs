The provided content relates to CVE-2023-28809.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the fact that some Hikvision access control products do not update the session ID after a user successfully logs in.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Session hijacking vulnerability due to lack of session ID rotation after login
- Unauthorized modification of device network configuration

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Session hijacking can grant attackers the ability to perform unauthorized actions on the device by impersonating an authenticated user.
- Unauthorized modification of device network configuration could disrupt network operations or allow further exploitation.

**Attack vectors:**
- For session hijacking:
    - An attacker needs to be on the same network as the device.
    - An attacker needs to request the session ID at the same time as a valid user logs in.
    - An attacker can then forge the IP and session ID of the authenticated user to gain device operation permissions.
- For unauthorized modification:
    - An attacker needs to be on the same local network as the device.
    - An attacker needs to send specifically crafted packets to the vulnerable interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- For session hijacking:
  - The attacker must be on the same network as the targeted device and must be able to intercept network traffic.
  - The attacker must be able to time their request for the session ID to coincide with a legitimate user login.
- For unauthorized modification:
  - The attacker must be on the same local network as the device and be able to send network packets.
