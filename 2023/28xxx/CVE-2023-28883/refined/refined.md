Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-28883:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a Blind SQL Injection located in the `limit` parameter of the `searchAll` action within the `Instance` controller of the Cerebrate application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Blind SQL Injection:** The application does not properly sanitize or validate the `limit` parameter from user input before using it in an SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the query.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The code directly uses the provided `limit` parameter without ensuring that it's an integer or sanitizing its value.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** A successful blind SQL injection attack could allow an attacker to extract sensitive data from the database. Because it is blind, it would require multiple requests to gather information.
*   **Data Manipulation:** An attacker might be able to modify or delete data from the database.
*   **Denial of Service:** In some scenarios, exploitation could lead to denial of service by crashing the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerable parameter is exposed through an HTTP GET request. An attacker would manipulate the `limit` query parameter in the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Cerebrate application to send malicious HTTP requests.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability is present in an endpoint that does not require any form of authentication.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered using the Cake Fuzzer tool.
*   The fix involves ensuring that the limit is an integer, which prevents the injection.
*   The CVSS score is 9.8 (Critical) with the vector string: `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H`.
*   The affected version is 1.13, and the fix is available in 1.3 latest patch or higher

**Code Changes:**

The commit diff shows two key changes:

1.  **`src/Controller/InstanceController.php`:**
    *   The code was changed to check if the `limit` parameter is numeric.
    ```diff
        -       $limit = $this->request->getQuery('limit', 5);
        -       $limit = is_numeric($limit) ? $limit : 5;
    ```
    This change only checks if it's numeric, not if it's an integer, meaning it's still vulnerable to non integer values such as `5.1`, or `5a`.

2.  **`src/Model/Table/InstanceTable.php`:**
    *   The `limit` parameter in the `searchAll` function was type-hinted to integer (`int`).
    ```diff
         -   public function searchAll($value, $user, $limit=5, $model=null)
         +  public function searchAll($value, $user, int $limit=5, $model=null)
    ```
    This change prevents any value other than an integer from being passed into the query.
