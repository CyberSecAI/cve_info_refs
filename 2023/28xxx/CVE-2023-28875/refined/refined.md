Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-28875:

**Vulnerability Details**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the fact that Filerun does not properly validate user-supplied input, specifically within the `download_terms` parameter when creating shared weblinks.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:**  Improper neutralization of input during web page generation, leading to a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79).
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the download terms, which will be executed when a user visits the created share link. This can lead to various malicious activities such as session hijacking, phishing attempts, or other client-side attacks.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attacker crafts a malicious payload within the `download_terms` GET parameter while creating a weblink.
    *   An unsuspecting user visits the crafted share link, triggering the injected JavaScript.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must have the ability to create shared web links.
    *   No special privileges or administrative access is explicitly required other than the ability to create a weblink.
*   **Payload Example:** `<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>` This simple payload demonstrates a basic alert box, but more complex scripts can be used for malicious actions.
