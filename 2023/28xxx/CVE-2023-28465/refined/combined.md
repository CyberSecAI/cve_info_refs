# Statement on CVE-2022-42889 (Commons Text)

[Previous](/our-blog/cms-non-compliance-cost)

[Next](/our-blog/what-is-data-fabric)

October 24, 2022

A vulnerability was recently disclosed against versions 1.9 and below of the Apache Commons Text library. The details of this vulnerability are discussed here: [![](https://nvd.nist.gov/site-media/images/favicons/favicon-16x16.png)NVD - CVE-2022-42889](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-42889)

We have performed a detailed code audit, and can confirm that HAPI FHIR and Smile CDR are **not** vulnerable to this issue. The issue applies to a specific feature of Commons-Text known as the "Interpolator String Lookup" and this feature is not used by these products. However, users may wish to upgrade anyhow as an added precaution.

HAPI FHIR users may wish to manually upgrade the Commons-Text library to version 1.10 in their project pom.xml file (or equivalent). This has been tested and confirmed to be a safe upgrade.

A Smile CDR point release will be published shortly which upgrades this library.

## Description

### Impact

Zip Slip protections implemented in [CVE-2023-24057](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-jqh6-9574-5x22 "CVE-2023-24057") ([GHSA-jqh6-9574-5x22](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-jqh6-9574-5x22 "GHSA-jqh6-9574-5x22")) can be bypassed due a partial path traversal vulnerability.

This issue allows a malicious actor to potentially break out of the `TerminologyCacheManager` cache directory. The impact is limited to sibling directories.

To demonstrate the vulnerability, consider `userControlled.getCanonicalPath().startsWith("/usr/out")` will allow an attacker to access a directory with a name like `/usr/outnot`.

### Why?

To demonstrate this vulnerability, consider `"/usr/outnot".startsWith("/usr/out")`.

The check is bypassed although `/outnot` is not under the `/out` directory.

It's important to understand that the terminating slash may be removed when using various `String` representations of the `File` object.

For example, on Linux, `println(new File("/var"))` will print `/var`, but `println(new File("/var", "/")` will print `/var/`;

however, `println(new File("/var", "/").getCanonicalPath())` will print `/var`.

### The Fix

Comparing paths with the `java.nio.files.Path#startsWith` will adequately protect againts this vulnerability.

For example: `file.getCanonicalFile().toPath().startsWith(BASE_DIRECTORY)` or `file.getCanonicalFile().toPath().startsWith(BASE_DIRECTORY_FILE.getCanonicalFile().toPath())`

### Other Examples

* [CVE-2022-31159](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java/security/advisories/GHSA-c28r-hw5m-5gv3) - aws/aws-sdk-java
* [CVE-2022-23457](https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2022-008_The_OWASP_Enterprise_Security_API/) - ESAPI/esapi-java-legacy

### Vulnerability

<https://github.com/hapifhir/org.hl7.fhir.core/blob/b0daf666725fa14476d147522155af1e81922aac/org.hl7.fhir.r4b/src/main/java/org/hl7/fhir/r4b/terminologies/TerminologyCacheManager.java#L99-L105>

While `getAbsolutePath` will return a normalized path, because the string `path` is not slash terminated, the guard can be bypassed to write the contents of the Zip file to a sibling directory of the cache directory.

### Patches

All org.hl7.fhir.core libraries should be updated to 5.6.106.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
