**CVE Description**:

Introduction:

AcyMailing is a newsletter and email marketing plugin available for Joomla and WordPress.

The vulnerability:

Stored cross site scripting (XSS) in templates and emails of AcyMailing, unauthenticated when being granted access to the campaign’s creation on front-office.

This issue affects AnyMailing Joomla Plugin in versions below 8.3.0.

The steps to exploit the vulnerability:

* Campaign creation access needs to be enabled on the front-office, the following steps can then be done unauthenticated
* Edit an AcyMailing email template and initiate applying the changes
* One of the resulting requests sent to the plugin contains the editor content and can be manipulated to contain Java Script code
* The template containing the Java Script code is stored on the system and the payload will trigger when accessing the template again

How to check for exploitation:

* Check access logs for suspicious requests in the form of “/index.php?option=com\_acym&tmpl=component&22f6c8a79b56f873e2406d68f8f1bf32=1&nocache=1675689449&ctrl=frontmails” or for JS payloads in the POST parameter “editor\_content” (e.g. “editor\_content=<script>console.log(‹test›)</script>%3Cdiv+id%3D%22acym\_\_wysid\_\_template%22+class…”)
* Check templates for injected JS payloads

**Solution**:

* update to a fixed version (>= 8.3.0)

**Timeline**:

* 2023-02-06: reported
* 2023-03-09: initial vendor notification
* 2023-03-10: initial vendor response
* 2023-03-20: release of fixed version
* 2023-03-30: coordinated public disclosure
