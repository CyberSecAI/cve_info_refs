Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-28998:

**Summary:**

This CVE relates to a vulnerability in the Nextcloud desktop client's end-to-end encryption (E2EE) implementation, specifically how it handles an empty list of metadata keys provided by the server. A malicious server could exploit this flaw to gain access to E2EE folders by manipulating metadata.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a logic flaw in the Nextcloud desktop client. When the client receives an empty list of metadata keys from the server, it does not handle this scenario correctly. Instead of throwing an error or terminating, it proceeds using a default, all-zero key. This effectively means the client attempts to decrypt file metadata with a known value.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper handling of empty metadata keys:** The client lacks a check for an empty metadata key list. When the metadata key is accessed using an index, and no key exists for that index, it results in a default constructed value, which is a null byte array/all-zeros key.
*   **Lack of input validation:** The client does not validate the structure or content of the metadata keys list received from the server. It trusts the server even though the threat model assumes a potentially malicious server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full Access to E2EE Folder:** By sending a crafted response containing empty metadata keys, a malicious server administrator can cause the client to encrypt file metadata using the default all-zeros key. This grants the attacker the ability to decrypt the file metadata and recover the file encryption keys.
*   **Decryption and Data Recovery:** With the file keys recovered, the attacker can decrypt and access all files within the affected E2EE folder.
*   **File Modification:** The attacker can also modify or add files to the E2EE folder using the all-zeros key.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attacker must be able to intercept and modify communication between the Nextcloud client and server.
*   **Malicious Server Administrator:** A malicious server administrator can directly exploit the vulnerability by manipulating the server's response to the client.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Server Administrator Access/Control:** The attacker needs administrative access to the Nextcloud server or the ability to act as a man-in-the-middle between the client and server.
*   **Ability to Manipulate Server Responses:** The attacker must be able to forge or modify the response from the server to the client, specifically by providing an empty list of metadata keys.
*   **No User Interaction:** This vulnerability can be exploited without requiring user interaction.

**Additional Notes:**

*   This vulnerability was found during a security analysis of Nextcloud's E2EE module.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 3.6.5 of the Nextcloud desktop client, as noted in the provided github content.
*   The fix involved adding a check to prevent the use of the default all-zeros key when receiving an empty metadata key list.
*   The issue is tracked as GHSA-jh3g-wpwv-cqgr in GitHub's security advisories.
*   The fix was backported to the stable-3.6 branch as well.
