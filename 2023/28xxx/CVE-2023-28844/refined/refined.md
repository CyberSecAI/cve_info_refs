Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-28844:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the ViewOnly DAV plugin of Nextcloud server, specifically related to how it handles access to file versions. The plugin was not correctly applying view-only restrictions to the versions endpoint, allowing users without download rights to access and download older versions of files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Access Control:** The core weakness lies in the improper implementation of access control for the file version endpoint, which is managed via the DAV protocol. This allowed bypassing the intended "view only" restrictions for users who should not have download permissions.
- **Authorization Bypass:** The plugin failed to prevent unauthorized downloads of file versions by users with insufficient permissions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** Unauthorized users could download older versions of files they should not have access to, leading to a breach of confidentiality. Sensitive data might be exposed to those who should only have read access or no access.
- **Uncontrolled Distribution:** The vulnerability could be leveraged to distribute files outside the intended user base, potentially leading to data leakage.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, implying that a remote attacker can exploit this flaw via the network. This is done by accessing the file versions endpoint through the WebDAV interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs to have a valid user account on the Nextcloud instance to access the vulnerable file version endpoint.
- **User Interaction:** The attack requires user interaction, as the user needs to navigate to a file's history or previous versions to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Access to the DAV interface:** The attacker needs to be able to access the WebDAV interface.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed by applying the ViewOnly DAV plugin also to the versions DAV endpoint.
- The vulnerability is classified as "moderate" severity.
- The vulnerability affects Nextcloud Server and Nextcloud Enterprise Server, version 24.0.4 and later, 25.0.0 and later before fixes.
- Patched versions are 24.0.10 and 25.0.4.
- The vulnerability is related to CWE-284 (Improper Access Control).
- The CVE ID assigned to this is CVE-2023-28844.
