*  **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of a victim's browser session. This could lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
*   **Attack vectors**: An attacker can control input files for the 'Record JaCoCo coverage report' post-build action.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to control the input files used for the JaCoCo coverage report. This implies that the attacker has some level of access/permission within the Jenkins environment to influence the build process.
