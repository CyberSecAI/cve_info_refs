Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2023-28651:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by the ability to store specific JavaScript code within the parameters of a specific PHP script. This stored code is then executed when a separate PHP call is made.

**Weakness/Vulnerability:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: The primary vulnerability is a reflected cross-site scripting issue. The system fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary script execution:** A specially crafted setting can be configured by an administrative user, which will lead to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code on the web browser of another administrative user accessing the system.
*   **Information theft/tampering:** Exploitation can lead to the theft or modification of information.
*   **Malicious program execution:** Attackers may be able to execute malicious programs within the context of a user's browser.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The attack occurs via the web interface of the CONPROSYS HMI System (CHS).
*   **Specific PHP Script Parameters:** The vulnerability is triggered by storing malicious JavaScript code in the parameters of a specific PHP script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Administrative Access:** The attacker needs to be able to access the affected product with administrative privileges in order to configure the malicious settings.
*   **User Interaction:**  The attack requires another administrative user to access the affected product via their web browser for the malicious script to be executed.

**Summary:**

CVE-2023-28651 describes a cross-site scripting vulnerability in CONPROSYS HMI System (CHS). An attacker with administrative privileges can inject malicious JavaScript code through a specific PHP script. This code gets executed when another administrative user accesses the system, potentially leading to information theft, data modification, or malicious program execution. The attack is network-based and requires a degree of user interaction.
