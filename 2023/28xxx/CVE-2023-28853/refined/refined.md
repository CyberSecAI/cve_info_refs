{
  "CVE-2023-28853": {
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the LDAP query used for authentication. The application directly incorporates the user's email (used as login) into the LDAP search filter, allowing an attacker to inject malicious LDAP syntax.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "LDAP injection vulnerability"
      ],
       "impact": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to leak arbitrary attributes from the LDAP database by using blind LDAP injection techniques. This enables the attacker to infer sensitive information bit by bit from the database using boolean-based techniques.",
      "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is network-based. An attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely by crafting specific inputs to the login form.",
      "required_capabilities": "An attacker requires a valid user account on the Mastodon instance with LDAP authentication enabled. The attacker also needs to understand basic LDAP syntax to construct the malicious injection."
