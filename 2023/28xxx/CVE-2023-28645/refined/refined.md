Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2023-28645:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from an unprotected internal API endpoint within the Nextcloud richdocuments app. This endpoint can be accessed without proper authorization checks, allowing bypass of the secure view feature.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** The internal API endpoint does not enforce proper access control, allowing unauthorized access to resources.
*   **Missing Authorization:** The application fails to verify if the user is permitted to access the document through the internal endpoint.
*   **Bypass of Secure View:** The secure view feature, designed to restrict document downloads and apply watermarks, is circumvented due to the lack of protection on the internal API endpoint.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** Attackers can potentially download files they should not have access to, including files with download restrictions or those protected by the secure view feature. This could result in unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information.
*   **Circumvention of Security Controls:** The secure view feature, which may include watermarking and download prevention, is effectively bypassed.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Nextcloud instance.
*   **Direct API Access:** The vulnerability is exploited by directly accessing an unprotected internal API endpoint of the richdocuments app.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs to have low privileges, meaning they are likely a regular user of the Nextcloud instance.
*   **Knowledge of API Endpoint:** The attacker needs knowledge of the specific vulnerable internal API endpoint.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects versions of the richdocuments app >= 7.0.0 and >= 6.0.0.
*   Patched versions are 7.0.2 and 6.3.2 and 8.0.0-beta.1
*   The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" with a CVSS score of 5.7.
*   A key mitigation is configuring the WOPI settings to restrict requests only to the IP addresses of the Collabora servers, as mentioned in the provided documentation.
*   The fix for this vulnerability includes a warning if the WOPI allow-list is not configured, highlighting the importance of this setting for security.
