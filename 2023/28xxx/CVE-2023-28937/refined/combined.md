SAISON Information Systems Co., Ltd.

HULFT Technical Support Center

Regarding the HULFT8 Script Options ScriptRunner containing a

vulnerability

Thank you very much for using our technical support service.
It has been discovered that there is an issue (CWE-321) with the ScriptRunner in HULFT8

Script Option where the private key is hard coded.

This vulnerability has been addressed in a modified patch for HULFT8 Script Option; if you

are using ScriptRunner, please check the following information and consider addressing this

issue.

1.  Applicable Products and Versions

-  HULFT8 Script Option for Windows/UNIX/Linux

All versions are eligible.

2.  Range of Impact
-  ScriptRunner

If ScriptRunner is not used (no startup configuration file is created), there is no impact.

3.

Impact of Vulnerability

An attacker with access to the product in question could use a hard-coded encryption

key to decrypt encrypted credentials if they obtain the ScriptRunner startup configuration

file.

Saison Information Systems CO.,LTD.

4.  Requests to Customers

The modified patch to correct this vulnerability can be applied to HULFT8 Script Option

Ver. 8.5.3. Therefore, if you are using Ver. 8.5.2 or lower, please update to Ver. 8.5.3. After

that, please apply the following modified patch.

HULFT8 Script Option

Corresponding  modified  patch

Note

Version

8.5.3

module

HS85̲230508̲02

The modified patch above is available on myHULFT.

You  can  download  it  by  selecting  the  product  from  the  "Product  Download/Issue  Key"

menu.

Please apply the corresponding patch module and perform the necessary procedures for

the startup configuration file. Please refer to the README in the patch module for details

on the process.

【Notes】

The HULFT main unit and HULFT8 Script Option must be used at the same level※.

Therefore, when upgrading HULFT8 Script Option to Ver. 8.5.3, HULFT itself must also be

Appendix: FAQs and Answers

Q1

How do I check if ScriptRunner is being used?

A：

ScriptRunner executes a script by running ScriptRunner.exe with a startup configuration file as

a command line argument. Please refer to the following in the HULFT8 Script Option online help

for details.

<Online Help>

[Operation Tool]-[ScriptRunner]

For this reason, please check below if ScriptRunner is used or not.

・  Whether you have the ScriptRunner.exe installed in your environment or not.
・  Whether  you  are  operating  in  the  above  environment  to  execute  a  script  with
ScriptRunner.exe by specifying a startup configuration file created by the customer or not.

Q2

I do not use ScriptRunner, but ScriptRunner.exe is in the HULFT8 Script Option operating

environment. Does this vulnerability issue occur when this file is in the HULFT8 Script

Option operating environment?

A：

This  vulnerability  is  related  to  password  encryption  of  the  startup  configuration  file  used  to

execute scripts in ScriptRunner.

Therefore,  even  if  the  ScriptRunner.exe  file  exists,  it  will  not  be  affected  if  the  startup

configuration file is not created.

Q3

Have there been any actual cases of this vulnerability causing damage?

A：

We have not received any reports of damage caused by this vulnerability at this time.

Saison Information Systems CO.,LTD.

Q4

Is there any way to confirm that the behavior has improved as expected after applying the

patch?

A：

Execute  ScriptRunner.exe  using  a  startup  configuration  file  that  has  not  been  changed  since

before the patch was applied. If an error occurs, the patch has been applied.

In  response  to  this  vulnerability,  we  have  changed  to  store  the  encryption  key  for  decrypting

authentication information in the execution environment. As a result, passwords in the startup

configuration file before the patch was applied cannot be decrypted after the patch was applied,

resulting in an error.

Q5

Is it correct to understand that if a machine with the HULFT8 Script Option installed is

not communicating using ScriptRunner, it is not affected by the vulnerability?

A：

This  vulnerability  allows  an  attacker  with  access  to  the  HULFT8  Script  Options  deployment

environment to verify credentials if they obtain the ScriptRunner startup configuration file.

Even if there is no communication between ScriptRunner and HULFT8 Script Option, if a pre-

created startup configuration file exists, it will be affected when the file is obtained.

Q1

How do I check if ScriptRunner is used?

A：

ScriptRunner executes a script by running ScriptRunner.exe with a startup configuration file

as a command line argument. For details, please refer to the help page at the URL below.

[ScriptRunner]

URL：https://www.hulft.com/help/ja-

jp/DataSpider/dss44sp1/help/ja/tools/scriptrunner.html

For this reason, please check below if ScriptRunner is used or not.

・  Whether you have the ScriptRunner.exe installed in your environment or not.

・  Whether  you  are  operating  in  the  above  environment  to  execute  a  script  with

ScriptRunner.exe by specifying a startup configuration file created by the customer or not.

Q2

I  do  not  use  ScriptRunner,  but  ScriptRunner.exe  and  ScriptRunnerSQS.exe  exist  in  the

DataSpiderServer operating environment.

Does  this  vulnerability  issue  occur  if  these  two  files  exist  in  the  DataSpiderServer

operating environment?

A：

This vulnerability is related to the encryption of the startup configuration file used to execute

scripts in ScriptRunner and ScriptRunner for Amazon SQS.

Therefore,  even  if  the  ScriptRunner.exe  and  ScriptRunnerSQS.exe  files  exist,  they  will  not  be

affected if the startup configuration file is not created.

Q3

Since the patch will be released for DataSpider Servista 4.4, 4.3, and 4.2, is it necessary

to upgrade if I use 4.1 or lower?

A：

We apologize for the inconvenience, but please upgrade to DataSpider Servista 4.2 or later.

DataSpider Servista 4.1 has been supported by Assistance Support since July 5th, 2022, and no

patches will be provided.

Saison Information Systems CO.,LTD.

Q4

Have there been any actual cases of this vulnerability causing damage?

A：

We have not received any reports of damage caused by this vulnerability at this time.

Q5

Is there any way to confirm that the behavior has improved as expected after applying the

patch?

A：

Execute  ScriptRunner.exe  using  a  startup  configuration  file  that  has  not  been  changed  since

before the patch was applied. If an error occurs, the patch has been applied.

In  response  to  this  vulnerability,  we  have  made  changes  to  store  the  encryption  key  for

decrypting  the  authentication  information  in  the  execution  environment.  As  a  result,  the

authentication information in the startup configuration file before the patch is applied cannot be

decrypted after the patch is applied, resulting in an error.

Q6

Is it correct to understand that if a machine with the DataSpider Servista installed is not

communicating using ScriptRunner, it is not affected by the vulnerability?

A：

This vulnerability allows an attacker with access to the DataSpiders deployment environment to

verify credentials if they obtain the ScriptRunner startup configuration file.

Even if there is no communication between ScriptRunner and DataSpiderServer, if a pre-created

startup configuration file exists, it will be affected when the file is obtained.

Q7

How do I apply the service pack?

A：

The service packs are located in the directory "ServicePack" on the same level as the installer

package downloaded from myHULFT.

The service pack is provided in a compressed ZIP format "DSSxx_SPx.zip".

Please refer to "DSSxx_SPx_README_en.txt" in the decompressed folder and apply the

service pack. Also, please refer to the documentation in the decompressed folder for details

about additional feature patches and service packs.

Saison Information Systems CO.,LTD.

Q8  When applying the latest Service Pack (SP), will the contents of the previous SP also be

applied if I apply the latest SP without applying the previous SP?

A：

Even if the latest SP is applied without the past SPs, all SP contents, including the past SPs,

will be applied. (If the latest SP is SP9, and SP9 is applied without SP1-8, all SP contents from

SP1 to SP9 will be applied.)

Therefore, applying SP1, SP2, ... SP9 in that order is unnecessary.
