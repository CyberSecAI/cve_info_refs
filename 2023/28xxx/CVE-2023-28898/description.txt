The Real-Time Streaming Protocol implementation in the MIB3 infotainment incorrectly handles requests to /logs URI, when the id parameter equals to zero. This issue allows an attacker connected to the in-vehicle Wi-Fi network to cause denial-of-service of the infotainment system, when the certain preconditions are met.

Vulnerability discovered on Å koda Superb III (3V3) - 2.0 TDI manufactured in 2022.
