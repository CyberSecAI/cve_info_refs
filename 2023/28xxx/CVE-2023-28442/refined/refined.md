Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-28442:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from an overly permissive security configuration in the `rest.properties` file of the `geoserver-geonode-ext` extension for GeoServer. Specifically, the `/rest/about/status` endpoint, which should be restricted to administrators, was accessible to anonymous users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Insecure Default Configuration:** The default `rest.properties` file incorrectly allowed anonymous access to the `/rest/about/status` endpoint.
- **Information Exposure:** This allowed unauthenticated users to retrieve sensitive information about the GeoNode configuration.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Sensitive Information Leakage:** Attackers could access configuration details of the GeoNode instance, potentially including information about the system setup, installed extensions, and other internal details.
- **Potential for Further Exploitation:** The leaked information could be used to further compromise the system or plan more targeted attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network Access:** The attack vector is network-based, where an attacker sends a GET request to the vulnerable `/geoserver/rest/about/status` endpoint.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability is exploitable without any prior authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs network access to the GeoNode instance running a vulnerable version of `geoserver-geonode-ext`.
- The attacker does not need any special permissions or credentials.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects GeoNode 3 and GeoNode 4 instances using vulnerable versions of the `geoserver-geonode-ext` extension (<=2.20.7).
- A patch has been released in `geoserver-geonode-ext` which blocks access to the affected endpoint and backported to previous versions as well.
- For existing deployments, the patched `rest.properties` file must be manually applied to the Geoserver data directory to mitigate the vulnerability.
- The fix is to remove anonymous access to the `/rest/about/status` endpoint using the `rest.properties` file in GeoServer.
