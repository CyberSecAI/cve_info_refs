Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2023-28505:

**Root Cause:**
- A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `U_get_string_value()` function within the `libunidata.so` library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The `U_get_string_value()` function uses `u2strcpy()`, which is a wrapper around `strcpy()`. The function copies data into a buffer without any bounds checking, leading to a buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successfully exploiting this vulnerability can lead to remote code execution as the authenticated user. With the authentication bypass from CVE-2023-28503, this can lead to remote code execution as the `root` user without knowing any password.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is accessible through the RPC service `unirep82` (associated with the `udsub` executable).
- The attacker needs to send a specially crafted RPC request to the `udsub` service that triggers the vulnerable `U_get_string_value()` function, passing a long string.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send network traffic to the affected service.
- The attacker needs to be able to connect to the UniRPC service, and be authenticated or use the authentication bypass vulnerability (CVE-2023-28503).
- The attacker needs to craft a specific RPC request with a string that overflows the buffer in `U_get_string_value()`.

**Additional Details:**
- The `U_get_string_value()` function is called by `U_unpack_conn_package`, which is called by `U_sub_connect` within the `udsub` binary.
- The buffer that is overflowed is allocated on the stack.
- Unlike password-based overflows, NUL bytes cannot be used, which limits the possibilities of returning to a useful address.
