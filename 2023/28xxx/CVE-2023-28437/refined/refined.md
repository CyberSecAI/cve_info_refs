Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-28437:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The application uses string concatenation with the `$` symbol in SQL queries, specifically within the `orderByClause` of `ExtSysMsgMapper.xml`, which leads to SQL injection.
*   The keyword blacklist implemented for SQL injection prevention is incomplete and can be bypassed using techniques like error-based injection with functions like `GTID_SUBSET`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, stemming from unsafe SQL query construction. The application directly incorporates user-controlled input into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application relies on a blacklist approach to prevent SQL injection, which is fundamentally flawed due to the difficulty of anticipating all possible malicious inputs.
*   **Improper use of SQL parameter:** The use of `$` for SQL splicing in the xml files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service.
*   Error-based SQL injection can leak database information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerable interface is `/api/sys_msg/list/1/10`, and the vulnerable parameter is `orders`.
*   The attacker can inject SQL code through the `orders` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to make requests to the vulnerable endpoint with malicious SQL code within the vulnerable parameter.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue was identified in DataEase version 1.18.4 and fixed in version 1.18.5.
*   The advisory mentions that several other XML files also use `$` for SQL splicing which suggests the vulnerability might exist in other parts of the application.
