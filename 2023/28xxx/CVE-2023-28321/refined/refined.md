{
  "CVE-2023-28321": {
    "description": "curl supports matching of wildcard patterns when listed as \"Subject Alternative Name\" in TLS server certificates. curl can be built to use its own name matching function for TLS rather than one provided by a TLS library. This private wildcard matching function would match IDN (International Domain Name) hosts incorrectly and could as a result accept patterns that otherwise should mismatch.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to an incorrect implementation of wildcard matching for IDN hostnames in curl's private name matching function for TLS.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Certificate Validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially bypass TLS certificate validation by crafting a malicious certificate that exploits the flawed wildcard matching logic, potentially leading to man-in-the-middle attacks.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through a TLS server presenting a certificate with a specially crafted wildcard in the 'Subject Alternative Name' field that the vulnerable curl client connects to.",
      "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to control a malicious server and issue a specially crafted certificate."
