- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of the "flags" attribute within HTTP headers, which allows an attacker to browse the filesystem or execute remote code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The primary vulnerability is an arbitrary file read vulnerability that, in some circumstances, can lead to remote code execution. This is due to a lack of proper input sanitization and validation of the 'flags' attribute in the HTTP headers.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exploitation of the vulnerability allows an attacker to browse the filesystem of the affected device and, in some scenarios, execute remote code. This access is achieved without any prior authentication.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves sending a crafted HTTP request to a vulnerable URL on the Array AG/vxAG device. The malicious request leverages the improperly handled "flags" attribute within the HTTP header.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker only needs network access to the vulnerable Array AG/vxAG device to exploit the vulnerability. No authentication is required.
