Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-28852:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the dashboard administration functionality. Specifically, an authenticated user with dashboard administration rights can inject malicious code into the dashboard form.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS issue. This means the malicious code is stored on the server (in the dashboard settings) and executed when other users access the dashboard.
- Lack of Input Sanitization: The system doesn't adequately sanitize or validate the input received when users customize dashboards.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Malicious Code Execution: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the browsers of other users who view the affected dashboard.
- Potential for Account Takeover: Depending on the nature of the injected code, this could lead to more serious issues such as session hijacking, stealing user credentials, or performing unauthorized actions on behalf of the victim users.
- Data exfiltration or modification: The attacker can steal sensitive data or modify page content for the users viewing the dashboard.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack: The attack is performed remotely over the network.
- Dashboard Customization: The attacker exploits the dashboard administration interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated User: The attacker needs to be a valid user with dashboard administration privileges.
- High privileges are required for the initial attack: As a user with dashboard administration rights.
- User Interaction: Other users are required to interact with the crafted dashboard to trigger the XSS payload, which is a consequence of the stored XSS type.

**Additional Details:**

- **Affected Versions:** GLPI versions 9.5.0 and later are affected up to 9.5.12, as well as versions 10.0.0 up to 10.0.6.
