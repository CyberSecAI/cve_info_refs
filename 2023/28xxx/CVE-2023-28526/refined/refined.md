The provided content is related to **CVE-2023-28527**, not CVE-2023-28526. The description states that IBM Informix archecker, cdr, and onsmsync are vulnerable to heap buffer overflow.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Heap buffer overflow due to invalid parameters passed to `archecker`, `cdr`, and `onsmsync` utilities.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap buffer overflow.

**Impact of exploitation:** The vulnerability could lead to a denial of service or potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system. The specific impact is not described in further detail.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves invoking the `archecker`, `cdr`, or `onsmsync` utilities with specially crafted, invalid parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be able to invoke these utilities with the specific invalid parameters required to trigger the overflow. This may require access to the system where Informix is installed.
