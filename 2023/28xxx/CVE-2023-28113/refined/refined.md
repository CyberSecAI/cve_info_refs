{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Insufficient validation of Diffie-Hellman (DH) keys during key exchange.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The code does not validate DH public keys to ensure they fall within the range 1 < e < p-1, where 'e' is the public key and 'p' is the prime modulus.",
      "The code does not validate the generated private keys to ensure they are within the valid range 0 < y < q, or 1 < x < q.",
      "The code uses `rng.gen_biguint()` which can produce a private key consisting of zeros."
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious client or server can manipulate DH key exchange parameters, leading to insecure shared secrets. This breaks the confidentiality of the connection, potentially allowing eavesdropping and data compromise.",
    "attack_vectors": "Network-based attacks where a malicious client or server manipulates the DH key exchange process.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be positioned to intercept and manipulate the key exchange process. The attacker needs to be able to act as a malicious peer.",
    "additional_information": [
      "The vulnerability is a violation of RFC 4253 and RFC 8268.",
        "The issue lies in how the russh library handles the Diffie-Hellman key exchange. It does not properly validate the received DH public keys nor the generated private keys.",
        "An attacker can potentially set the DH public key to 1, resulting in the shared secret always being 1, or other insecure order-2 subgroups.",
        "The fix involves adding validations to both public and private keys and generating the private keys within the valid range to prevent the generation of 0 keys."
