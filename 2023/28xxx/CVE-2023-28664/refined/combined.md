Medium

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

Joshua Martinelle of Tenable Research discovered multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities across a number of WordPress plugins. This advisory will track each vulnerability as information and fixes become available.

---

**Quick Event Manager : CVE-2023-23491 - Unauthenticated Reflected Cross-Site Scripting**

**Reference:** https://wordpress.org/plugins/quick-event-manager/

**Affected Versions:** < 9.7.5

**CVSSv3 Vector:**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

**CVSSv3 Score:**6.1

There is a reflected XSS vulnerability in the 'category' parameter of the 'qem\_ajax\_calendar' action, as the parameter is reflected in the response without prior filtering. The vulnerable code is present in the function 'qem\_show\_calendar()' of the file 'legacy/quick-event-manager.php'.

**Proof of Concept:**

Any user visiting the following link, where TARGET\_HOST is the instance of wordpress with the plugin installed, will trigger the reflected XSS payload:

```

http://TARGET_HOST/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=qem_ajax_calendar&category=</script><script>alert(1)</script>

```

---

**Login with Phone Number : CVE-2023-23492 - Unauthenticated Reflected Cross-Site Scripting**

**Reference:** https://wordpress.org/plugins/quick-event-manager/

**Affected Versions:** < 1.4.2

**CVSSv3 Vector:**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

**CVSSv3 Score:**6.1

The 'ID' parameter of the 'lwp\_forgot\_password' action is used in the response without any filtering leading to an reflected XSS. Although the response is encoded in JSON, the Content-Type of the response is text/html which allows the exploitation of the vulnerability. This vulnerability is present in the './login-with-phonenumber.php' file in the 'lwp\_forgot\_password()' function.

**Proof of Concept:**

Any user visiting the following link, where TARGET\_HOST is the instance of wordpress with the plugin installed, will trigger the reflected XSS payload:

```

http://TARGET_HOST/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=lwp_forgot_password&ID=<svg%20onload=alert(1)>

```

---

**WP Helper Lite : CVE-2023-0448 - Unauthenticated Reflected Cross-Site Scripting**

**Reference:** https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-helper-lite/

**Affected Versions:** < 4.3

**CVSSv3 Vector:**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

**CVSSv3 Score:**6.1

The plugin displays all of the user's GET parameters in the response to the **surveySubmit** action without any filtering. The vulnerable code is present in the function '**surveySubmit\_func()'** of the file '**includes/class-mbwp-helper.php**'

**Proof of Concept:**

Any user visiting the following link, where TARGET\_HOST is the instance of wordpress with the plugin installed, will trigger the reflected XSS payload:

```

http://TARGET_HOST/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=surveySubmit&aaa=xxx"><svg%20onload=alert(1)>
```

---

**Meta Data and Taxonomies Filter : CVE-2023-28664 - Authenticated Reflected Cross-Site Scripting**

**Reference:** https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-meta-data-filter-and-taxonomy-filter/

**Affected Versions:** < 1.3.1

**CVSSv3 Vector:**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

**CVSSv3 Score:**5.4

The plugin appears to have an incorrect usage of the core function '**esc\_html\_\_**' which can lead to a reflected XSS via the '**tax\_name**' parameter.

**Proof of Concept:**

An authenticated user visiting the following link, where TARGET\_HOST is the instance of WordPress with the plugin installed, will trigger the reflected XSS payload:

```

http://TARGET_HOST/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=mdf_get_tax_options_in_widget&tax_name=<svg/onload=alert(1)>
```

---

**Woo Bulk Price Update : CVE-2023-28665 - Authenticated Reflected Cross-Site Scripting**

**Reference:** https://wordpress.org/plugins/woo-bulk-price-update/

**Affected Versions:** < 2.2.2

**CVSSv3 Vector:**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

**CVSSv3 Score:**5.4

The '**page**' parameter to the **techno\_get\_products** action is used in the response without any filtering leading to a reflected XSS.

**Proof of Concept:**

An authenticated user visiting the following link, where TARGET\_HOST is the instance of WordPress with the plugin installed, will trigger the reflected XSS payload:

```

http://TARGET_HOST/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=techno_get_products&page=<svg%20onload=alert(1)>
```

---

**InPost Gallery : CVE-2023-28666 - Authenticated Reflected Cross-Site Scripting**

**Reference:** https://wordpress.org/plugins/inpost-gallery/

**Affected Versions:** <= 2.1.4.1

**CVSSv3 Vector:**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

**CVSSv3 Score:**5.4

The '**imgurl**' parameter to the **add\_inpost\_gallery\_slide\_item** action is used in the response without any filtering leading to an reflected XSS which could be triggered against authenticated users.

**Proof of Concept:**

An authenticated user visiting the following link, where TARGET\_HOST is the instance of WordPress with the plugin installed, will trigger the reflected XSS payload:

```

http://TARGET_HOST/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=add_inpost_gallery_slide_item&imgurl="><svg%20onload=alert(1)>
```

Все бы ничего но заставить работать фильтр на странице категории таксономии так и не удалось, перелазил кучу настроек шаблона и прочего, вообщем бесполезный плагин

I was very worried at first because it seemed too complex to me but the tutorials and documents on the site helped me a lot. It took me quite a while to build the search engine in the way I wanted but in the end, I was happy with the result. Definitely a very professional tool with lots of options and flexibility.
Beyond that, I just want to thank the developers who are always willing to help, available and professional. I have answered almost all the questions, given solutions and felt that I was not alone 🙂

This a really GREAT plugin that can transform the way users can interact with site!
The plugin has many features and options, I didn’t need to use all of them in my project.
Because of this, of the many possibilities of use, it is not a super simple plugin, but the author answers your questions if you you have them.
Thank you!

I am creating an event website in where I need tremendous amount of search options. I tried all possible event calendar plugins yet none of them was an answer for my complex search/sort need.
It is a free plugin but I will pay for it to show my respect and gratitude. Plus: The author is very responsive and talented, he solved my problem with one sentence email. Good job !

* ##### [CVE-2025-23040](https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-23040)

  ###### medium

  GitHub Desktop is an open-source Electron-based GitHub app designed for git development. An attacker convincing a user to clone a repository directly or through a submodule can allow the attacker access to the user's credentials through the use of maliciously crafted remote URL. GitHub Desktop relies on Git to perform all network related operations (such as cloning, fetching, and pushing). When a user attempts to clone a repository GitHub Desktop will invoke `git clone` and when Git encounters a remote which requires authentication it will request the credentials for that remote host from GitHub Desktop using the git-credential protocol. Using a maliciously crafted URL it's possible to cause the credential request coming from Git to be misinterpreted by Github Desktop such that it will send credentials for a different host than the host that Git is currently communicating with thereby allowing for secret exfiltration. GitHub username and OAuth token, or credentials for other Git remote hosts stored in GitHub Desktop could be improperly transmitted to an unrelated host. Users should update to GitHub Desktop 3.4.12 or greater which fixes this vulnerability. Users who suspect they may be affected should revoke any relevant credentials.
