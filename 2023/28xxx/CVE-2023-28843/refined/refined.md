Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-28843

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from improper neutralization of SQL parameters within the PayPal module for PrestaShop versions 1.5 and 1.6. Specifically, the `receiver_email` parameter was not properly sanitized before being used in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The primary weakness is the presence of an SQL injection vulnerability. The lack of sanitization of the `receiver_email` parameter in the `ipn.php` file allowed for arbitrary SQL code to be injected and executed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to:
  - Leak technical and personal data.
  - Obtain administrative access to the PrestaShop instance.
  - Remove all data of the linked PrestaShop.
  - Display sensitive tables on the front-office, potentially exposing admin's ajax scripts of modules protected by tokens.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack can be performed remotely over the network.
- **Attack Complexity:** The attack complexity is low.
- **Privileges Required:** No privileges are needed to exploit this vulnerability
- **User Interaction:** No user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable PrestaShop instance.
- The attacker does not need any specific privileges or user interaction to trigger the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerability was located in the `ipn.php` file of the PayPal module. The following code snippet shows the fix applied in version 3.16.4:

     $custom = Tools::jsonDecode(Tools::getValue('custom'), true);
-    Db::getInstance()->insert('paypal_hss_email_error', array('id_cart' => $custom['id_cart'], 'email' => Tools::getValue('receiver_email')));
+    Db::getInstance()->insert('paypal_hss_email_error', array('id_cart' => (int) $custom['id_cart'], 'email' => pSQL(Tools::getValue('receiver_email', ''))));
 }
```
The fix uses `pSQL()` to sanitize the `receiver_email` value before inserting it into the database, preventing SQL injection.
