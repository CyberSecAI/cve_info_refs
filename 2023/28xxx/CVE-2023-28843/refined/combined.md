Mar 31, 2023

## Package

(PrestaShop)

## Affected versions

> 3.12.0, < 3.16.4

## Description

### Impact

* Technical and personal data leaks
* Obtain admin access
* Remove all data of the linked PrestaShop
* Display sensitives tables to front-office to unlock potential admin's ajax scripts of modules protected by token on the ecosystem

You can also install an adhoc module that verify and patch if necessary the vulnerability. Follow the [knowledge base](https://desk.202-ecommerce.com/portal/en/kb/articles/security-advisory-cve-2023-28843#How_tho_verify_if_my_module_is_vulnerable_).

### Other recommandations

* It's recommended to upgrade the module beyond 3.16.4.
* Upgrade PrestaShop beyond 1.7.8.8 (and 8.0.1) to disable multiquery executions (separated by ";").
* Change the default database prefix ps\_ by a new longer arbitrary prefix. Nethertheless, be warned that this is useless against blackhat with DBA senior skill because of a design vulnerability in DBMS
* Activate OWASP 942’s rules on your WAF (Web application firewall), be warned that you will probably break your backoffice and you will need to pre-configure some bypasses against these set of rules.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
