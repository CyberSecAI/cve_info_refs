Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2023-28487:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from Sudo not properly escaping control characters in `sudoreplay -l` output. This means that user-controlled input containing special characters could be processed without proper sanitization when listing recorded sessions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Output Sanitization:** Sudo fails to escape control characters when listing recorded sessions with `sudoreplay -l`. This allows these characters to be interpreted by the terminal emulator.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure**: The primary impact is the potential for disclosure of sensitive information.
- The lack of proper escaping could lead to the alteration of terminal output, potentially allowing an attacker to inject malicious content into the output viewed by users. This could be misleading or used to socially engineer users.
- The specific output of `sudoreplay -l` contains information about sudo sessions. While the specific content is not detailed, it is implied that control characters could be used to manipulate how this session information is displayed, potentially obscuring or changing what is visible.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Manipulated Log Data:** Attackers can manipulate the log data by embedding control characters within commands executed through sudo.
- **Command Injection** Attackers cannot directly inject code, but they could inject misleading information in log entries which is then shown to other users in `sudoreplay -l` output.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to execute commands through sudo:** The attacker must be able to execute commands through sudo.
- **Access to or influence over log data:** The attacker needs to be able to create log entries that contain control characters. This is typically achieved by executing commands with those characters.
- **Access to `sudoreplay` command**: Attackers must be able to execute `sudoreplay -l` command in order to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix for this issue involves escaping control characters using octal representation (`#nnn`) in the `sudoreplay -l` output.
- The fix also includes changes to how command-line arguments with spaces and special characters are logged, surrounding them with single quotes and escaping literal single quotes and backslashes.
- The vulnerability is also related to CVE-2023-28486, which involves similar issues with log messages themselves.
- The vulnerability is classified as a medium severity issue, having a CVSS score of 5.3.
- This vulnerability is present in Sudo versions prior to 1.9.13.
