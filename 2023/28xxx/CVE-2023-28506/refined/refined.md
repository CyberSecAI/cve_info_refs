{
  "CVE-2023-28506": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `change_account()` function in `udapi_slave` copies the `account` argument into a fixed-size stack buffer using `u2memcpy` without proper bounds checking. The size of the copy is taken directly from the user input and can exceed the buffer size.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Stack buffer overflow",
	  "Insecure use of `u2memcpy`"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation leads to remote code execution as the authenticated user. With CVE-2023-28503, this is exploitable by an unauthenticated attacker with root privileges.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Network exploitation of the `udcs` service leading to execution of `udapi_server` and `udapi_slave`.",
	  "Specially crafted RPC request to `udapi_server` that includes an overly long `account` name, which is then passed on to the `udapi_slave` service."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be able to send a crafted request to the `unirpcd` daemon. Using the auth bypass from CVE-2023-28503, the attacker does not need valid credentials."
