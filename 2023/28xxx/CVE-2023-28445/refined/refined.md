Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of resizable `ArrayBuffer` objects within asynchronous built-in functions in Deno. Specifically, if a resizable `ArrayBuffer` is passed to an asynchronous native function and is shrunk during the asynchronous operation, it can lead to out-of-bounds read/write operations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read:** The vulnerability could lead to reading data outside the allocated boundaries of the `ArrayBuffer`.
*   **CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write:** The vulnerability could also lead to writing data outside the allocated boundaries of the `ArrayBuffer`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could potentially achieve arbitrary code execution, data corruption, or denial of service due to the out-of-bounds read/write.
*   The vulnerability has high confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network (AV:N):** The vulnerability is exploitable over a network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low privileges required (PR:L):** The attacker would need some kind of low privilege access.
*   **Low attack complexity (AC:L):** The attack does not require complex techniques.
*   **No user interaction (UI:N):** The attack doesn't require any user interaction.
*   **Scope Changed (S:C):** Exploitation of the vulnerability can affect resources outside the security scope of the vulnerable component.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Deno version 1.32.0
*   The issue has been addressed in Deno version 1.32.1 by temporarily disabling resizable `ArrayBuffer`s.
*   Deno 1.32.2 will re-enable resizable `ArrayBuffer`s with a proper fix.
*   Deno Deploy users are not affected by this vulnerability.
