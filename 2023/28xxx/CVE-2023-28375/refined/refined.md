Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2023-28375:

**Vulnerability:** Use of GET Request Method with Sensitive Query Strings (CWE-598)

*   **Root Cause:** The Osprey Pump Controller versions prior to release 20230518, uses the GET request method to handle sensitive query strings, which can lead to unauthenticated file disclosure.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Unauthenticated File Disclosure:** The system allows retrieval of arbitrary files and sensitive system information using GET parameters without any authentication. This exposes potentially confidential data.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to read arbitrary files from the system, including sensitive system information. This could lead to further attacks or compromise.

*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted HTTP GET request with a specific parameter.

*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**: The attacker can exploit this remotely with low attack complexity and no required privileges. No user interaction is required.
