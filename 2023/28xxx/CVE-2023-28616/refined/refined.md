- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The serverd component logs passwords containing "=" or " " (space) characters in plaintext.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Passwords are not properly sanitized or masked before being written to log files, resulting in plaintext storage.
- **Impact of exploitation**: If these log files are sent to a Syslog server, the plaintext passwords can be retrieved, leading to a confidentiality breach.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker with access to the log files, either on the local system or remotely via Syslog, can potentially extract plaintext passwords. The attack vector is considered to be "Adjacent Network."
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs access to the log files, which can be obtained through access to the system or the Syslog server where logs are forwarded. No specific privileges are required (PR:N), and no user interaction is needed (UI:N).
