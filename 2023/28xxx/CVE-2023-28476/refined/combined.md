There have been a number of medium and low security vulnerabilities that have been fixed in version 9 through 9.2. Thanks so much to all the community members who report vulnerabilities following the process outlined on https://www.concretecms.org/security so that they can be triaged and remediated!

Please note that CVE-2022-46464 was NOT created by the Concrete CMS team. After finding out about the CVE and investigating, our security team has determined that it is not a valid vulnerability. We have informed MITRE to have it recalled.

We have obtained the following new Concrete CMS CVEs to advise the community of validated weaknesses in previous versions.

We are excited to announce the release of Concrete version 9.2.3, as well as an update for Concrete CMS version 8.5, now at version 8.5.14. These releases come with a number of security updates, reinforcing our commitment to the security and reliability of Concrete CMS.

The CVE review also identified some CVEs which needed to have the affected versions tweaked. A special thank you goes out to all community members who diligently report vulnerabilities via our channels on [Concrete CMS Security](https://www.concretecms.org/security) and [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/concretecms?type=team). Your contributions are invaluable in helping us maintain a robust and secure platform.
