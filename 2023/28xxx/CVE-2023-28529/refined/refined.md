- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a stored XSS, which means malicious script can be persistently stored in the application's database and executed when a user views the affected page.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the application. These scripts would be executed in the context of other users' browsers, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the application's web interface, where an attacker can inject malicious code into input fields or data that is later displayed to other users.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to submit data that is later displayed to other users. This might involve compromising an authenticated user account.
