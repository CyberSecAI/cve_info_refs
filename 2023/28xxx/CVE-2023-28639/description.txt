GLPI is a free asset and IT management software package. Starting in version 0.85 and prior to versions 9.5.13 and 10.0.7, a malicious link can be crafted by an unauthenticated user. It will be able to exploit a reflected XSS in case any authenticated user opens the crafted link. This issue is fixed in versions 9.5.13 and 10.0.7.
