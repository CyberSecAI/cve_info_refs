  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The fullscreen notification on Firefox for Android could be blocked by using download popups.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of UI elements",
      "Insufficient layering of notifications"
     ],
    "impact": "The fullscreen notification, essential to warn users they are entering fullscreen mode, could be hidden. This could result in user confusion or spoofing attacks because the fullscreen mode lacks the omnibox.",
    "attack_vectors": "A malicious website could trigger a download popup while simultaneously requesting fullscreen mode, thereby obscuring the fullscreen notification.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to control a website visited by the user and induce both a download popup and a fullscreen request."
  },
  "affected_products": [
    "Firefox for Android"
  ],
  "fix_versions": [
    "Firefox 111"
  ],
 "additional_notes": "The fix involves refactoring the snackbar and download dialogs functionality to ensure the snackbar is always placed on top of the download dialogs. This resolves the issue of the download popup obscuring the fullscreen notification."
