# usd-2022-0033 | Seafile 9.0.6 - Open redirect

**Advisory ID:** usd-2022-0033

**Product:** Seafile

**Affected Version:** 9.0.6

**Vulnerability Type:** URL Redirection to Untrusted Site (CWE-601)

**Security Risk:** Medium

**Vendor URL:** https://seafile.com

**Vendor Status:** fixed

**CVE number:**  requested

## Description

The Seafile application allows to set up a self-hosted cloud storage system. It supports common functions such as synchronization of files between server and client, as well as group sharing.

The `next` parameter in the `/accounts/login` endpoint allows an remote attacker to redirect users to arbitrary sites.

## Proof of Concept

The `next` parameter in the Seafile 9.0.6 `/accounts/login` endpoint is vulnerable to Open Redirect. An example request is shown below.

```
$  curl -v http://localhost.localdomain/accounts/login/?next=https://usd.de

```

In this example, after logging in, a user would be redirected to the web page specified in the `next` parameter.

## Fix

It is recommended not to use dynamic forwarding. If this is not possible, it is recommended to perform forwarding only to explicitly allowed destinations.

Our [CST Academy](https://www.usd.de/en/cst-academy/) and our [usd HeroLab](https://herolab.usd.de/en/) are essential parts of our security mission. We share the knowledge we gain in our practical work and our research through training courses and publications.
