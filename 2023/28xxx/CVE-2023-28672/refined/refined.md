The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities, and this response focuses solely on **CVE-2023-28672**.

**CVE-2023-28672**:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The OctoPerf Load Testing Plugin 4.5.1 and earlier versions lack proper permission checks in a connection test HTTP endpoint.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing permission check.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with Overall/Read permission can connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs, potentially capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.
*   **Attack vectors**: Network-based, by sending HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have Overall/Read permission in Jenkins and know the ID of the credentials stored in Jenkins. They also need to be able to send HTTP requests to the Jenkins server.
