Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-28339:

**Verification:**

The content directly references CVE-2023-28339 and includes discussions, proof of concept, and mitigations related to the vulnerability described in the CVE.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of isolation between the controlling terminal and the process spawned by OpenDoas. Specifically, OpenDoas does not create a pseudo-terminal (pty) for the new session when a tty is attached to the process, making it vulnerable to terminal injection attacks via ioctls like `TIOCSTI` and `TIOCLINUX`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Terminal Sharing:** OpenDoas shares the controlling terminal with the user whose command it executes.
- **`TIOCSTI` ioctl vulnerability:** Allows injecting arbitrary characters into the input stream of the shared terminal.
- **`TIOCLINUX` ioctl vulnerability:** Allows executing arbitrary commands within the shared terminal (as reported later in the discussion).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Privilege Escalation:** A user can exploit this vulnerability to inject commands into the terminal of the user running `doas`, potentially escalating privileges if the target user has higher privileges.
- **TTY Hijacking:** An attacker can take over the terminal session of the user running `doas`.
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** By injecting commands, an attacker can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running `doas`.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Attack:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system and the ability to execute `doas` and have a tty.
- **Terminal Injection:** By using `TIOCSTI` and/or `TIOCLINUX` ioctls, an attacker can inject malicious code or commands into the shared terminal.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local User Access:** The attacker must have a user account on the system where `OpenDoas` is installed.
- **`doas` execution:** They must be able to execute `doas`.
- **TTY Connection:** They must be in a context where a tty is attached (e.g. interactive shell).
- **Knowledge of ioctl:** The attacker must be able to leverage `TIOCSTI` or `TIOCLINUX` ioctls to inject the commands.

**Additional Details from Content:**

- The vulnerability is present in OpenDoas version 6.8.2 and earlier.
- The issue was initially highlighted in the context of Arch Linux but is applicable to any system with `TIOCSTI` and `TIOCLINUX` enabled.
- The `su` command has a `--pty` option to mitigate this. `OpenDoas` lacks an equivalent mechanism.
- OpenBSD disables the `TIOCSTI` syscall by default, so is not affected.
- Linux kernel versions 6.2 and later can disable `TIOCSTI` via a sysctl (`dev.tty.legacy_tiocsti`), and 6.7 and later can disable `TIOCLINUX`.
- A proof-of-concept code using `TIOCSTI` ioctl is provided to demonstrate the vulnerability.
- Discussions include potential mitigations such as using `setsid(2)`, seccomp, and implementing pty handling similar to `sudo`.
- The main issue is the lack of a pseudo-terminal for the session, which allows attacks against terminal file descriptors.
- There is discussion on whether a default pty should be implemented and disabling it via command line option.
- The vulnerability is not unique to OpenDoas but was also present in tools like `su` and `sudo`.
- It is also noted that both util-linux and GNU coreutils have reverted their mitigation based on libseccomp in the past.

**Summary:**

CVE-2023-28339 describes a privilege escalation vulnerability in OpenDoas due to the lack of proper terminal isolation. By using the `TIOCSTI` and `TIOCLINUX` ioctls, a local user can inject commands into the terminal of the user running doas, leading to potential privilege escalation. While newer Linux kernels provide options to disable these ioctls, this does not address the issue for older kernels or other OSes and does not address the root cause of the vulnerability.
