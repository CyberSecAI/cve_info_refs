Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The Nextcloud server's API endpoint `/ocs/v1.php/cloud/user` was exposing the full path to the user's data directory in the `storageLocation` field of the JSON response.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Information Disclosure (CWE-212):** The vulnerability lies in the exposure of sensitive server-side file system information (full path of data directory) to authenticated users via an API endpoint.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Limited Direct Impact:** The disclosed path itself doesn't immediately compromise the server, as it requires prior authentication.
*   **Potential for Enhanced Attacks:** The information can be used to speed up or enable other attacks, by providing an attacker with additional knowledge of the server's filesystem structure.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is performed via network requests to the API endpoint `/ocs/v1.php/cloud/user`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a valid user of the Nextcloud instance. This means the attacker has a valid username/password to access the platform.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the Nextcloud server to make the API request.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability has a low severity score (3.5) due to its low confidentiality impact and the requirement for user authentication.
*   The fix involves restricting access to the `storageLocation` information, so that it's only visible to system administrators and not regular users, including group admins.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in Nextcloud versions 24.0.10, 25.0.4, and 23.0.14 and Nextcloud Enterprise versions 23.0.14, 24.0.10, 25.0.4.
