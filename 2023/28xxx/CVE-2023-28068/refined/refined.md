- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper folder permissions in Dell Command | Monitor when installed to a non-default path.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Inadequate access control leading to privilege escalation
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local, authenticated attacker can achieve privilege escalation by writing to a protected directory. This could allow the attacker to gain higher level access on the affected system, potentially leading to further compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to the system with an existing authenticated user account.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have an existing local user account and the ability to write to the vulnerable directory which is only exposed when Dell Command | Monitor is installed to a non-default location.
