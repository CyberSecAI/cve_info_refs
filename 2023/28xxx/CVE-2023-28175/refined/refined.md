The provided content is related to CVE-2023-28175.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Bosch Video Management System (BVMS) uses an SSH server that does not restrict port forwarding requested by an authenticated SSH client.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper authorization in the SSH server.
- Unrestricted port forwarding.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An authenticated attacker can request port forwarding through the BVMS SSH server to resources within the trusted internal network, which are normally protected from the WAN interface. This could allow access to resources beyond the scope of the BVMS, potentially exposing sensitive information. The impact includes information exposure and potential for unauthorized modification of internal network resources.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack.
- Exploitation of the SSH service.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be a legitimate user authenticated to the SSH server on the vulnerable BVMS or DIVAR IP device.
- The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable device.
