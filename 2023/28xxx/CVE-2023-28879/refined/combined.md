# Recent Changes in Ghostscript

## Version 10.04.0 (2024-09-18)

Highlights in this release include:

* This release addresses CVEs: CVE-2024-46951, CVE-2024-46952, CVE-2024-46953, CVE-2024-46954, CVE-2024-46955, CVE-2024-46956
* **IMPORTANT:** In this release (10.04.0) we have be added protection for
  device selection from PostScript input. This will mean that, by default, only the device specified
  on the command line will be permitted. Similar to the file permissions, there will be a "--permit-devices="
  allowing a comma separation list of allowed devices. This will also take a single wildcard "\*" allowing any device.

  Any application which relies on allowing PostScript to change devices during a job will have to be aware, and take action
  to deal with this change.

  The exception is "nulldevice", switching to that requires no special action.
* Our efforts in code hygiene and maintainability continue.
* The usual round of bug fixes, compatibility changes, and incremental improvements.
* (9.53.0) We have added the capability to build with the Tesseract OCR engine. In such
  a build, new devices are available (pdfocr8/pdfocr24/pdfocr32) which render the
  output file to an image, OCR that image, and output the image "wrapped" up as a
  PDF file, with the OCR generated text information included as "invisible" text
  (in PDF terms, text rendering mode 3).

  Mainly due to time constraints, we only support including Tesseract from
  source included in our release packages, and not linking to Tesseract/Leptonica
  shared libraries. Whether we add this capability will be largely dependent on
  community demand for the feature.

  See [Enabling OCR](https://www.ghostscript.com/ocr.html) for more details.

please visit [bugs.ghostscript.com](http://bugs.ghostscript.com/).
### Incompatible changes

#### Included below are incompatible changes from recent releases (the specific release in question is listed in parentheses). We include these, for now, as we are aware that not everyone upgrades with every release.

* (10.03.1) Almost all the "internal" PostScript procedures defined
  during the interpreter startup are now "executeonly", further reducing
  the attack surface of the interpreter.

  The nature of these procedures means there should be no impact for legitimate
  usage, but it is possible it will impact uses which abuse the previous accessibility
  (even for legitimate reasons). Such cases may now require "DELAYBIND",
  See [DELAYBIND](https://ghostscript.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Use.html#ddelaybind)
* (10.03.1) The "makeimagedevice" non-standard operator has been removed. It allowed
  low level access to the graphics library in a way that was, essentially impossible to secure.
* (10.03.1) The "putdeviceprops", "getdeviceprops", "finddevice",
  "copydevice", "findprotodevice" non-standard operators have all been removed.
  They provided functionality that is either accessible through standard operators, or should not
  be used by user PostScript.
* (10.03.1) The process of "tidying" the PostScript namespace should have removed
  only non-standard and undocumented operators. Nevertheless, it is possible that
  any integrations or utilities that rely on those non-standard and undocumented
  operators may stop working or may change behaviour.

  If you encounter such a case, please contact us ([Discord,
  [#ghostscript IRC channel](https://web.libera.chat/#ghostscript),
  or the gs-devel mailing list would be best), and we'll work with you to either find an
  alternative solution or return the previous functionality, if there is genuinely no other
  option.](https://discord.gg/H9GXKwyPvY)
* (9.55.0) Changes to the `device API`. This will affect developers and maintainers of
  Ghostscript devices. Firstly, and most importantly, the way device-specific "procs" are specified has
  been rewritten to make it (we think!) clearer and less confusing. See
  [The Interface between Ghostscript and Device Drivers](https://ghostscript.readthedocs.io/Drivers.htm) and
  [The Great Device Rework Of 2021](https://www.notion.so/artifexsoftware/The-Great-Device-Rework-Of-2021-94092fe1395d4a088b91462f0ca5038a)
  for more details.
* (9.55.0) The command line options `-sGraphicsICCProfile=___`, `-dGraphicsIntent=#`, `-dGraphicsBlackPt=#`,
  `-dGraphicsKPreserve=#` have been changed to `-sVectorICCProfile=___`, `-dVectorIntent=#`, `-dVectorBlackPt=#`,
  `-dVectorKPreserve=#`.
* (9.53.0) As of 9.53.0, we have (re-)introduced the patch level to the version number,
  this helps facilitate a revised policy on handling security-related issues.

  **Note for GSView Users:** The patch level addition breaks GSView 5 (it is
  hardcoded to check for versions `704-999`. It is possible, but not guaranteed that
  a GSView update might be forthcoming to resolve this.
* (9.52) `-dALLOWPSTRANSPARENCY`: The transparency compositor (and related
  features), whilst we are improving it, remains sensitive to being driven correctly, and
  incorrect use can have unexpected/undefined results. Hence, as part of improving security,
  we limited access to these operators, originally using the `-dSAFER` feature.
  As we made "SAFER" the default mode, that became unacceptable, hence the new option
  `-dALLOWPSTRANSPARENCY` which enables access to the operators.
* (9.50) There are a couple of subtle incompatibilities between the old and new SAFER
  implementations. Firstly, as mentioned in the 9.50 release notes, SAFER now leaves
  standard PostScript functionality unchanged (except for the file access limitations).
  Secondly, the interaction with `save`/`restore` operations
  has changed. See [SAFER](https://ghostscript.readthedocs.io/Use.htm#Safer).

  **Important Note for Windows Users**:

  The file/path pattern matching is case-sensitive, even on Windows. This is a
  change in behaviour compared to the old code which, on Windows, was case
  *in*sensitive. This is in recognition of changes in Windows behaviour,
  in that it now supports (although does not enforce) case sensitivity.

### Changelog

From 9.55.0 onwards, in recognition of how unwieldy very large HTML files can become
(History9.html had reached 8.1Mb!), we intend to only include the summary highlights (above).

For anyone wanting the full details of the changes in
a release, we ask them to look at the history in our public git repository:
[ghostpdl-10.04.0](https://git.ghostscript.com/?p=ghostpdl.git;a=shortlog;h=refs/tags/ghostpdl-10.04.0) log.

If this change does not draw negative feedback, History?.htm file(s) will be removed from the release archives.

Package        : ghostscript
CVE ID         : CVE-2023-28879
Debian Bug     : 1033757

It was discovered that Ghostscript, the GPL PostScript/PDF interpreter,
is prone to a buffer overflow vulnerability in the (T)BCP encoding
filters, which could result in the execution of arbitrary code if
malformed document files are processed (despite the -dSAFER sandbox
being enabled).

For the stable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed in
version 9.53.3~dfsg-7+deb11u4.

We recommend that you upgrade your ghostscript packages.

For the detailed security status of ghostscript please refer to its
security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/ghostscript>

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=706494#c0)  hperri    2023-03-23 08:15:25 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 23886](attachment.cgi?id=23886 "This zip archive includes three POC for GhostScript version 9.55.0 pulled from the package manager on ubuntu, GhostScript 10.0.0 and 10.01.0, compiled from source on Debian") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=23886&action=edit "This zip archive includes three POC for GhostScript version 9.55.0 pulled from the package manager on ubuntu, GhostScript 10.0.0 and 10.01.0, compiled from source on Debian") This zip archive includes three POC for GhostScript version 9.55.0 pulled from the package manager on ubuntu, GhostScript 10.0.0 and 10.01.0, compiled from source on Debian  Hi,  I found an exploitable buffer overflow in the s_xBCPE_process (called by both BCPEncode and TBCPEncode filter), which seems to impact many version of GhostScript interpreter. Within the s_xBCPE_process, it is possible to ends up with the write pointer (q, in the code) greater than the write limit pointer (pw->limit). This can be achieved by trying to write more data than the target source can handle, and passing an escaped character as the last writable character.  The issue can be easily seen in debug mode (-Zs), with the following POC:   /writtenTo {4 string} def  /ourFilter writtenTo /BCPEncode filter def  /readsFrom <[414141134141](http://www.ghostscript.com/cgi-bin/findgit.cgi?414141134141)> def ourFilter readsFrom writestring ourFilter flushfile   After the write, to the filter, the debug statement should print:   [s]write process 0x560dc8218ba8(stream_state), nr=6, nw=4, end=0 [s]after write 0x560dc8218ba8, nr=2, nw=[4294967295](http://www.ghostscript.com/cgi-bin/findgit.cgi?4294967295), end=0, status=1   The nw=[4294967295](http://www.ghostscript.com/cgi-bin/findgit.cgi?4294967295) indicates that the pw->limit - pw->ptr operation overflowed. Any subsequent write to the filter will not be bounded.   This can be exploited by chaining two filter together, as demonstrated in the attached POC. The out of bound write will overwrite the current stream structure, allowing an attacker to craft handy arbitrary read and arbitrary write primitive or simply hijack a function pointer within the proc structure. With those primitive, it is possible to disable the sandbox by overwriting the path_control_active variable, and execute code on the victim machine.   I attached three POC, one for Ubuntu 22.04.2 GhostScript package (which is GhostScript 9.55), one for Debian with GhostScript version 10.0.0 compiled from source, and for Debian for GhostScript version 10.01.0, compiled from source. For any of those POC, the result should look like :   ./gs -dSAFER -f debian10.01.0.ps  GPL Ghostscript 10.01.0 (2023-03-22) Copyright (C) 2023 Artifex Software, Inc.  All rights reserved. This software is supplied under the GNU AGPLv3 and comes with NO WARRANTY: see the file COPYING for details. Found leak: 0x000055C5BA2A6D67 Null filter address will be @ 0x55C5BA2DB558 read cursor address -1 should be @ 0x55C5BA2DB5C7 context addr @ 0x000055C5B9FB0BD8 path_control addr @ 0x55C5B9FAE5BA GS<1>uid=1000(debian) gid=1000(debian) groups=1000(debian) [...]   As the escaped character in BCPEncode or TBCPEncode can not be written (at least with my POC) you may need to restart to exploit to get a correct ASRL layout. Furthermore, as describe in the POC, you may need to change the offset between the leak we get and the NullFilter created after.   For the remediation, I'm no C nor GhostScript expert, but I guess the s_xBCPE_process should check if incrementing twice the write pointer (q) does not result in q > pw->limit.   I stay at your disposition for any additional information.  Thanks, Hadrien. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=706494#c1)  Ken Sharp    2023-03-24 15:59:33 UTC  ``` Firstly apologies for the slow response, we were literally pushing the 10.01.0 release out the door on Wednesday which involves some administrivia so our attention was temporarily diverted.  I've made two commits to address this and potential related issues. The first is [37ed5022cecd584de868933b5b60da2e995b3179](http://www.ghostscript.com/cgi-bin/findgit.cgi?37ed5022cecd584de868933b5b60da2e995b3179) which prevents the overrun.  Secondly, in the same vein as we've done in the past with PostScript operators, commit [3635f4c75e54e337a4eebcf6db3eef0e60f9cebf](http://www.ghostscript.com/cgi-bin/findgit.cgi?3635f4c75e54e337a4eebcf6db3eef0e60f9cebf) removes a load of non-standard filters. Some of these were used by the old PDF interpreter, a number seem to have been included just for symmetry with a companion Encode/Decode filter, and a few I have no clue why they are there; they are not used. Removing these reduces the attack surface so we should do that.  I have not closed the bug!  I believe this warrants an out of band release (given the proof of concept), sadly only days after the main release but that's life.  I'd like to leave this open and therefore not publicly disclosed, even though technically there is a patch available, until we have a chance to make a release generally available. That won't, unfortunately, be before the weekend.  I'll leave the bug assigned to Chris to close when we have a patch release up. ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=706494#c2)  hperri    2023-03-27 08:54:07 UTC  ``` Hi,  Thanks for the quick response, I can confirm that removing filters and reducing the attack surface in general is a really good idea.  From an administrative point of view (I'm sorry to bother you with this), could this bug be eligible for your bug bounty program, or is this inquiries addressed in a completely different channel ?  Thanks,  Hadrien ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=706494#c3)  Chris Liddell (chrisl)    2023-03-27 13:39:52 UTC  ``` We have been assigned CVE-2023-28879 for this issue. ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=706494#c4)  Henry Stiles    2023-03-28 00:46:33 UTC  ``` (In reply to hperri from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=706494#c2)) > Hi, >  > Thanks for the quick response, I can confirm that removing filters and > reducing the attack surface in general is a really good idea. >  > From an administrative point of view (I'm sorry to bother you with this), > could this bug be eligible for your bug bounty program, or is this inquiries > addressed in a completely different channel ? >  > Thanks,  > Hadrien  Hello Hadrien, please write me at the email address associated with my Bugzilla user name about the bounty. ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=706494#c5)  Chris Liddell (chrisl)    2023-03-31 14:00:26 UTC  ``` For the attention of the distribution package maintainers CC'ed here:  Please roll out this patch to your Ghostscript pagage(s) ASAP, this is relevant to any version of Ghostscript:  <https://git.ghostscript.com/?p=ghostpdl.git;a=commitdiff;h=37ed5022cecd>   We plan to make this bug public in approximately 7 days. ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=706494#c6)  Mosaab    2023-07-20 08:35:14 UTC  ``` Hello,  Do you know how i can do this for PC (Windows 10)  I don't know how to fix it ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=706494#c7)  Ken Sharp    2023-07-20 08:44:51 UTC  ``` (In reply to Mosaab from [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=706494#c6)) > Hello, >  > Do you know how i can do this for PC (Windows 10) >  > I don't know how to fix it  <https://artifex.com/news/critical-security-vulnerability-fixed-in-ghostscript> ``` |  |
