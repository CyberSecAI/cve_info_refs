- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Weak encoding of passwords used to access critical Unified Diagnostics Services (UDS) in the Modular Infotainment Platform 3 (MIB3) infotainment system.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The password for accessing critical UDS is transmitted over the CAN bus in a form that can be easily decoded. This constitutes a weak encoding of the password.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with physical access to the vehicle can decode the transmitted password, potentially gaining unauthorized access to critical UDS. This could lead to further unauthorized actions, although the specific impact is not described here. The CVSS score indicates a low confidentiality impact but no integrity or availability impact.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is physical access to the vehicle, specifically the CAN bus.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs physical access to the vehicle's CAN bus and the ability to monitor the traffic to capture the weakly encoded password.
