Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-28106:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the "UrlSlug" data type within the Pimcore application. Specifically, the `prettyUrl` setting, which is part of document settings, was not being sanitized before being processed and stored. This allowed for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Cross-site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is a stored XSS. By injecting a malicious script into the `prettyUrl` setting, an attacker could have the script executed in the context of other users when they accessed the document settings.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application failed to sanitize the `prettyUrl` input before storing it in the database/application state.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Malicious Script Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browser of other users, allowing for various malicious activities such as:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Data theft
    *   Defacement of the application
    *   Redirecting users to malicious sites

**Attack vectors:**

*   An attacker would need to have the ability to modify the document settings, which includes the `prettyUrl` field. This typically requires the attacker to be an authenticated user with sufficient permissions.
*   The attacker would insert a malicious JavaScript payload into the `prettyUrl` field. When other users access the document settings, this script would execute in their browser context.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the necessary privileges to modify document settings.
*   **Document Modification Access:** The attacker needs to have the permission to access and modify the document settings, specifically to alter the "UrlSlug" data type or `prettyUrl` attribute.

**Additional details from the provided patch:**

The patch includes the following:

*   **Server-Side Sanitization:** In `DocumentControllerBase.php`, the `prettyUrl` setting is now sanitized using `htmlspecialchars()` before being set to the document.
*   **Client-Side Sanitization:** In `settings.js`, the `prettyUrl` input is sanitized using `pimcore.helpers.sanitizeUrlSlug()` before being sent to the server, and also on "change" event of input element..
*   **New `sanitizeUrlSlug` Function:** The `helpers.js` file includes a new `sanitizeUrlSlug` function, which removes characters that are not alphanumeric, hyphens, underscores, plus signs or forward slashes.

This multi-layered approach mitigates the vulnerability by ensuring that potentially harmful characters are removed from the input both on the client side before submission and on the server side before storage.
