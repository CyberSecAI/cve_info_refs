**CVE-2023-28820**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient sanitization of the `href` attribute within the RSS Displayer block. Specifically, the link element input was not sanitized, leading to a stored XSS vulnerability.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
*  **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor could inject arbitrary JavaScript code, which would then be executed in the browsers of users who viewed the compromised content. This could potentially allow an attacker to perform actions such as stealing cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or defacing content.
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   An attacker, with the necessary privileges (admin role), could inject malicious code into the RSS Displayer via the href attribute input.
    *   The XSS payload is stored and executed when the page containing the vulnerable RSS Displayer is visited by other users.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker must have administrative privileges (high privileged user) to modify the content of the RSS Displayer.
    *   The attacker needs to have the capability to modify the href attribute when adding or editing an RSS feed in the RSS Displayer block.
