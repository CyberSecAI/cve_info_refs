{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The UniRPC service uses weak or non-existent encryption methods for various communications and passwords, which does not provide sufficient security, and in some cases cancels out the encryption entirely or enables other attacks to work.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use of XOR with static byte for packet encryption.",
      "Negating each byte of password strings.",
      "XORing passwords with a fixed value.",
	  "Use of easily reversible encoding methods."
    ],
    "impact": "Exposes sensitive data, such as passwords, to eavesdropping. Can negate other obfuscation methods. Enables other vulnerabilities by allowing the inclusion of null bytes where they would not normally be permitted.",
    "attack_vectors": "Eavesdropping network traffic, or crafting specific packets to exploit weaknesses.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Ability to capture or monitor network traffic, or send crafted packets"
