Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2023-28400:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization of parameters in mySCADA myPRO versions 8.26.0 and prior. This allows for the injection of arbitrary operating system commands.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- OS Command Injection (CWE-78)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an authenticated user to inject and execute arbitrary operating system commands. This can lead to a complete compromise of the affected system, potentially allowing attackers to:
    - Gain full control of the HMI/SCADA system
    - Modify configurations
    - Disrupt operations
    - Steal sensitive data
    - Launch further attacks

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote, over the network.
- The attack requires an authenticated user.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have valid credentials to authenticate to the mySCADA myPRO system.
- The attacker needs to be able to access the system over the network.
- The attack has a low complexity, implying that the exploit is easy to implement.

**Additional Information:**
- The advisory also mentions public exploits are available for this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability affects mySCADA myPRO versions 8.26.0 and prior.
- The CVSS v3 base score is 9.9 with a vector string of AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H.
- The advisory mentions that the vulnerability is also tracked as CVE-2023-28716, CVE-2023-28384, CVE-2023-29169 and CVE-2023-29150.
