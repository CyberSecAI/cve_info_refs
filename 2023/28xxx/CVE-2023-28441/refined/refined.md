- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Passwords are being stored in plain text within error logs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Sensitive information exposure (passwords) due to insecure logging practices.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthorized access to user passwords, potentially leading to account compromise and further malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to the server or system where error logs are stored.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Attacker requires local access to the file system where the affected error logs reside.
