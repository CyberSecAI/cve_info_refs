# Denial Of Service when opening a corrupt PDF file

Moderate

[michaelrsweet](/michaelrsweet)
published
GHSA-68x8-9phf-j7jf
Mar 20, 2023

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

<= v1.1.0

## Patched versions

None

## Description

### Summary

*Short summary of the problem. Make the impact and severity as clear as possible. For example: An unsafe deserialization vulnerability allows any unauthenticated user to execute arbitrary code on the server.*

A DOS exists in the pdfio parser. crafted pdf files can cause the program to run at 100% utilization and never terminate.

This is different from CVE-2023-24808

### Details

*Give all details on the vulnerability. Pointing to the incriminated source code is very helpful for the maintainer.*

./pdfiototext pdfiototext-dos2.pdf > test.txt will recreate this vulnerability (i will include a URL for the file download).

The underlying pdfiototext library is vulnerable, not just the pdfiototext executable.

This was discovered by fuzzing, i am unsure exactly what portion of the code is responsible

### PoC

*Complete instructions, including specific configuration details, to reproduce the vulnerability.*

I am unable to attach the pdf which causes this behavior directly to this report. I am providing a download URL and the file hash. If you would like me to submit the pdf in another way, please let me know.

[pdfiototext-dos2.pdf](https://files.catbox.moe/8oy3rr.pdf)

```
$ curl https://files.catbox.moe/8oy3rr.pdf > pdfiototext-dos2.pdf && shasum -a 256 pdfiototext-dos2.pdf
821710518f8217d3961ebe24d9c40bbb69365a8d1c6ee1ef83ac7facc677aff6  pdfiototexst-dos2.pdf

$ ./pdfiototext pdfiototext-dos2.pdf

```
### Impact

*What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?*

Anyone who uses this library either as a standalone binary or as a library can be DOSed when attempting to parse this type of file. Web servers or other automated processes which rely on this code to turn pdf submissions into plaintext can be DOSed when an attacker uploads the pdf.

### Severity

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L

### CVE ID

CVE-2023-28428
