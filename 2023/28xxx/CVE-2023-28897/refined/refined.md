```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The secret value used for access to critical UDS (Unified Diagnostic Services) of the MIB3 infotainment system is hardcoded in the firmware.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Use of hard-coded credentials (CWE-798) leading to authentication bypass (CAPEC-115).",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Compromise of UDS services, potentially allowing unauthorized access to diagnostic and control functions of the MIB3 infotainment unit. The direct impact of this is low (CVSS:3.1/C:L), since it only allows information disclosure, without any impact to integrity or availability.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local access is required to the affected device to exploit this vulnerability (CVSS:3.1/AV:L).",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs local access to the MIB3 infotainment unit. No special user privileges are needed (CVSS:3.1/PR:N)."
