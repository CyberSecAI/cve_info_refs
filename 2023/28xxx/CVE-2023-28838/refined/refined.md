Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2023-28838:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw present within the dynamic reports functionality of GLPI.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The core issue is the lack of proper sanitization or parameterization of user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries for dynamic reports. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Extraction:** An attacker could exploit the SQL injection to extract sensitive data from the database, including potentially all data.
- **Webshell Creation:** In some scenarios, an attacker could potentially write a webshell to the server by exploiting the SQL injection, leading to further compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
- **Dynamic Reports:** The attack vector is through the dynamic reports feature in GLPI.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Privileges:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated user with access rights to either "Statistics" or "Reports" features. This implies they do not require administrative access but need at least basic access to the application.
- **No User Interaction:**  Exploitation does not require any user interaction beyond the attacker submitting the malicious SQL payload.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is rated as **High severity**.
- The vulnerability has been patched in GLPI versions 9.5.13 and 10.0.7.
- The advisory recommends removing read rights for `Assistance > Statistics` and `Tools > Reports` as a workaround if upgrading is not immediately possible.
- The CVSS v3 base score is 7.7 with the following vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N
