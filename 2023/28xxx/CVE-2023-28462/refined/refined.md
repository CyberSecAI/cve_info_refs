The content is related to CVE-2023-28462.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a JNDI exploit that uses the `context.rebind` method when running Payara Server on older JDK 8 updates (specifically, updates lower than 1.8u191). This exploit is triggered by accessing insecure ORB listeners exposed by the Payara Server installation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unsecured ORB listeners in Payara Server when running on older JDK 8 versions allow for remote JNDI access, leading to the possibility of arbitrary code loading. The core weakness lies in the combination of a vulnerable JDK version and exposed insecure ORB listeners.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can load malicious code into the Payara Server. This is achieved by exploiting the exposed, unsecured ORB listeners via remote JNDI access.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is remote JNDI access via unsecured ORB listeners. The attacker needs network access to the targeted Payara Server and knowledge of the hostname and port of an unsecured ORB listener.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to connect to the Payara Server over the network and have knowledge of the server's publicly exposed (or accessible) unsecured ORB listener's hostname and port. They also need the capability to execute remote JNDI calls.
