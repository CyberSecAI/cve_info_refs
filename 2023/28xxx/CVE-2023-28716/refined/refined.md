Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2023-28716:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization in mySCADA myPRO versions 8.26.0 and prior. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary operating system commands.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** OS Command Injection (CWE-78).
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an authenticated user to execute arbitrary operating system commands. This could lead to a complete compromise of the affected system, including data breaches, system disruption, and potentially affecting connected industrial processes.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the mySCADA myPRO system. The attack complexity is low. Public exploits are available.
