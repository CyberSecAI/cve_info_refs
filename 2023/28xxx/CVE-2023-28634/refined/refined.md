Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2023-28634:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a flaw that allows a user with a "Technician" profile to generate a personal token for a "Super-Admin" account.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Privilege Escalation:**  The core issue is that a user with lower privileges (Technician) can obtain credentials (a personal token) that grant them higher privileges (Super-Admin).
- **Inadequate Access Control:**  The system fails to properly restrict the generation of personal tokens, allowing a technician to create one for a Super-Admin.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Account Hijacking:** By using the fraudulently obtained personal token, an attacker can impersonate a Super-Admin and gain full control over the GLPI system. This results in a complete takeover of the Super-Admin account and its associated privileges.
- **Full System Access:** Successful exploitation grants the attacker the ability to modify system settings, access sensitive information, and potentially disrupt or damage the system.
- **Loss of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Limited Availability:** The vulnerability leads to a high risk of data confidentiality and integrity loss with some impact to availability of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack can be carried out remotely over a network connection.
- **Exploitation Process:** A user with technician privileges abuses functionality to generate a personal token for a super admin, then uses that token to impersonate the super admin

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have a valid account with at least "Technician" profile privileges within the GLPI system.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the GLPI application.

**Additional Information:**
- **Affected Versions:** GLPI versions 0.83 up to (but not including) 9.5.13 and 10.0.7.
- **Patched Versions:** The vulnerability is fixed in GLPI versions 9.5.13 and 10.0.7.
- **Severity:** The vulnerability is considered to have a "Moderate" severity.
- **CVSS Score:** 6.7.
- **CVSS Metrics:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L
- **CWE:** CWE-285 (Improper Authorization).
