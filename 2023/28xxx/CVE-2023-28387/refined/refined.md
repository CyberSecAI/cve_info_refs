Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-28387:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The "NewsPicks" mobile application for both Android and iOS platforms contained a hard-coded API key for an external service.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Hard-coded credentials:** The API key was directly embedded within the application's code, making it easily accessible. This violates the principle of least privilege and best practices for secure coding. (CWE-798)
- **Exposure of sensitive information:**  The hardcoded API key granted access to an external service.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data analysis:** Attackers could analyze data transmitted by the app.
- **API key compromise:** The hard-coded API key could be obtained and potentially misused.
- **Access to external service:** The stolen API key could allow the attacker to access and potentially abuse the external service to which the key belonged. Note that the users of the app are not directly affected by this vulnerability

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local access:** An attacker could obtain the API key by analyzing the application package.
- **Reverse Engineering:** The hardcoded API key can be extracted by reverse engineering the application

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to obtain the application package:** The attacker needs to get a copy of the vulnerable application (e.g., by downloading it from an app store).
- **Basic reverse engineering skills:** The attacker requires some capability to extract the API key from the application's code or binary.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affected "NewsPicks" App for Android versions 10.4.5 and earlier, and "NewsPicks" App for iOS versions 10.4.2 and earlier.
- The vendor has released updated versions of the app where the API key is no longer hard-coded.
- The vulnerable API key has been deactivated, preventing further abuse through the vulnerable versions.
- The vulnerability was reported by Sunagawa Masanori of BroadBand Security, Inc.

**CVSS Metrics (from JVN):**
