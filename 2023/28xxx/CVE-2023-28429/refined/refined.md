Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-28429:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of the `tooltip` field within the DataObject class definition in pimcore. Specifically, the tooltip content was not HTML encoded before being rendered.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. Because the tooltip field was not properly sanitized, a malicious user could inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code into the tooltip.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into a tooltip field. When a user views this tooltip, the injected JavaScript will execute in their browser, which could lead to:
    - Stealing user cookies and gaining unauthorized access to user accounts.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Performing other unauthorized actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker needs to be able to modify the `tooltip` field in the DataObject class definition. This could happen if the attacker has sufficient permissions in pimcore to edit these configurations.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-  The attacker needs to have the ability to modify DataObject class definitions, including the `tooltip` field.
-  The attacker would require at least a privileged user account within the pimcore instance.
