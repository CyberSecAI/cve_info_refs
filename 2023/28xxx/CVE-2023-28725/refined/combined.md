# Hackers drain bitcoin ATMs of $1.5 million by exploiting 0-day bug

Don't store digital coins in hot wallets! It's great advice but can't always be followed.

Hackers drained millions of dollars in digital coins from cryptocurrency ATMs by exploiting a zero-day vulnerability, leaving customers on the hook for losses that can’t be reversed, the kiosk manufacturer has revealed.

The heist targeted ATMs sold by General Bytes, a company with multiple locations throughout the world. These BATMs, short for bitcoin ATMs, can be set up in convenience stores and other businesses to allow people to exchange bitcoin for other currencies and vice versa. Customers connect the BATMs to a [crypto application server](https://www.generalbytes.com/en/products/cas-server) (CAS) that they can manage or, until now, that General Bytes could manage for them. For reasons that aren’t entirely clear, the BATMs offer an option that allows customers to upload videos from the terminal to the CAS using a mechanism known as the master server interface.

## Going, going, gone

Over the weekend, General Bytes [revealed](https://www.generalbytes.com/en/news/general-bytes-statement-on-the-security-incident-that-occurred-on-march-18-2023) that more than $1.5 million worth of bitcoin had been drained from CASes operated by the company and by customers. To pull off the heist, an unknown threat actor exploited a previously unknown vulnerability that allowed it to use this interface to upload and execute a malicious Java application. The actor then drained various hot wallets of about 56 BTC, worth roughly $1.5 million. General Bytes patched the vulnerability 15 hours after learning of it, but due to the way cryptocurrencies work, the losses were unrecoverable.

General Bytes officials wrote:

> The night of 17-18 March was the most challenging time for us and some of our clients. The entire team has been working around the clock to collect all data regarding the security breach and is continuously working to resolve all cases to help clients back online and continue to operate their ATMs as soon as possible. We apologize for what happened and will review all our security procedures and are currently doing everything we can to keep our affected customers afloat.

The post said the flow of the attack was:

> 1. The attacker identified a security vulnerability in the master service interface the BATMs use to upload videos to the CAS.
>
> 2. The attacker scanned the IP address space managed by cloud host DigitalOcean Ocean to identify running CAS services on ports 7741, including the General Bytes Cloud service and other BATM operators running their servers on Digital Ocean.
>
> 3. Exploiting the vulnerability, the attacker uploaded the Java application directly to the application server used by the admin interface. The application server was, by default, configured to start applications in its deployment folder.

Once the malicious application executed on a server, the threat actor was able to (1) access the database, (2) read and decrypt encoded API keys needed to access funds in hot wallets and exchanges, (3) transfer funds from hot wallets to a wallet controlled by the threat actor, (4) download user names and password hashes and turn off 2FA, and (5) access terminal event logs and scan for instances where customers scanned private keys at the ATM. The sensitive data in step 5 had been logged by older versions of ATM software.

## BATM customers on their own now

Going forward, this weekend’s post said, General Bytes will no longer manage CASes on behalf of customers. That means terminal holders will have to manage the servers themselves. The company is also in the process of collecting data from customers to validate all losses related to the hack, performing an internal investigation, and cooperating with authorities in an attempt to identify the threat actor.

General Bytes said the company has received “multiple security audits since 2021,” and that none of them detected the vulnerability exploited. The company is now in the process of seeking further help in securing its BATMs.

The incident underscores the risk of storing cryptocurrencies in Internet-accessible wallets, commonly called hot wallets. Over the years, hot wallets have been illegally drained of untold amounts of digital coin by attackers who exploit various vulnerabilities in cryptocurrency infrastructures or by tricking wallet holders into providing the encryption keys required to make withdrawals.

Security practitioners have long advised people to store funds in cold wallets, meaning they’re not directly accessible to the Internet. Unfortunately, BATMs and other types of cryptocurrency ATMs generally can’t follow this best practice because the terminals must be connected to hot wallets so that they can make transactions in real time. That means BATMs are likely to remain a prime target for hackers.

## General Bytes crypto ATMs exploited for over $1.6 million

![A General Bytes Bitcoin ATM, which has a bright orange face with the text "Bitcoin ATM" on it, and a screen showing multiple cryptocurrencies that can be purchased.](https://primary-cdn.web3isgoinggreat.com/entryImages/resized/general-bytes-atm_300.webp)General Bytes Bitcoin ATM [(attribution)](/attribution)The largest manufacturer of Bitcoin ATMs, General Bytes, disclosed that attackers had stolen more than $1.6 million by exploiting a vulnerability in their software. The company released a statement on March 18 disclosing the breach, and urging operators of their ATMs to immediately upgrade their software to patch the devices.

In addition to standalone servers, General Bytes' cloud service was impacted, and the company announced that it would be permanently shuttering it. "It is theoretically (and practically) impossible to secure a system granting access to multiple operators at the same time where some of them are bad actors," wrote the company in their statement explaining the decision, apparently unaware that this is something software companies find themselves doing all the time.

This exploit was the second breach suffered by General Bytes this year, after hackers exploited a vulnerability in August 2022 that allowed them to steal customer funds. It's unknown how much was stolen in that attack. The company also patched multiple hardware and software issues in their ATMs in September 2021, after Kraken Security Labs discovered issues including poor security practices that would allow attackers to "walk up to an ATM and compromise it".

# General Bytes Bitcoin ATMs hacked using zero-day, $1.5M stolen

Leading Bitcoin ATM maker General Bytes disclosed that hackers stole cryptocurrency from the company and its customers using a zero-day vulnerability in its BATM management platform.

General Bytes makes Bitcoin ATMs allowing people to purchase or sell over 40 cryptocurrencies. Customers can deploy their ATMs using standalone management servers or General Bytes cloud service.

Over the weekend, the company disclosed that hackers exploited a zero-day vulnerability tracked as BATM-4780 to remotely uploaded a Java application via ATM's master service interface and run it with 'batm' user privileges.

"The attacker scanned the Digital Ocean cloud hosting IP address space and identified running CAS services on ports 7741, including the General Bytes Cloud service and other GB ATM operators running their servers on Digital Ocean (our recommended cloud hosting provider)," General Bytes explained in a security incident disclosure.

The company took to Twitter to urge customers to "take immediate action" and install the latest updates to protect their servers and funds from attackers.

[![tweet](https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/u/1220909/2023/Crypto/tweet.jpg)](https://twitter.com/generalbytes/status/1637192687160897537)

After uploading the Java application, the threat actors gained able to perform the following actions on compromised devices:

* Ability to access the database.
* Ability to read and decrypt API keys used to access funds in hot wallets and exchanges.
* Send funds from hot wallets.
* Download user names, their password hashes and turn off 2FA.
* Ability to access terminal event logs and scan for any instance where customers scanned private keys at the ATM. Older versions of ATM software were logging this information.

General Bytes warned that its customers and its own cloud service were breached during the attacks.

"GENERAL BYTES Cloud service was breached as well as other operator's standalone servers," [highlights the statement](https://generalbytes.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ESD/pages/2885222430/Security%2BIncident%2BMarch%2B17-18th%2B2023).

Although the company disclosed how much money the attacker stole, they provided a [list of cryptocurrency addresses](https://generalbytes.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ESD/pages/2885222430/Security%2BIncident%2BMarch%2B17-18th%2B2023#Crypto-addresses-used-in-the-attack) used by the hacker during the attack.

These addresses show that the hacker began stealing cryptocurrency from Bitcoin ATM servers on March 17th, with the attacker's Bitcoin address receiving [56.28570959 BTC](http://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/bc1qfa8pryacrjuzp9287zc2ufz5n0hdthff0av440), worth approximately $1,589,000, and[21.79436191 Ethereu](https://etherscan.io/address/0xD5173d215551538cebE79C4e40A4C54Fb751DD83)m, worth roughly $39,000.

While the Bitcoin wallet still contains the stolen cryptocurrency, the threat actors appear to have used Uniswap to convert the stolen Ethereum into USDT.

## Upgrade servers now

CAS (Crypto Application Server) admins are urged to examine their "master.log" and "admin.log" log files for any suspicious gaps in time caused by the attacker deleting log entries to conceal their actions on the device.

General Byte's report also warned that the uploaded malicious JAVA applications would appear in the "/batm/app/admin/standalone/deployments/" folder as random-named **.war** and **.war.deployed** files, as shown below.

The company notes that the file names are likely different per victim.

**Files (red) dropped by the attacker on breached servers** *(General Bytes)*

Those without signs of a breach should still consider all their CAS passwords and API keys compromised and immediately invalidate them and generate new ones. All user passwords should also be reset.

Detailed step-by-step instructions for all server operators on protecting their endpoints are enclosed in the company's statement.

## Shuttering the cloud service

General Bytes says they are shuttering its cloud service, stating it finds it "theoretically (and practically) impossible" to secure it from bad actors when it must simultaneously provide access to multiple operators.

The company will provide support with data migration to those who would like to install their own standalone CAS, which should now be placed behind a firewall and VPN.

General Byte has also released a CAS security fix that addresses the exploited vulnerability, provided in two patches, 20221118.48 and 20230120.44.

It also highlights that the breached system underwent multiple security audits since 2021, but none identified the exploited vulnerability.

Furthermore, researchers from the Kraken cryptocurrency exchange [found multiple vulnerabilities](https://blog.kraken.com/post/11263/kraken-security-labs-identifies-vulnerabilities-in-commonly-used-bitcoin-atm/) in General Bytes' ATMs in 2021, which the company quickly fixed

However, even with these security audits, in August 2022, General Bytes [had a security incident](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-steal-crypto-from-bitcoin-atms-by-exploiting-zero-day-bug/) where hackers exploited a zero-day vulnerability in its ATM servers to steal cryptocurrency from its customers.

The company says its plans to conduct numerous security audits of its products by multiple companies in a short period to discover and fix other potential flaws before bad actors find them.

The Crypto Application Server (CAS) should be updated regularly. Updating CAS requires it to be shut down, so choose an appropriate time for your entire network of BATMs to be offline.

The latest server version can be identified [here](https://generalbytes.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/_/pages/1598062601?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiM2NmY2M4ODhhOTlhNDQ5Nzg4ZTgzYjViY2VkYzk0NjMiLCJwIjoiYyJ9 "https://generalbytes.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/_/pages/1598062601?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiM2NmY2M4ODhhOTlhNDQ5Nzg4ZTgzYjViY2VkYzk0NjMiLCJwIjoiYyJ9"):

#### NOTICE:

* GENERAL BYTES requires KYC registration for every license.
* Operators with accounts in arrears will need to bring their account current to upgrade.
* You must add the GB APT Repository to update, see: <https://generalbytes.atlassian.net/l/cp/20wDrKSM>
## Update your Ubuntu installation regularly!

Like CAS, Ubuntu is updated frequently. Keep your server's software up to date to stay head of the curve and maintain your server’s security.

CAS will expect your server to work properly & use current software, so begin by updating your Ubuntu server:

`sudo apt update && sudo apt -y dist-upgrade`

When logging in via SSH, Ubuntu may notify you that a restart is required:

Open ![](https://media-cdn.atlassian.com/file/e425ce43-bcf5-4fcd-8731-20d289855655/image/cdn?allowAnimated=true&client=7495d857-9ab7-4dc8-8374-d5fede2a29bc&collection=contentId-951418958&height=74&max-age=2592000&mode=full-fit&source=mediaCard&token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpc3MiOiI3NDk1ZDg1Ny05YWI3LTRkYzgtODM3NC1kNWZlZGUyYTI5YmMiLCJhY2Nlc3MiOnsidXJuOmZpbGVzdG9yZTpjb2xsZWN0aW9uOmNvbnRlbnRJZC05NTE0MTg5NTgiOlsicmVhZCJdfSwiZXhwIjoxNzM2ODkyMzg3LCJuYmYiOjE3MzY4ODk1MDd9.uhOYOWjoFzMJ3KbH9AqKJHqFg43SpPY-f2q7AiInafE&width=760)

* This is the perfect to time to comply. Restart your system:

`sudo reboot now`

Your SSH connection will be terminated for about a couple minutes while the server reboots. Be patient, then reconnect to your server. The message should now be gone.

**WISDOM**: Please avoid installing CAS updates when Support is unavailable.

* If Support is necessary, the best results come on Tuesdays or Wednesdays.
## To update CAS, follow these simple steps:

### **1. Note the "Latest version" from the** [**website**](https://www.generalbytes.com/en/support/changelog "https://www.generalbytes.com/en/support/changelog")**:**

`https://www.generalbytes.com/support/`

* We'll refer to the current version as “BUILDNUM” below.
* Where necessary, further explanation of features & bug fixes can be found here:

  + <https://generalbytes.atlassian.net/l/cp/Yzw8Zh9F>

### 2. Shut down CAS:

If a service won’t shut down at this point (for any reason), wait a few minutes & reboot your server.

### 3. Update CAS:

* Enter “Y” to confirm your agreement to the current licensing and terms (when asked).

Open ![](https://media-cdn.atlassian.com/file/ed0ca470-6365-45f9-a1f5-5708033c1292/image/cdn?allowAnimated=true&client=7495d857-9ab7-4dc8-8374-d5fede2a29bc&collection=contentId-951418958&height=104&max-age=2592000&mode=full-fit&source=mediaCard&token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpc3MiOiI3NDk1ZDg1Ny05YWI3LTRkYzgtODM3NC1kNWZlZGUyYTI5YmMiLCJhY2Nlc3MiOnsidXJuOmZpbGVzdG9yZTpjb2xsZWN0aW9uOmNvbnRlbnRJZC05NTE0MTg5NTgiOlsicmVhZCJdfSwiZXhwIjoxNzM2ODkyMzg3LCJuYmYiOjE3MzY4ODk1MDd9.uhOYOWjoFzMJ3KbH9AqKJHqFg43SpPY-f2q7AiInafE&width=760)
### 4. Reboot

Ubuntu should be updated regularly, and it will need to be restarted occasionally. This is an important step - yet easy to overlook.

* After a few minutes, log back into your server via SSH.

### 5. Restart CAS:

Assuming everything updated as planned, start CAS again.

---

## **That's it - you should be done!**

Login to CAS to verify that it's working and reporting the proper version.

# Description

**Severity**: Highest

**Description**: The attacker was able to upload his own java application remotely via the master service interface used by terminals to upload videos and run it using batm user privileges.

This resulted in:

* Ability to access the database.
* Ability to read and decrypt API keys used to access funds in hot wallets and exchanges.
* Send funds from hot wallets.
* Download user names, their password hashes and turn off 2FA.
* Ability to access terminal event logs and scan for any instance where customers scanned private key at the ATM. Older versions of ATM software were logging this information.

GENERAL BYTES Cloud service was breached as well as other operator’s standalone servers.

**DO NOT continue to operate your GB ATM server (CAS) unless you have implemented the solution described below!**

---

# How to find out if your server was breached

1. Investigate your master.log and admin.log files and look for time gaps that your server wasn’t logging anything. Typically you will only see one day of events. The attacker was deleting these logs to conceal his activity. This is a certain indicator of attack.
2. Look for suspicious content in `/batm/app/admin/standalone/deployments/`
   root@batmserver:/batm# ls -la /batm/app/admin/standalone/deployments/
   total 148352

   **Files marked in red were created by attacker. Filenames on your server may differ.**
3. Please understand that even if you don’t have any of these files on file system it doesn’t mean that you were not hacked. An empty admin.log and master.log is the primary indicator.

# I believe I wasn’t breached

**You should apply the solution anyway**!

*Read “Solution” below.*

* **Consider all your 1) user’s CAS passwords, and 2) API keys to exchanges and hot wallets** to have been compromised and leaked**.**
* **Regenerate new API keys and invalidate old ones.**
* Change all user passwords.

# Solution

GENERAL BYTES is shuttering it’s Cloud service.

It is theoretically (and practically) impossible to secure a system granting access to multiple operators at the same time where some of them are bad actors. You’ll need to install your own Standalone server. GB support will provide you with help you to migrate your data from the GB Cloud to your own Standalone server.

**Please keep your CAS behind a firewall and VPN**. **Terminals should also connect to CAS via VPN.** With VPN/Firewall attackers from open internet cannot access your server and exploit it. If your server was breached please reinstall the whole server including operation system.

**Additionally consider your all user’s passwords, and API keys to exchanges and hot wallets to be compromised. Please invalidate them and generate new keys & password.**

The CAS security fix is provided in two server patch releases, 20221118.**48** and 20230120.**44**.

**Please ensure you implement all other steps** - not just the server upgrade installation.

### Specific steps for Standalone Operators:

1. Stop the admin and master service and wait until the patch release is available.
2. If your BATM server was breached, reinstall it, including the operating system, to ensure that there is no code left by the attacker on your server. [CAS CLI Installation](https://generalbytes.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ESD/pages/928710726)
3. Upgrade your server to the latest version, which is 20230120.**45**. If you are currently running version 20221118, you can also apply the fix by upgrading to patch release 20221118.**49**. Do not start the server until after the upgrade is complete. <https://generalbytes.atlassian.net/l/cp/uDWwYSuQ>
   It is HIGHLY recommended that you install always the latest patch available. As they contain the latest security fixes and important improvements. See this document to find the patch versions we recommend operating: [Patch Releases](https://generalbytes.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ESD/pages/2734850053)
4. Update your CAS server by modifying your server firewall settings to ensure that your CAS admin interface running on TCP ports 7777 or 443 is only accessible from IP addresses you trust, such as your office or home. Refer to the firewall configuration guide for assistance. <https://generalbytes.atlassian.net/l/cp/ikf0h0Ld>
5. Move your terminals and server behind a VPN and make sure the master service interface (port 7741) is accessible only by terminals behind the VPN. <https://generalbytes.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ESD/pages/2807791617> [Terminal Security | Terminal VPN](https://generalbytes.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ESD/pages/2875621377/Terminal%2BData%2BSecurity%2BVPN#Terminal-VPN)
6. Deactivate all your terminals in the CAS interface to prevent any sales on machines. Alternatively, you can deactivate only two-way machines.
7. Review all your CAS users, their permissions, and groups, and make sure that only users you trust have administration rights.
8. Check whether the attacker added any terminals and remove them if necessary.
9. Activate the terminals.
10. If you were breached, review the admin.log file to find more details on the attacker's activity.

### Steps for ALL Operators:

1. Review all your CAS users, their permissions, and groups, and delete any unrecognized users.
2. Check all CAS users' email addresses (in Persons) and reset all user passwords (except your own) as a precautionary measure.
3. Review your Crypto Settings and run the Crypto Settings tests to verify that your crypto addresses and strategies are correct. The attacker may have changed your SELL Crypto Settings to receive coins from customers into his wallet, so it's important to double-check and make sure everything is as it should be.
4. Delete any unrecognized or unpaired terminals.
5. Activate only the ***verified*** terminals.
6. Set up a VPN connection to the terminals to ensure secure communication.

Taking these steps can help protect your system from any potential vulnerabilities and mitigate the risks of future attacks.

# Moving data from old server

1. Use batm-manage backup mechanism to create backup archive. [Server Migration](https://generalbytes.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ESD/pages/952172692) [batm-manage: the CAS CLI Toolkit](https://generalbytes.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ESD/pages/948961405)
2. Transfer from backup only following files as they don’t contain executable code:
   batm\_server\_db.sql.gz - contains database.
   batm\_server\_data.tar.gz - contains data files.
   batm\_server\_config.tar.gz - contains configuration.
   SHA256SUMS - file containing hashes of files above. Edit file to remove line with files that you didn’t transfer.
3. Use batm-manage restore command
4. Make sure you reset user passwords incl 2FA, verify terminals and perform other steps defined in “Steps for ALL Operators” section of this page.

# What happened

1. The attacker identified a security vulnerability in the master service interface used by Bitcoin ATMs to upload videos to server.
2. The attacker scanned the Digital Ocean cloud hosting IP address space and identified running CAS services on ports 7741, including the General Bytes Cloud service and other GB ATM operators running their servers on Digital Ocean (our recommended cloud hosting provider).
3. Using this security vulnerability, attacker uploaded his own application directly to application server used by admin interface. Application server was by default configured to start applications in its deployment folder.

Note: We’ve concluded multiple security audits since 2021, and none of them identified this vulnerability.

We will continuously update this page as information arises.
