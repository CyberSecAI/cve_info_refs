**CVE-2023-28671:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The OctoPerf Load Testing Plugin 4.5.0 and earlier does not require POST requests for a connection test HTTP endpoint.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs, potentially capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.
*   **Attack vectors:** An attacker can induce a victim's browser to send a crafted request to the vulnerable endpoint.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to induce a victim to trigger the crafted request, and they must have knowledge of a valid credential ID. The attacker would need to be logged into Jenkins, and have the `Overall/Read` permission.
