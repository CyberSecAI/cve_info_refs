        ],
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises from the absence of proper enforcement of IPsec encryption on outgoing VXLAN traffic when the `xt_u32` kernel module is unavailable, which is the case on Red Hat Enterprise Linux and derivatives (RHEL 8.3+, RHEL 9), where it is either not installed by default or completely removed.  The `overlay` network driver relies on the `u32` iptables extension provided by the `xt_u32` kernel module to directly filter on a VXLAN packet's VNI field, so that IPSec guarantees can be enforced on encrypted overlay networks. When the `xt_u32` module is unavailable, this rule is not created.",
        "weaknesses": [
            "CWE-311",
            "CWE-636"
        ],
        "impact": "The impact of this vulnerability is the transmission of unencrypted data over encrypted overlay networks, leading to a loss of confidentiality and data integrity guarantees. An attacker with a position on the network can read all traffic across the overlay network, potentially disclosing sensitive information such as database protocols, internal APIs, and user data.",
        "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is a network-based attack, where an attacker can eavesdrop on network traffic between nodes on an encrypted overlay network. ",
        "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be in a position to observe network traffic. This can be achieved either through a compromised node on the network or by being present on a shared network segment.",
        "additional_details": "This vulnerability is present in Moby (Docker) Swarm Mode, which uses VXLAN to create overlay networks. The lack of proper rule creation when `xt_u32` is missing means encrypted overlay networks will silently transmit unencrypted traffic.  The fix involves using xt_bpf as an alternative when xt_u32 is not available. This commit also includes BPF filter creation for better matching on VNI for IPsec."
