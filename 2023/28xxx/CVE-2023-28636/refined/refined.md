Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper sanitization when creating external links, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Specifically, the vulnerability allows for the injection of malicious JavaScript in external links.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An administrator can create malicious external links. When a user clicks on such a link, the injected JavaScript could be executed in their browser, potentially leading to:
    -  Hijacking user sessions.
    -  Performing actions on behalf of the user.
    -  Redirecting the user to malicious sites.
    -  Data theft.
    -  Other malicious activity within the context of the user's session on the vulnerable GLPI instance.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack.
- The attack vector is through the GLPI application's interface for managing external links.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be an administrator within the GLPI application to create these malicious external links.
-  The attacker would need to be able to access the GLPI instance over a network.
- Requires a user to interact with the malicious link

**Additional details:**
- This vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" severity.
- The vulnerability is fixed in GLPI versions 9.5.13 and 10.0.7.
- The affected versions are >= 0.60
- CVSS v3 score: 4.5 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)
