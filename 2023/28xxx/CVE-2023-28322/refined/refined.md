Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-28322:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from incorrect handling of HTTP method changes in libcurl when reusing a handle. Specifically, if a libcurl handle was previously used for a `PUT` request that employed a read callback (`CURLOPT_READFUNCTION`), a subsequent `POST` request using the same handle and setting `CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS` could still trigger the read callback instead of using the provided POST data. This happens because the code logic for managing HTTP methods and behaviors was inconsistent, leading to a confused state where the handle incorrectly used the read callback.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Incorrect State Management:** libcurl failed to properly reset its internal state when changing from a `PUT` to a `POST` request on a reused handle, leading to unexpected behavior.
-   **Violation of Expected Behavior:** The read callback (`CURLOPT_READFUNCTION`) was called unexpectedly for a `POST` operation where `CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS` was set, which contradicts normal behavior.
-   **Potential Use-After-Free or Incorrect Data Transmission:**  While not directly present in libcurl's code, the unexpected callback could cause an application to either send incorrect data (since it's being asked to provide data via a callback when it should not), or use freed memory due to unexpected control flow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Data Corruption/Incorrect Data Transmission:** Applications might transmit unintended or incorrect data to servers because the library unexpectedly calls the read callback, potentially leading to application misbehavior.
-   **Potential Information Leak:** In a use-after-free scenario, sensitive heap-based data can potentially be leaked.
-   **Application Instability/Crashes:**  The incorrect behavior could lead to program instability or crashes depending on how the application utilizes the read callback.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Reused libcurl Handles:** Exploitation requires the reuse of a libcurl handle that was previously used for a `PUT` request with a read callback.
-   **Setting `CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS`:** A subsequent `POST` request should attempt to use `CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS`, triggering the vulnerability.
-   **Libcurl with libssh2:** This is only applicable when curl is built with libssh2.
-   **Use of `CURLOPT_READFUNCTION`** The initial PUT request should be using the read callback.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   The attacker needs to have control of an application that uses libcurl and reuses handles.
-   The attacker needs to be able to initiate a sequence of requests: a PUT with a read callback, followed by a POST with `CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS`.
-   The attacker must be able to influence the application's behavior so that it calls the read function unexpectedly.

**Additional Information:**

-   The command-line tool 'curl' is not vulnerable, and the issue is limited to applications using the libcurl API.
-   The issue is similar to CVE-2022-32221.
-   Setting `CURLOPT_POST` for the second transfer avoids the problem.

The provided information also confirms the fix was included in curl 8.1.0 and has been backported to several OS distributions.
