[View manpage source](https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/master/docs/libcurl/opts/CURLOPT_READFUNCTION.md)

## Name

CURLOPT\_READFUNCTION - read callback for data uploads

## Synopsis

```

#include <curl/curl.h>

size_t read_callback(char *buffer, size_t size, size_t nitems, void *userdata);

CURLcode [curl_easy_setopt](curl_easy_setopt.html)(CURL *handle, [CURLOPT_READFUNCTION](CURLOPT_READFUNCTION.html), read_callback);

```
## Description

Pass a pointer to your callback function, as the prototype shows above.

This callback function gets called by libcurl as soon as it needs to read data in order to send it to the peer - like if you ask it to upload or post data to the server. The data area pointed at by the pointer buffer should be filled up with at most size multiplied with nitems number of bytes by your function. size is always 1.

Set the userdata argument with the [CURLOPT\_READDATA](./CURLOPT_READDATA.html) option.

Your function must return the actual number of bytes that it stored in the data area pointed at by the pointer buffer. Returning 0 signals end-of-file to the library and causes it to stop the current transfer.

If you stop the current transfer by returning 0 "pre-maturely" (i.e before the server expected it, like when you have said you would upload N bytes and you upload less than N bytes), you may experience that the server "hangs" waiting for the rest of the data that is not sent.

The read callback may return CURL\_READFUNC\_ABORT to stop the current operation immediately, resulting in a [CURLE\_ABORTED\_BY\_CALLBACK](libcurl-errors.html#CURLEABORTEDBYCALLBACK) error code from the transfer.

The callback can return CURL\_READFUNC\_PAUSE to cause reading from this connection to pause. See [curl\_easy\_pause](./curl_easy_pause.html) for further details.

Bugs: when doing TFTP uploads, you must return the exact amount of data that the callback wants, or it is considered the final packet by the server end and the transfer ends there.

If you set this callback pointer to NULL, or do not set it at all, the default internal read function is used. It is doing an fread() on the FILE \* userdata set with [CURLOPT\_READDATA](./CURLOPT_READDATA.html).

You can set the total size of the data you are sending by using [CURLOPT\_INFILESIZE\_LARGE](./CURLOPT_INFILESIZE_LARGE.html) or [CURLOPT\_POSTFIELDSIZE\_LARGE](./CURLOPT_POSTFIELDSIZE_LARGE.html), depending on the type of transfer. For some transfer types it may be required and it allows for better error checking.

## Default

fread(3)

## Protocols

This functionality affects all supported protocols

## Example

```

size_t read_callback(char *ptr, size_t size, size_t nmemb, void *userdata)
{
  FILE *readhere = (FILE *)userdata;
  curl_off_t nread;

  /* copy as much data as possible into the 'ptr' buffer, but no more than
     'size' * 'nmemb' bytes. */
  size_t retcode = fread(ptr, size, nmemb, readhere);

  nread = (curl_off_t)retcode;

  fprintf(stderr, "*** We read %" CURL_FORMAT_CURL_OFF_T
          " bytes from file\n", nread);
  return retcode;
}

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  FILE *file = fopen(argv[1], "rb");
  CURLcode result;

  CURL *curl = [curl_easy_init](curl_easy_init.html)();
  if(curl) {
    /* set callback to use */
    [curl_easy_setopt](curl_easy_setopt.html)(curl, [CURLOPT_READFUNCTION](CURLOPT_READFUNCTION.html), read_callback);

    /* pass in suitable argument to callback */
    [curl_easy_setopt](curl_easy_setopt.html)(curl, [CURLOPT_READDATA](CURLOPT_READDATA.html), (void *)file);

    result = [curl_easy_perform](curl_easy_perform.html)(curl);
  }
}

```
## History

CURL\_READFUNC\_PAUSE return code was added in [7.18.0](/ch/7.18.0.html) and CURL\_READFUNC\_ABORT was added in [7.12.1.](/ch/7.12.1..html)

## Availability

Added in curl [7.1](/ch/7.1.html)

## Return value

This returns [CURLE\_OK](libcurl-errors.html#CURLEOK).

## CVE-2023-28321

# IDN wildcard match

Project curl Security Advisory, May 17th 2023 - [Permalink](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2023-28321.html)

## VULNERABILITY

curl supports matching of wildcard patterns when listed as "Subject
Alternative Name" in TLS server certificates. curl can be built to use
its own name matching function for TLS rather than one provided by a TLS
library. This private wildcard matching function would match IDN
(International Domain Name) hosts incorrectly and could as a result
accept patterns that otherwise should mismatch.

IDN hostnames are converted to puny code before used for certificate
checks. Puny coded names always start with `xn--` and should
not be allowed to pattern match, but the wildcard check in curl could
still check for `x*`, which would match even though the IDN
name most likely contained nothing even resembling an
`x`.

## INFO

curl's wildcard matching function is used only when curl was built to
use OpenSSL, Schannel or Gskit. All other backends use the matching
functions of the corresponding TLS library and are thus not vulnerable
to this flaw.

This flaw is lessened somewhat by two factors:

* Certificates issued by Certificate Authorities for the public
  Internet are not allowed to use "partial" wildcards, thus completely
  avoiding this issue.
* In many circumstances, the control of hostnames used and the
  wildcards used in issued certificates are controlled by the same entity,
  making this unlikely to actually become a problem.

curl does not need to be built with IDN support to be vulnerable, as
a user can pass in a puny coded version of the hostname directly in the
URL and can then trigger this flaw.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned
the name CVE-2023-28321 to this issue.

CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation

Severity: Low

## AFFECTED VERSIONS

This bug was introduced in curl when IDN support was first
introduced, in curl [7.12.0](vuln-7.12.0.html) - June 2004. The wildcard function was
subsequently updated for this case in 2012 (the IDN problem is mentioned
in RFC 6125 in a far from obvious way) but was done wrongly, so the flaw
remained.

* Affected versions: curl [7.12.0](vuln-7.12.0.html) to and including [8.0.1](vuln-8.0.1.html)
* Not affected versions: curl < [7.12.0](vuln-7.12.0.html) and curl >= [8.1.0](vuln-8.1.0.html)
* Introduced-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/9631fa740708b1890197fad>

libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as
such!

## SOLUTION

curl [8.1.0](vuln-8.1.0.html) completely removes the support for "partial" matches and
now only supports `*.`. No `a*`, `a*b`
or `*b` matches. For all hostnames, IDN or not.

* Fixed-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/199f2d440d8659b42>

## RECOMMENDATIONS

A - Upgrade curl to version [8.1.0](vuln-8.1.0.html)

B - Apply the patch to your local version

## TIMELINE

This issue was reported to the curl project on April 17 2023. We
contacted distros@openwall on May 9, 2023.

curl [8.1.0](vuln-8.1.0.html) was released on May 17 2023, coordinated with the
publication of this advisory.

## CVE-2023-28320

# siglongjmp race condition

Project curl Security Advisory, May 17th 2023 - [Permalink](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2023-28320.html)

## VULNERABILITY

libcurl provides several different backends for resolving hostnames,
selected at build time. If it is built to use the synchronous resolver,
it allows name resolves to time-out slow operations using
`alarm()` and `siglongjmp()`.

When doing this, libcurl used a global buffer that was not mutex
protected and a multi-threaded application might therefore crash or
otherwise misbehave.

## INFO

Most platforms and systems build libcurl to use the threaded resolver
or with c-ares, neither of those suffer from this flaw. Most platforms
that build with the synchronous resolver do not feature
`alarm()` and `siglongjmp()` and therefore are not
vulnerable either.

Since `alarm()` uses signals, it is not advisable to use
in a multi-threaded environment (signals and threads rarely mix very
well) which reduces the risk that this flaw hurts many users.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned
the name CVE-2023-28320 to this issue.

CWE-662: Improper Synchronization

Severity: Low

## AFFECTED VERSIONS

* Affected versions: curl [7.9.8](vuln-7.9.8.html) to and including [8.0.1](vuln-8.0.1.html)
* Not affected versions: curl < [7.9.8](vuln-7.9.8.html) and curl >= [8.1.0](vuln-8.1.0.html)
* Introduced-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/3c49b405de4fbf1f>

libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as
such!

## SOLUTION

The fix is to only support this timeout ability if curl has and can
properly mutex protect the buffer.

* Fixed-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/13718030ad4b3209a7583b>

## RECOMMENDATIONS

A - Upgrade curl to version [8.1.0](vuln-8.1.0.html)

B - Apply the patch to your local version

C - Do not use the synchronous name resolver option

## TIMELINE

This issue was reported to the curl project on April 2 2023. We
contacted distros@openwall on May 9, 2023.

curl [8.1.0](vuln-8.1.0.html) was released on May 17 2023, coordinated with the
publication of this advisory.

## CVE-2023-28322

# more POST-after-PUT confusion

Project curl Security Advisory, May 17 2023 - [Permalink](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2023-28322.html)

## VULNERABILITY

When doing HTTP(S) transfers, libcurl might erroneously use the read
callback (`[CURLOPT_READFUNCTION](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_READFUNCTION.html)`) to ask for data to send,
even when the `[CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS.html)` option has been set, if
the same handle previously was used to issue a `PUT` request
which used that callback.

This flaw may surprise the application and cause it to misbehave and
either send off the wrong data or use memory after free or similar in
the second transfer.

The problem exists in the logic for a reused handle when it is
(expected to be) changed from a PUT to a POST.

## INFO

The code actually sending wrong data or doing a use-after-free is not
present in libcurl code but are only presumed scenarios that might
become the outcome of libcurl surprisingly calling the read callback in
a situation where it is not expected to.

This flaw cannot be triggered with the command line tool.

This problem is almost identical to [CVE-2022-32221](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2022-32221.html). A
difference this time is that setting `[CURLOPT_POST](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_POST.html)` for the
second transfer avoids the problem, where as only setting
`[CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS.html)` after the PUT still makes the second
transfer to a PUT and use the callback.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned
the name CVE-2023-28322 to this issue.

CWE-440: Expected Behavior Violation

Severity: Low

## AFFECTED VERSIONS

* Affected versions: libcurl [7.7](vuln-7.7.html) to and including [8.0.1](vuln-8.0.1.html)
* Not affected versions: libcurl < [7.7](vuln-7.7.html) and >= [8.1.0](vuln-8.1.0.html)
* Introduced-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/546572da0457f3>

libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as
such!

## SOLUTION

This time the logic is improved to avoid having two separate variable
fields holding info about HTTP method and behavior. Now there is only
one, which should make it harder to end up in such a confused middle
state.

* Fixed-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/7815647d6582c0a4900be2e1de>

## RECOMMENDATIONS

A - Upgrade curl to version [8.1.0](vuln-8.1.0.html)

B - Apply the patch to your local version

C - Do not do mix using the read callback and
`[CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS.html)` string on a reused easy handle

## TIMELINE

This issue was reported to the curl project on April 19, 2023. We
contacted distros@openwall on May 9, 2023.

libcurl [8.1.0](vuln-8.1.0.html) was released on May 17 2023, coordinated with the
publication of this advisory.

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

Two security issues were found in Curl, an easy-to-use client-side URL
transfer library and command line tool.

Additionally, the command line tool does now:
- - display the Debian revision in "curl --version", and
- - does no longer output verbose "Expire in" messsages with "curl -v"

    POST-after-PUT confusion.

CVE-2023-46218

## CVE-2023-28319

# UAF in SSH sha256 fingerprint check

Project curl Security Advisory, May 17th 2023 - [Permalink](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2023-28319.html)

## VULNERABILITY

libcurl offers a feature to verify an SSH server's public key using a
SHA 256 hash. When this check fails, libcurl would free the memory for
the fingerprint before it returns an error message containing the (now
freed) hash.

This flaw risks inserting sensitive heap-based data into the error
message that might be shown to users or otherwise get leaked and
revealed.

## INFO

This only applies to users of the
`[CURLOPT_SSH_HOST_PUBLIC_KEY_SHA256](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_SSH_HOST_PUBLIC_KEY_SHA256.html)` option, which is
**only supported for libcurl built with libssh2** (curl
optionally supports other SSH backends). Either of the options
`[CURLOPT_VERBOSE](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_VERBOSE.html)` or `[CURLOPT_ERRORBUFFER](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_ERRORBUFFER.html)` also
need to be set to trigger the problem.

The damage is somewhat limited by the extremely short time window
between the free and the use of the freed memory.

The largest possible info leak that can happen due to this flaw per
trigger occasion, is limited to `CURL_ERROR_SIZE` - the error
message prefix length (69) = 186 bytes. It also stops at the first null
byte within those 186 bytes.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned
the name CVE-2023-28319 to this issue.

CWE-416: Use After Free

Severity: Medium

## AFFECTED VERSIONS

* Affected versions: curl [7.81.0](vuln-7.81.0.html) to and including [8.0.1](vuln-8.0.1.html)
* Not affected versions: curl < [7.81.0](vuln-7.81.0.html) and curl >= [8.1.0](vuln-8.1.0.html)
* Introduced-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/3467e89bb97e6c87c7>

libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as
such!

## SOLUTION

* Fixed-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/8e21b1a05f3c0ee098dbcb6c>

## RECOMMENDATIONS

A - Upgrade curl to version [8.1.0](vuln-8.1.0.html)

B - Apply the patch to your local version

C - Do not use `[CURLOPT_SSH_HOST_PUBLIC_KEY_SHA256](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_SSH_HOST_PUBLIC_KEY_SHA256.html)`

## TIMELINE

This issue was reported to the curl project on March 21 2023. We
contacted distros@openwall on May 9, 2023.

curl [8.1.0](vuln-8.1.0.html) was released on May 17 2023, coordinated with the
