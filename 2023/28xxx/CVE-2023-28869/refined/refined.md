{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The NCP Secure Enterprise Client's Support Assistant feature uses a high-privileged service to read diagnostic files, even though the user interface operates with lower privileges. This service reads files from a user-controlled temporary directory.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Arbitrary File Read",
       "The application uses a high-privileged service to read files from a user-controlled directory, where low-privileged users can create symbolic links.",
       "Lack of proper privilege separation in file access."
    ],
    "impact": "A low-privileged user can use a symbolic link to redirect the high-privileged service to read an arbitrary file on the system. This allows the low-privileged user to access files that would otherwise be inaccessible, potentially leaking sensitive information.",
    "attack_vectors": "A low-privileged user creates a symbolic link in the Support Assistant's temporary directory, pointing to a target file. When the user views the diagnostic file, the high-privileged service follows the link and reads the content of the target file.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a low-privileged user on the system where the NCP Secure Enterprise Client is installed."
