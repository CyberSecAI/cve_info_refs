Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2023-28110:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of Kubernetes tokens within the Koko component of JumpServer. Specifically, the Koko component does not properly sanitize or validate user-provided tokens before using them to connect to Kubernetes clusters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is command injection. By crafting a malicious Kubernetes token that includes shell commands, an attacker can inject and execute these commands on the server hosting the Koko component.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands within the Koko container environment.
- **Disruption of Koko Service:** Executed commands can disrupt the normal operation of the Koko container and, potentially, impact the overall JumpServer functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, implying a remote attacker can attempt this exploit.
- **Malicious Kubernetes Token:** The specific attack vector involves supplying a maliciously crafted Kubernetes token when establishing a connection to a Kubernetes cluster via Koko.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **High Privileges:** The attacker requires high privileges, suggesting they would need to have the ability to configure or provide Kubernetes connection details to the JumpServer.
- **User Interaction:** The user interaction requirement suggests that the attacker needs an authorized user to initiate the connection process with the malicious token.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is specific to JumpServer versions prior to 2.28.8.
- The provided example of a malicious token is `;touch /tmp/hackeme;`, which, if used, would create a file on the system.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Chaitin Tech.
- The CVSS score is 5.7, categorized as "Moderate."

**CVSS Metrics Breakdown:**
- **AV:N (Attack Vector: Network):** The attack can be launched over a network.
- **AC:H (Attack Complexity: High):** The exploit is not straightforward and requires some preparation.
- **PR:H (Privileges Required: High):** The attacker needs significant privileges within the JumpServer system.
- **UI:R (User Interaction: Required):** Requires a legitimate user to take some action.
- **S:U (Scope: Unchanged):** The impact is limited to the vulnerable component (Koko).
- **C:N (Confidentiality: None):** No unauthorized disclosure of information.
- **I:H (Integrity: High):** Potential for significant data modification by the attacker.
- **A:H (Availability: High):** Potential for significant disruption to the service.
