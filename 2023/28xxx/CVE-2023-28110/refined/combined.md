# Command Injection for Kubernets Connection

Moderate

[ibuler](/ibuler)
published
GHSA-6x5p-jm59-jh29
Mar 16, 2023

## Package

koko
(Internal Compoent)

## Affected versions

<2.28.7

## Patched versions

2.28.8

## Description

### Impact

Command Injection for Kubernets Connection

Using illegal tokens to connect to a Kubernetes cluster through Koko can result in the execution of dangerous commands that may disrupt the Koko container environment and affect normal usage

### Details

1. Create an example of an illegal Kubernetes token like the one shown below:

```
;touch /tmp/hackeme;

```

2. If the token is used to connect to a Kubernetes cluster, any commands executed using the token - such as `touch /tmp/hackeme` - will create a file at /tmp/hackeme.

### Patches

The vulnerability has been fixed in v2.28.8

### Workarounds

It is recommended to upgrade the version to v2.28.8

### References

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H

### CVE ID
