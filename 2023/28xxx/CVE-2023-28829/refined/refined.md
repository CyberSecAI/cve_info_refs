- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The use of legacy OPC services (OPC DA, OPC HDA, and OPC AE) in SIMATIC WinCC before V8, which rely on Windows ActiveX and DCOM mechanisms. These mechanisms lack modern security features for authentication and encryption.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use of obsolete functions (CWE-477), lack of strong authentication, and lack of encryption within the legacy OPC services.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exploitation could lead to limited information disclosure, limited data modification, and limited disruption of service.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is adjacent (AV:A).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have high privileges (PR:H) and the attack requires high interaction (AC:H), and no user interaction is needed(UI:N).
