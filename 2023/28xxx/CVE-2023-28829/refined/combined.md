SSA-508677: Use of Obsolete Function Vulnerability in SIMATIC
WinCC before V8

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 3.9

SUMMARY

Before SIMATIC WinCC V8, legacy OPC services (OPC DA (Data Access), OPC HDA (Historical Data
Access), and OPC AE (Alarms & Events)) were used per default. These services were designed on
top of the Windows ActiveX and DCOM mechanisms and do not implement state-of-the-art security
mechanisms for authentication and encryption of contents.

Starting with WinCC V8.0 the legacy OPC services are no longer enabled by default in new installations.
Siemens recommends to use OPC UA instead and to disable the legacy OPC services. For deployments
where the legacy OPC services are still in use, ensure that only trusted users are part of the SIMATIC
HMI group.

Siemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT

• SINATIC NET PC Software: Ensure that only trusted users are part of the SIMATIC Net group
• Disable the legacy OPC DA/HDA/AE services and switch to OPC UA, if possible
• Ensure that only trusted users are part of the SIMATIC HMI group

Product-speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by
Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SIMATIC NET PC software is a software product that is sold separately and implements the communica-
tions product from SIMATIC NET.

SIMATIC PCS 7 is a distributed control system (DCS) integrating SIMATIC WinCC, SIMATIC Batch,
SIMATIC Route Control, OpenPCS 7 and other components.

SIMATIC WinCC is a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system.

SINAUT Software ST7sc connects SINAUT ST7 stations to HMI, SCADA and ofﬁce applications via OPC.

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on
SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the
same ﬁrmware as the product they are based on.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2023-28829

Before SIMATIC WinCC V8, legacy OPC services (OPC DA (Data Access), OPC HDA (Historical Data
Access), and OPC AE (Alarms & Events)) were used per default. These services were designed on
top of the Windows ActiveX and DCOM mechanisms and do not implement state-of-the-art security
mechanisms for authentication and encryption of contents.
