- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insecure Java deserialization in Adobe LiveCycle ES4v11.0 due to the software not using safe methods of deserialization and being dependent on a vulnerable version of Java (Jdk7u21).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure deserialization. The application fails to securely handle deserialization of objects, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary code.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote code execution (RCE) on the server operating system (OS) in the context of the user or process that started the software. This can lead to complete compromise of the server, and further access to the organization's network.
- **Attack vectors**: An unauthenticated attacker can exploit the vulnerability over the network by sending malicious serialized objects to the vulnerable forms processing component.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable forms processing component of Adobe LiveCycle ES4v11.0. No authentication is required.
