{
  "CVE-2023-28503": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `do_log_on_user()` function within `libunidata.so`. This function has a hardcoded username \":local:\" and a deterministic password format that bypasses the standard PAM-based authentication.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Authentication bypass due to hardcoded username and predictable password format."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can authenticate as any Linux user on the target system, leading to the ability to execute commands as that user, including root, especially when combined with other vulnerabilities. This also allows exploiting post-authentication vulnerabilities without needing valid credentials.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through the UniRPC service, specifically by sending a crafted authentication message to vulnerable services (e.g., `udadmin_server`) that use the vulnerable `do_log_on_user()` function for authentication.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs network access to the UniRPC service and the ability to craft network packets using the UniRPC protocol. No prior authentication or user knowledge is needed other than the hardcoded username and password format."
