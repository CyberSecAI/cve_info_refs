Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-28099:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `ds_is_in_list()` function in OpenSIPS. When an invalid IP address string (specifically a `NULL` value, which is not a valid input) is passed to the function, it attempts to print a string from a random memory address (stack garbage). This occurs because the `val` variable, which contains a string (`val.rs.len` and `val.rs.s`), is not initialized before being used in the `LM_ERR` logging statement within the function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Uninitialized Variable:** The primary vulnerability is the usage of an uninitialized `pv_value_t val` variable before accessing its members `val.rs.len` and `val.rs.s`.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The function does not properly handle invalid IP address strings (`NULL`) and proceeds to use the uninitialized `val` variable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Crash:** The most direct impact of exploiting this vulnerability is that OpenSIPS can crash due to attempting to read from an arbitrary memory location.
- **Potential Information Leak:** An attacker might be able to pollute the stack before calling `ds_is_in_list` to control the uninitialized `val.rs.s` to an arbitrary memory address, potentially exposing sensitive data such as passwords, cookies, or session tokens in the logs if `val.rs.len` is also controlled to a non-zero value.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is through the network, as an attacker would need to craft a SIP message that results in an invalid IP address string being passed to the `ds_is_in_list()` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to have the ability to send SIP messages that can trigger the `ds_is_in_list()` function with an invalid IP address.
- No privileges or user interaction are required for exploitation.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability exists in OpenSIPS versions `3.1.8` and earlier, as well as `3.2.5` and earlier.
- Patched versions are `3.1.9` and `3.2.6`.
- The fix involves using the original IP string that was passed into the function for the error log message, rather than relying on the uninitialized `val` variable.
- The vulnerability is considered "moderate" severity due to the high attack complexity but also high impact on availability.
- The CVSS score is 5.9, with a vector of `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H`
