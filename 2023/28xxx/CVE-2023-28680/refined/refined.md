*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Crap4J Plugin does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** XML External Entity (XXE) injection vulnerability.
*  **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to parse a crafted XML document containing external entities, leading to the extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.
*   **Attack vectors:** An attacker able to control the contents of a Crap Report file can inject malicious XML.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to control Crap Report file contents.

This vulnerability allows an attacker with the ability to manipulate Crap Report files to potentially access sensitive information on the Jenkins server or to perform server-side request forgery.
