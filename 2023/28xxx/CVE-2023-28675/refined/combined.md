## Descriptions

### Incorrect permission checks in Role-based Authorization Strategy Plugin

**SECURITY-3053
/
CVE-2023-28668**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`role-strategy`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/role-strategy)**

**Description:**

Permissions in Jenkins can be enabled and disabled.
Some permissions are disabled by default, e.g., Overall/Manage or Item/Extended Read.
Disabled permissions cannot be granted directly, only through greater permissions that imply them (e.g., Overall/Administer or Item/Configure).

Role-based Authorization Strategy Plugin 587.v2872c41fa\_e51 and earlier grants permissions even after they’ve been disabled.

This allows attackers to have greater access than they’re entitled to after the following operations took place:

1. A permission is granted to attackers directly or through groups.
2. The permission is disabled, e.g., through the script console.

Role-based Authorization Strategy Plugin 587.588.v850a\_20a\_30162 does not grant disabled permissions.
