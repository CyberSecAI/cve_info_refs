The provided document contains information about multiple vulnerabilities, including CVE-2023-28675.

**CVE-2023-28675**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The OctoPerf Load Testing Plugin Plugin 4.5.2 and earlier does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints. Additionally, these endpoints do not require POST requests.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    *   Missing permission check: The plugin does not validate user permissions before allowing access to certain HTTP endpoints.
    *   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): The affected HTTP endpoints do not require POST requests.
*   **Impact of exploitation**:
    *   An attacker with Overall/Read permission can connect to a previously configured Octoperf server using attacker-specified credentials, potentially gaining unauthorized access or control over the Octoperf server and potentially also being able to capture credentials.
*   **Attack vectors**:
    *   Network-based attack: The vulnerabilities are triggered through HTTP requests.
    *   CSRF:  An attacker can trick a user's browser into making unintended requests to the vulnerable endpoints.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    *   The attacker needs Overall/Read permissions to the Jenkins instance.
    *   The attacker needs to lure a user to visit a malicious website to perform a CSRF attack
