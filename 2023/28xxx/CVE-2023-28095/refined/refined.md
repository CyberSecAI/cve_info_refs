Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability details for CVE-2023-28095:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**
   - The provided content describes a detailed security audit of OpenSIPS, which includes a finding related to a crash in `build_res_buf_from_sip_req` function which is assigned CVE-2023-28095. This aligns with the provided CVE ID.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability arises from incorrect handling of To header processing in the `build_res_buf_from_sip_req` function. When a SIP message contains multiple `To` headers, with one having a `tag` and one without, the function incorrectly calculates memory offsets, leading to a negative size parameter for `memcpy`.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Incorrect handling of multiple `To` headers with varying presence of `tag` parameters.
    *   Improper calculation of memory copy size (`len`) using `to_tag.s-hdr->name.s`, which can result in a negative value.
    *   Lack of proper initialization/validation before `memcpy` operation which results in negative-size-param.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation results in a crash of the OpenSIPS server due to the `memcpy` call with a negative size argument causing a crash, leading to service disruption. The function, and the described vulnerability, is not reachable directly through any public API, making direct exploitation not possible.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Network:** The attack vector is via sending a specially crafted SIP message.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   No special privileges or authentication are needed to trigger the vulnerability.
    *   Attacker needs to be able to send network traffic (malicious SIP message) to OpenSIPS server.

**3. Additional Technical Details:**

*   **Function:** `build_res_buf_from_sip_req` in `msg_translator.c` is the vulnerable function.
*   **Trigger:** The issue is triggered by a specific SIP message structure containing more than one `To` header where the first has the tag and the next one doesn't. This specific structure leads to wrong length calculations when copying the header.
*   **Backtrace:** The provided backtrace confirms that a negative size is passed to memcpy in the vulnerable function.
*   **Mitigation:** The issue was fixed in commit `9cf3dd3` by correctly handling header correlation.

**4. CVSS Metrics:**
   -   **CVSS v3.1 Base Score:** 5.9
   -   **CVSS v3.1 Impact Subscore:** 3.6
   -   **CVSS v3.1 Exploitability Subscore:** 2.2
   -   **CVSS v3.1 Temporal Score:** 4.7
   -   **CVSS v3.1 Environmental Score:** 6.2
   -   **CVSS v3.1 Modified Impact Subscore:** 5.4
   -   **CVSS v3.1 Overall Score:** 6.2
   -   **CVSS v3.1 Vector:** AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:U/RL:O/RC:U/CR:X/IR:X/AR:H/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:N/MUI:N/MS:U/MC:N/MI:N/MA:H

**5. Additional Notes**
    *   The vulnerability was discovered during fuzzing of the `build_res_buf_from_sip_req` function.
    *   Exploitation of the vulnerability through a running instance of OpenSIPS is unlikely due to missing public functions which would call this vulnerable code.

In summary, CVE-2023-28095 identifies a DoS vulnerability in OpenSIPS core due to incorrect handling of To headers while building responses. While this vulnerability cannot be exploited directly due to it being called by non-public functions, it is still important that it is addressed.
