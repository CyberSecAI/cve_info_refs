Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-28096:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**
The content directly relates to CVE-2023-28096, which describes a memory leak vulnerability in the `parse_mi_request` function of OpenSIPS. This is verified by the presence of the CVE ID in the GitHub advisory and the mention of `parse_mi_request` in both the advisory and the linked audit document.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a memory leak in the `cJSON` library, specifically when parsing malformed JSON objects within the `parse_mi_request` function of OpenSIPS. The leak occurs during error handling within the cJSON library.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The vulnerability is a memory leak, which can lead to resource exhaustion.
*   **Impact:** An attacker could cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by repeatedly sending malformed JSON requests to the management interface. Over time, this would exhaust available memory, making the OpenSIPS server unstable or unresponsive. The impact is higher if the management interface is exposed without authentication. The vulnerability could also exist in other parts of OpenSIPS that use the cJSON library.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is network-based, exploiting the management interface via the FIFO transport layer.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker must be able to send data to the management interface. No authentication is mentioned as required to trigger the leak in the provided materials. The GitHub advisory mentions "High" privilege is required, which is contradictory to the "no authentication is typically required" statement in the technical report.

**3. Additional Details:**

*   The provided GitHub advisory provides the affected versions (2.3 - 3.2) and the patched versions (3.1.8, 3.2.5). It also provides a link to the commit that fixes the issue.
*   The linked technical report provides a more in-depth technical explanation and steps to reproduce the issue.
*   The technical report also details the methodology used to discover this vulnerability.
*   The CVSS score is 7.1 which is Moderate overall according to the advisory

**4. Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is located in how the cJSON library handles parsing errors.
*   The vulnerability can be triggered using a malformed JSON message {"jsonrpc": "2.0","method": "log_le" sent through the FIFO interface
*   The fix is located in commit `4175687`.

**Summary of extracted information:**

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2023-28096
*   **Root cause:** Memory leak in the `cJSON` library during malformed JSON object parsing within the `parse_mi_request` function.
*   **Vulnerability:** Memory leak.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) due to memory exhaustion.
*   **Attack vector:** Network access to the management interface (e.g., FIFO transport).
*   **Attacker capabilities:** Ability to send malformed JSON requests to the management interface. No authentication is mentioned as required in the technical report, though the GitHub advisory contradicts this statement, saying "High" privileges are required
*   **Affected versions:** OpenSIPS versions 2.3 - 3.2
*   **Patched versions:** OpenSIPS versions 3.1.8, 3.2.5
*   **Fix Commit:** [4175687](https://github.com/OpenSIPS/opensips/commit/417568707520af25ec5c5dd91da18e6db3649dcb)
