Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-28438:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Improper Quoting of Filters:** The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of user-provided input in custom report filters within the Pimcore application. Specifically, the application does not correctly quote and sanitize field names in the `HAVING` clause of SQL queries within `models/Tool/CustomReport/Adapter/Sql.php`.
*   **Path Traversal:** Additionally, there is a path traversal vulnerability, though details are not fully elucidated in the provided excerpts, but is related to creation of arbitrary files with the exported data.
*   **Lack of CSRF Protection:** The use of the GET method for the custom report endpoint without CSRF protection allows for easier exploitation via crafted links.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection (CWE-89):**  The improper quoting of the filters enables SQL injection attacks. Attackers can inject malicious SQL code by manipulating filter values.
*   **Path Traversal (CWE-22):** The application is also vulnerable to path traversal, allowing attackers to create and append data to arbitrary files on the server.
*  **Lack of CSRF Protection:** The custom report endpoint uses the GET method, which is susceptible to CSRF attacks, as there is no CSRF protection implemented.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary SQL Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries against the database, potentially leading to data breaches, manipulation, or denial of service.
*   **Arbitrary File Creation/Modification:** The attacker can create files on the server or append data to existing files.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** By combining SQL injection and path traversal, an attacker can export data, upload a webshell and execute arbitrary PHP code on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack can be performed over the network.
*   **Malicious Links:** The attacker can craft a malicious link and trick an authenticated user into clicking it. The malicious link would trigger the vulnerable report endpoint with injected SQL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User with "report" permission:** The attacker needs to have valid user credentials with the 'report' permission to access the custom reports functionality.
*  **User interaction:** The attacker needs to trick a user into clicking on a malicious link.

**Additional Details:**

* The vulnerability is present in Pimcore versions prior to 10.5.19.
* Patches are available in commits  `d1abadb181c88ebaa4bce1916f9077469d4ea2bc` and  `7f788fa44bc18bc1c9182c25e26b770a1d30b62f` and should be applied to resolve this vulnerability.
* The CVSS score is 6.2 Moderate, with CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N.
*   The provided files include the patch which quotes the identifier and direction in `models/Tool/CustomReport/Adapter/Sql.php` to fix the vulnerability

**Summary of changes in the patch:**

*   In the `getData` function, ensures that the order direction (`$dir`) is either 'ASC' or 'DESC', preventing SQL injection through this parameter.
*   In the `buildQueryString` function, the field name is wrapped with `quoteIdentifier` before being used in the `HAVING` clause, preventing SQL injection via filter names.
