{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Slideshow Gallery plugin for WordPress lacks proper CSRF protection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.",
  "Attack vectors": "A malicious actor can craft a request that, when triggered by an authenticated user, performs unintended actions on the vulnerable website.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into performing an action (e.g. clicking a link or loading a malicious web page). No special access or privilege is required."
