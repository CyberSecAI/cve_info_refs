Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-28319:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a use-after-free (UAF) in libcurl's SSH public key verification process. Specifically, when verifying an SSH server's public key using a SHA256 hash and the verification fails, libcurl frees the memory allocated for the fingerprint before returning an error message that includes the (now freed) hash.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free (CWE-416): The code frees the memory holding the SHA256 fingerprint before it is used to compose an error message.
- Improper memory management: Failure to ensure the memory containing the fingerprint is valid when generating error messages.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Sensitive information leak:  Heap-based data, which could contain sensitive information, may be inserted into the error message. This message could be shown to users, logged, or otherwise leaked.
- Potential for crashes or unexpected behavior: While the time window is very short, using freed memory can lead to unpredictable behavior.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when:
   -  The `CURLOPT_SSH_HOST_PUBLIC_KEY_SHA256` option is used.
   -  The libcurl is built with `libssh2`.
   - The fingerprint check fails.
    - Either `CURLOPT_VERBOSE` or `CURLOPT_ERRORBUFFER` is set.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to cause a failed SHA256 fingerprint check during an SSH connection.
- The attacker doesn't need to be on the same network, and this can be a remote vulnerability.
-  The attacker needs to have control over the SSH server's public key.

**Additional Details:**
- The amount of leaked data is limited to `CURL_ERROR_SIZE` (186 bytes) and it stops at the first null byte within those 186 bytes.
- The vulnerability affects curl versions 7.81.0 up to and including 8.0.1.
- The vulnerability was introduced in commit `3467e89bb97e6c87c7`.
- The fix was introduced in commit `8e21b1a05f3c0ee098dbcb6c`.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Medium" severity.
