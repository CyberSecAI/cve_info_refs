Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-28474:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of input sanitization when saving presets on search functionality in Concrete CMS. Specifically, the application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when saving search presets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The core vulnerability is a stored XSS issue. This means that malicious JavaScript code can be injected through the vulnerable input field (the name of the search preset) and stored in the database. This malicious code is then executed in the browsers of other users when they view the saved preset.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code, allowing them to execute arbitrary code in the context of a victim user's browser.
- **Session Hijacking/Data Theft:**  The attacker could potentially hijack user sessions, steal cookies, redirect users to malicious websites, or perform other malicious actions within the application.
- **Defacement:** The injected script could be used to alter the display of web pages, leading to defacement.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is launched over the network through web requests.
- **User Interaction:**  The attacker must be able to access the search preset saving functionality. The victim user is then impacted when they load a page containing the malicious preset.
- **Input Vector:** The vulnerability lies in the search preset name parameter, which is not sanitized.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Privileged Access:**  The attacker needs high privileges within Concrete CMS (e.g., a user that can save search presets). The vulnerability requires a user with "High" privileges.
- **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware that the search preset name input is vulnerable to XSS.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in Concrete CMS versions below 9.2, and specifically between versions 9.0 - 9.1.3.
- The Concrete CMS Security team assigned a CVSS v3.1 score of 3.5 with vector AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N.
- The vulnerability was reported by Veshraj Ghimire.

In summary, CVE-2023-28474 is a stored XSS vulnerability within the search preset functionality of Concrete CMS versions 9.0 - 9.1.3. It can be exploited by a high-privileged user to inject malicious scripts that will then be executed when other users interact with these search presets.
