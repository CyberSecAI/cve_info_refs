# Multisite DoS by spamming backups

Moderate

[jomaxro](/jomaxro)
published
GHSA-cp7c-fm4c-6xxx
Mar 16, 2023

## Package

Discourse
(Discourse)

## Affected versions

stable <= 3.0.1; beta <= 3.1.0.beta2; tests-passed <= 3.1.0.beta2

## Patched versions

stable > 3.0.1; beta > 3.1.0.beta2; tests-passed > 3.1.0.beta2

## Description

### Impact

A user logged as an administrator can request backups multiple times, which will eat up all the connections to the DB. If this is done on a site using multisite, then it can affect the whole cluster.

### Patches

This issue is patched in the latest stable, beta and tests-passed versions of Discourse.

### Workarounds

None.

### Severity

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H
