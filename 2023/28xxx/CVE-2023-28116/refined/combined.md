# Buffer overflow in L2CAP due to misconfigured MTU

Moderate

[nvt](/nvt)
published
GHSA-m737-4vx6-pfqp
Mar 17, 2023

## Package

ble-l2cap

## Affected versions

<= 4.8

## Patched versions

None

## Description

### Impact

An out-of-bounds write can occur in the BLE L2CAP module of the Contiki-NG operating system. The network stack of Contiki-NG uses a global buffer (packetbuf) for processing of packets, with the size of PACKETBUF\_SIZE. In particular, when using the BLE L2CAP module with the default configuration, the PACKETBUF\_SIZE value becomes larger then the actual size of the packetbuf. When large packets are processed by the L2CAP module, a buffer overflow can therefore occur when copying the packet data to the packetbuf.

### Patches

The vulnerability has been patched in the "develop" branch of Contiki-NG, and will be included in release 4.9.

### Workarounds

The problem can be fixed by applying the patch in Contiki-NG pull request [#2398](https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/2398).

### CVE ID

CVE-2023-28116

I know nothing about BLE MTU, but are you not allowed to have a smaller MTU than the packetbuf? If not, and `BLE_L2CAP_NODE_MTU` must indeed be equal to `PACKETBUF_SIZE`, would it not be cleaner to simply remove `BLE_L2CAP_CONF_NODE_MTU`, as it would be moot?

Thanks for the comment. The PR has been updated and this restriction has been removed. Moreover, the default value is now PACKETBUF\_SIZE instead of 1280.

Don't you want to keep a check for for `BLE_L2CAP_NODE_MTU > PACKETBUF_SIZE` to provide a compile-time warning for misconfigurations? (if I understood the issue correctly)
