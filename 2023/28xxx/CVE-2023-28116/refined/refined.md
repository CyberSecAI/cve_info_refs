Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2023-28116:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a misconfiguration of the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) in the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) L2CAP module of the Contiki-NG operating system. The `PACKETBUF_SIZE` was sometimes larger than the actual buffer size used by the L2CAP module, which lead to an out-of-bounds write.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the BLE L2CAP module due to a mismatch between the configured `BLE_L2CAP_NODE_MTU` (which defaults to `PACKETBUF_SIZE`) and the actual size of the buffer (`packetbuf`). When large packets are processed, data is copied to the `packetbuf` without proper bounds checking, causing an out-of-bounds write when the MTU is larger than the buffer size.
- **Misconfigured MTU:** The default configuration allowed `PACKETBUF_SIZE` to be larger than the actual buffer, which triggered the overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Out-of-bounds write:**  Writing beyond the allocated buffer memory can lead to unpredictable behavior, potentially including:
    - **Memory corruption:** Overwriting adjacent memory regions, which can affect other data or program functionality.
    - **Crash:** Causing the system or application to crash, leading to denial of service.
    - **Potential for further exploitation:** Although not explicitly stated, memory corruption vulnerabilities can sometimes be leveraged for more serious attacks, such as remote code execution in some cases.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication:** The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a BLE packet of size larger than the allocated buffer.
- **Network Level:**  The attacker needs to send a specifically crafted BLE packet through L2CAP.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Adjacent network access:** The attacker needs to be within the range of the BLE device to send a malicious BLE packet.
- **Ability to craft and send BLE packets:** The attacker must be able to create and transmit BLE packets exceeding the buffer size.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `ble-l2cap` module of Contiki-NG.
- Affected versions are `4.8` and earlier.
- The fix is available in the "develop" branch and will be included in release 4.9.
- A patch is also available in the associated pull request [#2398](https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/2398).
- The fix involves enforcing a check on `BLE_L2CAP_NODE_MTU` to prevent it from being larger than the actual buffer size, and changing the default value of `BLE_L2CAP_NODE_MTU` to `PACKETBUF_SIZE`
