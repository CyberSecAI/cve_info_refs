Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2023-28855:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of access control checks within the GLPI "fields" plugin. Specifically, the plugin fails to properly verify user permissions before allowing write operations to fields containers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Access Control:** The primary weakness is the absence of proper authorization checks. This allows authenticated users to modify data in field containers even if they lack the necessary permissions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Data Modification:** An attacker can modify any field container data regardless of their configured access rights. This can lead to data corruption, alteration of system behavior, or other unintended consequences.
*   **Integrity Violation**: As stated in the CVSS, the main impact of this vulnerability is high integrity violation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user within the GLPI system, but not with administrative privileges for that field.
*   **Low Privileges:** The vulnerability is exploitable by users with low privileges.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Versions:** Versions of the plugin up to and including 1.20.3 are vulnerable.
*   **Patched Versions:** The vulnerability is fixed in versions 1.13.1 and 1.20.4.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 6.5, indicating a moderate severity.
