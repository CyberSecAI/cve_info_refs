Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-28850:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-provided input when creating or renaming perspectives and views within the Pimcore perspective editor. Specifically, the 'name' field used for perspectives and views was not being sanitized before being used in the application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The core vulnerability is an XSS flaw. Because user-controlled input for names of perspectives and views is not properly sanitized or escaped, a malicious actor can inject arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Cookie Theft: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to steal a user's session cookies.
- Unauthorized Account Access: Stolen cookies can be used to gain unauthorized access to the victim's account.
- Malicious Redirects: An attacker could redirect users to malicious websites by injecting code that changes the page's location.

**Attack Vectors:**
- User Input Fields: The attack vector is through user input fields when creating or renaming perspectives and views. When a user inputs a malicious script in the name field, this script is not properly processed when displayed to the user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a user with permission to create or edit perspectives or views in Pimcore.
- They need to have the ability to input text into the name field for a perspective or view.
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious name containing javascript code.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was patched by implementing input sanitization in the JavaScript code and by using `htmlspecialchars` in the PHP code when converting the tree store to configuration.
- The fix involves two approaches:
  1. Server-side sanitization using `htmlspecialchars` on the perspective and view names when converting tree store data to configuration.
  2. Client-side sanitization before sending data to the backend to prevent the input of malicious characters when creating or renaming perspectives or views.
- The vulnerability is classified as "Moderate" in severity.
- The affected versions are those prior to 1.5.1 of the `pimcore/perspective-editor` composer package.
