  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The TP-Link T2600G-28SQ layer-2 switch uses vulnerable SSH host keys.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Use of vulnerable SSH host keys (CWE-1391).",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can potentially obtain the administrator's credentials by tricking the administrator into logging into a spoofed device.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker located on an adjacent network can attempt a man-in-the-middle attack.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the targeted device and must be able to intercept and spoof the legitimate device's traffic. They would also need to trick the administrator into connecting to the spoofed device."
