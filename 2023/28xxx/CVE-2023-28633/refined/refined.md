Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2023-28633:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper URL sanitization in the RSS feed autodiscovery feature. Specifically, the `RSSFeed::showDiscoveredFeeds()` function does not check the safety of URLs before using them. This allows an attacker to specify arbitrary URLs that will be accessed by the server when processing RSS feeds, triggering a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Blind Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
- Improper URL sanitization.
- The RSS autodiscovery feature does not check the safety of URLs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can cause the server to make requests to arbitrary URLs, potentially leading to:
  - Information disclosure from internal services not intended to be exposed publicly.
  - Interaction with internal network resources.
  - Potential abuse of internal network resources.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based.
- An attacker can control the URL of the RSS feed being processed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to submit or control the URL of a RSS feed being processed by the GLPI application.
- Requires low privileges in the application.
- No user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is classified as low severity, with a CVSS score of 3.5.
- The affected versions are GLPI >= 0.84.
- The vulnerability is fixed in GLPI versions 9.5.13 and 10.0.7.
- The vulnerability is identified as CWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery).
