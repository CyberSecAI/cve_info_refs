# Blind Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in RSS feeds

Low

[cedric-anne](/cedric-anne)
published
GHSA-r57v-j88m-rwwf
Apr 5, 2023

## Package

glpi
(glpi)

## Affected versions

>= 0.84

## Patched versions

9.5.13, 10.0.7

## Description

### Impact

Usage of RSS feeds is subject to SSRF exploit.

In case remote address is not a valid RSS feed, a RSS autodiscovery feature is triggered. This feature does not check safetiness or URLs.

### Patches

Upgrade to 10.0.7.

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory, mail us at glpi-security@ow2.org

### Severity

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N

### CVE ID
