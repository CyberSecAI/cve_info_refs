{
  "CVE-2023-28508": {
    "Root cause": "A post-authentication heap overflow vulnerability exists in the `udsub` executable (accessed via the RPC service `unirep82`) due to a complex subscription request.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Heap overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "Potential remote code execution as the authenticated user. However, the service crashed when trying to free an invalid pointer after a complex subscription request.",
    "Attack vectors": "By sending a specially crafted message to the `unirep82` service after authenticating (or bypassing auth using CVE-2023-28503).",
      "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send crafted messages to the `unirep82` service. The attacker can either authenticate or leverage the authentication bypass (CVE-2023-28503) to gain access as the root user."
