Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2023-28413:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Directory traversal vulnerability in the Snow Monkey Forms plugin.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when handling file paths, allowing an attacker to traverse directories outside the intended scope.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A remote unauthenticated attacker can use this vulnerability to access files on the server that they should not be able to access.
- This can lead to sensitive information disclosure, potentially modification of website files, and denial of service (DoS) due to server resource exhaustion.
- In severe cases, it could even lead to a remote code execution (RCE) if an attacker can manipulate files to trigger a WordPress reinstallation.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote unauthenticated attackers can exploit this vulnerability by crafting malicious form submissions with directory traversal sequences in file paths.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need any authentication or special privileges to exploit this vulnerability. They can trigger it by sending malicious requests to the server.
- The attacker needs to be able to submit form data to the vulnerable WordPress plugin.
