{
  "CVE-2023-28642": {
    "Description": "It was found that AppArmor, and potentially SELinux, can be bypassed when `/proc` inside the container is symlinked with a specific mount configuration.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability arises from a flaw in how runc handles symlinked /proc directories within containers, allowing AppArmor and potentially SELinux to be bypassed.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "AppArmor bypass",
      "SELinux bypass",
      "Improper handling of symlinked /proc"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS).",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Local"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Requires the ability to mount /proc inside a container as a symlink. User interaction is required to run the container, but no specific privileges are needed. An untrusted container image must be used."
