# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

|  |  | # ======== 2023/03/30: Security patch sample. ======== |
|  |  | # |
|  |  | # What is this security risk type? |
|  |  | # - Shell command injection on httpd user. |
|  |  | # |
|  |  | # At what point does this security risk become apparent? |
|  |  | # - Send password setting mail or mail-login mail. |
|  |  | # - Maybe many system have a 'forget password?' link. |
|  |  | # |
|  |  | # Who can use this security risk? |
|  |  | # - Users who can add or modify the login field in login table to invalid mail address. |
|  |  | # - In many system, admin user will be able to create or modify a user. |
|  |  | # - If your system allow users to change login name to invalid mail address, the user can use this security risk. |
|  |  | # |
|  |  | # How to fix it? |
|  |  | # - Please use the newest index.php or add this bq\_login() function to your env.php. |
|  |  | # |
|  |  | # Important line is here: |
|  |  | # < if (!preg\_match('/^[0-9A-Za-z][-\_.@+0-9A-Za-z]\*$/', $login)) |
