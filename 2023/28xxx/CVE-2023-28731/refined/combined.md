**CVE Description:**

Introduction:

AcyMailing is a newsletter and email marketing plugin available for Joomla and WordPress.

The vulnerability:

Unrestricted upload of files allows PHP code to be injected, leading to unauthenticated remote code execution, when being granted access to the campaign’s creation on front-office.

This issue affects AcyMailing Joomla Plugin in versions below 8.3.0.

The steps to exploit the vulnerability:

* Campaign creation access needs to be enabled on the front-office, the following steps can then be done unauthenticated
* Editing an AcyMailing template and initiate sending a test email
* One of the resulting requests sent to the plugin sets a thumbnail, this request can be manipulated and accepts PHP code, which gets stored on the system
* The resulting PHP file is accessible and enables execution of the injected code

How to check for exploitation:

* The thumbnails are stored in the following location: /media/com\_acym/images/thumbnails/
* Signs of a successful exploitation would be the presence of PHP files in this directory
* Check for suspicious POST requests similar to “/index.php?option=com\_acym&tmpl=component&4f0877f7c82462a794cb5a042282dbf0=1&ctrl=frontmails&task=setNewThumbnail”

**Solution**:

* update to a fixed version (>= 8.3.0)

**Workaround**:

* Prevent the execution of PHP files in the thumbnail directory to prevent the injected code from being executed

**Timeline**:

* 2023-02-01: reported
* 2023-03-09: initial vendor notification
* 2023-03-10: initial vendor response
* 2023-03-20: release of fixed version
* 2023-03-30: coordinated public disclosure

**Credits**:

* Reporter: Raphaël Arrouas (“Xel”), on a bug bounty program of Bug Bounty Switzerland
* Coordinator: Bug Bounty Switzerland
