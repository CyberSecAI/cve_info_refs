SUMMARY

Polarion ALM is vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) injection attack that could allow an attacker to
potentially disclose conﬁdential data.

Siemens has released an update for Polarion ALM and recommends to update to the latest version.

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND SOLUTION

Affected Product and Versions

Remediation

Polarion ALM:
All versions < V22R2

Update to V22R2 or later version
https://support.sw.siemens.com/
See recommendations from section Workarounds
and Mitigations

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Set the below conﬁgurations to mitigate against external entity injection in OpenSAML 4.x parser

conﬁguration. This will be included by default on Polarion V2304 and later versions.

parserPool.setMaxPoolSize(100);

parserPool.setCoalescing(true);

parserPool.setIgnoreComments(true);

parserPool.setIgnoreElementContentWhitespace(true);

parserPool.setNamespaceAware(true);

parserPool.setExpandEntityReferences(false);

parserPool.setXincludeAware(false);

final Map<String, Boolean> features = new HashMap<String, Boolean>();

features.put(http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities, Boolean.FALSE
);

features.put(http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities, Boolean.
FALSE);

features.put(http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl, Boolean.TRUE);

features.put(http://apache.org/xml/features/validation/schema/normalized-value,
Boolean.FALSE);

features.put(http://javax.xml.XMLConstants/feature/secure-processing, Boolean.
TRUE);

parserPool.setBuilderFeatures(features);

Product-speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by
Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Polarion ALM is an application lifecycle management solution that improves software development
processes with a single, uniﬁed solution for requirements, coding, testing, and release.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2023-28828

The application contains a XML External Entity Injection (XXE) vulnerability. This could allow an
attacker to view ﬁles on the application server ﬁlesystem.
