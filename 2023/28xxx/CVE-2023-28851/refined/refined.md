Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-28851:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper handling of user input when displaying stored form submissions. Specifically, the `Value` of submitted form fields was not being properly escaped before being rendered in the HTML of the GridField view.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS vulnerability.  Due to the lack of proper output escaping, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into form fields that will be executed in the browser of any user viewing the stored form submissions.
- **Improper Output Encoding:** The code failed to encode user input before rendering it in the HTML context, allowing injected JavaScript to execute.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser.
- **Session Hijacking:** Attackers could potentially steal user session cookies.
- **Data Theft:** Attackers could potentially access and exfiltrate sensitive data displayed on the page or perform actions on behalf of the victim user.
- **Defacement:** The attacker could modify the content displayed on the page.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Form Submission:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code by submitting a form with specially crafted input values.
- **Stored XSS:** The malicious payload is stored in the database and executed when the form submission is viewed in the application's admin interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Submit Forms:** An attacker needs to be able to submit forms on the vulnerable website/application.
- **Access to Admin Interface:** The attacker does not need access to the admin interface, but this is required to execute the XSS. An attacker with access to the admin interface can see the vulnerability.
