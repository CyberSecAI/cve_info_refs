{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Nextcloud desktop client was not generating a new initialization vector (IV) when uploading an updated file. It was reusing the same IV used in the original upload.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Initialization Vector Reuse: The same IV is used for multiple encryptions with the same key."
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious server administrator can recover and modify the contents of E2EE files. This is due to the fact that reusing the IV with AES-GCM allows the recovery of the XOR of the plaintexts. This, in combination with the ability to recover the authentication tag, allows a malicious actor to modify the encrypted files.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A malicious server administrator with access to the encrypted data."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a malicious server administrator with access to the data and ability to modify the files"
  },
  "cve_id": "CVE-2023-28997"
