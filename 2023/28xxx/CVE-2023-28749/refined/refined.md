- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress CM On Demand Search And Replace Plugin (versions <= 1.3.0) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CSRF vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious actor can exploit this by crafting a malicious request that is triggered when a logged-in administrator visits a malicious site or interacts with malicious content.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into interacting with a malicious request, and does not need to be authenticated.
