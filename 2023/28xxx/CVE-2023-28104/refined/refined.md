  "CVE-2023-28104": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "A specially crafted GraphQL query can cause excessive server-side processing.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability allows an attacker to perform a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack by exploiting the lack of input validation or resource limits when processing GraphQL queries.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "The exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) or Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, rendering the affected website unavailable.",
       "Attack vectors": "A specially crafted GraphQL query sent over the network.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send GraphQL queries to the server. No specific privileges are required unless the GraphQL schema is not publicly exposed, in which case a valid user account is required."
    },
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper resource management when processing GraphQL queries.  A schema rebuild was reverted to remediate this.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The main weakness is the lack of protection against complex and resource-intensive GraphQL queries, allowing an attacker to cause a denial of service.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "The vulnerability can cause a denial of service, making the website or application unavailable.",
      "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is sending a specially crafted GraphQL query to the server.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send GraphQL queries to the server. No privileges required when graphql schema is exposed publicly, otherwise a valid user account is needed."
