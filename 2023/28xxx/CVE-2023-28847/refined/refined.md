{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to the lack of brute force protection for passwords of password-protected share links. This allows attackers to repeatedly attempt passwords without restrictions.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Missing brute force protection mechanism for password-protected share links."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to shared files by brute-forcing the password of a share link.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is network-based, exploiting the publicly accessible share link interface.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to know a share link and attempt to guess the password. No special privileges are required, but user interaction (clicking the link, entering the password) is needed. The attacker can be remote."
