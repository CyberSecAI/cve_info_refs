# Missing brute force protection for passwords of password protected share links

Low

[julien-nc](/julien-nc)
published
GHSA-r5wf-xj97-3w7w
Apr 25, 2023

## Package

Server
(Nextcloud)

## Affected versions

>= 24.0.0, >= 25.0.0

## Patched versions

24.0.11, 25.0.5

Server
(Nextcloud Enterprise)

>= 23.0.0, >= 24.0.0, >= 25.0.0

23.0.12.6, 24.0.11, 25.0.5

## Description

### Impact

An attacker is not restricted in verifying passwords of share links so they can just start brute forcing the password.

### Patches

It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 24.0.11 or 25.0.5

It is recommended that the Nextcloud Enterprise Server is upgraded to 23.0.12.6, 24.0.11 or 25.0.5

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

This adds a rate limit on all methods wrapped by PublicShareMiddleware if an invalid token is provided.

As the token check does not happen in the controller methods but in the middleware, we can't use the `@AnonRateThrottle` annotation on those methods.

Remaining questions:

* Does it make sense to use the brute force protection mechanism instead? If so, same issue, we can't use the annotation in the controller.
* Do the limit (10) and period (120) values make sense?
* Does it make sense to call registerAnonRequest only if the token check fails like it's done here?
  + It could be called in other cases
  + Where should it be called to apply the limit when the token is correct but the password is wrong?

Sorry, something went wrong.

| This adds a rate limit on all methods wrapped by PublicShareMiddleware if an invalid token is provided.  Sounds like you want to do brute force protection, not rate limiting.   * Rate limiting is for correct usage, but you want to prevent abuse, e.g. we could rate limit guests so they can only post 10 chat messages per 60 seconds. * Brute force protection is to prevent guessing access, e.g. log every attempt of accessing a room that does not exist and then return without trying after X failed attempts   But seems like I should extend the docs with this a bit going forward. |

| [@nickvergessen](https://github.com/nickvergessen) Thanks for the explanation. Better like this?  It still only protects against incorrect token attempts but not against incorrect share password.  I'll squash the commits later if needed. |

Can we read if the controller itself has the annotation and then reuse that action or better not do anything, so it's not double slowed?

Technically we can, just like the `BruteForceMiddleware` does.

But as you said, what if the `ShareController` is handled by the `BruteForceMiddleware` in the future? `sleepDelayOrThrowOnMax` would be called twice.

Also it would probably bring some confusion. Why would the `PublicShareMiddleware` care about annotations that are bruteforce-related?

I think it's fine the way we do it. All methods having the token/password check are bruteforce protected.

Only weird aspect of this is when reading the controllers...nothing mentions bruteforce protection in `OCA\Files_Sharing\Controller\PublicShareController` and `OCA\Files_Sharing\Controller\ShareController`.

Should we add explicit comments pointing to the `PublicShareMiddleware` in those controllers? And/or in the `AuthPublicShareController` and `PublicShareController`?

Sorry, something went wrong.

[@nickvergessen](https://github.com/nickvergessen) I kinda answered your question 😁. IMO it's fine and clearer like it is now.
