An issue was discovered in Veritas NetBackup IT Analytics 11 before 11.2.0. The application upgrade process included unsigned files that could be exploited and result in a customer installing unauthentic components. A malicious actor could install rogue Collector executable files (aptare.jar or upgrademanager.zip) on the Portal server, which might then be downloaded and installed on collectors.
