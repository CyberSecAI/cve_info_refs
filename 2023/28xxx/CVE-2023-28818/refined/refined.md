- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Veritas NetBackup IT Analytics application upgrade process included unsigned files. This means there was no verification of the authenticity and integrity of the files being used for upgrades.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature (CWE-347). The application failed to verify the digital signatures of the upgrade files.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor could install rogue Collector executable files (aptare.jar, upgrademanager.zip) on the NetBackup IT Analytics Portal server. These rogue files, if installed, could potentially compromise the collectors which receive and use these files. This could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or other malicious activities depending on the capabilities of the rogue executables.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the NetBackup IT Analytics Portal server. A malicious actor needs to gain administrative/root access to the server to install the unsigned/rogue components.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires administrative or root level access to the NetBackup IT Analytics Portal server.
