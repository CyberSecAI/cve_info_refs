- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A flaw in IBM MQ's tracing logic causes sensitive data to be captured and stored in plain text within IBM MQ trace files under certain circumstances.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Sensitive information disclosure, with data stored in plain text within trace files.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in plain text within IBM MQ trace files.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation requires access to IBM MQ trace files.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Access to the file system where IBM MQ trace files are stored. The attacker needs to know that tracing is enabled.
