- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Broken access control. An attacker can retrieve trip details by using a Skoda vehicle's VIN, even without proper authorization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Improper access control mechanisms. The system allows retrieval of trip data based on the VIN alone, without proper authentication or authorization checks against the vehicle owner or authorized users.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can obtain sensitive trip information, such as timestamps, fuel consumption, and speed data, of the vehicle.
- **Attack vectors:**  Exploiting the API or backend system by sending requests using the vehicle's VIN.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to know the VIN of the target Skoda vehicle and have the ability to make requests to the backend system where the vehicle trip data is stored. They also need to be aware of the vulnerable API endpoint.
