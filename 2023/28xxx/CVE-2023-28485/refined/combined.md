## Features in WeKan

### Boards

You can make many boards for different projects or tasks. Each board can have columns to show the different stages of your work, such as "To Do," "Doing," and "Done." You can also add cards to each board to represent tasks, with titles, descriptions, and due dates. WeKan helps you keep track of your tasks and projects visually, so you can see what needs to be done and what has been completed.

### Lists

WeKan uses lists on a Kanban board to represent different stages of a workflow, such as "To Do," "Doing," and "Done." Lists help you organize and track tasks on the board. To add a new list, click "Add a list" and give it a name. You can move tasks between lists by dragging and dropping them. Lists can be customized by changing their color or adding custom fields to capture more information about tasks.

### Cards

A card represents a task on a Kanban board. It includes a title, description, due date, labels, and comments. To create a new card, choose the board and column, and add the relevant details. As work progresses, move the card from one column to another. Cards can be customized by adding labels, files, and checklists. You can also comment on cards to provide updates or feedback.

### Security

WeKan has several features to protect your data and keep it secure. WeKan is designed with security in mind.

WeKan is an open-source project, which means that its source code is available for anyone to inspect and audit for security vulnerabilities. This makes it less likely that there are hidden security holes that could be exploited by attackers.

#### Standard for Public Code

[WeKan and Standard for Public Code](https://wekan.github.io/standard-for-public-code/) assessment was made at 2023-11.
Currently WeKan meets 8 out of 16 criteria out of the box. Some others could be met with small changes.

#### Self-hosted option

One of the biggest advantages of WeKan is its self-hosting option, which gives you full control over your data, better security, greater customization options, cost-effectiveness, long-term viability,
and can help you ensure that your data is not being accessed or shared without your knowledge.

#### Access controls

WeKan allows you to set up access controls to limit who can see and edit your boards and cards. You can set permissions at the board level or for individual users, which helps you control who has access to sensitive data.

| **2023-02-16 17.35 EET** | Report received. ```                title: Stored XSS vulnerability in rename functionality             product: WeKan (Open-Source kanban)  vulnerable version: <=6.74       fixed version:           CVE number:               impact: Medium            homepage: https://wekan.github.io               found: 2022-12-30                  by: Heiner Liesegang (Office Berlin)                      SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab                      An integrated part of SEC Consult, an Atos company                      Europe | Asia | North America                      https://www.sec-consult.com  Vendor description: -------------------  WeKan ® is an completely Open Source and Free software collaborative kanban board application with MIT license.  Whether you’re maintaining a personal todo list, planning your holidays with some friends, or working in a team on your next revolutionary idea, Kanban boards are an unbeatable tool to keep your things organized. They give you a visual overview of the current state of your project, and make you productive by allowing you to focus on the few items that matter the most.  Source: https://github.com/wekan/wekan  Business recommendation: ------------------------ Patch the application with the latest update supplied by the vendor.  Vulnerability overview/description: ----------------------------------- 1) Stored Cross-Site Scripting  An authenticated attacker with the role 'BoardAdmin' is able to rename file attachments of Kanban cards. Being an admin of the Wekan instance is not required in order for this exploit to work, as any user can obtain 'BoardAdmin' privileges by creating a new Kanban board.  The 'renameAttachment' method does not sanitise user input and allows embedding XSS payloads in the specified filename. The stored XSS payload is triggered by opening the attachment as the modified filename is displayed in the header bar of the file preview.  Proof of concept: ----------------- 1) Stored Cross-Site Scripting The following steps are necessary to exploit the vulnerability: 1. Log into the application with at least "user" privileges 2a. Open a Kanban board in which you have 'BoardAdmin' privileges 2b. Or, create a new Kanban board otherwise 3. Create a Kanban card if none exist 4. Open Kanban card to edit it 5. If there is no attachment in the card, upload one 6. Click on "Attachment Actions" under the attachment and select "Rename" 7. Include arbitrary XSS payload such as the following inside the filename:  "[script]alert('Stored XSS')[/script]" (where change [] to open close tags)  8. Select "Save" to embed the XSS payload  Any user with access to the board clicking on the attachment preview triggers the stored XSS. In case the used Kanban board is set to "public" any person with a link to the board can access the targeted card and  trigger the payload inside the attachments' filename.  Vulnerable / tested versions: ----------------------------- The following versions have been tested to be vulnerable: * v6.64 * v6.69 * v6.71  TBD: According to the vendor, all previous versions are affected as well.  Vendor contact timeline: ------------------------ 2023-02-16: Contacting vendor through email.  Solution: --------- TBD: The vendor provides a patched version which should be installed immediately. TBD: Link to vendor update & version information  Workaround: ----------- None  Advisory URL: ------------- https://sec-consult.com/vulnerability-lab/  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab  SEC Consult, an Atos company Europe | Asia | North America  About SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab  The SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab is an integrated part of SEC Consult, an Atos company.
