Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2023-28486:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is that `sudo` did not properly escape control characters present in log messages. This could lead to misinterpretation or manipulation of logs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of control characters in log messages.
- Log messages contain user-controlled strings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  Successful exploitation could lead to disclosure of sensitive information by manipulating the log output.
- Misinterpretation of logs
- Log injection

**Attack Vectors:**
-  An attacker with the ability to execute commands via sudo could potentially inject crafted command paths, command line arguments, or environment variables containing control characters.
-  A user could also inject control characters via input parameters if `sudo` command is called as part of script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-  The attacker must have the ability to execute commands via `sudo`.
-  The attacker must have the ability to insert specific command names or arguments containing special characters.

**Additional Notes:**

- The fix for this vulnerability includes escaping control characters with a leading octal `#`. Space characters in the command path are also escaped in octal format. Command line arguments that contain spaces are enclosed in single quotes and any literal single quote or backslash characters are escaped with a backslash.
- This vulnerability is addressed in `sudo` version 1.9.13.
- The vulnerability is present in the logging functionality of sudo, both in syslog and local log files.
- The Gentoo Security Advisory indicates the vulnerability is exploitable remotely.

The provided content from netapp states: "Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to disclosure of sensitive information."

The commit message in github states:
```
The log message contains user-controlled strings that could include things like terminal control characters. Space characters in the command path are now also escaped.

Command line arguments that contain spaces are surrounded with single quotes and any literal single quote or backslash characters are escaped with a backslash. This makes it possible to distinguish multiple command line arguments from a single argument that contains spaces.
```

The Debian security advisory states "Sudo did not escape control characters in log messages."
