This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Escape control characters in log messages and "sudoreplay -l" output.

```
The log message contains user-controlled strings that could include
things like terminal control characters.  Space characters in the
command path are now also escaped.

Command line arguments that contain spaces are surrounded with
single quotes and any literal single quote or backslash characters
are escaped with a backslash.  This makes it possible to distinguish
multiple command line arguments from a single argument that contains
spaces.

Issue found by Matthieu Barjole and Victor Cutillas of Synacktiv
(<https://synacktiv.com>).

[`effed9e`](/sudo-project/sudo/commit/effed9ecbb54acedcbf32d53d9ebd571498867b4)

* Fixed a bug running relative commands via sudo when *log\_subcmds* is enabled. [GitHub issue #194](https://github.com/sudo-project/sudo/issues/194).
* Fixed a signal handling bug when running sudo commands in a shell script. Signals were not being forwarded to the command when the sudo process was not run in its own process group.
* Fixed a bug in the `cvtsudoers` LDIF parsing when the file ends without a newline and a backslash is the last character of the file.
* Fixed a potential use-after-free bug with cvtsudoers filtering. [GitHub issue #198](https://github.com/sudo-project/sudo/issues/198).
* Added a reminder to the default lecture that the password will not echo. This line is only displayed when the pwfeedback option is disabled. [GitHub issue #195](https://github.com/sudo-project/sudo/issues/195).
* Fixed potential memory leaks in error paths. [GitHub issue #199](https://github.com/sudo-project/sudo/issues/199). [GitHub issue #202](https://github.com/sudo-project/sudo/issues/202).
* Fixed potential NULL dereferences on memory allocation failure. [GitHub issue #204](https://github.com/sudo-project/sudo/issues/204). [GitHub issue #211](https://github.com/sudo-project/sudo/issues/211).
* Sudo now uses C23-style attributes in function prototypes instead of gcc-style attributes if supported.
* Added a new **list** pseudo-command in sudoers to allow a user to list another user's privileges. Previously, only root or a user with the ability to run any command as either root or the target user on the current host could use the -U option. This also includes a fix to the log entry when a user lacks permission to run `sudo -U otheruser -l command`. Previously, the logs would indicate that the user tried to run the actual command, now the log entry includes the list operation.
* JSON logging now escapes control characters if they happen to appear in the command or environment.
* New Albanian translation from translationproject.org.
* Regular expressions in sudoers or logsrvd.conf may no longer contain consecutive repetition operators. This is implementation- specific behavior according to POSIX, but some implementations will allocate excessive amounts of memory. This mainly affects the fuzzers.
* Sudo now builds AIX-style shared libraries and dynamic shared objects by default instead of svr4-style. This means that the default sudo plugins are now .a (archive) files that contain a .so shared object file instead of bare .so files. This was done to improve compatibility with the AIX Freeware ecosystem, specifically, the AIX Freeware build of OpenSSL. Sudo will still load svr4-style .so plugins and if a .so file is requested, either via sudo.conf or the sudoers file, and only the .a file is present, sudo will convert the path from plugin.so to plugin.a(plugin.so) when loading it. This ensures compatibility with existing configurations. To restore the old, pre-1.9.13 behavior, run configure using the --with-aix-soname=svr4 option.
* Sudo no longer checks the ownership and mode of the plugins that it loads. Plugins are configured via either the sudo.conf or sudoers file which are trusted configuration files. These checks suffered from time-of-check vs. time-of-use race conditions and complicate loading plugins that are not simple paths. Ownership and mode checks are still performed when loading the sudo.conf and sudoers files, which do not suffer from race conditions. The sudo.conf *developer\_mode* setting is no longer used.
* Control characters in sudo log messages and `sudoreplay -l` output are now escaped in octal format. Space characters in the command path are also escaped. Command line arguments that contain spaces are surrounded by single quotes and any literal single quote or backslash characters are escaped with a backslash. This makes it possible to distinguish multiple command line arguments from a single argument that contains spaces.
* Improved support for DragonFly BSD which uses a different struct procinfo than either FreeBSD or 4.4BSD.
* Fixed a compilation error on Linux arm systems running older kernels that may not define EM\_ARM in linux/elf-em.h. [GitHub issue #232](https://github.com/sudo-project/sudo/issues/232).
* Fixed a compilation error when LDFLAGS contains -Wl,--no-undefined. Sudo will now link using -Wl,--no-undefined by default if possible. [GitHub issue #234](https://github.com/sudo-project/sudo/issues/234).
* Fixed a bug executing a command with a very long argument vector when *log\_subcmds* or *intercept* is enabled on a system where *intercept\_type* is set to **trace**. [GitHub issue #194](https://github.com/sudo-project/sudo/issues/194).
* When sudo is configured to run a command in a pseudo-terminal but the standard input is not connected to a terminal, the command will now be run as a background process. This works around a problem running sudo commands in the background from a shell script where changing the terminal to raw mode could interfere with the interactive shell that ran the script. [GitHub issue #237](https://github.com/sudo-project/sudo/issues/237).
* A missing include file in sudoers is no longer a fatal error unless the *error\_recovery* plugin argument has been set to false.

Debian LTS Advisory DLA-3732-1                debian-lts@lists.debian.org

Package        : sudo
Version        : 1.8.27-1+deb10u6
CVE ID         : CVE-2023-7090 CVE-2023-28486 CVE-2023-28487

Sudo, a program designed to allow a sysadmin to give limited
root privileges to users and log root activity, was vulnerable.

CVE-2023-7090

    A flaw was found in sudo in the handling of ipa_hostname, where
    ipa_hostname from /etc/sssd/sssd.conf was not propagated in sudo.
    Therefore, it leads to privilege mismanagement vulnerability in
    applications, where client hosts retain privileges even after
    retracting them.

CVE-2023-28486

    Sudo did not escape control characters in log messages.

CVE-2023-28487

    Sudo did not escape control characters in sudoreplay output.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
1.8.27-1+deb10u6.

We recommend that you upgrade your sudo packages.

For the detailed security status of sudo please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/sudo>
