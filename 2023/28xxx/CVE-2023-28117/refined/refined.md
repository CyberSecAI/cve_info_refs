Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2023-28117:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the Sentry Python SDK's Django integration, where it was not properly sanitizing or removing sensitive session-related cookies before sending them to Sentry. Specifically, if the `sendDefaultPII` configuration was set to `True`, and custom names were used for Django's `SESSION_COOKIE_NAME` or `CSRF_COOKIE_NAME` settings, the SDK would inadvertently send the values of these cookies to Sentry.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Information Disclosure:** The core issue is the leakage of sensitive cookie values, including session IDs and CSRF tokens, which are considered Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
-   **Insufficient Data Sanitization:** The SDK lacked the proper logic to detect custom cookie names and remove their values from the payload. The SDK did not remove these cookies unless explicitly configured to do so.
-   **Configuration Dependency:** The vulnerability's exploitability was contingent on specific configurations:
    -   `sendDefaultPII` being set to `True`.
    -   Custom names being used for Django's session or CSRF cookies.
    -   Absence of data scrubbing configurations in Sentry settings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Session Impersonation:** Attackers with access to the leaked session cookie could impersonate users, gaining unauthorized access to their accounts and related data.
-   **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers could potentially escalate their privileges if the leaked session allowed them to do so.
-   **Confidentiality Breach:** The leak exposes sensitive user information and potentially application internal data.
-   **Compromise of Integrity:** An attacker could modify or delete data with the leaked session.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, as the sensitive data is transmitted from the affected application to Sentry's servers.
-   **Indirect:** An attacker would need access to the Sentry instance and the sent events.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Access to Sentry:** An attacker needs access to the Sentry instance where the leaked cookie values are sent. This could include malicious insiders or attackers that have already compromised the Sentry environment.
-   **Knowledge of Target Configuration:** The attacker needs to be aware that the target application is using the Sentry SDK with the vulnerable configuration (i.e., `sendDefaultPII` set to `True` and custom cookie names).

**Additional Notes:**

-   The vulnerability was addressed in `sentry-sdk` version 1.14.0, which automatically detects custom cookie names from Django settings and removes their values before sending data to Sentry.
-   The advisory also suggests workarounds, such as using the SDK's filtering mechanisms (`before_send` and `before_send_transaction`) or Sentry's advanced data scrubbing features, to mitigate the risk in versions prior to 1.14.0.
-   The vulnerability is specific to applications using the Sentry Python SDK's Django integration.
