The values of cookies that are set by Django and are session related (session id and CSRF token) should be removed regardless of what `sendDefaultPII` is set to.

Fixes [#1839](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/issues/1839)

Sorry, something went wrong.

### Various fixes & improvements

* Add `before_send_transaction` ([#1840](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/pull/1840)) by [@antonpirker](https://github.com/antonpirker)

  Adds a hook (similar to `before_send`) that is called for all transaction events (performance releated data).

  Usage:

  ```
    import sentry_sdk

    def strip_sensitive_data(event, hint):
        # modify event here (or return `None` if you want to drop the event entirely)
        return event

    sentry_sdk.init(
        # ...
        before_send_transaction=strip_sensitive_data,
    )
  ```

# Sensitive session information is leaked when `sendDefaultPII` is set to `True`

High

[mdtro](/mdtro)
published
GHSA-29pr-6jr8-q5jm
Mar 21, 2023

## Package

pip

sentry-sdk
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

<1.14

## Patched versions

1.14

## Description

### Impact

When using the [Django integration](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/guides/django/) of the Sentry SDK in a specific configuration it is possible to leak sensitive cookies values, including the session cookie to Sentry. These sensitive cookies could then be used by someone with access to your Sentry issues to impersonate or escalate their privileges within your application.

The below must be true in order for these sensitive values to be leaked:

1. Your Sentry SDK configuration has `sendDefaultPII` set to `True`
2. You are using a custom name for either of the cookies below in your Django settings.

* [`SESSION_COOKIE_NAME`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/settings/#std-setting-SESSION_COOKIE_NAME) or
* [`CSRF_COOKIE_NAME`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/settings/#std-setting-CSRF_COOKIE_NAME) Django settings

3. You are not configured in your organization or project settings to use [our data scrubbing features](https://docs.sentry.io/product/data-management-settings/scrubbing/) to account for the custom cookie names

### Patches

As of version `1.14.0`, the Django integration of the `sentry-sdk` will detect the custom cookie names based on your Django settings and will remove the values from the payload *before* sending the data to Sentry.

### Workarounds

If you can not update your `sentry-sdk` to a patched version than you can use the SDKs filtering mechanism to remove the cookies from the payload that is sent to Sentry. For error events this can be done with the [before\_send](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/configuration/filtering/#using-platformidentifier-namebefore-send-) callback method and for performance related events (transactions) you can use the [before\_send\_transaction](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/configuration/filtering/#using-platformidentifier-namebefore-send-transaction-) callback method.

If you'd like to handle filtering of these values on the server-side, you can also use our [advanced data scrubbing feature](https://docs.sentry.io/product/data-management-settings/scrubbing/advanced-datascrubbing/) to account for the custom cookie names. Look for the `$http.cookies`, `$http.headers`, `$request.cookies`, or `$request.headers` fields to target with your scrubbing rule.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
