  for version 9. The Concrete CMS Security Team gave this a CVSS v4 score of 2.1 with vector [CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:H/AT:N/PR:H/UI:N/VC:L/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/4.0#CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:H/AT:N/PR:H/UI:N/VC:L/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N) Prior to the fix a rogue admin could add malicious code to the Thumbnails/Add Type. Thanks Alexey Solovyev for reporting HackerOne 921527.
* Fixed [CVE-2024-7398](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-7398) Stored XSS Vulnerability in Calendar Event Addition Feature with [commit 7c8ed0d1d9db0d7f6df7fa066e0858ea618451a5](https://github.com/concretecms/concretecms/commit/7c8ed0d1d9db0d7f6df7fa066e0858ea618451a5) for version 8 and commits [12183](https://github.com/concretecms/concretecms/pull/12183) and [12184](https://github.com/concretecms/concretecms/pull/12184) for version 9. The Concrete CMS Security Team gave this vulnerability a CVSS v4 score of 1.8 with vector [VSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:H/AT:N/PR:H/UI:A/VC:N/VI:N/VA:N/SC:L/SI:N/SA:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/4.0#CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:H/AT:N/PR:H/UI:A/VC:N/VI:N/VA:N/SC:L/SI:N/SA:N) Prior to the fix, the calendar event name was not sanitized on output. Users or groups with permission to create event calendars could embed scripts and users or groups with permission to modify event calendars could execute scripts. Thank you Yusuke Uchida for reporting HackerOne 2400810.
* Fixed [CVE-2024-8660](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-8660) Stored XSS in in the "Top Navigator Bar" block with commit [12128](https://github.com/concretecms/concretecms/pull/12128). The Concrete CMS Security Team gave this vulnerability a CVSS v4 score of 4.6 with vector [CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:H/UI:A/VC:N/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/4.0#CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:H/UI:A/VC:N/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N) Prior to the fix,a rogue admin could add a malicious payload. Since "Top Navigator Bar" output was not sufficiently sanitized, the payload could be executed when targeted users visited the home page. This does not affect Versons below 9 since they do not have the Top Navigation Bar Block. Thanks Chu Quoc Khanh for reporting HackerOne 2610205
* Fixed [CVE-2024-8661](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-8661) Stored XSS in the "Next&Previous Nav" block with commit [12204](https://github.com/concretecms/concretecms/pull/12204) for version 9 and with commit [ce5ee2ab83fe8de6fa012dd51c5a1dde05cb0dc4](https://github.com/concretecms/concretecms/commit/ce5ee2ab83fe8de6fa012dd51c5a1dde05cb0dc4) for version 8. The Concrete CMS Security Team gave this vulnerability a CVSS v4 score of 4.6 with vector [CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:H/UI:A/VC:N/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/4.0#CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:H/UI:A/VC:N/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N). Prior to the fix, a rogue admin could add a malicious payload. Since the "Next&Previous Nav" block output was not sufficiently sanitized, the malicious payload could be executed in the browsers of targeted users.

Users or groups with permission to create event calendars could embed scripts and users or groups with permission to modify event calendars could execute scripts. Thank you Yusuke Uchida for reporting HackerOne 2400810.
* Fixed [CVE-2024-8661](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-8661) Stored XSS in the "Next&Previous Nav" block with commit [12204](https://github.com/concretecms/concretecms/pull/12204) for version 9 and with commit [ce5ee2ab83fe8de6fa012dd51c5a1dde05cb0dc4](https://github.com/concretecms/concretecms/commit/ce5ee2ab83fe8de6fa012dd51c5a1dde05cb0dc4) for version 8.

Prior to the fix, a rogue admin could add a malicious payload. Since the "Next&Previous Nav" block output was not sufficiently sanitized, the malicious payload could be executed in the browsers of targeted users.

The Concrete CMS security team gave this vulnerability a CVSS 4.0 Score of 1.8 with vector: [CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:H/AT:N/PR:H/UI:A/VC:L/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/4.0#CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:H/AT:N/PR:H/UI:A/VC:L/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N). Versions below 9 are not affected.Thanks m3dium for reporting HackerOne 2486344.
* Show a more generic error message in RSS Displayer block if curl is unable to load posts. Thanks m3dium for recommending this in HackerOne 2479824
* Concrete v.9.3.3 now enforces the Secure Flag for the CONCRETE cookie if a login request is using https by default. This is in line with industry best practice. If a site is served over http:// and the guest uses http:// to log in, the CONCRETE cookie will not have the Secure flag applied so that the site is usable. Although the patch could not be applied cleanly to version 8, the Secure Flag setting can be configured via the dashboard. Since this is a configuration setting, no CVE is being issued.

# Concrete CMS Security Advisory 2023-04-20

Apr 20, 2023

There have been a number of medium and low security vulnerabilities that have been fixed in version 9 through 9.2. Thanks so much to all the community members who report vulnerabilities following the process outlined on https://www.concretecms.org/security so that they can be triaged and remediated!

Please note that CVE-2022-46464 was NOT created by the Concrete CMS team. After finding out about the CVE and investigating, our security team has determined that it is not a valid vulnerability. We have informed MITRE to have it recalled.

We have obtained the following new Concrete CMS CVEs to advise the community of validated weaknesses in previous versions.

CVE-2023-28477

Concrete CMS (previously concrete5) below 9.2 is vulnerable to stored XSS on API Integrations via the name parameter. Prior to the fix, while adding API Integrations on Concrete CMS, the parameter name accepted special characters enabling malicious JavaScript payloads impacting /dashboard/system/api/integrations and /dashboard/system/api/integrations/view\_client/unique-id. Concrete CMS Security team scored this 5.5 with CVSS v3.1 vector AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N. Thanks Veshraj Ghimire for reporting H1 1753684 and providing the fix.

CVE-2023-28476

Concrete CMS (previously concrete5) below 9.2 is vulnerable to Stored XSS on Tags. Prior to fix there was no sanitation when adding tags on uploaded files. Concrete CMS Security team scored this 4.5 with CVSS v3.1 vector [AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N&version=3.1). Thanks Veshraj Ghimire and Ashim Chapagain for reporting H1#1767949 and providing the fix.

CVE-2023-28475

Concrete CMS (previously concrete5) below 9.2 is vulnerable to Reflected XSS on the Reply form since msgID was not sanitized. Concrete CMS Security team scored this 4.2 with CVSS v3.1 vector [AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N.](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N&version=3.1) Thanks Bogdan Tiron from Fortbridge for reporting H1 1772092.

CVE-2023-28474

Concrete CMS (previously concrete5) below 9.2 is vulnerable to Stored XSS on Saved Preset. Prior to fix, there was no sanitation when saving presets on search. Concrete CMS Security team scored this 3.5 with CVSS v3.1 vector [AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N&version=3.1) Thanks Veshraj Ghimire for reporting H1 [1768494](https://hackerone.com/reports/1768494)

CVE-2023-28472

Concrete CMS Security team scored this 3.4 with CVSS v3.1 vector [AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N&version=3.1) .

CVE-2023-28473

Concrete CMS (previously concrete5) below 9.2 is vulnerable to possible Auth bypass in the jobs section. Concrete CMS Security team scored this 2.2 with CVSS v3.1 vector [AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N&version=3.1) Thanks Adrian Tiron from Fortbridge for Reporting H1 1772230
