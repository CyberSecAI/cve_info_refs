### [`v0.4.2`](https://togithub.com/total-typescript/ts-reset/releases/tag/v0.4.2)

#### 0.4.2

##### Minor Changes

-   [`ce9db42`](https://togithub.com/total-typescript/ts-reset/commit/ce9db42): Added support for widening in `Array.lastIndexOf`, `Array.indexOf`, `ReadonlyArray.lastIndexOf` and `ReadonlyArray.indexOf`.

-   [`107dfc2`](https://togithub.com/total-typescript/ts-reset/commit/107dfc2): Changed the array.includes on readonly arrays to NOT be a type predicate. Before this change, this perfectly valid code would not behave correctly.

    ```ts
    type Code = 0 | 1 | 2;
    type SpecificCode = 0 | 1;

    const currentCode: Code = 0;

    // Create an empty list of subset type
    const specificCodeList: ReadonlyArray<SpecificCode> = [];

    // This will be false, since 0 is not in []
    if (specificCodeList.includes(currentCode)) {
      currentCode; // -> SpecificCode
    } else {
      // This branch will be entered, and ts will think z is 2, when it is actually 0
      currentCode; // -> 2
    }
    ```

    Removing the type predicate brings ts-reset closer towards correctness.

-   [`4765413`](https://togithub.com/total-typescript/ts-reset/commit/4765413): author: [@&#8203;mefechoel](https://togithub.com/mefechoel)

    Added the `Map.has` rule.

    Similar to `.includes` or `Set.has()`, `Map.has()` doesn't let you pass members that don't exist in the map's keys:

    ```ts
    // BEFORE
    const userMap = new Map([
      [\"matt\", 0],
      [\"sofia\", 1],
      [2, \"waqas\"],
    ] as const);

    // Argument of type '\"bryan\"' is not assignable to
    // parameter of type '\"matt\" | \"sofia\" | \"waqas\"'.
    userMap.has(\"bryan\");
    ```

    With the rule enabled, `Map` follows the same semantics as `Set`.

    ```ts
    // AFTER
    import \"@&#8203;total-typescript/ts-reset/map-has\";

    const userMap = new Map([
      [\"matt\", 0],
      [\"sofia\", 1],
      [2, \"waqas\"],
    ] as const);

    // .has now takes a string as the argument!
    userMap.has(\"bryan\");
    ```

##### Patch Changes

-   [`b15aaa4`](https://togithub.com/total-typescript/ts-reset/commit/b15aaa4): Fixed an oversight with the initial `set-has` implementation by adding support to `ReadonlySet`.

### [`v0.4.1`](https://togithub.com/total-typescript/ts-reset/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;041)

##### Patch Changes

-   No changes, just pushing to fix the previous slightly borked release.

### [`v0.4.0`](https://togithub.com/total-typescript/ts-reset/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;040)

##### Minor Changes

-   [`ce9db42`](https://togithub.com/total-typescript/ts-reset/commit/ce9db42): Added support for widening in `Array.lastIndexOf`, `Array.indexOf`, `ReadonlyArray.lastIndexOf` and `ReadonlyArray.indexOf`.

    // This will be false, since 0 is not in []
    if (specificCodeList.includes(currentCode)) {
      currentCode; // -> SpecificCode
    } else {
      // This branch will be entered, and ts will think z is 2, when it is actually 0
      currentCode; // -> 2
    }

### [`v0.4.2`](https://togithub.com/total-typescript/ts-reset/releases/tag/v0.4.2)

#### 0.4.2

##### Minor Changes

-   [`ce9db42`](https://togithub.com/total-typescript/ts-reset/commit/ce9db42): Added support for widening in `Array.lastIndexOf`, `Array.indexOf`, `ReadonlyArray.lastIndexOf` and `ReadonlyArray.indexOf`.

-   [`107dfc2`](https://togithub.com/total-typescript/ts-reset/commit/107dfc2): Changed the array.includes on readonly arrays to NOT be a type predicate. Before this change, this perfectly valid code would not behave correctly.

    ```ts
    type Code = 0 | 1 | 2;
    type SpecificCode = 0 | 1;

    const currentCode: Code = 0;

    // Create an empty list of subset type
    const specificCodeList: ReadonlyArray<SpecificCode> = [];

    // This will be false, since 0 is not in []
    if (specificCodeList.includes(currentCode)) {
      currentCode; // -> SpecificCode
    } else {
      // This branch will be entered, and ts will think z is 2, when it is actually 0
      currentCode; // -> 2
    }
    ```

    Removing the type predicate brings ts-reset closer towards correctness.

-   [`4765413`](https://togithub.com/total-typescript/ts-reset/commit/4765413): author: [@&#8203;mefechoel](https://togithub.com/mefechoel)

    Added the `Map.has` rule.

    Similar to `.includes` or `Set.has()`, `Map.has()` doesn't let you pass members that don't exist in the map's keys:

    ```ts
    // BEFORE
    const userMap = new Map([
      [\"matt\", 0],
      [\"sofia\", 1],
      [2, \"waqas\"],
    ] as const);

    // Argument of type '\"bryan\"' is not assignable to
    // parameter of type '\"matt\" | \"sofia\" | \"waqas\"'.
    userMap.has(\"bryan\");
    ```

    With the rule enabled, `Map` follows the same semantics as `Set`.

    ```ts
    // AFTER
    import \"@&#8203;total-typescript/ts-reset/map-has\";

    const userMap = new Map([
      [\"matt\", 0],
      [\"sofia\", 1],
      [2, \"waqas\"],
    ] as const);

    // .has now takes a string as the argument!
    userMap.has(\"bryan\");
    ```

##### Patch Changes

-   [`b15aaa4`](https://togithub.com/total-typescript/ts-reset/commit/b15aaa4): Fixed an oversight with the initial `set-has` implementation by adding support to `ReadonlySet`.

### [`v0.4.1`](https://togithub.com/total-typescript/ts-reset/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;041)

##### Patch Changes

-   No changes, just pushing to fix the previous slightly borked release.

### [`v0.4.0`](https://togithub.com/total-typescript/ts-reset/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;040)

##### Minor Changes

-   [`ce9db42`](https://togithub.com/total-typescript/ts-reset/commit/ce9db42): Added support for widening in `Array.lastIndexOf`, `Array.indexOf`, `ReadonlyArray.lastIndexOf` and `ReadonlyArray.indexOf`.

    // Create an empty list of subset type
    const specificCodeList: ReadonlyArray<SpecificCode> = [];

    // This will be false, since 0 is not in []
    if (specificCodeList.includes(currentCode)) {
      currentCode; // -> SpecificCode
    } else {
      // This branch will be entered, and ts will think z is 2, when it is actually 0
      currentCode; // -> 2
    }
    ```

<summary>total-typescript/ts-reset</summary>

### [`v0.4.2`](<https://togithub.com/total-typescript/ts-reset/releases/tag/v0.4.2>)

#### 0.4.2

##### Minor Changes

-   [`ce9db42`](<https://togithub.com/total-typescript/ts-reset/commit/ce9db42>): Added support for widening in `Array.lastIndexOf`, `Array.indexOf`, `ReadonlyArray.lastIndexOf` and `ReadonlyArray.indexOf`.

-   [`107dfc2`](<https://togithub.com/total-typescript/ts-reset/commit/107dfc2>): Changed the array.includes on readonly arrays to NOT be a type predicate. Before this change, this perfectly valid code would not behave correctly.

    ```ts
    type Code = 0 | 1 | 2;
    type SpecificCode = 0 | 1;

    const currentCode: Code = 0;

    // Create an empty list of subset type
    const specificCodeList: ReadonlyArray<SpecificCode> = [];

    // This will be false, since 0 is not in []
    if (specificCodeList.includes(currentCode)) {
      currentCode; // -> SpecificCode
    } else {
      // This branch will be entered, and ts will think z is 2, when it is actually 0
      currentCode; // -> 2
    }
    ```

    Removing the type predicate brings ts-reset closer towards correctness.

-   [`4765413`](<https://togithub.com/total-typescript/ts-reset/commit/4765413>): author: [@&#8203;mefechoel](<https://togithub.com/mefechoel>)

    Added the `Map.has` rule.

    Similar to `.includes` or `Set.has()`, `Map.has()` doesn't let you pass members that don't exist in the map's keys:

    ```ts
    // BEFORE
    const userMap = new Map([
      ["matt", 0],
      ["sofia", 1],
      [2, "waqas"],
    ] as const);

    // Argument of type '"bryan"' is not assignable to
    // parameter of type '"matt" | "sofia" | "waqas"'.
    userMap.has("bryan");
    ```

    With the rule enabled, `Map` follows the same semantics as `Set`.

    ```ts
    // AFTER
    import "@&#8203;total-typescript/ts-reset/map-has";

    const userMap = new Map([
      ["matt", 0],
      ["sofia", 1],
      [2, "waqas"],
    ] as const);

    // .has now takes a string as the argument!
    userMap.has("bryan");
    ```

##### Patch Changes

-   [`b15aaa4`](<https://togithub.com/total-typescript/ts-reset/commit/b15aaa4>): Fixed an oversight with the initial `set-has` implementation by adding support to `ReadonlySet`.

### [`v0.4.1`](<https://togithub.com/total-typescript/ts-reset/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;041>)

##### Patch Changes

-   No changes, just pushing to fix the previous slightly borked release.

### [`v0.4.0`](<https://togithub.com/total-typescript/ts-reset/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;040>)

##### Minor Changes

-   [`ce9db42`](<https://togithub.com/total-typescript/ts-reset/commit/ce9db42>): Added support for widening in `Array.lastIndexOf`, `Array.indexOf`, `ReadonlyArray.lastIndexOf` and `ReadonlyArray.indexOf`.

-   [`107dfc2`](<https://togithub.com/total-typescript/ts-reset/commit/107dfc2>): Changed the array.includes on readonly arrays to NOT be a type predicate. Before this change, this perfectly valid code would not behave correctly.

    ```ts
    type Code = 0 | 1 | 2;
    type SpecificCode = 0 | 1;

    const currentCode: Code = 0;

    // Create an empty list of subset type
    const specificCodeList: ReadonlyArray<SpecificCode> = [];

    // This will be false, since 0 is not in []
    if (specificCodeList.includes(currentCode)) {
      currentCode; // -> SpecificCode
    } else {
      // This branch will be entered, and ts will think z is 2, when it is actually 0
      currentCode; // -> 2
    }
    ```

    Removing the type predicate brings ts-reset closer towards correctness.

-   [`4765413`](<https://togithub.com/total-typescript/ts-reset/commit/4765413>): author: [@&#8203;mefechoel](<https://togithub.com/mefechoel>)

    Added the `Map.has` rule.

    Similar to `.includes` or `Set.has()`, `Map.has()` doesn't let you pass members that don't exist in the map's keys:

    ```ts
    // BEFORE
    const userMap = new Map([
      ["matt", 0],
      ["sofia", 1],
      [2, "waqas"],
    ] as const);

    // Argument of type '"bryan"' is not assignable to
    // parameter of type '"matt" | "sofia" | "waqas"'.
    userMap.has("bryan");
    ```

    With the rule enabled, `Map` follows the same semantics as `Set`.

    ```ts
    // AFTER
    import "@&#8203;total-typescript/ts-reset/map-has";

    const userMap = new Map([
      ["matt", 0],
      ["sofia", 1],
      [2, "waqas"],
    ] as const);

    // .has now takes a string as the argument!
    userMap.has("bryan");
    ```

##### Patch Changes

-   [`b15aaa4`](<https://togithub.com/total-typescript/ts-reset/commit/b15aaa4>): Fixed an oversight with the initial `set-has` implementation by adding support to `ReadonlySet`.

| webpack has a feature called [magic comment](https://webpack.js.org/api/module-methods/#magic-comments), it looks like this:  ``` import(   /* webpackChunkName: "my-chunk-name" */   /* webpackMode: "lazy" */   /* webpackExports: ["default", "named"] */   'module' ); ```  This comment can be any arbitrary JavaScript code. It accepts strings, arrays, and RegExp, here is where we dive in. Note: I'll reference the commit before this PR.  Webpack executes the magic comment using the [Node's vm](https://nodejs.org/api/vm.html) module.   [webpack/lib/javascript/JavascriptParser.js](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/7e8260a86cc3b8183dd76572981f7aa5f1b485ee/lib/javascript/JavascriptParser.js#L3644)  Line 3644 in [7e8260a](/webpack/webpack/commit/7e8260a86cc3b8183dd76572981f7aa5f1b485ee)   |  | const val = vm.runInNewContext(`(function(){return {${value}};})()`); | | --- | --- |      This is very subtle and easy to make a fragile "sandbox" and webpack actually made a mistake here.   [webpack/lib/dependencies/ImportParserPlugin.js](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/7e8260a86cc3b8183dd76572981f7aa5f1b485ee/lib/dependencies/ImportParserPlugin.js#L172-L174)  Lines 172 to 174 in [7e8260a](/webpack/webpack/commit/7e8260a86cc3b8183dd76572981f7aa5f1b485ee)   |  | importOptions.webpackExports.every( | | --- | --- | |  | item => typeof item === "string" | |  | )) |      Here it access "every" property from an untrusted object and passes a function in. By crafting the following code, we can get access to the real global object:  ``` const source = import(/* webpackExports: ((() => {     const array = ["a"]     array.every = function (fun) {         //                  ~~~ provided by webpack         const realGlobalThis = fun.constructor('return this')()         //                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ the real Function         const require = realGlobalThis.process.mainModule.constructor.createRequire(realGlobalThis.process.argv[1])         //    ~~~~~~~ full power! now we can do anything we want.         const fs = require("fs")         const path = require("path")         fs.writeFileSync(path.join(realGlobalThis.process.cwd(), "test.txt"), "oops")         return Reflect.apply(Array.prototype.every, array, [fun])     }     return array })()) */ './next.js') ```  This PR ensures values from the VM are being sanitized by `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(val))`. It's still possible to hang the compiler forever by writing the following code, but it's less dangerous.  ``` const source = import(/* webpackExports: ((() => {     while (true) {} })()) */ './next.js') ``` |

| [@akcsi](https://github.com/akcsi) Not really, I wouldn't say it's a vulnerability - you shouldn't build code that you don't trust, for example - val-loader, some plugins and loaders execute code, even `require("./code-to-be-executed.js!")` will be a problem if you run it on untrusted code... |

| [@alexander-akait](https://github.com/alexander-akait) Thank you for this answer. Can it at least be said that using webpack 4 has the same risk as webpack <5.76.0 regarding this security issue ? |

| Good find [@Jack-Works](https://github.com/Jack-Works) !  From an exploitability perspective, does this only affect build process / machine / runner? My interpretation of the above is that an attacker would have to submit malicious input into the repo / CI/CD and it would only get executed at build time, on the build machine / runner. After webpack runs, the remaining static js bundles would not include any malicious code, right?  I noticed that your CVE was scored with network attack vector in NVD. <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28154> Can you help us understand where an attacker needs to be to exploit this? Did you select network because an attacker can submit code to github? The exploit would only be triggered by existing build process on the build machine / runner, right? |

This attack requires the code compiled is already malicious (therefore the output may not be clean already). Yes, it only attacks the builder, but the developer's computer is also a builder.  Did you select network because an attacker can submit code to github? The exploit would only be triggered by existing build process on the build machine / runner, right?  Yes. Yes. |

### GitHub Vulnerability Alerts

#### [CVE-2023-28154](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28154)

Webpack 5 before 5.76.0 does not avoid cross-realm object access. ImportParserPlugin.js mishandles the magic comment feature. An attacker who controls a property of an untrusted object can obtain access to the real global object.

### Bugfixes

-   fix handling of build dependencies with `#` in path

### Performance

-   improve memory usage when using the filesystem cache

> When reading a file into a Buffer and picking smaller slices of the Buffer
> the small slices still keep a reference to the large original Buffer.
> The leads to increased memory usage. A fix would be to clone the slice into
> a smaller Buffer when wasting too much memory, but this has a performance cost.
> There is now a new option `cache.allowCollectingMemory` which controls that.
> For one-off builds you probably want `allowCollectingMemory: false` and
> for watch builds you probably want `allowCollectingMemory: true`.
> It defaults to false in production mode and true in development mode.

### Features

-   add a few more options for infrastructure logging:
    -   `infrastructureLogging.colors`: Enables/Disables colorful output.
    -   `infrastructureLogging.appendOnly`: Only appends lines to the output. Avoids updating existing output e. g. for status messages.
    -   `infrastructureLogging.stream`: Stream used for logging output. Defaults to process.stderr.
    -   `infrastructureLogging.console`: Custom console used for logging.

### Bugfixes

-   fix handling of build dependencies with `#` in path

### Performance

-   improve memory usage when using the filesystem cache

> When reading a file into a Buffer and picking smaller slices of the Buffer
> the small slices still keep a reference to the large original Buffer.
> The leads to increased memory usage. A fix would be to clone the slice into
> a smaller Buffer when wasting too much memory, but this has a performance cost.
> There is now a new option `cache.allowCollectingMemory` which controls that.
> For one-off builds you probably want `allowCollectingMemory: false` and
> for watch builds you probably want `allowCollectingMemory: true`.
> It defaults to false in production mode and true in development mode.

### Bugfixes

-   fix handling of build dependencies with `#` in path

### Performance

-   improve memory usage when using the filesystem cache

> When reading a file into a Buffer and picking smaller slices of the Buffer
> the small slices still keep a reference to the large original Buffer.
> The leads to increased memory usage. A fix would be to clone the slice into
> a smaller Buffer when wasting too much memory, but this has a performance cost.
> There is now a new option `cache.allowCollectingMemory` which controls that.
> For one-off builds you probably want `allowCollectingMemory: false` and
> for watch builds you probably want `allowCollectingMemory: true`.
> It defaults to false in production mode and true in development mode.

## Cross-realm object access in Webpack 5

Critical severity

GitHub Reviewed

Published
Mar 13, 2023
to the GitHub Advisory Database
•
Updated Oct 30, 2023

[Vulnerability details](/advisories/GHSA-hc6q-2mpp-qw7j)
[Dependabot alerts
0](/advisories/GHSA-hc6q-2mpp-qw7j/dependabot)

## Package

npm

webpack
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

>= 5.0.0, < 5.76.0

## Patched versions

5.76.0

## Description

Webpack 5 before 5.76.0 does not avoid cross-realm object access. ImportParserPlugin.js mishandles the magic comment feature. An attacker who controls a property of an untrusted object can obtain access to the real global object.

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.

GeneralPlans & PricingPrivacyResponsible AI
### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.

# Merge Confidence[¶](#merge-confidence "Permanent link")

Look at the Merge Confidence badges before merging to:

* Prevent updates which break in production
* See at a glance if you should update

Merge Confidence finds and flags undeclared breaking releases.
It analyzes test and release adoption data from the Mend Renovate App users.

![Renovate PR with Merge Confidence badges](../assets/images/merge-confidence.png)

## Pull request badges[¶](#pull-request-badges "Permanent link")

Merge Confidence adds the following badges to your pull requests:

* **Age**: The age of the package
* **Adoption**: The percentage of this package's users (within Renovate) which are using this release
* **Passing**: The percentage of updates which have passing tests for this package
* **Confidence**: The confidence level for this update

## Supported platforms[¶](#supported-platforms "Permanent link")

Merge Confidence badges for pull requests are available on any supported platform or Renovate distribution, including Mend Remediate.

## Supported languages[¶](#supported-languages "Permanent link")

Renovate will show Merge Confidence badges for these languages:

| Language | Datasource |
| --- | --- |
| Golang | `go` |
| JavaScript | `npm` |
| Java | `maven` |
| Python | `pypi` |
| .NET | `nuget` |
| PHP | `packagist` |
| Ruby | `rubygems` |

We plan to support more languages soon.

## Enabling and disabling[¶](#enabling-and-disabling "Permanent link")

If you use the Mend Renovate App then the badges are enabled automatically.

If you're self-hosting Renovate, you can enable the badges by adding the `mergeConfidence:all-badges` preset to the `extends` array in your Renovate config:

```
{
  "extends": ["mergeConfidence:all-badges"]
}

```

Note

The `mergeConfidence:age-confidence-badges` preset can be used to only show the Age and Confidence badges.

If you want to disable the badges in the Mend Renovate App, add the `mergeConfidence:all-badges` preset to the `ignorePresets` array in your config:

```
{
  "ignorePresets": ["mergeConfidence:all-badges"]
}

```
## Confidence levels and their meaning[¶](#confidence-levels-and-their-meaning "Permanent link")

Merge Confidence uses the following confidence levels:

* **Low**: We think the update contains breaking changes. Often this is expected because it's a `major` version update, but updates can have unknown breaking changes
* **Neutral**: We don't have enough data about the update, or we can't decide if the update should be Low or High confidence
* **High**: We rank updates as High confidence when the combination of `Age`, `Adoption` and `Passing` tests means there's a very low chance of breaking changes
* **Very High**: We only use this for updates which are months old and have either high `Adoption` or have very high test `Passing` scores

## How it works[¶](#how-it-works "Permanent link")

The Mend Renovate App created millions of pull requests on `github.com` to help developers update their dependencies since 2017.
We bundle and analyze metrics such as package `Age`, package `Adoption`, and `Passing` tests.
This way we can find packages that have undeclared breaking changes.

### Algorithm[¶](#algorithm "Permanent link")

The algorithm that decides on the values is private and is not something we plan to share.
Similar to a search engine's algorithm, we plan to adjust and improve it over time, for example by using historical data to set a baseline confidence level for packages.

### Data[¶](#data "Permanent link")

We plan to expose much more of the data via a companion website, such as number of users of a package and popular repositories which already updated to the version in question.

## Explanations[¶](#explanations "Permanent link")

### Package ranking[¶](#package-ranking "Permanent link")

npm packages less than three days old can be [unpublished](https://docs.npmjs.com/policies/unpublish), which can result in a service impact if you have updated to a package that gets unpublished.
This is why npm packages can only get the **High** Confidence badge when they are at least three days old.

### Percentage values weighting[¶](#percentage-values-weighting "Permanent link")

The percentages for `Adoption` and `Passing` are weighted towards Organizations, private repositories, and projects with high test reliability.
This means those values aren't *raw* percentages.

## Questions and feedback[¶](#questions-and-feedback "Permanent link")

You are invited to [start a discussion](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/discussions/new/choose) if you have anything you'd like to discuss.

### [`v0.4.2`](https://togithub.com/total-typescript/ts-reset/releases/tag/v0.4.2)

#### 0.4.2

##### Minor Changes

-   [`ce9db42`](https://togithub.com/total-typescript/ts-reset/commit/ce9db42): Added support for widening in `Array.lastIndexOf`, `Array.indexOf`, `ReadonlyArray.lastIndexOf` and `ReadonlyArray.indexOf`.

-   [`107dfc2`](https://togithub.com/total-typescript/ts-reset/commit/107dfc2): Changed the array.includes on readonly arrays to NOT be a type predicate. Before this change, this perfectly valid code would not behave correctly.

    ```ts
    type Code = 0 | 1 | 2;
    type SpecificCode = 0 | 1;

    const currentCode: Code = 0;

    // Create an empty list of subset type
    const specificCodeList: ReadonlyArray<SpecificCode> = [];

    // This will be false, since 0 is not in []
    if (specificCodeList.includes(currentCode)) {
      currentCode; // -> SpecificCode
    } else {
      // This branch will be entered, and ts will think z is 2, when it is actually 0
      currentCode; // -> 2
    }
    ```

    Removing the type predicate brings ts-reset closer towards correctness.

-   [`4765413`](https://togithub.com/total-typescript/ts-reset/commit/4765413): author: [@&#8203;mefechoel](https://togithub.com/mefechoel)

    Added the `Map.has` rule.

    Similar to `.includes` or `Set.has()`, `Map.has()` doesn't let you pass members that don't exist in the map's keys:

    ```ts
    // BEFORE
    const userMap = new Map([
      [\"matt\", 0],
      [\"sofia\", 1],
      [2, \"waqas\"],
    ] as const);

    // Argument of type '\"bryan\"' is not assignable to
    // parameter of type '\"matt\" | \"sofia\" | \"waqas\"'.
    userMap.has(\"bryan\");
    ```

    With the rule enabled, `Map` follows the same semantics as `Set`.

    ```ts
    // AFTER
    import \"@&#8203;total-typescript/ts-reset/map-has\";

    const userMap = new Map([
      [\"matt\", 0],
      [\"sofia\", 1],
      [2, \"waqas\"],
    ] as const);

    // .has now takes a string as the argument!
    userMap.has(\"bryan\");
    ```

##### Patch Changes

-   [`b15aaa4`](https://togithub.com/total-typescript/ts-reset/commit/b15aaa4): Fixed an oversight with the initial `set-has` implementation by adding support to `ReadonlySet`.

### [`v0.4.1`](https://togithub.com/total-typescript/ts-reset/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;041)

##### Patch Changes

-   No changes, just pushing to fix the previous slightly borked release.

### [`v0.4.0`](https://togithub.com/total-typescript/ts-reset/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;040)

##### Minor Changes

    // This will be false, since 0 is not in []
    if (specificCodeList.includes(currentCode)) {
      currentCode; // -> SpecificCode
    } else {
      // This branch will be entered, and ts will think z is 2, when it is actually 0
      currentCode; // -> 2
    }
    ```

### [`v0.4.2`](https://togithub.com/total-typescript/ts-reset/releases/tag/v0.4.2)

#### 0.4.2

##### Minor Changes

-   [`ce9db42`](https://togithub.com/total-typescript/ts-reset/commit/ce9db42): Added support for widening in `Array.lastIndexOf`, `Array.indexOf`, `ReadonlyArray.lastIndexOf` and `ReadonlyArray.indexOf`.

-   [`107dfc2`](https://togithub.com/total-typescript/ts-reset/commit/107dfc2): Changed the array.includes on readonly arrays to NOT be a type predicate. Before this change, this perfectly valid code would not behave correctly.

    ```ts
    type Code = 0 | 1 | 2;
    type SpecificCode = 0 | 1;

    const currentCode: Code = 0;

    // Create an empty list of subset type
    const specificCodeList: ReadonlyArray<SpecificCode> = [];

    // This will be false, since 0 is not in []
    if (specificCodeList.includes(currentCode)) {
      currentCode; // -> SpecificCode
    } else {
      // This branch will be entered, and ts will think z is 2, when it is actually 0
      currentCode; // -> 2
    }
    ```

    Removing the type predicate brings ts-reset closer towards correctness.

-   [`4765413`](https://togithub.com/total-typescript/ts-reset/commit/4765413): author: [@&#8203;mefechoel](https://togithub.com/mefechoel)

    Added the `Map.has` rule.

    Similar to `.includes` or `Set.has()`, `Map.has()` doesn't let you pass members that don't exist in the map's keys:

    ```ts
    // BEFORE
    const userMap = new Map([
      [\"matt\", 0],
      [\"sofia\", 1],
      [2, \"waqas\"],
    ] as const);

    // Argument of type '\"bryan\"' is not assignable to
    // parameter of type '\"matt\" | \"sofia\" | \"waqas\"'.
    userMap.has(\"bryan\");
    ```

    With the rule enabled, `Map` follows the same semantics as `Set`.

    ```ts
    // AFTER
    import \"@&#8203;total-typescript/ts-reset/map-has\";

    const userMap = new Map([
      [\"matt\", 0],
      [\"sofia\", 1],
      [2, \"waqas\"],
    ] as const);

    // .has now takes a string as the argument!
    userMap.has(\"bryan\");
    ```

##### Patch Changes

-   [`b15aaa4`](https://togithub.com/total-typescript/ts-reset/commit/b15aaa4): Fixed an oversight with the initial `set-has` implementation by adding support to `ReadonlySet`.

### [`v0.4.1`](https://togithub.com/total-typescript/ts-reset/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;041)

##### Patch Changes

-   No changes, just pushing to fix the previous slightly borked release.

    } else {
      // This branch will be entered, and ts will think z is 2, when it is actually 0

<summary>total-typescript/ts-reset</summary>

### [`v0.4.2`](<https://togithub.com/total-typescript/ts-reset/releases/tag/v0.4.2>)

#### 0.4.2

##### Minor Changes

-   [`ce9db42`](<https://togithub.com/total-typescript/ts-reset/commit/ce9db42>): Added support for widening in `Array.lastIndexOf`, `Array.indexOf`, `ReadonlyArray.lastIndexOf` and `ReadonlyArray.indexOf`.

-   [`107dfc2`](<https://togithub.com/total-typescript/ts-reset/commit/107dfc2>): Changed the array.includes on readonly arrays to NOT be a type predicate. Before this change, this perfectly valid code would not behave correctly.

    ```ts
    type Code = 0 | 1 | 2;
    type SpecificCode = 0 | 1;

    const currentCode: Code = 0;

    // Create an empty list of subset type
    const specificCodeList: ReadonlyArray<SpecificCode> = [];

    // This will be false, since 0 is not in []
    if (specificCodeList.includes(currentCode)) {
      currentCode; // -> SpecificCode
    } else {
      // This branch will be entered, and ts will think z is 2, when it is actually 0
      currentCode; // -> 2
    }
    ```

    Removing the type predicate brings ts-reset closer towards correctness.

-   [`4765413`](<https://togithub.com/total-typescript/ts-reset/commit/4765413>): author: [@&#8203;mefechoel](<https://togithub.com/mefechoel>)

    Added the `Map.has` rule.

    Similar to `.includes` or `Set.has()`, `Map.has()` doesn't let you pass members that don't exist in the map's keys:

    ```ts
    // BEFORE
    const userMap = new Map([
      ["matt", 0],
      ["sofia", 1],
      [2, "waqas"],
    ] as const);

    // Argument of type '"bryan"' is not assignable to
    // parameter of type '"matt" | "sofia" | "waqas"'.
    userMap.has("bryan");
    ```

    With the rule enabled, `Map` follows the same semantics as `Set`.

    ```ts
    // AFTER
    import "@&#8203;total-typescript/ts-reset/map-has";

    const userMap = new Map([
      ["matt", 0],
      ["sofia", 1],
      [2, "waqas"],
    ] as const);

    // .has now takes a string as the argument!
    userMap.has("bryan");
    ```

##### Patch Changes

-   [`b15aaa4`](<https://togithub.com/total-typescript/ts-reset/commit/b15aaa4>): Fixed an oversight with the initial `set-has` implementation by adding support to `ReadonlySet`.

### [`v0.4.1`](<https://togithub.com/total-typescript/ts-reset/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;041>)

##### Patch Changes

-   No changes, just pushing to fix the previous slightly borked release.

### [`v0.4.0`](<https://togithub.com/total-typescript/ts-reset/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;040>)

##### Minor Changes

-   [`ce9db42`](<https://togithub.com/total-typescript/ts-reset/commit/ce9db42>): Added support for widening in `Array.lastIndexOf`, `Array.indexOf`, `ReadonlyArray.lastIndexOf` and `ReadonlyArray.indexOf`.

-   [`107dfc2`](<https://togithub.com/total-typescript/ts-reset/commit/107dfc2>): Changed the array.includes on readonly arrays to NOT be a type predicate. Before this change, this perfectly valid code would not behave correctly.

    ```ts
    type Code = 0 | 1 | 2;
    type SpecificCode = 0 | 1;

    const currentCode: Code = 0;

    // Create an empty list of subset type
    const specificCodeList: ReadonlyArray<SpecificCode> = [];

    // This will be false, since 0 is not in []
    if (specificCodeList.includes(currentCode)) {
      currentCode; // -> SpecificCode
    } else {
      // This branch will be entered, and ts will think z is 2, when it is actually 0
      currentCode; // -> 2
    }
    ```

    Removing the type predicate brings ts-reset closer towards correctness.

    Added the `Map.has` rule.

    Similar to `.includes` or `Set.has()`, `Map.has()` doesn't let you pass members that don't exist in the map's keys:

    ```ts
    // BEFORE
    const userMap = new Map([
      ["matt", 0],
      ["sofia", 1],
      [2, "waqas"],
    ] as const);

    // Argument of type '"bryan"' is not assignable to
    // parameter of type '"matt" | "sofia" | "waqas"'.
    userMap.has("bryan");
    ```

    With the rule enabled, `Map` follows the same semantics as `Set`.

    ```ts
    // AFTER
    import "@&#8203;total-typescript/ts-reset/map-has";

    const userMap = new Map([
      ["matt", 0],
      ["sofia", 1],
      [2, "waqas"],
    ] as const);

    // .has now takes a string as the argument!
    userMap.has("bryan");
    ```

##### Patch Changes

-   [`b15aaa4`](<https://togithub.com/total-typescript/ts-reset/commit/b15aaa4>): Fixed an oversight with the initial `set-has` implementation by adding support to `ReadonlySet`.

| webpack has a feature called [magic comment](https://webpack.js.org/api/module-methods/#magic-comments), it looks like this:  ``` import(   /* webpackChunkName: "my-chunk-name" */   /* webpackMode: "lazy" */   /* webpackExports: ["default", "named"] */   'module' ); ```  This comment can be any arbitrary JavaScript code. It accepts strings, arrays, and RegExp, here is where we dive in. Note: I'll reference the commit before this PR.  Webpack executes the magic comment using the [Node's vm](https://nodejs.org/api/vm.html) module.   [webpack/lib/javascript/JavascriptParser.js](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/7e8260a86cc3b8183dd76572981f7aa5f1b485ee/lib/javascript/JavascriptParser.js#L3644)  Line 3644 in [7e8260a](/webpack/webpack/commit/7e8260a86cc3b8183dd76572981f7aa5f1b485ee)   |  | const val = vm.runInNewContext(`(function(){return {${value}};})()`); | | --- | --- |      This is very subtle and easy to make a fragile "sandbox" and webpack actually made a mistake here.   [webpack/lib/dependencies/ImportParserPlugin.js](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/7e8260a86cc3b8183dd76572981f7aa5f1b485ee/lib/dependencies/ImportParserPlugin.js#L172-L174)  Lines 172 to 174 in [7e8260a](/webpack/webpack/commit/7e8260a86cc3b8183dd76572981f7aa5f1b485ee)   |  | importOptions.webpackExports.every( | | --- | --- | |  | item => typeof item === "string" | |  | )) |      Here it access "every" property from an untrusted object and passes a function in. By crafting the following code, we can get access to the real global object:  ``` const source = import(/* webpackExports: ((() => {     const array = ["a"]     array.every = function (fun) {         //                  ~~~ provided by webpack         const realGlobalThis = fun.constructor('return this')()         //                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ the real Function         const require = realGlobalThis.process.mainModule.constructor.createRequire(realGlobalThis.process.argv[1])         //    ~~~~~~~ full power! now we can do anything we want.         const fs = require("fs")         const path = require("path")         fs.writeFileSync(path.join(realGlobalThis.process.cwd(), "test.txt"), "oops")         return Reflect.apply(Array.prototype.every, array, [fun])     }     return array })()) */ './next.js') ```  This PR ensures values from the VM are being sanitized by `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(val))`. It's still possible to hang the compiler forever by writing the following code, but it's less dangerous.  ``` const source = import(/* webpackExports: ((() => {     while (true) {} })()) */ './next.js') ``` |

| [@akcsi](https://github.com/akcsi) Not really, I wouldn't say it's a vulnerability - you shouldn't build code that you don't trust, for example - val-loader, some plugins and loaders execute code, even `require("./code-to-be-executed.js!")` will be a problem if you run it on untrusted code... |

| [@alexander-akait](https://github.com/alexander-akait) Thank you for this answer. Can it at least be said that using webpack 4 has the same risk as webpack <5.76.0 regarding this security issue ? |

| Good find [@Jack-Works](https://github.com/Jack-Works) !  From an exploitability perspective, does this only affect build process / machine / runner? My interpretation of the above is that an attacker would have to submit malicious input into the repo / CI/CD and it would only get executed at build time, on the build machine / runner. After webpack runs, the remaining static js bundles would not include any malicious code, right?  I noticed that your CVE was scored with network attack vector in NVD. <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28154> Can you help us understand where an attacker needs to be to exploit this? Did you select network because an attacker can submit code to github? The exploit would only be triggered by existing build process on the build machine / runner, right? |

This attack requires the code compiled is already malicious (therefore the output may not be clean already). Yes, it only attacks the builder, but the developer's computer is also a builder.  Did you select network because an attacker can submit code to github? The exploit would only be triggered by existing build process on the build machine / runner, right?  Yes. Yes. |

### GitHub Vulnerability Alerts

#### [CVE-2023-28154](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28154)

Webpack 5 before 5.76.0 does not avoid cross-realm object access. ImportParserPlugin.js mishandles the magic comment feature. An attacker who controls a property of an untrusted object can obtain access to the real global object.

### Bugfixes

-   fix handling of build dependencies with `#` in path

### Performance

-   improve memory usage when using the filesystem cache

> When reading a file into a Buffer and picking smaller slices of the Buffer
> the small slices still keep a reference to the large original Buffer.
> The leads to increased memory usage. A fix would be to clone the slice into
> a smaller Buffer when wasting too much memory, but this has a performance cost.
> There is now a new option `cache.allowCollectingMemory` which controls that.
> For one-off builds you probably want `allowCollectingMemory: false` and
> for watch builds you probably want `allowCollectingMemory: true`.
> It defaults to false in production mode and true in development mode.

        (exception: `Cache-Control: no-cache`).
    -   The `webpack.lock.data` persisting can be disabled with `experiments.buildHttp.cacheLocation: false`.
        That will will introduce a availability risk.

[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack/compare/v5.34.0...v5.35.0)

### Bugfixes

-   fix handling of build dependencies with `#` in path

### Performance

-   improve memory usage when using the filesystem cache

> When reading a file into a Buffer and picking smaller slices of the Buffer
> the small slices still keep a reference to the large original Buffer.
> The leads to increased memory usage. A fix would be to clone the slice into
> a smaller Buffer when wasting too much memory, but this has a performance cost.
> There is now a new option `cache.allowCollectingMemory` which controls that.
> For one-off builds you probably want `allowCollectingMemory: false` and
> for watch builds you probably want `allowCollectingMemory: true`.
> It defaults to false in production mode and true in development mode.

### [`v5.49.0`](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack/releases/tag/v5.49.0)

[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/webpack/webpack/compare/v5.48.0...v5.49.0)

### Features

-   add `experiments.buildHttp` to build `http(s)://` imports instead of keeping them external
    -   keeps a `webpack.lock` file with integrity and `webpack.lock.data` with cached content that should be committed
    -   Automatically upgrades lockfile during development when remote resources change
        (might be disabled with `experiments.buildHttp.upgrade: false`)
    -   Lockfile is frozen during production builds and usually no network requests are made
        (exception: `Cache-Control: no-cache`).
    -   The `webpack.lock.data` persisting can be disabled with `experiments.buildHttp.cacheLocation: false`.
        That will will introduce a availability risk.

### Bugfixes

-   fix handling of build dependencies with `#` in path

### Performance

-   improve memory usage when using the filesystem cache

> When reading a file into a Buffer and picking smaller slices of the Buffer
> the small slices still keep a reference to the large original Buffer.
> The leads to increased memory usage. A fix would be to clone the slice into
> a smaller Buffer when wasting too much memory, but this has a performance cost.
> There is now a new option `cache.allowCollectingMemory` which controls that.
> For one-off builds you probably want `allowCollectingMemory: false` and
> for watch builds you probably want `allowCollectingMemory: true`.
> It defaults to false in production mode and true in development mode.
