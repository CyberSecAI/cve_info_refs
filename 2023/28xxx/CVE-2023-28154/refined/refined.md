This allows an attacker to control properties of an untrusted object and gain access to the real global object.\",\n  \"Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present\": \"Cross-realm object access vulnerability due to mishandling of magic comments within the ImportParserPlugin, allowing for the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code that has the ability to break out of the vm sandbox.\",\n  \"Impact of exploitation\": \"An attacker can potentially gain access to the real global object, allowing them to execute arbitrary code on the build machine and potentially exfiltrate sensitive data or affect the build process. They could also write files on the build system.\",\n  \"Attack vectors\": \"The attack vector is network-based, where a malicious actor can inject malicious code via webpack's magic comments feature.\",\n  \"Required attacker capabilities/position\": \"The attacker needs to have the ability to control properties within an untrusted object that is processed by webpack's ImportParserPlugin. This could be done through a malicious contribution to a repository's codebase or malicious configuration.\",\n   \"Additional Details\": \"The vulnerability is triggered by how webpack evaluates JavaScript code in magic comments using Node's vm module. Specifically, the vulnerability exists in the way webpack accesses properties from an untrusted object and executes arbitrary javascript code.  The fix includes sanitizing the values from the VM via `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(val))`\"\n}"
