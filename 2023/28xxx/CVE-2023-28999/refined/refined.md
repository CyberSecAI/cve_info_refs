      "Data": {
        "Root cause of vulnerability": "The lack of authenticity of metadata keys in Nextcloud's end-to-end encryption (E2EE) module.",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
          "Metadata keys are encrypted with RSA-OAEP which provides confidentiality and integrity but not authentication.",
          "A malicious server can insert a metadata key of its choosing.",
           "An implementation bug causes the client to use an empty metadata key if the server returns a metadata file with no keys.",
            "The IV is not re-generated when a file is updated leading to IV reuse with AES-GCM."
        ],
        "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious server can decrypt, modify and create files in an E2EE folder by controlling the metadata key, or through the IV reuse vulnerability.",
        "Attack vectors": [
          "A malicious server admin, or anyone with write access to the server's data folder, can modify the encrypted folder metadata, insert malicious metadata keys, or remove them.",
          "A malicious server admin can overwrite existing files with their own crafted versions by exploiting IV reuse."
        ],
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have read and write access to the server's data folder to modify the encrypted metadata, or be able to send crafted responses to the client during file synchronization."
