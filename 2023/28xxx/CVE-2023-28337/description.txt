When uploading a firmware image to a Netgear Nighthawk Wifi6 Router (RAX30), a hidden “forceFWUpdate” parameter may be provided to force the upgrade to complete and bypass certain validation checks. End users can use this to upload modified, unofficial, and potentially malicious firmware to the device.
