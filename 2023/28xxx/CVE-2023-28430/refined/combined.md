## Summary

React Native OneSignal SDK repository is vulnerable to a Command Injection in `Zapier.yml`.

## Product

React Native OneSignal SDK

## Tested Version

[4e43bda](https://github.com/OneSignal/react-native-onesignal/commit/4e43bda4ce1eb395f36bb8a5640002523c051085)

## Details

### Actions command injection in `Zapier.yml` (`GHSL-2023-051`)

The [`Zapier.yml`](https://github.com/OneSignal/react-native-onesignal/blob/4e43bda4ce1eb395f36bb8a5640002523c051085/.github/workflows/Zapier.yml) workflow is triggered on `issues` (`types: [closed]`) (i.e., when an Issue is closed). The workflow starts [with full `write`-permissions GitHub repository token](https://github.com/OneSignal/react-native-onesignal/actions/runs/4164681191/jobs/7206638323#step:1:16) since the [default workflow permissions on Organization/Repository level](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository#configuring-the-default-github_token-permissions) are set to read-write.

Taking the above into account, this workflow runs the following step with data controlled by said comment (`${{ github.event.issue.title }}` – the full title of the Issue), allowing an attacker to take over the GitHub Runner and run custom commands, potentially stealing any **secret** (if used), or altering the repository.

```
- name: Call Zapier web hook to close Asana task
  if: ${{ !github.event.issue.pull_request }}
  run: |
    curl --location --request POST 'https://hooks.zapier.com/hooks/catch/...' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --header 'Accept: application/json' \
    --data-raw '{
      "task_name" : "${{ github.event.issue.title }}"
    }'

```

This issue was found with CodeQL using [javascript’s Expression injection in Actions query](https://codeql.github.com/codeql-query-help/javascript/js-actions-command-injection/).

#### Proof of Concept

1. Create an Issue in [OneSignal/react-native-onesignal](https://github.com/OneSignal/react-native-onesignal) with the following title: `foo"}'; echo "Hello"; echo '` (without backticks)
2. Close the Issue.
3. Check the [workflow runs](https://github.com/OneSignal/react-native-onesignal/actions/workflows/Zapier.yml) for the new Actions run that will execute the command `echo "Hello"`.

#### Impact

This issue may lead to stealing workflow secrets and modification of the repository.
