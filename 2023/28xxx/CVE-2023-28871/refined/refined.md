The provided content is related to CVE-2023-28871, which is not explicitly mentioned, but it does describe a vulnerability in the NCP Secure Enterprise Client that leads to information disclosure through insecure registry export.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The NCP Secure Enterprise Client's Support Assistant exports registry information, including symbolic links. It recursively exports keys under `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\*`. Low-privileged users can create subkeys within this location and create symbolic links within those subkeys that redirect to arbitrary locations in the registry, such as `HKLM\SAM`, which contains hashed user credentials.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure registry export: The client exports registry keys without proper access control, allowing low-privileged users to redirect the export to sensitive areas.
- Usage of registry symbolic links: The client follows registry symbolic links during the export, enabling the redirection attack.
- Insufficient privilege management: The client does not impersonate the user that started the Support Assistant, so it exports information based on the client's privileges, not the user's.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Information disclosure: An attacker can gain access to sensitive registry information, such as hashed user credentials, by redirecting the registry export.
- Potential for privilege escalation: Accessing hashed credentials can potentially lead to local or domain privilege escalation.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access: A low-privileged user can exploit the vulnerability on a machine with the vulnerable software installed.
- Requires the ability to create subkeys and symbolic links within specific areas of the registry.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be a low-privileged user on the target machine with the vulnerable NCP Secure Enterprise Client installed.
- Ability to create registry keys within the `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\` tree (e.g. by creating subkeys).
- Ability to create registry symbolic links within these subkeys.
