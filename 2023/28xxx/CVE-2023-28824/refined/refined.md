Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-28824:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists in the query settings screen of the CONPROSYS HMI System (CHS). It allows access to database content that should be restricted, due to a lack of proper access control when handling requests to the database.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) - The system allows a user to craft requests that can access unintended database content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information theft and/or data tampering. An attacker can potentially read and modify data in the database that should not be accessible to them.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack. An attacker needs network access to the CONPROSYS HMI System (CHS) application.
- Exploitation occurs through the query setting screen.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have low-level privileges on the affected system.
- They need access to the application's query settings screen.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is identified as CWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery).
- The CVSS v3 score is 4.3 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N), indicating a medium severity vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Michael Heinzl.
- A fix is available in version 3.5.3 and later of the software.
- Workarounds include isolating the system from the network, implementing firewalls, and restricting network access to a closed network.
