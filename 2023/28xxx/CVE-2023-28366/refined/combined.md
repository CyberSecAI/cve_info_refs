Package        : mosquitto
CVE ID         : CVE-2021-34434 CVE-2023-0809 CVE-2023-3592 CVE-2023-28366
                 CVE-2021-41039
Debian Bug     : 993400 1001028

Several security vulnerabilities have been discovered in mosquitto, a MQTT
compatible message broker, which may be abused for a denial of service attack.

CVE-2021-34434

    In Eclipse Mosquitto when using the dynamic security plugin, if the ability
    for a client to make subscriptions on a topic is revoked when a durable
    client is offline, then existing subscriptions for that client are not
    revoked.

CVE-2023-0809

    Fix excessive memory being allocated based on malicious initial packets
    that are not CONNECT packets.

CVE-2023-3592

    Fix memory leak when clients send v5 CONNECT packets with a will message
    that contains invalid property types.

CVE-2023-28366

    The broker in Eclipse Mosquitto has a memory leak that can be abused
    remotely when a client sends many QoS 2 messages with duplicate message
    IDs, and fails to respond to PUBREC commands. This occurs because of
    mishandling of EAGAIN from the libc send function.

Additionally CVE-2021-41039 has been fixed for Debian 11 "Bullseye".

CVE-2021-41039

    An MQTT v5 client connecting with a large number of user-property
    properties could cause excessive CPU usage, leading to a loss of
    performance and possible denial of service.

For the oldstable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed
in version 2.0.11-1+deb11u1.

For the stable distribution (bookworm), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.11-1.2+deb12u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your mosquitto packages.

For the detailed security status of mosquitto please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/mosquitto>

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

GeneralPlans & PricingPrivacyResponsible AI
### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

## Description

The broker in Eclipse Mosquitto 1.3.2 through 2.x before 2.0.16 has a memory leak that can be abused remotely when a client sends many QoS 2 messages with duplicate message IDs, and fails to respond to PUBREC commands. This occurs because of mishandling of EAGAIN from the libc send function.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

i need to merge this patch to mosquitto, I am using mosquitto-1.5.5, and there are many lines of code missing in my version, it is not possible to directly patch, so I need to fix the intermediate patch to patch first.

Can someone please guide me on how to take this patch and move forward?

thanks,

Chandra

| [Description](#c0)  Ilian Zarov    2002-01-08 19:01:06 UTC  ``` Hello, attached is multi-gnome-terminal-1.3.8.ebuild. (<http://multignometerm.sourceforge.net>): Multi GNOME Terminal is an enhanced  version of gnome-terminal which has the following features added:     Many terminals in each window     Switch between terminals using shortcuts     Execution of user defined commands in new terminals     Notification of terminal states (changed, changing, unchanged) using different tabs colors     Reorderable tabs  I suggest app-misc/multi-gnome-terminal for this package.      Best Regards,     Ilian Zarov ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Ilian Zarov    2002-01-08 19:03:00 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 30](attachment.cgi?id=30 "multi-gnome-terminal-1.3.8.ebuild") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=30&action=edit "multi-gnome-terminal-1.3.8.ebuild")] multi-gnome-terminal-1.3.8.ebuild ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Mikael Hallendal (hallski) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-08 19:08:57 UTC  ``` multi-gnome-terminal is already in portage (x11-term/multi-gnome-terminal), updated from 1.3.7 to 1.3.8 though.  ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Ilian Zarov    2002-01-08 19:36:10 UTC  ```  I just noticed that the settings menu is not working. Sorry. Here's the corrected version (note: I used cp to copy a default configuration file - multi-gnome-terminal.glade, because the file should be in /usr/share/gnome-terminal/glade - configuration directory of gnome-terminal). ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Ilian Zarov    2002-01-08 19:44:35 UTC  ``` There was a problem with creating a new attachment (No file was provided, or it was empty) though it was there. Put a tab in front of cp :) --- multi-gnome-terminal-1.3.8-r1.ebuild # Distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License, v2 or later # Author: Ilian Zarov <coder@descom.com>  S=${WORKDIR}/${P} SRC_URI="[http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/multignometerm/${P}.tar.bz2](http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/multignometerm/%24%7BP%7D.tar.bz2)" HOMEPAGE="<http://multignometerm.sf.net>" DESCRIPTION="MGT is an enchanced version of gnome-terminal with many terminals in each window support ala konsole"  DEPEND=">=x11-libs/gtk+-1.2.10 	>=gnome-base/gnome-libs-1.0.59 	>=media-libs/gdk-pixbuf-0.7.0 	>=gnome-base/libglade-0.17-r1         >=app-text/scrollkeeper-0.2         >=gnome-base/ORBit-0.5.10-r1"  src_unpack() {         unpack ${A}         cd ${S} cp gnome-terminal/multi-gnome-terminal.glade /usr/share/gnome-terminal/glade }  src_compile() { 	./configure --prefix=/usr --host=${CHOST} 	\ 	--build=${CHOST} 	emake || die }  src_install() { 	make prefix=${D} install || die } ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Mikael Hallendal (hallski) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-08 19:49:01 UTC  ``` multi-gnome-term 1.3.8 is already in portage. (I upgraded it before).  Also, you should never do   cp gnome-terminal/multi-gnome-terminal.glade /usr/share/gnome-terminal/glade  in src_unpack (this makes it copy a file directly to the filesystem without being installed the correct way).  Anyway, just use the .ebuild that already in x11-misc/multi-gnome-term, it works.    ``` |  |

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2023-9adc4be8b0
2023-09-15 18:36:13.238037
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : mosquitto
Product : Fedora 39
Version : 2.0.17
Release : 1.fc39
URL : <https://mosquitto.org/>
Summary : Open Source MQTT v5/v3.1.x Broker
Description :
Mosquitto is an open source message broker that implements the MQ Telemetry
Transport protocol version 3.1 and 3.1.1 MQTT provides a lightweight method
of carrying out messaging using a publish/subscribe model. This makes it
suitable for "machine to machine" messaging such as with low power sensors
or mobile devices such as phones, embedded computers or micro-controllers
like the Arduino.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

2.0.17 Broker: \* Fix `max\_queued\_messages 0` stopping clients from receiving
messages \* Fix `max\_inflight\_messages` not being set correctly. Apps: \* Fix
`mosquitto\_passwd -U` backup file creation. 2.0.16 Security: \*
CVE-2023-28366: Fix memory leak in broker when clients send multiple QoS 2
messages with the same message ID, but then never respond to the PUBREC
commands. \* CVE-2023-0809: Fix excessive memory being allocated based on
malicious initial packets that are not CONNECT packets. \* CVE-2023-3592: Fix
memory leak when clients send v5 CONNECT packets with a will message that
contains invalid property types. \* Broker will now reject Will messages that
attempt to publish to $CONTROL/. \* Broker now validates usernames provided in a
TLS certificate or TLS-PSK identity are valid UTF-8. \* Fix potential crash when
loading invalid persistence file. \* Library will no longer allow single level
wildcard certificates, e.g. \*.com Broker: \* Fix $SYS messages being expired
after 60 seconds and hence unchanged values disappearing. \* Fix some retained
topic memory not being cleared immediately after used. \* Fix error handling
related to the `bind\_interface` option. \* Fix std\* files not being redirected
when daemonising, when built with assertions removed. \* Fix default settings
incorrectly allowing TLS v1.1. \* Use line buffered mode for stdout. Closes
#2354. \* Fix bridges with non-matching cleansession/local\_cleansession being
expired on start after restoring from persistence. \* Fix connections being
limited to 2048 on Windows. The limit is now 8192, where supported. \* Broker
will log warnings if sensitive files are world readable/writable, or if the
owner/group is not the same as the user/group the broker is running as. In
future versions the broker will refuse to open these files. \*
mosquitto\_memcmp\_const is now more constant time. \* Only register with DLT if
DLT logging is enabled. \* Fix any possible case where a json string might be
incorrectly loaded. This could have caused a crash if a textname or
textdescription field of a role was not a string, when loading the dynsec config
from file only. \* Dynsec plugin will not allow duplicate clients/groups/roles
when loading config from file, which matches the behaviour for when creating
them. \* Fix heap overflow when reading corrupt config with "log\_dest file".
Client library: \* Use CLOCK\_BOOTTIME when available, to keep track of time.
This solves the problem of the client OS sleeping and the client hence not being
able to calculate the actual time for keepalive purposes. \* Fix default settings
incorrectly allowing TLS v1.1. \* Fix high CPU use on slow TLS connect. Clients:
\* Fix incorrect topic-alias property value in mosquitto\_sub json output. \* Fix
confusing message on TLS certificate verification. Apps: \* mosquitto\_passwd
uses mkstemp() for backup files. \* `mosquitto\_ctrl dynsec init` will refuse to
overwrite an existing file, without a race-condition.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Version 2.0.16 released.

---

[2023-08-16 12:57](.)

Version 2.0.16 of Mosquitto has been released. This is a security
and bugfix release.

## Security

* [CVE-2023-28366](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-27366): Fix memory leak in broker when clients send multiple QoS 2
  messages with the same message ID, but then never respond to the PUBREC
  commands.
* [CVE-2023-0809](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-0809): Fix excessive memory being allocated based on malicious
  initial packets that are not CONNECT packets.
* [CVE-2023-3592](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-3592): Fix memory leak when clients send v5 CONNECT packets with a
  will message that contains invalid property types.
* Broker will now reject Will messages that attempt to publish to $CONTROL/.
* Broker now validates usernames provided in a TLS certificate or TLS-PSK
  identity are valid UTF-8.
* Fix potential crash when loading invalid persistence file.
* Library will no longer allow single level wildcard certificates, e.g. \*.com

## Broker

* Fix $SYS messages being expired after 60 seconds and hence unchanged values
  disappearing.
* Fix some retained topic memory not being cleared immediately after used.
* Fix error handling related to the `bind_interface` option.
* Fix std\* files not being redirected when daemonising, when built with
  assertions removed. Closes [#2708](https://github.com/eclipse/mosquitto/issues/2708).
* Fix default settings incorrectly allowing TLS v1.1. Closes [#2722](https://github.com/eclipse/mosquitto/issues/2722).
* Use line buffered mode for stdout. Closes #2354. Closes [#2749](https://github.com/eclipse/mosquitto/issues/2749).
* Fix bridges with non-matching cleansession/local\_cleansession being expired
  on start after restoring from persistence. Closes [#2634](https://github.com/eclipse/mosquitto/issues/2634).
* Fix connections being limited to 2048 on Windows. The limit is now 8192,
  where supported. Closes [#2732](https://github.com/eclipse/mosquitto/issues/2732).
* Broker will log warnings if sensitive files are world readable/writable, or
  if the owner/group is not the same as the user/group the broker is running
  as. In future versions the broker will refuse to open these files.
* mosquitto\_memcmp\_const is now more constant time.
* Only register with DLT if DLT logging is enabled.
* Fix any possible case where a json string might be incorrectly loaded. This
  could have caused a crash if a textname or textdescription field of a role was
  not a string, when loading the dynsec config from file only.
* Dynsec plugin will not allow duplicate clients/groups/roles when loading
  config from file, which matches the behaviour for when creating them.
* Fix heap overflow when reading corrupt config with "log\_dest file".

## Client library

* Use CLOCK\_BOOTTIME when available, to keep track of time. This solves the
  problem of the client OS sleeping and the client hence not being able to
  calculate the actual time for keepalive purposes. Closes [#2760](https://github.com/eclipse/mosquitto/issues/2760).
* Fix default settings incorrectly allowing TLS v1.1. Closes [#2722](https://github.com/eclipse/mosquitto/issues/2722).
* Fix high CPU use on slow TLS connect. Closes [#2794](https://github.com/eclipse/mosquitto/issues/2794).

## Clients

* Fix incorrect topic-alias property value in mosquitto\_sub json output.
* Fix confusing message on TLS certificate verification. Closes [#2746](https://github.com/eclipse/mosquitto/issues/2746).

## Apps

* mosquitto\_passwd uses mkstemp() for backup files.
* `mosquitto_ctrl dynsec init` will refuse to overwrite an existing file,
  without a race-condition.

i need to merge this patch to mosquitto, I am using mosquitto-1.5.5, and there are many lines of code missing in my version, it is not possible to directly patch, so I need to fix the intermediate patch to patch first.

Can someone please guide me on how to take this patch and move forward?

thanks,

Chandra

#
# Product: Eclipse Mosquitto
# Vendor: Eclipse Foundation
# CSNC ID: CSNC-2023-001
# CVE ID: CVE-2023-28366
# Subject: Denial of Service / Memory Leak
# Risk: High
# Effect: Remotely exploitable
# Author: Mischa Bachmann
# Date: 31.08.2023
#
#############################################################
Introduction
------------
Eclipse Mosquitto [1,2] is an open source (EPL/EDL licensed) message broker that implements the MQTT protocol versions 5.0, 3.1.1 and 3.1. Mosquitto is lightweight and is suitable for use on all devices from low power single board computers to full servers.
The MQTT protocol provides a lightweight method of carrying out messaging using a publish/subscribe model. This makes it suitable for Internet of Things messaging such as with low power sensors or mobile devices such as phones, embedded computers or microcontrollers.
The Mosquitto project also provides a C library for implementing MQTT clients, and the very popular mosquitto\_pub and mosquitto\_sub command line MQTT clients.
Affected
--------
Vulnerable:
\* Eclipse Mosquitto v1.4 - v2.0.15
Not tested:
\* Eclipse Mosquitto before v1.4
Technical Description
---------------------
The Eclipse Mosquitto broker does not properly handle error codes generated by the libc send() function. If an EAGAIN error code is returned the control flow will catch the error but return a success to the calling function. This skips the process of freeing the memory and leads to a memory leak.
Attackers can abuse this behavior by transmitting a large amount of network packets of a particular type at a high rate, filling up the memory with unsent packages and resulting in a Denial of Service attack.
Workaround / Fix
----------------
Upgrade to Eclipse Mosquitto v2.0.16 or later containing the fix [3].
