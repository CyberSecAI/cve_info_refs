Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-28520:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization within the IBM Planning Analytics TM1 Application Web component, allowing for the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before displaying it within the web interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can embed malicious JavaScript code into the Web UI. This could lead to:
*   Altering the intended functionality of the application.
*   Potential disclosure of user credentials within a trusted session.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through the Web UI. Specifically, by injecting malicious JavaScript code in a way that it will be rendered by the application within a user's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs the ability to inject script code into the Web UI, possibly via some form of user-supplied input. The attacker may be a malicious internal user, or external attacker with the ability to manipulate input if the application is exposed to a vulnerable interface.
