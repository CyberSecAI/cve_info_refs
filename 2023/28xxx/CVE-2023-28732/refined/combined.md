**CVE Description**:

Introduction:

AcyMailing is a newsletter and email marketing plugin available for Joomla and WordPress.

The vulnerability:

Missing access control allows to list and access files containing sensitive information from the plugin itself and access to system files due to path traversal, when being granted access to the campaign’s creation on front-office.

This issue affects AnyMailing Joomla Plugin in versions below 8.3.0.

The steps to exploit the vulnerability:

* Campaign creation access needs to be enabled on the front-office, the following steps can then be done unauthenticated
* Manipulate the URL to list and get access to the logs of the plugin itself, leaking PII of users
* Manipulate the URL to list and get access to system files (e.g. in the root directory of Joomla). Only allowed file-types can be listed and accessed
* Upload arbitrary files. Only allowed file-types can be uploaded

How to check for exploitation:

* Check access logs for requests in the form of “/component/acym/frontfile.html?currentFolder=media/com\_acym/upload/logs” or suspicious access to files in “/media/com\_acym/upload/logs/”
* Check access logs for requests in the form of “/component/acym/frontfile.html?currentFolder=media/com\_acym/upload/logs/../../../..” or suspicious access to allowed file-types on the entire system accessible by the user of the webserver
* Check for suspicious files uploaded in /media/com\_acym/upload/
* Default allowed file-types are: zip, doc, docx, pdf, xls, txt, gzip, rar, jpg, jpeg, gif, xlsx, pps, csv, bmp, ico, odg, odp, ods, odt, png, ppt, swf, xcf, mp3, wma

**Solution**:

* update to a fixed version (>= 8.3.0)

**Timeline**:

* 2023-02-01: reported
* 2023-03-09: initial vendor notification
* 2023-03-10: initial vendor response
* 2023-03-20: release of fixed version
* 2023-03-30: coordinated public disclosure

**CVE Description**:

Introduction:

AcyMailing is a newsletter and email marketing plugin available for Joomla and WordPress.

The vulnerability:

Missing access control allows to list and access files containing sensitive information from the plugin itself and access to system files due to path traversal, when being granted access to the campaign’s creation on front-office.

This issue affects AnyMailing Joomla Plugin in versions below 8.3.0.

The steps to exploit the vulnerability:

* Campaign creation access needs to be enabled on the front-office, the following steps can then be done unauthenticated
* Manipulate the URL to list and get access to the logs of the plugin itself, leaking PII of users
* Manipulate the URL to list and get access to system files (e.g. in the root directory of Joomla). Only allowed file-types can be listed and accessed
* Upload arbitrary files. Only allowed file-types can be uploaded

How to check for exploitation:

* Check access logs for requests in the form of “/component/acym/frontfile.html?currentFolder=media/com\_acym/upload/logs” or suspicious access to files in “/media/com\_acym/upload/logs/”
* Check access logs for requests in the form of “/component/acym/frontfile.html?currentFolder=media/com\_acym/upload/logs/../../../..” or suspicious access to allowed file-types on the entire system accessible by the user of the webserver
* Check for suspicious files uploaded in /media/com\_acym/upload/
* Default allowed file-types are: zip, doc, docx, pdf, xls, txt, gzip, rar, jpg, jpeg, gif, xlsx, pps, csv, bmp, ico, odg, odp, ods, odt, png, ppt, swf, xcf, mp3, wma

**Solution**:

* update to a fixed version (>= 8.3.0)

**Timeline**:

* 2023-02-01: reported
* 2023-03-09: initial vendor notification
* 2023-03-10: initial vendor response
* 2023-03-20: release of fixed version
* 2023-03-30: coordinated public disclosure

# AcyMailing

Welcome to the AcyMailing repository on GitHub. Here you can browse the source code, look at open issues and keep track of development.

This is the code of the AcyMailing Starter version.

If you are not a developer, please download AcyMailing [from our website](https://www.acymailing.com/#download) instead.

## Documentation

* [Documentation](https://docs.acymailing.com/)
* [Developer Documentation](https://docs.acymailing.com/developers/acymailing-developer-documentation)

## Support

This repository is not suitable for support. Please don't use our issue tracker for support requests, but for core AcyMailing issues only.

Support requests in issues on this repository will be closed.

## Contributing to AcyMailing

If you have a patch or have stumbled upon an issue with AcyMailing, you can create a pull request on your fork, it will be reviewed by the AcyMailing development team.

## Setup

### Requirements

* npm
* PHP 5.6 minimum

### Installation

We don't recommend to clone the project inside the CMS to avoid losing your data when updating.

```
#fork the project

#clone your copy
git clone https://xxx

#go to the repository
cd acymailing

#install the dependencies
npm install
```

Once you've done that, you will have to create a new file `gulp-settings.js` in the folder gulp.
Here is the content of it:

```
module.exports = {
    //you can set one or several joomla dev sites
    joomla: ['path/to/joomla', 'path/to/other/joomla'],
    //you can set one or several wordpress dev sites
    wordpress: ['path/to/wordpress'],
};
```

### Development

Before launching any further script please download and install the Starter version on your development site.

You can download the latest version of AcyMailing [here](https://www.acymailing.com/account/license/)

Once this step is done open a new console at the root of the AcyMailing project:

```
#Start the synchronization
gulp default
```

This gulp task will synchronize any modification made in the AcyMailing folder on your WordPress and Joomla websites.
