Missing access control inÂ AnyMailing Joomla Plugin allows to list and access files containing sensitive information from the plugin itself and access to system files via path traversal, when being granted access to the campaign's creation on front-office. 

This issue affects AnyMailing Joomla Plugin in versions below 8.3.0.
