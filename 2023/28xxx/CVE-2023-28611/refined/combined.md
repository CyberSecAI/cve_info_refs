## Detect cyber attacks promptly

The Intrusion Detection System (IDS) StationGuard monitors Ethernet networks in the power grid and identifies cyber threats, prohibited activity, and malfunctions.

With this combination of cybersecurity and functional monitoring, not only can new threats and as yet unknown attack scenarios be identified, but different kinds of malfunctions in the power utility automation system too.

## StationGuard - designed for the energy system

Regardless of whether your system is based on IEC 60870-5-104, DNP3, Modbus TCP, or IEC 61850, StationGuard deeply inspects all communication to find cyber threats, prohibited activity, and errors.

Based on our 25+ years’ of experience in power utility automation systems, StationGuard truly understands the communication in power utility automation and SCADA systems. With its unique system model approach, this knowledge is used to determine between legitimate traffic and malicious activity.

StationGuard is the leading cybersecurity solution for your power utility automation and SCADA networks. It detects every threat to your systems, enhances your network performance, and saves operational costs, while ensuring compliance with critical infrastructure cybersecurity standards and regulations.

## Support for commissioning and maintenance

Engineering protocols and IED web interfaces have many known vulnerabilities and new ones are being released all the time. These interfaces are however needed in the commissioning phase and during routine maintenance. To protect your substations against attacks on these ports, you should generally prohibit engineering activity and only allow it when needed. The "Maintenance Mode" enables a high security level by prohibiting engineering activities during normal operation, while providing a low level of false alarms during maintenance phases.

In contrast to baseline or learning based IDS, StationGuard supports the different phases in the lifecycle of a substation with high selectivity in the alerts.

## Expert Support | We make life easy for you

If an alarm indicates prohibited or non-standard-compliant behavior, the StationGuard experts are on hand to help you evaluate the cause. A profile of your substation can also be created on request to offer an alarm analysis targeted specifically for your site and its devices.

In addition to our Technical Support team, who are available 24/7, StationGuard Expert Support helps you to evaluate alarms and perform network capture analyses.

# OMICRON Product Security Vulnerability Handling and Disclosure

At OMICRON we take any type of vulnerability issue that affects our products very seriously, and we appreciate and welcome every report that helps us improve their security. Consequently, we have established a systematic approach for receiving, handling, and disclosing such vulnerabilities.

## Coordinated Disclosure

We are aware of our responsibility for contributing to an increased level of cybersecurity, especially in the area of critical infrastructures. Therefore, we want to inform our customers about validated and relevant vulnerabilities that affect our products in our Security Advisories section below. However, to avoid unnecessary risks to our customers, we encourage anyone that detects a vulnerability to not make the information public until we have evaluated the appropriate remediation options.

## OMICRON Product Security Team

At OMICRON, we have a dedicated product security team responsible for managing security issues and taking further disclosure actions. They are happy to help you with any questions related to vulnerabilities in OMICRON products. If possible, please use encrypted e-mail communication.

#### 1. Report

We invite everyone to report security issues that affect OMICRON products.
 We respect your privacy and will not publish any information about you without your explicit consent.

It is possible to submit an identified security issue anonymously, but if desired, we will credit you for finding a vulnerability issue in our security advisory.

To report a vulnerability issue, please contact the dedicated Product Security Team mentioned earlier. Please provide as many details as possible when reporting a security issue, and include the following information in your report:

* Affected OMICRON product including detailed version
* Detailed description of the vulnerability issue

## Simple yet Powerful

StationScout simplifies testing for Substation Automation Systems (SAS) and significantly reduces the required testing effort. It comes with a robust and powerful hardware that allows users to simulate multiple IEDs with secure isolation to the SAS networks. This user-friendly software helps you to visualize SCL files, trace signals, and test RTU/Gateway mappings within your substation without any configuration effort.

## Powerful hardware

Afraid to connect a PC to your substation system? Do you need to simulate several IEDs? Is it important to share your license?

This is why we developed the MBX:

* No administrator rights are needed on your enterprise PCs to set up IP addresses for IED simulation.
* Enough network ports to connect to different substation networks.
* Very powerful HW for simulating many IEDs.
* The license is in the box and can be shared easily with your team.

**Is the MBX just a regular PC?**
 No, it has special network interfaces, a secure crypto-processor (TPM) and its rugged design makes it ideal for substation use.

### "For the testing and commissioning of our new 10 kV substation we use the test solution StationScout. The factory acceptance tests were successfully carried out jointly with the supplier under OMICRON's leadership and the entire system was tested with StationScout for the first time. StationScout was able to quickly identify where there was still a need for action on the part of the IEC 61850 parameterization."

 Head of Electricity Department

### "StationScout is a great tool to visualize the configuration and to see, that manufacturers are fulfilling our 61850 requirements. This gives us new opportunities for the future to “virtualize” our protection and control specifications into SSD files and create and visualize all needed functionalities which can be used as a handover packing in a digital substation concept."

 Sebastian Sjögren
 Specialist - Secondary Systems at Fingrid Oyj
 Head of Substation Automation Systems

### "Within the Qirion OT company, we are very pleased with StationScout. It simplifies our way of testing complete automation systems without using physical IEDs. Furthermore, StationScout is a useful device for testing interlockings between IEDs, because the state of the interlocking is graphically displayed on the screen. So, no switching is necessary. This gives us a great benefit for testing interlockings in a live automation system as well as in an in-house test environment."

 Robbert Koenderman
 Senior Engineer at Qirion, part of Alliander
 Product Manager

## Key benefits

**Status overview**
 StationScout provides a clear overview of the substation, visualizing the communication according to IEC 61850 in SCL files, values and states in the substation.

**RTU/Gateway testing**
 StationScout supports IEC 60870-5-104 communication protocols, allowing users to easily observe, track and test the communications from binary I/Os to IEC 61850 to IEC 60870-5-104 mappings for the SCADA/control center, enabling automated end-to-end testing.

**Signal tracing  and signal testing**
 The communication diagram of StationScout allows you to use signal tracing from the overview to the detailed communication message attributes. StationScout also accelerates the efficient testing of SCADA/HMI signals.

**Signal filtering**
 StationScout can visualize the 'state' of the signals in the Overview section for a quick check of the mapping from binary I/Os to IEC 61850 to IEC 60870-5-104, reducing the time needed for on-demand troubleshooting.

**Automated testing**
 StationScout is able to re-use predefined test cases for testing procedure. Interlocking conditions can be tested automatically.

**Cybersecurity**
 The dedicated hardware for StationScout ensures cybersecure operation within the substation communication network.

**Simulation**
 StationScout’s powerful simulation features simplify testing and commissioning. Missing IEDs and IOs can also be simulated.
