Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-28105:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a path traversal issue (ZipSlip) in the `zip.Unzip` function of the `go-huge-util` library. This occurs because the code does not properly sanitize file names within a ZIP archive before extracting them.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal (CWE-22):** The `zip.Unzip` function in versions prior to v0.0.34 did not correctly handle filenames within the zip archive. Specifically, filenames containing `../` sequences were not properly sanitized. This allowed an attacker to write files to arbitrary locations on the filesystem during the extraction process.
- The vulnerable code snippet is in `zip/unzip.go` where the `filePath` was constructed using `path.Join(dstDir, file.Name)` without sanitization

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Write:** A malicious attacker can craft a zip archive that, when extracted using the vulnerable `zip.Unzip` function, writes files to arbitrary locations within the filesystem. This can lead to various impacts such as:
    - Overwriting important system files or configuration files.
    - Injecting malicious code into locations that are executed by the system or other applications.
    - Creating files in unexpected locations, potentially causing denial of service or other issues.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious ZIP Archive:** An attacker crafts a zip archive containing specially crafted filenames, such as those with "../" sequences, that, when extracted using the vulnerable `zip.Unzip` function, writes files to arbitrary locations on the filesystem.
- **Network:** The attacker could distribute the malicious zip file through a network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious zip file to a user that will then use the vulnerable `zip.Unzip` function.
- No special privileges are required.
- User interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability by initiating the unzipping process.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS score of 8.8, indicating a high severity.
- The fix was implemented in version v0.0.34 by sanitizing the `file.Name` using `strings.TrimPrefix(filepath.Join(string(filepath.Separator), file.Name), string(filepath.Separator))` before constructing the `filePath`.
- The vulnerability is present in versions before v0.0.34.
- The vulnerability was reported by `@cokeBeer`
