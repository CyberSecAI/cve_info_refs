The Hub in the Snap One OvrC cloud platform is a device used to centralize and manage nested devices connected to it. A vulnerability exists in which an attacker could impersonate a hub and send device requests to claim already claimed devices. The OvrC cloud platform receives the requests but does not validate if the found devices are already managed by another user.
