Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2023-28471:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of sanitization of the container name within Concrete CMS. This means that when a user inputs a name for a container, the system does not properly clean or validate the input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary weakness is the presence of a stored XSS vulnerability. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the container name field. This code is then stored in the system's database and executed when other users view the affected content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Code Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the container name, which will be executed in the browsers of users who view the page where the container name is displayed.
- **Information Disclosure:** Successful XSS can lead to a variety of impacts depending on the attacker's payload, such as the attacker gaining access to sensitive information, stealing cookies, or performing actions on behalf of the user.
- **Defacement:** Attackers can potentially alter the appearance of the website, including adding or modifying content.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is network-based. An attacker can submit a malicious container name over the network via HTTP(S).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **High Privileges:** The attacker needs to have high privileges (Admin user) within Concrete CMS to create or modify container names that will be affected by this vulnerability. This is indicated by the `PR:H` (Privileges Required: High) in the CVSS vector.
- **User Interaction (UI):** The attacker does need a user to interact with the page or interface where the injected script is executed. This is indicated by the `UI:R` (User Interaction: Required) in the CVSS vector.
- **Attack Complexity:** The attack is of high complexity (AC:H).

**Additional Details:**
- **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability affects Concrete CMS versions below 9.2. However, in a later update, Concrete CMS clarified that this CVE specifically affects versions 9.0-9.1.3, as versions below 9 do not use containers.
- **CVSS Score:** Concrete CMS Security team scored this vulnerability with a CVSS v3.1 base score of 2.0 with a vector of `AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N`.
