The provided content contains information about CVE-2023-28660.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Events Made Easy WordPress Plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query. Specifically, the `search_name` parameter in the `eme_recurrences_list` action is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection vulnerability in the `search_name` parameter of the `eme_recurrences_list` action.
- Improper sanitization of user-supplied input.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious SQL code. This could lead to:
   - Unauthorized access to sensitive data
   - Modification of data
   - Complete compromise of the database and the WordPress site.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP request to the WordPress site's admin-ajax.php endpoint, with the action parameter set to eme\_recurrences\_list and injecting SQL code in the search\_name parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be authenticated as a user on the WordPress site, but does not require administrator privileges.
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the target WordPress site.
