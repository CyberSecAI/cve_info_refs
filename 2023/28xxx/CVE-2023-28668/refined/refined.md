**CVE-2023-28668**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Role-based Authorization Strategy Plugin grants permissions even after they have been disabled.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities**: Incorrect permission checks. The plugin does not properly check if a permission is disabled before granting it.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can gain greater access than they are entitled to, potentially leading to unauthorized actions or access to sensitive information.
*   **Attack vectors**:
    1.  A permission is granted to attackers directly or through groups.
    2.  The permission is disabled (e.g., through the script console).
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have an initial permission granted, then after it's disabled, they can still retain that permission.
