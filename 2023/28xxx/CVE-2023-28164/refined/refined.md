Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2023-28164:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from how Firefox handles drag-and-drop operations involving cross-origin iframes. Specifically, if a user starts dragging a URL from within a cross-origin iframe, and that iframe is removed during the drag operation, Firefox still allows the drop to trigger navigation in the same tab.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Cross-origin iframe manipulation:** The vulnerability relies on a scenario involving cross-origin iframes, which are iframes that load content from a different domain than the main page.
- **Incorrect DragSession handling:** The core issue lies in how Firefox's DragSession handles the context of the drag-and-drop operation, specifically the top-level window context. When the iframe is removed during a drag operation, the DragSession is not correctly updated, leading to a navigation in the top-level window.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **User confusion:** Users may be confused or tricked into navigating to a different page than intended, because the drag operation doesn't behave as expected (iframe is removed, but navigation still happens).
- **Website Spoofing Attacks:** An attacker could potentially use this behavior to make a website appear as something else.
    - By hosting a malicious site in an iframe that gets removed during the drag-and-drop, and then leveraging the navigation, the user could be mislead about the URL or the source they are navigating to.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Drag-and-drop:** The attack requires the user to initiate a drag-and-drop operation on a URL within a cross-origin iframe.
- **Iframe Removal:**  The cross-origin iframe must be removed during the drag operation to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to control or influence content within an iframe:** The attacker needs to be able to host or inject content within an iframe on a website visited by the target user.
- **User interaction:** The attack requires the user to perform a specific action (drag a URL from the iframe).
- **No special privilege/access required**: The vulnerability is exploitable by any user who visits a malicious page.

**Additional Details:**

- The fix involves tracking the top-level window context in the `DragSession` to ensure the navigation only occurs if the top-level window context is still valid.
- This vulnerability was fixed in Firefox 111, Firefox ESR 102.9 and Thunderbird 102.9
