Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2023-28856:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of user-supplied input when using the `HINCRBYFLOAT` command in Redis. Specifically, the `HINCRBYFLOAT` command does not properly check the validity of the input before performing an operation.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The core issue is that the Redis server does not validate whether a value is a valid floating point number before creating a new hash field or modifying an existing field using `HINCRBYFLOAT`.
*   **Potential for Invalid Hash Field Creation**:  The lack of validation allows an authenticated user to create a hash field with an invalid value, such as NaN or Infinity, which can lead to a server crash when the field is later accessed.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a potential denial-of-service condition. By creating an invalid hash field, an attacker can trigger a crash of the Redis server when the malformed field is accessed. This could render the Redis database unavailable and disrupt services that rely on it.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over the network if the Redis instance is exposed.
*   **Redis Command:** The attack vector is the `HINCRBYFLOAT` Redis command used to increment the value of a field in a hash.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user of the Redis database to send the `HINCRBYFLOAT` command.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Redis server to send the malicious command, or must have the ability to execute commands on the Redis server (e.g. through LUA scripting).

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Versions:**  Redis versions prior to 7.0.11, 6.2.12, and 6.0.19 are vulnerable.
*  **Fix:** The fix involves adding validation checks before the creation or modification of hash fields to ensure the values are not NaN or Infinity.
*   **NetApp Products:** Multiple NetApp products that incorporate vulnerable Redis versions are also affected, and a patch has been released for the "Management Services for Element Software and NetApp HCI" product.
*   **Fedora Packages:** Fedora 36, 37 and 38 have released updated packages of Redis to address the vulnerability.
*   **Redis Fix Details:**  The fix involved moving the validation of `isnan` and `isinf` to the top of the `hincrbyfloatCommand` function, preventing an invalid value from being written to the database.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 score of 6.5 (Medium) with a vector of  `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H`.
