{
  "vulnerability": {
    "description": "The Full Text Search (FTS) stats endpoint at /api/nsstats does not implement correct authentication, so it is possible to view the names of Couchbase Server buckets, the names of FTS indexes and configuration of FTS indexes without authentication. The contents of the buckets and indexes are not exposed.",
    "root_cause": "The FTS stats endpoint lacks proper authentication mechanisms.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Missing Authentication",
      "Information Disclosure"
    ],
    "impact": "An unauthenticated attacker can gain unauthorized access to sensitive information, specifically the names of Couchbase Server buckets, FTS index names, and FTS index configurations. This information, while not exposing the content of the buckets or indexes, could be used in further attacks.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network access to the FTS stats endpoint at `/api/nsstats`."
     ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs network connectivity to the Couchbase Server instance and knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint.",
