## CVE-2023-28320

# siglongjmp race condition

Project curl Security Advisory, May 17th 2023 - [Permalink](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2023-28320.html)

## VULNERABILITY

libcurl provides several different backends for resolving hostnames,
selected at build time. If it is built to use the synchronous resolver,
it allows name resolves to time-out slow operations using
`alarm()` and `siglongjmp()`.

When doing this, libcurl used a global buffer that was not mutex
protected and a multi-threaded application might therefore crash or
otherwise misbehave.

## INFO

Most platforms and systems build libcurl to use the threaded resolver
or with c-ares, neither of those suffer from this flaw. Most platforms
that build with the synchronous resolver do not feature
`alarm()` and `siglongjmp()` and therefore are not
vulnerable either.

Since `alarm()` uses signals, it is not advisable to use
in a multi-threaded environment (signals and threads rarely mix very
well) which reduces the risk that this flaw hurts many users.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned
the name CVE-2023-28320 to this issue.

CWE-662: Improper Synchronization

Severity: Low

## AFFECTED VERSIONS

* Affected versions: curl [7.9.8](vuln-7.9.8.html) to and including [8.0.1](vuln-8.0.1.html)
* Not affected versions: curl < [7.9.8](vuln-7.9.8.html) and curl >= [8.1.0](vuln-8.1.0.html)
* Introduced-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/3c49b405de4fbf1f>

libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as
such!

## SOLUTION

The fix is to only support this timeout ability if curl has and can
properly mutex protect the buffer.

* Fixed-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/13718030ad4b3209a7583b>

## RECOMMENDATIONS

A - Upgrade curl to version [8.1.0](vuln-8.1.0.html)

B - Apply the patch to your local version

C - Do not use the synchronous name resolver option

## TIMELINE

This issue was reported to the curl project on April 2 2023. We
contacted distros@openwall on May 9, 2023.

curl [8.1.0](vuln-8.1.0.html) was released on May 17 2023, coordinated with the
publication of this advisory.
