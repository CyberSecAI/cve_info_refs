Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-28661:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The WP Popup Banners WordPress Plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input. Specifically, the `value` parameter within the `get_popup_data` action is not sanitized before being used in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the `value` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Full Database compromise:** Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the WordPress database.
- **Data theft/modification:** This may lead to sensitive data theft, modification, or deletion.
- **Loss of Integrity**: It may also lead to the modification of website functionality or content.
- **System takeover:** In severe cases, with access to the database, it may also be possible to escalate privileges and gain control of the web server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is triggered via an HTTP request to the `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint.
- **`get_popup_data` Action**:  The vulnerable code is executed when the `action` parameter is set to `get_popup_data`
- **`value` Parameter**: The malicious SQL code is injected via the `value` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user on the WordPress site.  The content states that subscriber level is sufficient.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target WordPress site.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerable plugin is WP Popup Banners versions 1.2.5 and below.
- The plugin has been closed as of December 19, 2022 because of security issues.
- A Tenable Web Application Scanning plugin (ID 114266) exists to detect this vulnerability.

This vulnerability is considered high risk due to the potential for full database compromise and the ease of exploitation once a user is authenticated.
