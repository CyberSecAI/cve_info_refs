{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The MinIO server in a cluster deployment exposes all environment variables, including sensitive credentials like MINIO_SECRET_KEY and MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD, through the /bootstrap/v1/verify endpoint.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Information Disclosure"
    ],
    "impact": "Exposed sensitive credentials can lead to unauthorized access and full control of the MinIO cluster and its stored data. Attackers could read, modify, or delete data, and potentially move laterally within the infrastructure.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker can send a request to the `/bootstrap/v1/verify` endpoint of a vulnerable MinIO instance in a cluster deployment. No authentication is required.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send an HTTP request to the vulnerable endpoint. No prior authentication or special permissions are needed.",
    "details": "The vulnerability occurs due to the `getServerSystemCfg` function in `minio/cmd/bootstrap-peer-server.go` which lists all environment variables starting with MINIO_, then returns them in the server config without filtering out sensitive credentials. The VerifyHandler then returns this config object in a JSON response. This endpoint is used for inter-node communication and is unintentionally exposing sensitive data."
