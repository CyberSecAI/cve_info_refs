Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**Relates to CVE:** No, this content does not directly relate to a specific CVE. It discusses the deprecation of `apps-graphql@2.x` for security reasons and the required upgrade to `3.x`. This is more of a security advisory and best practice than a report of a specific vulnerability with a CVE ID.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The root cause isn't a vulnerability itself, but rather a lack of access control in the older version of `apps-graphql`. Version `2.x` allowed unauthenticated requests to access private configuration data, which is a security concern.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The main weakness was the ability of unauthenticated users to access private configuration data through `apps-graphql@2.x`. This version did not have the necessary access authorization policies to prevent this.

**Impact of exploitation:** Exploitation could lead to exposure of sensitive data, such as API keys or other private settings, potentially leading to unauthorized access or manipulation of application functionalities.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector would be unauthenticated requests to the `apps-graphql@2.x` API.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attackers would not need to be authenticated. They would require knowledge of the API endpoint for `apps-graphql@2.x` and potentially knowledge of the specific app settings they wish to access.

**Summary:**

The document describes a security improvement by deprecating version 2.x of the `apps-graphql` module. The older version allowed unauthenticated access to private app settings, which was a security risk. The solution is to migrate to version 3.x, which enforces access authorization policies. The deprecation action is to mitigate the security risk and improve overall platform security.
