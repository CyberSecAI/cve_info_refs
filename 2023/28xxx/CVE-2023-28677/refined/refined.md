The provided content contains information about multiple CVEs, including CVE-2023-28677.

**CVE-2023-28677**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Convert To Pipeline Plugin uses basic string concatenation to convert Freestyle projects' Build Environment, Build Steps, and Post-build Actions to the equivalent Pipeline step invocations, without proper sanitization.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command injection vulnerability.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker able to configure Freestyle projects can inject Pipeline script code into the (unsandboxed) Pipeline resulting from a conversion by the Convert To Pipeline Plugin. This can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the Jenkins server when an administrator converts the crafted Freestyle project to a Pipeline, as the injected script will be pre-approved.
*   **Attack vectors**: An attacker with the ability to configure Freestyle projects can craft a malicious configuration that injects arbitrary Pipeline script code. This malicious configuration is then converted to a pipeline, leading to execution of the injected code.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have the ability to configure Freestyle projects. The attacker also needs to have an administrator convert the freestyle project to a pipeline.
