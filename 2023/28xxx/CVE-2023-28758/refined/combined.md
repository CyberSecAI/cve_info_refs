### VTS23-003

# Security Advisory Impacting NetBackup Servers and Clients

### Revision History

* 1.0: March 14, 2023 – Initial Public Release
* 1.1: May 26, 2023 – Update to Affected Product Versions and Added Mitigation Information

### Summary

Veritas has addressed a vulnerability impacting the NetBackup servers and clients.

### Issue

**Arbitrary File Write**

BPCD allows an unprivileged user to create or modify an arbitrary file when executing a NetBackup command. This can be used to elevate privileges and compromise the system.

* CVE ID: [CVE-2023-28758](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28758)
* Severity: High
* CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 7.7 ([AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H))
* Affected Product & Version:
  + NetBackup primary server, media server, and clients – 8.2 and earlier.
  + In environments where the primary and all media servers are at 8.3 or higher, primary and media servers are NOT vulnerable (See Table 1 below).
* Recommended Action:
  + Preferred: Upgrade to version 8.3 or later.

Table 1. Am I Vulnerable?

|  | Primary | Media | Client >= 8.3 | Client < 8.3 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| All NetBackup servers and clients in environment at 8.3 and above | No | No | No | NA |
| All NetBackup servers in environment at 8.3 and above | No | No | No | Yes |
| NetBackup primary server at 8.3/8.3.0.1 & one or more media servers < 8.3 | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| versions < 8.3 | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |

### Mitigation

Mitigation for environments with clients or media servers that are unable to upgrade to 8.3 or newer versions (perform both):

* Remove non-administrator access from all NetBackup servers. Users that are not system administrators or NetBackup administrators should not be able to log in (at the OS level) or execute commands on the NetBackup primary and media server.
* Review the SERVER and MEDIA\_SERVER entries in the bp.conf/host properties and remove entries for systems that are not at NetBackup 8.3 or higher.

### Notes

A best practice for all NetBackup environments is to review the SERVER and MEDIA\_SERVER entries in bp.conf/host properties for each host and to remove entries for systems that no longer exist or do not communicate with this host. This follows the principle of least privilege to limit access to only those systems that need access.

This issue was addressed earlier but a Security Advisory was not generated at that time. NetBackup version 8.3 and later contain the fix and no action is necessary if you are on any of those releases.
