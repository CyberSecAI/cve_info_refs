  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The application loads entire files into memory during upload for processing, which can lead to memory exhaustion if a large file is uploaded.",

    "fixes": [
    "The vulnerability was fixed by loading files in chunks instead of loading the entire file in memory.",

    "Site owners are encouraged to add extra protections outside of Wagtail to limit the size of uploaded files.",
     "Examples of how to do this include:",
     "Nginx: `client_max_body_size`",
     "Apache: `LimitRequestBody`",
      "Cloudflare: Imposes a limit of 100MB - 500MB depending on plan",
      "CloudFront: `SizeConstraint`",
