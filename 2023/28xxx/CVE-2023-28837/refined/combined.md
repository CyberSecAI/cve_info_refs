|  |  | Many thanks to Thibaud Colas for reporting this issue. For further details, please see [the CVE-2023-28836 security advisory](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/security/advisories/GHSA-5286-f2rf-35c2). |

|  |  | ### CVE-2023-28837: Denial-of-service via memory exhaustion when uploading large files |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | This release addresses a memory exhaustion bug in Wagtail's handling of uploaded images and documents. For both images and documents, files are loaded into memory during upload for additional processing. A user with access to upload images or documents through the Wagtail admin interface could upload a file so large that it results in a crash or denial of service. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | The vulnerability is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without access to the Wagtail admin. It can only be exploited by admin users with permission to upload images or documents. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Many thanks to Jake Howard for reporting this issue. For further details, please see [the CVE-2023-28837 security advisory](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/security/advisories/GHSA-33pv-vcgh-jfg9). |

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.

GeneralPlans & PricingPrivacyResponsible AI
### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.

These can be quite large. Instead pass them straight to Willow to have it read just as much as it needs to

## Wagtail vulnerable to stored Cross-site Scripting attack via ModelAdmin views

High severity

[Vulnerability details](/advisories/GHSA-5286-f2rf-35c2)

## Package

pip

wagtail
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

>= 1.5, < 4.1.4
>= 4.2, < 4.2.2

## Patched versions

4.1.4
4.2.2

## Description

### Impact

A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists on ModelAdmin views within the Wagtail admin interface. A user with a limited-permission editor account for the Wagtail admin could potentially craft pages and documents that, when viewed by a user with higher privileges, could perform actions with that user's credentials. The vulnerability is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without access to the Wagtail admin, and only affects sites with ModelAdmin enabled.

* For page, the vulnerability is in the "Choose a parent page" ModelAdmin view ([`ChooseParentView`](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/reference/contrib/modeladmin/chooseparentview.html#customising-chooseparentview)), available when managing pages via ModelAdmin.
* For documents, the vulnerability is in the ModelAdmin Inspect view ([`InspectView`](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/reference/contrib/modeladmin/inspectview.html#enabling-customising-inspectview)) when displaying document fields.

### Patches

Patched versions have been released as Wagtail 4.1.4 (for the LTS 4.1 branch) and Wagtail 4.2.2 (for the current 4.2 branch).

### Workarounds

Site owners who are unable to upgrade to the new versions can disable or override the corresponding functionality.

#### `ChooseParentView`

For [`ChooseParentView`](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/reference/contrib/modeladmin/chooseparentview.html#modeladmin-choose-parent-view-class):

* Disable ModelAdmin for all page models.
* Or provide a custom view via [`choose_parent_view_class`](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/reference/contrib/modeladmin/chooseparentview.html#id4), with the custom view overriding the `get_form` method.

One of those steps need to be applied for every `ModelAdmin` class hooked into Wagtail where the model is a Wagtail `Page` or sub-class. Here is an example of implementing the custom `ChooseParentView` with patched HTML escaping:

```
from django import forms
from django.utils.translation import gettext as _
from wagtail.contrib.modeladmin.views import ChooseParentView
from wagtail.contrib.modeladmin.forms import ParentChooserForm

class PatchedPageChoiceField(forms.ModelChoiceField):
    """PageChoiceField with plain-text breadcrumbs to patch stored XSS."""
    def label_from_instance(self, obj):
        bits = []
        for ancestor in (
            obj.get_ancestors(inclusive=True).exclude(depth=1).specific(defer=True)
        ):
            bits.append(ancestor.get_admin_display_title())
        return ' | '.join(bits)

class PatchedParentChooserForm(ParentChooserForm):
    """ParentChooserForm with custom parent_page to patch stored XSS."""
    parent_page = PatchedPageChoiceField(
        label=_("Parent page"),
        required=True,
        empty_label=None,
        queryset=Page.objects.none(),
        widget=forms.RadioSelect(),
    )

class PatchedChooseParentView(ChooseParentView):
    """ChooseParentView with custom get_form patch stored XSS."""
    def get_form(self, request):
        parents = self.permission_helper.get_valid_parent_pages(request.user)
        return PatchedParentChooserForm(parents, request.POST or None)
```
#### `InspectView`

For [`InspectView`](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/reference/contrib/modeladmin/inspectview.html#enabling-customising-inspectview):

* Remove `inspect_view_enabled=True` or set it to False to disable the view.
* Or use [`inspect_view_fields`](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/reference/contrib/modeladmin/inspectview.html#modeladmin-inspect-view-fields) or [`inspect_view_fields_exclude`](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/reference/contrib/modeladmin/inspectview.html#modeladmin-inspect-view-fields-exclude) to prevent displaying document fields in the views.
* Or provide a custom view via [`inspect_view_class`](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/reference/contrib/modeladmin/inspectview.html#id12), with the custom view overriding the `get_document_field_display` method.

One of those steps need to be applied for every `ModelAdmin` class hooked into Wagtail where `inspect_view_enabled=True`. Here is an example of implementing the custom `InspectView` with patched HTML escaping:

```
from django.template.defaultfilters import filesizeformat
from django.utils.html import format_html
from wagtail.contrib.modeladmin.views import InspectView

class PatchedInspectView(InspectView):
    """InspectView with override to patch stored XSS vulnerability."""
    def get_document_field_display(self, field_name, field):
        """Render a link to a document"""
        document = getattr(self.instance, field_name)
        if document:
            return format_html(
                '<a href="{}">{} <span class="meta">({}, {})</span></a>',
                document.url,
                document.title,
                document.file_extension.upper(),
                filesizeformat(document.file.size),
            )
        return self.model_admin.get_empty_value_display(field_name)

# CVSS v4 base metrics

##### Exploitability Metrics

Attack Vector:
This metric reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible. This metric value (and consequently the resulting severity) will be larger the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable system. The assumption is that the number of potential attackers for a vulnerability that could be exploited from across a network is larger than the number of potential attackers that could exploit a vulnerability requiring physical access to a device, and therefore warrants a greater severity.

Attack Complexity:
This metric captures measurable actions that must be taken by the attacker to actively evade or circumvent existing built-in security-enhancing conditions in order to obtain a working exploit. These are conditions whose primary purpose is to increase security and/or increase exploit engineering complexity. A vulnerability exploitable without a target-specific variable has a lower complexity than a vulnerability that would require non-trivial customization. This metric is meant to capture security mechanisms utilized by the vulnerable system.

Attack Requirements:
This metric captures the prerequisite deployment and execution conditions or variables of the vulnerable system that enable the attack. These differ from security-enhancing techniques/technologies (ref Attack Complexity) as the primary purpose of these conditions is not to explicitly mitigate attacks, but rather, emerge naturally as a consequence of the deployment and execution of the vulnerable system.

Privileges Required:
This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess prior to successfully exploiting the vulnerability. The method by which the attacker obtains privileged credentials prior to the attack (e.g., free trial accounts), is outside the scope of this metric. Generally, self-service provisioned accounts do not constitute a privilege requirement if the attacker can grant themselves privileges as part of the attack.

User interaction:
This metric captures the requirement for a human user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise of the vulnerable system. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner.
##### Vulnerable System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the VULNERABLE SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.
##### Subsequent System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.

## Wagtail vulnerable to denial-of-service via memory exhaustion when uploading large files

Moderate severity

GitHub Reviewed

Published
Apr 3, 2023
in
[wagtail/wagtail](/wagtail/wagtail)
•
Updated Nov 19, 2024

[Vulnerability details](/advisories/GHSA-33pv-vcgh-jfg9)
[Dependabot alerts
0](/advisories/GHSA-33pv-vcgh-jfg9/dependabot)

## Package

pip

wagtail
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

>= 4.2, < 4.2.2
< 4.1.4

## Patched versions

4.2.2
4.1.4

## Description

### Impact

A memory exhaustion bug exists in Wagtail's handling of uploaded images and documents. For both images and documents, files are loaded into memory during upload for additional processing. A user with access to upload images or documents through the Wagtail admin interface could upload a file so large that it results in a crash or denial of service.

The vulnerability is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without access to the Wagtail admin. It can only be exploited by admin users with permission to upload images or documents.

Image uploads are [restricted to 10MB by default](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/reference/settings.html#wagtailimages-max-upload-size), however this validation only happens on the frontend and on the backend after the vulnerable code.

### Patches

Patched versions have been released as Wagtail 4.1.4 (for the LTS 4.1 branch) and Wagtail 4.2.2 (for the current 4.2 branch).

### Workarounds

Site owners who are unable to upgrade to the new versions are encouraged to add extra protections outside of Wagtail to limit the size of uploaded files. Exactly how this is done will vary based on your hosting environment, but here are a few references for common setups:

* Nginx: [`client_max_body_size`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#client_max_body_size)
* Apache: [`LimitRequestBody`](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/core.html#limitrequestbody)
* Cloudflare: Already [imposes a limit of 100MB - 500MB](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/about/default-cache-behavior#customization-options-and-limitations) depending on plan
* CloudFront: [`SizeConstraint`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/APIReference/API_SizeConstraintStatement.html)
* Traefik: [`traefik.http.middlewares.limit.buffering.maxRequestBodyBytes`](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/middlewares/http/buffering/#maxrequestbodybytes)

The changes themselves are deep inside Wagtail, making patching incredibly difficult.

# CVSS v4 base metrics

##### Exploitability Metrics

Attack Vector:
This metric reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible. This metric value (and consequently the resulting severity) will be larger the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable system. The assumption is that the number of potential attackers for a vulnerability that could be exploited from across a network is larger than the number of potential attackers that could exploit a vulnerability requiring physical access to a device, and therefore warrants a greater severity.

Attack Complexity:
This metric captures measurable actions that must be taken by the attacker to actively evade or circumvent existing built-in security-enhancing conditions in order to obtain a working exploit. These are conditions whose primary purpose is to increase security and/or increase exploit engineering complexity. A vulnerability exploitable without a target-specific variable has a lower complexity than a vulnerability that would require non-trivial customization. This metric is meant to capture security mechanisms utilized by the vulnerable system.

Attack Requirements:
This metric captures the prerequisite deployment and execution conditions or variables of the vulnerable system that enable the attack. These differ from security-enhancing techniques/technologies (ref Attack Complexity) as the primary purpose of these conditions is not to explicitly mitigate attacks, but rather, emerge naturally as a consequence of the deployment and execution of the vulnerable system.

Privileges Required:
This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess prior to successfully exploiting the vulnerability. The method by which the attacker obtains privileged credentials prior to the attack (e.g., free trial accounts), is outside the scope of this metric. Generally, self-service provisioned accounts do not constitute a privilege requirement if the attacker can grant themselves privileges as part of the attack.

User interaction:
This metric captures the requirement for a human user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise of the vulnerable system. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner.
##### Vulnerable System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the VULNERABLE SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.
##### Subsequent System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.

# Stored XSS attack via ModelAdmin views

Moderate

[gasman](/gasman)
published
GHSA-5286-f2rf-35c2
Apr 3, 2023

## Package

pip

wagtail
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

1.5 - 4.1.4, 4.2, 4.2.1

## Patched versions

4.1.4, 4.2.2

## Description

### Impact

A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists on ModelAdmin views within the Wagtail admin interface. A user with a limited-permission editor account for the Wagtail admin could potentially craft pages and documents that, when viewed by a user with higher privileges, could perform actions with that user's credentials. The vulnerability is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without access to the Wagtail admin, and only affects sites with ModelAdmin enabled.

* For page, the vulnerability is in the "Choose a parent page" ModelAdmin view ([`ChooseParentView`](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/reference/contrib/modeladmin/chooseparentview.html#customising-chooseparentview)), available when managing pages via ModelAdmin.
* For documents, the vulnerability is in the ModelAdmin Inspect view ([`InspectView`](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/reference/contrib/modeladmin/inspectview.html#enabling-customising-inspectview)) when displaying document fields.

We classify this vulnerability as Moderate according to the [severity levels used by Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/security/#how-django-discloses-security-issues).

### Patches

Patched versions have been released as Wagtail 4.1.4 (for the LTS 4.1 branch) and Wagtail 4.2.2 (for the current 4.2 branch).

### Workarounds

Site owners who are unable to upgrade to the new versions can disable or override the corresponding functionality.

#### `ChooseParentView`

For [`ChooseParentView`](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/reference/contrib/modeladmin/chooseparentview.html#modeladmin-choose-parent-view-class):

* Disable ModelAdmin for all page models.
* Or provide a custom view via [`choose_parent_view_class`](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/reference/contrib/modeladmin/chooseparentview.html#id4), with the custom view overriding the `get_form` method.

One of those steps need to be applied for every `ModelAdmin` class hooked into Wagtail where the model is a Wagtail `Page` or sub-class. Here is an example of implementing the custom `ChooseParentView` with patched HTML escaping:

```
from django import forms
from django.utils.translation import gettext as _
from wagtail.contrib.modeladmin.views import ChooseParentView
from wagtail.contrib.modeladmin.forms import ParentChooserForm

class PatchedPageChoiceField(forms.ModelChoiceField):
    """PageChoiceField with plain-text breadcrumbs to patch stored XSS."""
    def label_from_instance(self, obj):
        bits = []
        for ancestor in (
            obj.get_ancestors(inclusive=True).exclude(depth=1).specific(defer=True)
        ):
            bits.append(ancestor.get_admin_display_title())
        return ' | '.join(bits)

class PatchedParentChooserForm(ParentChooserForm):
    """ParentChooserForm with custom parent_page to patch stored XSS."""
    parent_page = PatchedPageChoiceField(
        label=_("Parent page"),
        required=True,
        empty_label=None,
        queryset=Page.objects.none(),
        widget=forms.RadioSelect(),
    )

class PatchedChooseParentView(ChooseParentView):
    """ChooseParentView with custom get_form patch stored XSS."""
    def get_form(self, request):
        parents = self.permission_helper.get_valid_parent_pages(request.user)
        return PatchedParentChooserForm(parents, request.POST or None)
```
#### `InspectView`

For [`InspectView`](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/reference/contrib/modeladmin/inspectview.html#enabling-customising-inspectview):

* Remove `inspect_view_enabled=True` or set it to False to disable the view.
* Or use [`inspect_view_fields`](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/reference/contrib/modeladmin/inspectview.html#modeladmin-inspect-view-fields) or [`inspect_view_fields_exclude`](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/reference/contrib/modeladmin/inspectview.html#modeladmin-inspect-view-fields-exclude) to prevent displaying document fields in the views.
* Or provide a custom view via [`inspect_view_class`](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/reference/contrib/modeladmin/inspectview.html#id12), with the custom view overriding the `get_document_field_display` method.

One of those steps need to be applied for every `ModelAdmin` class hooked into Wagtail where `inspect_view_enabled=True`. Here is an example of implementing the custom `InspectView` with patched HTML escaping:

```
from django.template.defaultfilters import filesizeformat
from django.utils.html import format_html
from wagtail.contrib.modeladmin.views import InspectView

class PatchedInspectView(InspectView):
    """InspectView with override to patch stored XSS vulnerability."""
    def get_document_field_display(self, field_name, field):
        """Render a link to a document"""
        document = getattr(self.instance, field_name)
        if document:
            return format_html(
                '<a href="{}">{} <span class="meta">({}, {})</span></a>',
                document.url,
                document.title,
                document.file_extension.upper(),
                filesizeformat(document.file.size),
            )
        return self.model_admin.get_empty_value_display(field_name)
```

# Denial-of-service via memory exhaustion when uploading large files

Moderate

[gasman](/gasman)
published
GHSA-33pv-vcgh-jfg9
Apr 3, 2023

## Package

pip

wagtail
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 4.1.4, 4.2, 4.2.1

## Patched versions

4.1.4, 4.2.2

## Description

### Impact

A memory exhaustion bug exists in Wagtail's handling of uploaded images and documents. For both images and documents, files are loaded into memory during upload for additional processing. A user with access to upload images or documents through the Wagtail admin interface could upload a file so large that it results in a crash or denial of service.

The vulnerability is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without access to the Wagtail admin. It can only be exploited by admin users with permission to upload images or documents.

Image uploads are [restricted to 10MB by default](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/reference/settings.html#wagtailimages-max-upload-size), however this validation only happens on the frontend and on the backend after the vulnerable code.

We classify this vulnerability as Moderate according to the [severity levels used by Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/security/#how-django-discloses-security-issues).

### Patches

Patched versions have been released as Wagtail 4.1.4 (for the LTS 4.1 branch) and Wagtail 4.2.2 (for the current 4.2 branch).

### Workarounds

Site owners who are unable to upgrade to the new versions are encouraged to add extra protections outside of Wagtail to limit the size of uploaded files. Exactly how this is done will vary based on your hosting environment, but here are a few references for common setups:

* Nginx: [`client_max_body_size`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#client_max_body_size)
* Apache: [`LimitRequestBody`](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/core.html#limitrequestbody)
* Cloudflare: Already [imposes a limit of 100MB - 500MB](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/about/default-cache-behavior#customization-options-and-limitations) depending on plan
* CloudFront: [`SizeConstraint`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/APIReference/API_SizeConstraintStatement.html)
* Traefik: [`traefik.http.middlewares.limit.buffering.maxRequestBodyBytes`](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/middlewares/http/buffering/#maxrequestbodybytes)

The changes themselves are deep inside Wagtail, making patching incredibly difficult.

### Acknowledgements

Many thanks to [Jake Howard](https://github.com/RealOrangeOne) for reporting this issue.

# Settings[¶](#settings "Link to this heading")

Wagtail makes use of the following settings, in addition to [Django’s core settings](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/settings/ "Django 5.1")`:

## Sites[¶](#sites "Link to this heading")

### `WAGTAIL_SITE_NAME`[¶](#wagtail-site-name "Link to this heading")

```
WAGTAIL_SITE_NAME = 'Stark Industries Skunkworks'

```

This is the human-readable name of your Wagtail install which welcomes users upon login to the Wagtail admin.

### `WAGTAILADMIN_BASE_URL`[¶](#wagtailadmin-base-url "Link to this heading")

```
WAGTAILADMIN_BASE_URL = 'http://example.com'

```

This is the base URL used by the Wagtail admin site. It is typically used for generating URLs to include in notification emails.

If this setting is not present, Wagtail will try to fall back to `request.site.root_url` or to the request’s host name.

## Append Slash[¶](#append-slash "Link to this heading")

### `WAGTAIL_APPEND_SLASH`[¶](#wagtail-append-slash "Link to this heading")

```
# Don't add a trailing slash to Wagtail-served URLs
WAGTAIL_APPEND_SLASH = False

```

Similar to Django’s `APPEND_SLASH`, this setting controls how Wagtail will handle requests that don’t end in a trailing slash.

When `WAGTAIL_APPEND_SLASH` is `True` (default), requests to Wagtail pages which omit a trailing slash will be redirected by Django’s [`CommonMiddleware`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/middleware/#django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware "(in Django v5.1)") to a URL with a trailing slash.

When `WAGTAIL_APPEND_SLASH` is `False`, requests to Wagtail pages will be served both with and without trailing slashes. Page links generated by Wagtail, however, will not include trailing slashes.

Note

If you use the `False` setting, keep in mind that serving your pages both with and without slashes may affect search engines’ ability to index your site. See [this Google Search Central Blog post](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2010/04/to-slash-or-not-to-slash) for more details.

## Search[¶](#search "Link to this heading")

### `WAGTAILSEARCH_BACKENDS`[¶](#wagtailsearch-backends "Link to this heading")

```
WAGTAILSEARCH_BACKENDS = {
    'default': {
        'BACKEND': 'wagtail.search.backends.elasticsearch8',
        'INDEX': 'myapp'
    }
}

```

Define a search backend. For a full explanation, see [Backends](../topics/search/backends.html#wagtailsearch-backends).

### `WAGTAILSEARCH_HITS_MAX_AGE`[¶](#wagtailsearch-hits-max-age "Link to this heading")

```
WAGTAILSEARCH_HITS_MAX_AGE = 14

```

Set the number of days (default 7) that search query logs are kept for; these are used to identify popular search terms for [promoted search results](contrib/searchpromotions.html#editors-picks). Queries older than this will be removed by the [searchpromotions\_garbage\_collect](contrib/searchpromotions.html#searchpromotions-garbage-collect) command.

## Internationalization[¶](#internationalization "Link to this heading")

Wagtail supports the internationalization of content by maintaining separate trees of pages for each language.

For a guide on how to enable internationalization on your site, see the [configuration guide](../advanced_topics/i18n.html#enabling-internationalisation).

### `WAGTAIL_I18N_ENABLED`[¶](#wagtail-i18n-enabled "Link to this heading")

(boolean, default `False`)

When set to `True`, Wagtail’s internationalization features will be enabled:

```
WAGTAIL_I18N_ENABLED = True

```

### `WAGTAIL_CONTENT_LANGUAGES`[¶](#wagtail-content-languages "Link to this heading")

(list, default `[]`)

A list of languages and/or locales that Wagtail content can be authored in.

For example:

```
WAGTAIL_CONTENT_LANGUAGES = [
    ('en', _("English")),
    ('fr', _("French")),
]

```

Each item in the list is a 2-tuple containing a language code and a display name.
The language code can either be a language code on its own (such as `en`, `fr`), or it can include a region code (such as `en-gb`, `fr-fr`).
You can mix the two formats if you only need to localize in some regions but not others.

This setting follows the same structure as Django’s `LANGUAGES` setting, so they can both be set to the same value:

```
LANGUAGES = WAGTAIL_CONTENT_LANGUAGES = [
    ('en-gb', _("English (United Kingdom)")),
    ('en-us', _("English (United States)")),
    ('es-es', _("Spanish (Spain)")),
    ('es-mx', _("Spanish (Mexico)")),
]

```

However having them separate allows you to configure many different regions on your site yet have them share Wagtail content (but defer on things like date formatting, currency, etc):

```
LANGUAGES = [
    ('en', _("English (United Kingdom)")),
    ('en-us', _("English (United States)")),
    ('es', _("Spanish (Spain)")),
    ('es-mx', _("Spanish (Mexico)")),
]

WAGTAIL_CONTENT_LANGUAGES = [
    ('en', _("English")),
    ('es', _("Spanish")),
]

```

This would mean that your site will respond on the `https://www.mysite.com/es/` and `https://www.mysite.com/es-MX/` URLs, but both of them will serve content from the same “Spanish” tree in Wagtail.

Note

`WAGTAIL_CONTENT_LANGUAGES` must be a subset of `LANGUAGES`

Note that all languages that exist in `WAGTAIL_CONTENT_LANGUAGES` must also exist in your `LANGUAGES` setting. This is so that Wagtail can generate a live URL to these pages from an untranslated context (such as the admin interface).

## Embeds[¶](#embeds "Link to this heading")

Wagtail supports generating embed code from URLs to content on external providers such as YouTube or X (formerly Twitter). By default, Wagtail will fetch the embed code directly from the relevant provider’s site using the oEmbed protocol.
Wagtail has a built-in list of the most common providers.

The embeds fetching can be fully configured using the `WAGTAILEMBEDS_FINDERS` setting. This is fully documented in [Configuring embed “finders”](../advanced_topics/embeds.html#configuring-embed-finders).

### `WAGTAILEMBEDS_RESPONSIVE_HTML`[¶](#wagtailembeds-responsive-html "Link to this heading")

```
WAGTAILEMBEDS_RESPONSIVE_HTML = True

```

Adds `class="responsive-object"` and an inline `padding-bottom` style to embeds, to assist in making them responsive. See [Responsive Embeds](../topics/writing_templates.html#responsive-embeds) for details.

## Dashboard[¶](#dashboard "Link to this heading")

### `WAGTAILADMIN_RECENT_EDITS_LIMIT`[¶](#wagtailadmin-recent-edits-limit "Link to this heading")

```
WAGTAILADMIN_RECENT_EDITS_LIMIT = 5

```

This setting lets you change the number of items shown at ‘Your most recent edits’ on the dashboard.

## General editing[¶](#general-editing "Link to this heading")

### `WAGTAILADMIN_RICH_TEXT_EDITORS`[¶](#wagtailadmin-rich-text-editors "Link to this heading")

```
WAGTAILADMIN_RICH_TEXT_EDITORS = {
    'default': {
        'WIDGET': 'wagtail.admin.rich_text.DraftailRichTextArea',
        'OPTIONS': {
            'features': ['h2', 'bold', 'italic', 'link', 'document-link']
        }
    },
    'secondary': {
        'WIDGET': 'some.external.RichTextEditor',
    }
}

```

Customize the behavior of rich text fields. By default, `RichTextField` and `RichTextBlock` use the configuration given under the `'default'` key, but this can be overridden on a per-field basis through the `editor` keyword argument, for example `body = RichTextField(editor='secondary')`. Within each configuration block, the following fields are recognized:

* `WIDGET`: The rich text widget implementation to use. Wagtail provides `wagtail.admin.rich_text.DraftailRichTextArea` (a modern extensible editor which enforces well-structured markup). Other widgets may be provided by third-party packages.
* `OPTIONS`: Configuration options to pass to the widget. Recognized options are widget-specific, but `DraftailRichTextArea` accepts a `features` list indicating the active rich text features (see [Limiting features in a rich text field](../advanced_topics/customisation/page_editing_interface.html#rich-text-features)).

If a `'default'` editor is not specified, rich text fields that do not specify an `editor` argument will use the Draftail editor with the default feature set enabled.

### `WAGTAILADMIN_EXTERNAL_LINK_CONVERSION`[¶](#wagtailadmin-external-link-conversion "Link to this heading")

```
WAGTAILADMIN_EXTERNAL_LINK_CONVERSION = 'exact'

```

Customize Wagtail’s behavior when an internal page url is entered in the external link chooser. Possible values for this setting are `'all'`, `'exact'`, `'confirm'`, or `''`. The default, `'all'`, means that Wagtail will automatically convert submitted urls that exactly match page urls to the corresponding internal links. If the url is an inexact match - for example, the submitted url has query parameters - then Wagtail will confirm the conversion with the user. `'exact'` means that any inexact matches will be left as external urls, and the confirmation step will be skipped. `'confirm'` means that every link conversion will be confirmed with the user, even if the match is exact. `''` means that Wagtail will not attempt to convert any urls entered to internal page links.

If the url is relative, Wagtail will not convert the link if there are more than one [`Site`](pages/model_reference.html#wagtail.models.Site "wagtail.models.Site") instances. This is to avoid accidentally matching coincidentally named pages on different sites.

### `WAGTAIL_DATE_FORMAT`, `WAGTAIL_DATETIME_FORMAT`, `WAGTAIL_TIME_FORMAT`[¶](#wagtail-date-format-wagtail-datetime-format-wagtail-time-format "Link to this heading")

```
WAGTAIL_DATE_FORMAT = '%d.%m.%Y.'
WAGTAIL_DATETIME_FORMAT = '%d.%m.%Y. %H:%M'
WAGTAIL_TIME_FORMAT = '%H:%M'

```

Specifies the date, time, and datetime format to be used in input fields in the Wagtail admin. The format is specified in [Python datetime module syntax](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-strptime-behavior) and must be one of the recognized formats listed in the `DATE_INPUT_FORMATS`, `TIME_INPUT_FORMATS`, or `DATETIME_INPUT_FORMATS` setting respectively (see [DATE\_INPUT\_FORMATS](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/settings/#std:setting-DATE_INPUT_FORMATS)).

For example, to use US Imperial style date and time format (AM/PM times) in the Wagtail Admin, you’ll need to override the Django format for your site’s locale.

```
# settings.py
WAGTAIL_TIME_FORMAT = "%I:%M %p"  # 03:00 PM
WAGTAIL_DATE_FORMAT = '%m/%d/%Y'  # 01/31/2004
WAGTAIL_DATETIME_FORMAT = '%m/%d/%Y %I:%M %p'  # 01/31/2004 03:00 PM

# Django uses formatting based on the system locale.
# Therefore we must specify a locale and then override the date
# formatting for that locale.
FORMAT_MODULE_PATH = ["formats"]
LANGUAGE_CODE = "en-US"

```

Next create the file `formats/en_US/formats.py` in your project:

```
# formats/en_US/formats.py

# Append our custom format to the Django defaults.
TIME_INPUT_FORMATS = [
    "%H:%M:%S",  # '14:30:59'
    "%H:%M:%S.%f",  # '14:30:59.000200'
    "%H:%M",  # '14:30'
    # Custom
    "%I:%M %p",
]
DATETIME_INPUT_FORMATS = [
    "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S",  # '2006-10-25 14:30:59'
    "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%f",  # '2006-10-25 14:30:59.000200'
    "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M",  # '2006-10-25 14:30'
    "%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S",  # '10/25/2006 14:30:59'
    "%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S.%f",  # '10/25/2006 14:30:59.000200'
    "%m/%d/%Y %H:%M",  # '10/25/2006 14:30'
    "%m/%d/%y %H:%M:%S",  # '10/25/06 14:30:59'
    "%m/%d/%y %H:%M:%S.%f",  # '10/25/06 14:30:59.000200'
    "%m/%d/%y %H:%M",  # '10/25/06 14:30'
    # Custom
    "%m/%d/%Y %I:%M %p",
]

# Here you can also customize: DATE_INPUT_FORMATS, DATE_FORMAT,
# DATETIME_FORMAT, TIME_FORMAT, SHORT_DATE_FORMAT.

```

## Page editing[¶](#page-editing "Link to this heading")

### `WAGTAILADMIN_COMMENTS_ENABLED`[¶](#wagtailadmin-comments-enabled "Link to this heading")

```
# Disable commenting
WAGTAILADMIN_COMMENTS_ENABLED = False

```

Sets whether commenting is enabled for pages (`True` by default).

### `WAGTAIL_ALLOW_UNICODE_SLUGS`[¶](#wagtail-allow-unicode-slugs "Link to this heading")

```
WAGTAIL_ALLOW_UNICODE_SLUGS = True

```

By default, page slugs can contain any alphanumeric characters, including non-Latin alphabets. Set this to False to limit slugs to ASCII characters.

### `WAGTAIL_AUTO_UPDATE_PREVIEW`[¶](#wagtail-auto-update-preview "Link to this heading")

```
WAGTAIL_AUTO_UPDATE_PREVIEW = True

```

When enabled, the preview panel in the page editor is automatically updated on each change. If set to `False`, a refresh button will be shown and the preview is only updated when the button is clicked.
This behavior is enabled by default.

Changed in version 6.3: This setting is deprecated. Set `WAGTAIL_AUTO_UPDATE_PREVIEW_INTERVAL = 0` to disable automatic preview updates instead.

### `WAGTAIL_AUTO_UPDATE_PREVIEW_INTERVAL`[¶](#wagtail-auto-update-preview-interval "Link to this heading")

```
WAGTAIL_AUTO_UPDATE_PREVIEW_INTERVAL = 500

```

The interval (in milliseconds) to automatically check for changes made in the page or snippet editor before updating the preview in the preview panel. The default value is `500`.

If set to `0`, a refresh button will be shown in the panel and the preview is only updated when the button is clicked.

To completely disable previews, set [preview modes](pages/model_reference.html#wagtail.models.Page.preview_modes "wagtail.models.Page.preview_modes") to be empty on your model (`preview_modes = []`).

### `WAGTAIL_EDITING_SESSION_PING_INTERVAL`[¶](#wagtail-editing-session-ping-interval "Link to this heading")

```
WAGTAIL_EDITING_SESSION_PING_INTERVAL = 10000

```

The interval (in milliseconds) to ping the server during an editing session. This is used to indicate that the session is active, as well as to display the list of other sessions that are currently editing the same content. The default value is `10000` (10 seconds). In order to effectively display the sessions list, this value needs to be set to under 1 minute. If set to `0`, the interval will be disabled.

### `WAGTAILADMIN_GLOBAL_EDIT_LOCK`[¶](#wagtailadmin-global-edit-lock "Link to this heading")

`WAGTAILADMIN_GLOBAL_EDIT_LOCK` can be set to `True` to prevent users from editing pages and snippets that they have locked.

### `WAGTAILADMIN_UNSAFE_PAGE_DELETION_LIMIT`[¶](#wagtailadmin-unsafe-page-deletion-limit "Link to this heading")

```
WAGTAILADMIN_UNSAFE_PAGE_DELETION_LIMIT = 20

```

This setting enables an additional confirmation step when deleting a page with a large number of child pages. If the number of pages is greater than or equal to this limit (10 by default), the user must enter the site name (as defined by `WAGTAIL_SITE_NAME`) to proceed.

## Images[¶](#images "Link to this heading")

### `WAGTAILIMAGES_IMAGE_MODEL`[¶](#wagtailimages-image-model "Link to this heading")

```
WAGTAILIMAGES_IMAGE_MODEL = 'myapp.MyImage'

```

This setting lets you provide your own image model for use in Wagtail, which should extend the built-in `AbstractImage` class.

### `WAGTAILIMAGES_IMAGE_FORM_BASE`[¶](#wagtailimages-image-form-base "Link to this heading")

```
WAGTAILIMAGES_IMAGE_FORM_BASE = 'myapp.forms.MyImageBaseForm'

```

This setting lets you provide your own image base form for use in Wagtail, which should extend the built-in `BaseImageForm` class.
You can use it to specify or override the widgets to use in the admin form.

### `WAGTAILIMAGES_MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE`[¶](#wagtailimages-max-upload-size "Link to this heading")

```
WAGTAILIMAGES_MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE = 20 * 1024 * 1024  # 20MB

```

This setting lets you override the maximum upload size for images (in bytes). If omitted, Wagtail will fall back to using its 10MB default value.

### `WAGTAILIMAGES_MAX_IMAGE_PIXELS`[¶](#wagtailimages-max-image-pixels "Link to this heading")

```
WAGTAILIMAGES_MAX_IMAGE_PIXELS = 128000000  # 128 megapixels

```

This setting lets you override the maximum number of pixels an image can have. If omitted, Wagtail will fall back to using its 128 megapixels default value. The pixel count takes animation frames into account - for example, a 25-frame animation of size 100x100 is considered to have 100 \_ 100 \_ 25 = 250000 pixels.

### `WAGTAILIMAGES_FEATURE_DETECTION_ENABLED`[¶](#wagtailimages-feature-detection-enabled "Link to this heading")

```
WAGTAILIMAGES_FEATURE_DETECTION_ENABLED = True

```

This setting enables feature detection once OpenCV is installed, see all details on the [Feature Detection](../advanced_topics/images/feature_detection.html#image-feature-detection) documentation.

### `WAGTAILIMAGES_INDEX_PAGE_SIZE`[¶](#wagtailimages-index-page-size "Link to this heading")

```
WAGTAILIMAGES_INDEX_PAGE_SIZE = 30

```

Specifies the number of images per page shown on the main Images listing in the Wagtail admin.

### `WAGTAILIMAGES_USAGE_PAGE_SIZE`[¶](#wagtailimages-usage-page-size "Link to this heading")

```
WAGTAILIMAGES_USAGE_PAGE_SIZE = 20

```

Specifies the number of items per page shown when viewing an image’s usage.

### `WAGTAILIMAGES_CHOOSER_PAGE_SIZE`[¶](#wagtailimages-chooser-page-size "Link to this heading")

```
WAGTAILIMAGES_CHOOSER_PAGE_SIZE = 12

```

Specifies the number of images shown per page in the image chooser modal.

### `WAGTAILIMAGES_RENDITION_STORAGE`[¶](#wagtailimages-rendition-storage "Link to this heading")

```
# Recommended
WAGTAILIMAGES_RENDITION_STORAGE = 'my_custom_storage'
# Or
WAGTAILIMAGES_RENDITION_STORAGE = 'myapp.backends.MyCustomStorage'
WAGTAILIMAGES_RENDITION_STORAGE = MyCustomStorage()

```

This setting allows image renditions to be stored using an alternative storage configuration. It is recommended to use a storage alias defined in [Django’s STORAGES setting](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/settings/#std-setting-STORAGES). Alternatively, this setting also accepts a dotted module path to a `Storage` subclass, or an instance of such a subclass. The default is `None`, meaning renditions will use the project’s default storage.

Custom storage classes should subclass `django.core.files.storage.Storage`. See the [Django file storage API](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/files/storage/ "(in Django v5.1)") for more information.

### `WAGTAILIMAGES_EXTENSIONS`[¶](#wagtailimages-extensions "Link to this heading")

```
WAGTAILIMAGES_EXTENSIONS = ['png', 'jpg']

```

A list of allowed image extensions that will be validated during image uploading.
If this isn’t supplied, all of AVIF, GIF, JPG, JPEG, PNG, WEBP are allowed.
Warning: this doesn’t always ensure that the uploaded file is valid as files can
be renamed to have an extension no matter what data they contain.

## Documents[¶](#documents "Link to this heading")

### `WAGTAILDOCS_DOCUMENT_MODEL`[¶](#wagtaildocs-document-model "Link to this heading")

```
WAGTAILDOCS_DOCUMENT_MODEL = 'myapp.MyDocument'

```

This setting lets you provide your own document model for use in Wagtail, which should extend the built-in `AbstractDocument` class.

### `WAGTAILDOCS_DOCUMENT_FORM_BASE`[¶](#wagtaildocs-document-form-base "Link to this heading")

```
WAGTAILDOCS_DOCUMENT_FORM_BASE = 'myapp.forms.MyDocumentBaseForm'

```

This setting lets you provide your own Document base form for use in Wagtail, which should extend the built-in `BaseDocumentForm` class.
You can use it to specify or override the widgets to use in the admin form.

### `WAGTAILDOCS_SERVE_METHOD`[¶](#wagtaildocs-serve-method "Link to this heading")

```
WAGTAILDOCS_SERVE_METHOD = 'redirect'

```

Determines how document downloads will be linked to and served. Normally, requests for documents are sent through a Django view, to perform privacy checks (see [Collection Privacy settings](https://guide.wagtail.org/en-latest/how-to-guides/manage-collections/#privacy-settings)) and potentially other housekeeping tasks such as hit counting. To fully protect against users bypassing this check, it needs to happen in the same request where the document is served; however, this incurs a performance hit as the document then needs to be served by the Django server. In particular, this cancels out much of the benefit of hosting documents on external storage, such as S3 or a CDN.

For this reason, Wagtail provides several serving methods that trade some of the strictness of the permission check for performance:

* `'direct'` - links to documents point directly to the URL provided by the underlying storage, bypassing the Django view that provides the permission check. This is most useful when deploying sites as fully static HTML (for example using [wagtail-bakery](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail-bakery) or [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)).
* `'redirect'` - links to documents point to a Django view which will check the user’s permission; if successful, it will redirect to the URL provided by the underlying storage to allow the document to be downloaded. This is most suitable for remote storage backends such as S3, as it allows the document to be served independently of the Django server. Note that if a user can guess the latter URL, they will be able to bypass the permission check; some storage backends may provide configuration options to generate a random or short-lived URL to mitigate this.
* `'serve_view'` - links to documents point to a Django view which both checks the user’s permission and serves the document. Serving will be handled by [django-sendfile](https://github.com/johnsensible/django-sendfile), if this is installed and supported by your server configuration, or as a streaming response from Django if not. When using this method, it is recommended that you configure your webserver to *disallow* serving documents directly from their location under `MEDIA_ROOT`, as this would provide a way to bypass the permission check.

If `WAGTAILDOCS_SERVE_METHOD` is unspecified or set to `None`, the default method is `'redirect'` when a remote storage backend is in use (one that exposes a URL but not a local filesystem path), and `'serve_view'` otherwise. Finally, some storage backends may not expose a URL at all; in this case, serving will proceed as for `'serve_view'`.

Warning

Allowing direct access to document URLs within `MEDIA_ROOT` may present a security risk if untrusted users are allowed to upload documents - in this case additional configuration will be required at the webserver level to handle these securely. See [User Uploaded Files](../deployment/under_the_hood.html#user-uploaded-files).

### `WAGTAILDOCS_CONTENT_TYPES`[¶](#wagtaildocs-content-types "Link to this heading")

```
WAGTAILDOCS_CONTENT_TYPES = {
    'pdf': 'application/pdf',
    'txt': 'text/plain',
}

```

Specifies the MIME content type that will be returned for the given file extension, when using the `serve_view` method. Content types not listed here will be guessed using the Python `mimetypes.guess_type` function, or `application/octet-stream` if unsuccessful.

### `WAGTAILDOCS_INLINE_CONTENT_TYPES`[¶](#wagtaildocs-inline-content-types "Link to this heading")

```
WAGTAILDOCS_INLINE_CONTENT_TYPES = ['application/pdf', 'text/plain']

```

A list of MIME content types that will be shown inline in the browser (by serving the HTTP header `Content-Disposition: inline`) rather than served as a download, when using the `serve_view` method. Defaults to `application/pdf`.

### `WAGTAILDOCS_EXTENSIONS`[¶](#wagtaildocs-extensions "Link to this heading")

```
WAGTAILDOCS_EXTENSIONS = ['pdf', 'docx']

```

A list of allowed document extensions that will be validated during document uploading.
If this isn’t supplied all document extensions are allowed. This doesn’t ensure that the uploaded file is valid, as files can be renamed to have an extension no matter what data they contain.

Warning

Allowing all file types may present a security risk if untrusted users are allowed to upload documents - in this case additional configuration will be required at the webserver level to handle these securely. See [User Uploaded Files](../deployment/under_the_hood.html#user-uploaded-files).

## User Management[¶](#user-management "Link to this heading")

### `WAGTAIL_PASSWORD_MANAGEMENT_ENABLED`[¶](#wagtail-password-management-enabled "Link to this heading")

```
WAGTAIL_PASSWORD_MANAGEMENT_ENABLED = True

```

This specifies whether users are allowed to change their passwords (enabled by default).

### `WAGTAIL_PASSWORD_RESET_ENABLED`[¶](#wagtail-password-reset-enabled "Link to this heading")

```
WAGTAIL_PASSWORD_RESET_ENABLED = True

```

This specifies whether users are allowed to reset their passwords. Defaults to the same as `WAGTAIL_PASSWORD_MANAGEMENT_ENABLED`. Password reset emails will be sent from the address specified in Django’s `DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL` setting.

### `WAGTAILUSERS_PASSWORD_ENABLED`[¶](#wagtailusers-password-enabled "Link to this heading")

```
WAGTAILUSERS_PASSWORD_ENABLED = True

```

This specifies whether password fields are shown when creating or editing users through Settings -> Users (enabled by default). Set this to False (along with `WAGTAIL_PASSWORD_MANAGEMENT_ENABLED` and `WAGTAIL_PASSWORD_RESET_ENABLED`) if your users are authenticated through an external system such as LDAP.

### `WAGTAILUSERS_PASSWORD_REQUIRED`[¶](#wagtailusers-password-required "Link to this heading")

```
WAGTAILUSERS_PASSWORD_REQUIRED = True

```

This specifies whether password is a required field when creating a new user. True by default; ignored if `WAGTAILUSERS_PASSWORD_ENABLED` is false. If this is set to False, and the password field is left blank when creating a user, then that user will have no usable password; to log in, they will have to reset their password (if `WAGTAIL_PASSWORD_RESET_ENABLED` is True) or use an alternative authentication system such as LDAP (if one is set up).

### `WAGTAIL_EMAIL_MANAGEMENT_ENABLED`[¶](#wagtail-email-management-enabled "Link to this heading")

```
WAGTAIL_EMAIL_MANAGEMENT_ENABLED = True

```

This specifies whether users are allowed to change their email (enabled by default).

### `WAGTAILADMIN_USER_PASSWORD_RESET_FORM`[¶](#wagtailadmin-user-password-reset-form "Link to this heading")

```
WAGTAILADMIN_USER_PASSWORD_RESET_FORM = 'users.forms.PasswordResetForm'

```

Allows the default `PasswordResetForm` to be extended with extra fields.

### `WAGTAIL_USER_EDIT_FORM`[¶](#wagtail-user-edit-form "Link to this heading")

```
WAGTAIL_USER_EDIT_FORM = 'users.forms.CustomUserEditForm'

```

Allows the default `UserEditForm` class to be overridden with a custom form when a custom user model is being used and extra fields are required in the user edit form.

Changed in version 6.2: This setting has been deprecated in favor of customizing the form classes via `UserViewSet.get_form_class()` and will be removed in a future release. For further information, see [Creating a custom UserViewSet](../advanced_topics/customisation/custom_user_models.html#custom-userviewset).

### `WAGTAIL_USER_CREATION_FORM`[¶](#wagtail-user-creation-form "Link to this heading")

```
WAGTAIL_USER_CREATION_FORM = 'users.forms.CustomUserCreationForm'

```

Allows the default `UserCreationForm` class to be overridden with a custom form when a custom user model is being used and extra fields are required in the user creation form.

Changed in version 6.2: This setting has been deprecated in favor of customizing the form classes via `UserViewSet.get_form_class()` and will be removed in a future release. For further information, see [Creating a custom UserViewSet](../advanced_topics/customisation/custom_user_models.html#custom-userviewset).

### `WAGTAIL_USER_CUSTOM_FIELDS`[¶](#wagtail-user-custom-fields "Link to this heading")

```
WAGTAIL_USER_CUSTOM_FIELDS = ['country']

```

A list of the extra custom fields to be appended to the default list. The resulting list is passed to [`ModelForm`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/forms/modelforms/#django.forms.ModelForm "(in Django v5.1)")’s `Meta.fields` to generate the form fields.

Changed in version 6.2: This setting has been deprecated in favor of customizing the form classes via `UserViewSet.get_form_class()` and will be removed in a future release. For further information, see [Creating a custom UserViewSet](../advanced_topics/customisation/custom_user_models.html#custom-userviewset).

### `WAGTAILADMIN_USER_LOGIN_FORM`[¶](#wagtailadmin-user-login-form "Link to this heading")

```
WAGTAILADMIN_USER_LOGIN_FORM = 'users.forms.LoginForm'

```

Allows the default `LoginForm` to be extended with extra fields.

### `WAGTAILADMIN_LOGIN_URL`[¶](#wagtailadmin-login-url "Link to this heading")

```
WAGTAILADMIN_LOGIN_URL = 'http://example.com/login/'

```

This specifies the URL to redirect when a user attempts to access a Wagtail admin page without being logged in. If omitted, Wagtail will fall back to using the standard login view (typically `/admin/login/`).

## User preferences[¶](#user-preferences "Link to this heading")

### `WAGTAIL_GRAVATAR_PROVIDER_URL`[¶](#wagtail-gravatar-provider-url "Link to this heading")

```
WAGTAIL_GRAVATAR_PROVIDER_URL = '//www.gravatar.com/avatar'

```

If a user has not uploaded a profile picture, Wagtail will look for an avatar linked to their email address on gravatar.com. This setting allows you to specify an alternative provider such as like robohash.org, or can be set to `None` to disable the use of remote avatars completely.

### `WAGTAIL_USER_TIME_ZONES`[¶](#wagtail-user-time-zones "Link to this heading")

Logged-in users can choose their current time zone for the admin interface in the account settings. If there is no time zone selected by the user, then `TIME_ZONE` will be used.
(Note that time zones are only applied to datetime fields, not to plain time or date fields. This is a Django design decision.)

By default, this uses the set of timezones returned by `zoneinfo.available_timezones()`.
It is possible to override this list via the `WAGTAIL_USER_TIME_ZONES` setting.
If there is zero or one-time zone permitted, the account settings form will be hidden.

```
WAGTAIL_USER_TIME_ZONES = ['America/Chicago', 'Australia/Sydney', 'Europe/Rome']

```

### `WAGTAILADMIN_PERMITTED_LANGUAGES`[¶](#wagtailadmin-permitted-languages "Link to this heading")

Users can choose between several languages for the admin interface in the account settings. The list of languages is by default all the available languages in Wagtail with at least 90% coverage. To change it, set `WAGTAILADMIN_PERMITTED_LANGUAGES`:

```
WAGTAILADMIN_PERMITTED_LANGUAGES = [('en', 'English'),
                                    ('pt', 'Portuguese')]

```

Since the syntax is the same as Django `LANGUAGES`, you can do this so users can only choose between front office languages:

```
LANGUAGES = WAGTAILADMIN_PERMITTED_LANGUAGES = [('en', 'English'), ('pt', 'Portuguese')]

```

## Email notifications[¶](#id22 "Link to this heading")

### `WAGTAILADMIN_NOTIFICATION_FROM_EMAIL`[¶](#wagtailadmin-notification-from-email "Link to this heading")

```
WAGTAILADMIN_NOTIFICATION_FROM_EMAIL = 'wagtail@myhost.io'

```

Wagtail sends email notifications when content is submitted for moderation, and when the content is accepted or rejected. This setting lets you pick which email address these automatic notifications will come from. If omitted, Wagtail will fall back to using Django’s `DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL` setting.

### `WAGTAILADMIN_NOTIFICATION_USE_HTML`[¶](#wagtailadmin-notification-use-html "Link to this heading")

```
WAGTAILADMIN_NOTIFICATION_USE_HTML = True

```

Notification emails are sent in `text/plain` by default, change this to use HTML formatting.

### `WAGTAILADMIN_NOTIFICATION_INCLUDE_SUPERUSERS`[¶](#wagtailadmin-notification-include-superusers "Link to this heading")

```
WAGTAILADMIN_NOTIFICATION_INCLUDE_SUPERUSERS = False

```

Notification emails are sent to moderators and superusers by default. You can change this to exclude superusers and only notify moderators.

## Wagtail update notifications[¶](#wagtail-update-notifications "Link to this heading")

### `WAGTAIL_ENABLE_UPDATE_CHECK`[¶](#wagtail-enable-update-check "Link to this heading")

```
WAGTAIL_ENABLE_UPDATE_CHECK = True

```

For admins only, Wagtail performs a check on the dashboard to see if newer releases are available. This also provides the Wagtail team with the hostname of your Wagtail site. If you’d rather not receive update notifications, or if you’d like your site to remain unknown, you can disable it with this setting.

If admins should only be informed of new long-term support (LTS) versions, then set this setting to `"lts"` (the setting is case-insensitive).

### `WAGTAIL_ENABLE_WHATS_NEW_BANNER`[¶](#wagtail-enable-whats-new-banner "Link to this heading")

```
WAGTAIL_ENABLE_WHATS_NEW_BANNER = True

```

For new releases, Wagtail may show a notification banner on the dashboard that helps users learn more about the UI changes and new features in the release. Users can dismiss this banner, which will hide it until the next release. If you’d rather not show these banners, you can disable it with this setting.

## Frontend authentication[¶](#frontend-authentication "Link to this heading")

### `WAGTAIL_PASSWORD_REQUIRED_TEMPLATE`[¶](#wagtail-password-required-template "Link to this heading")

```
WAGTAIL_PASSWORD_REQUIRED_TEMPLATE = 'myapp/password_required.html'

```

This is the path to the Django template which will be used to display the “password required” form when a user accesses a private page. For more details, see the [Private pages](../advanced_topics/privacy.html#private-pages) documentation.

### `WAGTAILDOCS_PASSWORD_REQUIRED_TEMPLATE`[¶](#wagtaildocs-password-required-template "Link to this heading")

```
WAGTAILDOCS_PASSWORD_REQUIRED_TEMPLATE = 'myapp/document_password_required.html'

```

As above, but for password restrictions on documents. For more details, see the [Private pages](../advanced_topics/privacy.html#private-pages) documentation.

### `WAGTAIL_FRONTEND_LOGIN_TEMPLATE`[¶](#wagtail-frontend-login-template "Link to this heading")

The basic login page can be customized with a custom template.

```
WAGTAIL_FRONTEND_LOGIN_TEMPLATE = 'myapp/login.html'

```

### `WAGTAIL_FRONTEND_LOGIN_URL`[¶](#wagtail-frontend-login-url "Link to this heading")

Or the login page can be a redirect to an external or internal URL.

```
WAGTAIL_FRONTEND_LOGIN_URL = '/accounts/login/'

```

For more details, see the [Setting up a login page](../advanced_topics/privacy.html#login-page) documentation.

### `WAGTAIL_PRIVATE_PAGE_OPTIONS`[¶](#wagtail-private-page-options "Link to this heading")

If you’d rather users not have the ability to use a shared password to make pages private, you can disable it with this setting:

```
WAGTAIL_PRIVATE_PAGE_OPTIONS = {"SHARED_PASSWORD": False}

```

See [Private pages](../advanced_topics/privacy.html#private-pages) for more details.

### `WAGTAILDOCS_PRIVATE_COLLECTION_OPTIONS`[¶](#wagtaildocs-private-collection-options "Link to this heading")

If you’d rather users not have the ability to use a shared password to make collections (used for documents) private, you can disable it with this setting:

```
WAGTAILDOCS_PRIVATE_COLLECTION_OPTIONS = {"SHARED_PASSWORD": False}

```

See [Private pages](../advanced_topics/privacy.html#private-pages) for more details.

## Tags[¶](#tags "Link to this heading")

### `TAGGIT_CASE_INSENSITIVE`[¶](#taggit-case-insensitive "Link to this heading")

```
TAGGIT_CASE_INSENSITIVE = True

```

Tags are case-sensitive by default (‘music’ and ‘Music’ are treated as distinct tags). In many cases the reverse behavior is preferable.

### `TAG_SPACES_ALLOWED`[¶](#tag-spaces-allowed "Link to this heading")

```
TAG_SPACES_ALLOWED = False

```

Tags can only consist of a single word, no spaces allowed. The default setting is `True` (spaces in tags are allowed).

### `TAG_LIMIT`[¶](#tag-limit "Link to this heading")

```
TAG_LIMIT = 5

```

Limit the number of tags that can be added to (django-taggit) Tag model. Default setting is `None`, meaning no limit on tags.

## Static files[¶](#static-files "Link to this heading")

### `WAGTAILADMIN_STATIC_FILE_VERSION_STRINGS`[¶](#wagtailadmin-static-file-version-strings "Link to this heading")

```
WAGTAILADMIN_STATIC_FILE_VERSION_STRINGS = False

```

Static file URLs within the Wagtail admin are given a version-specific query string of the form `?v=1a2b3c4d`, to prevent outdated cached copies of JavaScript and CSS files from persisting after a Wagtail upgrade. To disable these, set `WAGTAILADMIN_STATIC_FILE_VERSION_STRINGS` to `False`.

## API[¶](#api "Link to this heading")

For full documentation on API configuration, including these settings, see [Wagtail API v2 Configuration Guide](../advanced_topics/api/v2/configuration.html#api-v2-configuration) documentation.

### `WAGTAILAPI_BASE_URL`[¶](#wagtailapi-base-url "Link to this heading")

```
WAGTAILAPI_BASE_URL = 'http://api.example.com/'

```

Required when using frontend cache invalidation, used to generate absolute URLs to document files and invalidating the cache.

### `WAGTAILAPI_LIMIT_MAX`[¶](#wagtailapi-limit-max "Link to this heading")

```
WAGTAILAPI_LIMIT_MAX = 500

```

Default is 20, used to change the maximum number of results a user can request at a time, set to `None` for no limit.

### `WAGTAILAPI_SEARCH_ENABLED`[¶](#wagtailapi-search-enabled "Link to this heading")

```
WAGTAILAPI_SEARCH_ENABLED = False

```

Default is true, setting this to false will disable full text search on all endpoints.

### `WAGTAILAPI_USE_FRONTENDCACHE`[¶](#wagtailapi-use-frontendcache "Link to this heading")

```
WAGTAILAPI_USE_FRONTENDCACHE = True

```

Requires `wagtailfrontendcache` app to be installed, indicates the API should use the frontend cache.

## Frontend cache[¶](#frontend-cache "Link to this heading")

For full documentation on frontend cache invalidation, including these settings, see [Frontend cache invalidator](contrib/frontendcache.html#frontend-cache-purging).

### `WAGTAILFRONTENDCACHE`[¶](#wagtailfrontendcache "Link to this heading")

```
  WAGTAILFRONTENDCACHE = {
      'varnish': {
          'BACKEND': 'wagtail.contrib.frontend_cache.backends.HTTPBackend',
          'LOCATION': 'http://localhost:8000',
      },
  }

```

See the documentation linked above for the full options available.

Note

`WAGTAILFRONTENDCACHE_LOCATION` is no longer the preferred way to set the cache location, instead set the `LOCATION` within the `WAGTAILFRONTENDCACHE` item.

### `WAGTAILFRONTENDCACHE_LANGUAGES`[¶](#wagtailfrontendcache-languages "Link to this heading")

```
WAGTAILFRONTENDCACHE_LANGUAGES = [l[0] for l in settings.LANGUAGES]

```

Default is an empty list, there must be a list of languages to also purge the urls for each language of a purging url. This setting needs `settings.USE_I18N` to be `True` to work.

## Redirects[¶](#redirects "Link to this heading")

### `WAGTAIL_REDIRECTS_FILE_STORAGE`[¶](#wagtail-redirects-file-storage "Link to this heading")

```
WAGTAIL_REDIRECTS_FILE_STORAGE = 'tmp_file'

```

By default the redirect importer keeps track of the uploaded file as a temp file, but on certain environments (load balanced/cloud environments), you cannot keep a shared file between environments. For those cases, you can use the built-in cache to store the file instead.

```
WAGTAIL_REDIRECTS_FILE_STORAGE = 'cache'

```

## Form builder[¶](#form-builder "Link to this heading")

### `WAGTAILFORMS_HELP_TEXT_ALLOW_HTML`[¶](#wagtailforms-help-text-allow-html "Link to this heading")

```
WAGTAILFORMS_HELP_TEXT_ALLOW_HTML = True

```

When true, HTML tags in form field help text will be rendered unescaped (default: False).

Warning

Enabling this option will allow editors to insert arbitrary HTML into the page, such as scripts that could allow the editor to acquire administrator privileges when another administrator views the page. Do not enable this setting unless your editors are fully trusted.

## Workflow[¶](#workflow "Link to this heading")

### `WAGTAIL_WORKFLOW_ENABLED`[¶](#wagtail-workflow-enabled "Link to this heading")

```
WAGTAIL_WORKFLOW_ENABLED = True

```

Specifies whether moderation workflows are enabled (default: `True`). When disabled, editors will no longer be given the option to submit pages to a workflow, and the settings areas for admins to configure workflows and tasks will be unavailable.

### `WAGTAIL_WORKFLOW_REQUIRE_REAPPROVAL_ON_EDIT`[¶](#wagtail-workflow-require-reapproval-on-edit "Link to this heading")

```
WAGTAIL_WORKFLOW_REQUIRE_REAPPROVAL_ON_EDIT = True

```

Moderation workflows can be used in two modes. The first is to require that all tasks must approve a specific page revision for the workflow to complete. As a result, if edits are made to a page while it is in moderation, any approved tasks will need to be re-approved for the new revision before the workflow finishes. To use workflows in this mode, set `WAGTAIL_WORKFLOW_REQUIRE_REAPPROVAL_ON_EDIT = True`. The second mode does not require reapproval: if edits are made when tasks have already been approved, those tasks do not need to be reapproved. This is more suited to a hierarchical workflow system. This is the default, `WAGTAIL_WORKFLOW_REQUIRE_REAPPROVAL_ON_EDIT = False`.

### `WAGTAIL_FINISH_WORKFLOW_ACTION`[¶](#wagtail-finish-workflow-action "Link to this heading")

```
WAGTAIL_FINISH_WORKFLOW_ACTION = 'wagtail.workflows.publish_workflow_state'

```

This sets the function to be called when a workflow completes successfully - by default, `wagtail.workflows.publish_workflow_state`,which publishes the page. The function must accept a `WorkflowState` object as its only positional argument.

### `WAGTAIL_WORKFLOW_CANCEL_ON_PUBLISH`[¶](#wagtail-workflow-cancel-on-publish "Link to this heading")

```
WAGTAIL_WORKFLOW_CANCEL_ON_PUBLISH = True

```

This determines whether publishing a page with an ongoing workflow will cancel the workflow (if true) or leave the workflow unaffected (false).
Disabling this could be useful if your site has long, multi-step workflows, and you want to be able to publish urgent page updates while the workflow continues to provide less urgent feedback.

|  |  | ### CVE-2023-28837: Denial-of-service via memory exhaustion when uploading large files |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | This release addresses a memory exhaustion bug in Wagtail's handling of uploaded images and documents. For both images and documents, files are loaded into memory during upload for additional processing. A user with access to upload images or documents through the Wagtail admin interface could upload a file so large that it results in a crash or denial of service. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | The vulnerability is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without access to the Wagtail admin. It can only be exploited by admin users with permission to upload images or documents. |
