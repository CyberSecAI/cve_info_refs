# Insecure randomness for default password in file sharing when password policy app is disabled

Low

Mar 30, 2023

## Package

Server
(Nextcloud)

## Affected versions

>= 24.0.0, >= 25.0.0

## Patched versions

24.0.10, 25.0.4

Server
(Nextcloud Enterprise)

>= 23.0.0, >= 24.0.0, >= 25.0.0

23.0.14, 24.0.10, 25.0.4

## Description

### Impact

The generated fallback password when creating a share was using a weak complexity, so when the sharer did not change it the password would be guessable in an acceptable time frame.

### Patches

It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 24.0.10 or 25.0.4

It is recommended that the Nextcloud Enterprise Server is upgraded to 23.0.14 or 24.0.10 or 25.0.4

### Workarounds

* Enable password policy app
* Overwrite the default password when creating a share

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
