Based on the provided information, this is related to CVE-2023-28835.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the use of insecure randomness when generating default passwords for file shares when the password policy app is disabled. This results in passwords that are easily guessable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure random number generation.
- Weak password complexity for default generated passwords.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can guess the default password for a share within a reasonable timeframe, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the shared resource.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack.
- Attack complexity is low.
- Requires low privileges.
- User interaction is required (user has to create a share).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to know that a file share has been created with a default password.
- They need to have network access to the target.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability occurs in Nextcloud Server.
- The fix involves using web crypto for password generation when the password policy app is disabled.
- The issue is tracked with GitHub Security Advisory GHSA-7w2p-rp9m-9xp9.
- Affected versions include:
  - Nextcloud Server: >= 24.0.0, >= 25.0.0
  - Nextcloud Enterprise Server: >= 23.0.0, >= 24.0.0, >= 25.0.0
- Patched versions include:
  - Nextcloud Server: 24.0.10, 25.0.4
  - Nextcloud Enterprise Server: 23.0.14, 24.0.10, 25.0.4
- The vulnerability has a low severity with a CVSS score of 3.5.
- It is recommended to upgrade to the patched versions or enable the password policy app or overwrite the default generated passwords when creating shares.
