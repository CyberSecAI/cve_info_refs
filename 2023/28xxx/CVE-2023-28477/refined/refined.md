Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-28477:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a lack of sanitization of the "name" parameter when adding API Integrations in Concrete CMS. This allowed the injection of malicious JavaScript payloads.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Improper input sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- Successful exploitation can lead to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to:
  - Data theft
  - Session hijacking
  - Defacement of the admin interface.
  - Other malicious activities, as dictated by the attacker's payload

**Attack vectors:**

- The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the "name" parameter when creating or editing an API integration.
- The injected script is then stored in the database.
- When a user views the API integrations page or the view client page, the stored script is executed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to be a Concrete CMS user with high level permissions to access and modify API Integrations settings.
- The attacker needs to be able to add API integrations to the system, with the capability of setting a "name" parameter that accepts special characters.

**Additional Notes:**

- This vulnerability affects Concrete CMS versions prior to 9.2.
- The specific vulnerable locations are:
  - `/dashboard/system/api/integrations`
  - `/dashboard/system/api/integrations/view_client/unique-id`
- The vulnerability was rated as medium severity with CVSS v3.1 vector of AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N which translates to the following:
    - Attack Vector: Network
    - Attack Complexity: Low
    - Privileges Required: High
    - User Interaction: None
    - Scope: Unchanged
    - Confidentiality: High
    - Integrity: Low
    - Availability: None
