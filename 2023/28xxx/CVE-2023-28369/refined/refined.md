Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Improper access control in the Brother iPrint&Scan Android application. Specifically, the application exposes sensitive information in the print preview, such as settings and log data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Access Control (CWE-284):** The application does not properly restrict access to sensitive data, allowing other applications on the same device to potentially trigger the exposure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker (via a malicious app or otherwise) could potentially view the Brother iPrint&Scan application's settings and log information displayed as a print preview.
*   **Confidential Data Exposure:** This could include sensitive data such as authentication tokens for linked services (e.g., Dropbox, Google Drive) or other private data stored by the app.
*   **Note:** The vendor states that the vulnerability does NOT lead to external data leaks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** The attack must occur on the same Android device where the vulnerable application is installed.
*   **Inter-App Communication:** The vulnerability can be triggered through interaction with other apps on the device by causing the Brother iPrint&Scan app to display sensitive data in the print preview.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Installed App:** The attacker must be able to execute code on the same Android device as the targeted Brother iPrint&Scan application. This could be through a malicious app installed by the user.
*   **User Interaction:** Some form of user interaction on the device is required to trigger the vulnerability and display the print preview, as per the JVN analysis.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by Johan Francsics.
*   The fix is to update to the latest version (6.11.3 or later) of the Brother iPrint&Scan app via the Google Play Store.
* The CVSS v3 score is 3.3 (Low severity).
