The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities, including CVE-2023-28676.

**CVE-2023-28676**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Convert To Pipeline Plugin does not require POST requests for the HTTP endpoint that converts a Freestyle project to a Pipeline.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can create a Pipeline based on a Freestyle project. Combined with CVE-2023-28677, this can lead to the execution of unsandboxed Pipeline scripts, potentially leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE).
*   **Attack vectors:** An attacker can trigger the conversion of a Freestyle project to a Pipeline via a crafted request.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No authentication is required to trigger the CSRF vulnerability, but the user must be tricked into initiating the request. An attacker must also be able to create or control a freestyle project to fully exploit the vulnerability.
