Siemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT

SSA-711309: Denial of Service Vulnerability in the OPC UA Implementations
of SIMATIC Products

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 7.5

2023-09-12
2025-01-14
V2.3

SUMMARY

The OPC UA implementations (ANSI C and C++) as used in several SIMATIC products contain a denial
of service vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to create a denial of service
condition by sending a specially crafted certificate.

Siemens has released new versions for several affected products and recommends to update to the latest
versions. Siemens recommends specific countermeasures for products where fixes are not, or not yet
available.

VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

This chapter describes all vulnerabilities (CVE-IDs) addressed in this security advisory. Wherever
applicable, it also documents the product-specific impact of the individual vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability CVE-2023-28831

The OPC UA implementations (ANSI C and C++) in affected products contain an integer overflow
vulnerability that could cause the application to run into an infinite loop during certificate validation.

[1] <https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/html/ssa-711309.html>

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND SOLUTION

| Affected Product and Versions | Remediation |
| --- | --- |
| SINUMERIK MC  All versions < V1.22 | Update to V1.22 or later version  <https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109824227/>   See further recommendations from section [Workarounds and Mitigations](#mitigations-section) |

WORKAROUNDS
AND
MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to reduce the risk:

* Expose the OPC UA interface of the integrated S7-1500 CPU only to trusted network environments

Product-specific remediations or mitigations can be found in the section
[Affected Products and Solution](#affected-products-section).

Please follow the [General Security Recommendations](#general-recommendations).

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends to configure the environment according to Siemens' operational guidelines for Industrial Security (Download: <https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security>), and to follow the recommendations in the product manuals.
Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at: <https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity>

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SINUMERIK MC is a CNC system for customized machine solutions.

SINUMERIK ONE is a digital-native CNC system with an integrated SIMATIC S7-1500 CPU for automation.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

[Un-/Collapse All](#/)

The vulnerability classification has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (<https://www.first.org/cvss/>). The CVSS environmental score is specific to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually defined by the customer to accomplish final scoring.

An additional classification has been performed using the CWE classification, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identification, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
<https://cwe.mitre.org/>.

Vulnerability CVE-2023-28831

The OPC UA implementations (ANSI C and C++) in affected products contain an integer overflow vulnerability that could cause the application to run into an infinite loop during certificate validation.

This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to create a denial of service condition by sending a specially crafted certificate.

SSA-711309: Denial of Service Vulnerability in the OPC UA Implementations of SIMATIC Products

| Publication Date: | 2023-09-12 |
| --- | --- |
| Last Update: | 2025-01-14 |
| Current Version: | V2.3 |
| CVSS v3.1 Base Score: | 7.5 |

SUMMARY

The OPC UA implementations (ANSI C and C++) as used in several SIMATIC products contain a denial of service vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to create a denial of service condition by sending a specially crafted certificate.

Siemens has released new versions for several affected products and recommends to update to the latest versions. Siemens recommends specific countermeasures for products where fixes are not, or not yet available.

VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

[Un-/Collapse All](#/)

This chapter describes all vulnerabilities (CVE-IDs) addressed in this security advisory.
Wherever applicable, it also documents the product-specific impact of the individual vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability CVE-2023-28831

The OPC UA implementations (ANSI C and C++) in affected products contain an integer overflow vulnerability that could cause the application to run into an infinite loop during certificate validation.

This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to create a denial of service condition by sending a specially crafted certificate.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SINUMERIK MC is a CNC system for customized machine solutions.

SINUMERIK ONE is a digital-native CNC system with an integrated SIMATIC S7-1500 CPU for automa-
tion.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classification has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.first.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is specific to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually defined by the customer to accomplish final scoring.

An additional classification has been performed using the CWE classification, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identification, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2023-28831

The OPC UA implementations (ANSI C and C++) in affected products contain an integer overflow
vulnerability that could cause the application to run into an infinite loop during certificate validation.

This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to create a denial of service condition by sending
a specially crafted certificate.
