**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function within the WordPress Dynamics 365 Integration Plugin. This lack of proper access control allows unprivileged users to execute actions that should be restricted to higher-privileged users.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the vulnerable plugin, which is "WordPress Dynamics 365 Integration Plugin <= 1.3.12". An attacker could potentially exploit the plugin's functionality by exploiting the missing access controls.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
