Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-28098:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

   - The content directly references "CVE-2023-28098" and the description aligns with the provided advisory on the GitHub security page. The included technical report also validates the vulnerability.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

   - The vulnerability lies within the `parse_param_name()` function, specifically in how it handles malformed parameters in the Authorization header of a SIP message.
   - The function uses a `q_memchr()` to search for specific characters. When malformed input is provided, the size parameter to `q_memchr()` becomes negative due to pointer arithmetic errors within the parsing logic. This negative size when converted to an unsigned integer becomes a very large value, causing q_memchr to read out of bounds.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

   - **Buffer Over-read:** The core issue is an out-of-bounds read within `q_memchr()`. The size parameter for q_memchr becomes negative due to incorrect parsing logic, resulting in reading beyond allocated memory.
   - **Improper Input Validation:**  The parsing logic fails to properly handle malformed input with incorrect parameters within the "Authorization" header. Specifically, there is a lack of checks for the validity of parameter names and their structure, leading to the pointer arithmetic errors and the negative size value passed to `q_memchr()`.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

   - **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation can lead to a crash of the OpenSIPS server due to a segmentation fault. The invalid memory access caused by `q_memchr()` trying to read out of bounds results in a program crash.
   - **Erratic Program Behavior:** The advisory mentions that the vulnerability "may cause erratic program behavior". This is likely due to the memory corruption that can occur in cases where memory happens to be present beyond the allocated buffer.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

   - **Network:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by sending specially crafted SIP REGISTER requests.
   - **Malformed Authorization Header:** The attack is triggered by an "Authorization" header that contains malformed parameters using `Digest a a="",real` as an example

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

   - **No Authentication Required:** No prior authentication is needed to trigger the vulnerability.
   - **Network Accessibility:** The attacker must be able to send crafted network packets to the OpenSIPS server.

**Additional Details from Content:**
   - The GitHub security advisory provides a clear explanation of the vulnerability and includes a proof of concept SIP message.
   - The technical report expands on the details, noting that the vulnerability was found via coverage-guided fuzzing.
   - The report details that the `q_memchr()` function was called with invalid memory locations and sizes due to incorrect pointer arithmetic and logic in the `parse_param_name()` function.
   - The report provides an example of how the negative size is calculated.
   - The vulnerability is present in OpenSIPS versions up to and including 3.2 and fixed in versions 3.1.7 and 3.2.4.
   - The CVSS score is 5.9 which is considered moderate.

In summary, CVE-2023-28098 is a moderate severity vulnerability caused by improper input validation in the digest authentication parameter parsing that leads to a buffer over-read and potential DoS. An attacker does not need authentication to trigger the vulnerability.
