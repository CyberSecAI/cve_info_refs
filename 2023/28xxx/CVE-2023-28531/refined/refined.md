Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2023-28531:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in how OpenSSH handles smartcard keys with per-hop destination constraints when adding them to `ssh-agent`. A logic error prevents these constraints from being properly communicated to the agent.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Improper constraint handling:** SSH agent does not enforce per-hop destination constraints for smartcard keys added using the `ssh-add -h` option

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Security bypass:** Smartcard keys are added to the agent without their intended constraints, potentially allowing them to be used in unintended contexts or towards unintended destinations. This could lead to unauthorized access.
*   **Information disclosure, data modification, Denial of Service (DoS)**: According to NetApp's advisory, successful exploitation "could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS)." While not explicitly defined, this is a general statement which suggests the issue could have varying levels of impact depending on the context in which OpenSSH is used.

**Attack vectors:**

*   An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by adding a malicious smartcard key with per-hop destination constraints to a vulnerable SSH agent.
*   The attacker needs to add the malicious key to the ssh-agent using `ssh-add -h`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to add a smartcard key to a vulnerable ssh-agent.
*   The attacker needs to be able to influence the destination used by the agent if a smartcard key is used.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability affects OpenSSH versions prior to 9.3.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Luci Stanescu, and is also referenced in an OpenSSH release announcement.
*   The issue specifically occurs when adding *smartcard keys* with per-hop destination constraints (using `ssh-add -h`), and not with other types of keys, or keys without destination constraints.
*   NetApp states that their products are not affected by this CVE, which suggests they might not be using the vulnerable code path.

**Additional notes**
* Some resources mention that the fix for CVE-2023-28531 was included in OpenSSH version 9.3, but a subsequent fix to address the constraint problem with PKCS#11 keys was introduced in version 9.3p1.
* NetApp does not have any affected products, and there are no software fixes required.
* A Gentoo advisory (GLSA 202307-01) indicates that CVE-2023-28531 is related to remote code execution, however, this is not supported by the official description, or other sources.
