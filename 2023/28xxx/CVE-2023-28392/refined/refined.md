Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-28392:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to an OS command injection flaw present in the web user interface of Inaba Denki Sangyo's Wi-Fi AP UNIT devices. Specifically, after successful authentication to the web interface, it's possible to inject and execute arbitrary OS commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **OS Command Injection (CWE-78):** The primary vulnerability is that the application fails to sanitize user-supplied input before using it in OS commands, allowing an attacker to inject malicious commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker who has authenticated to the web interface can execute arbitrary OS commands on the affected device. This could lead to:
    *   Complete compromise of the device.
    *   Potential for further network attacks depending on the device's role and network configuration.
    *   Confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact (full control over the device).

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network-based:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely through the web interface.
*   **Requires Authentication:** The attacker must have valid login credentials for the device's web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to reach the web interface of the affected device over the network.
*   The attacker must have valid user credentials for the web interface (administrative privileges).
*   The attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests to the web interface to inject OS commands.

**Affected Products:**
*   AC-PD-WAPU v1.05\_B04 and earlier
*   AC-PD-WAPUM v1.05\_B04 and earlier
*   AC-PD-WAPU-P v1.05\_B04P and earlier
*   AC-PD-WAPUM-P v1.05\_B04P and earlier
*   AC-WAPU-300 v1.00\_B07 and earlier
*   AC-WAPUM-300 v1.00\_B07 and earlier
*   AC-WAPU-300-P v1.00\_B08P and earlier
*   AC-WAPUM-300-P v1.00\_B08P and earlier

**Mitigations:**
Since the products are no longer supported, no patch will be released. The following workarounds are provided:
* Change the default IP address.
* Restrict web interface access to the LAN port only, disallowing access via WAN/Wireless.
* Implement MAC address filtering for wireless connections.
* Use VPN or IP filters to limit access.
* Deploy a firewall in front of the devices.
* Do not access other websites while logged into the device's web configuration page.
* Close the browser after configuration changes.
* Remove saved passwords from the web browser used to access the device's configuration.
