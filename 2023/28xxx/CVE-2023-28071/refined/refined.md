- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from an insecure operation on Windows Junction / Mount Point within Dell Command | Update, Dell Update, and Alienware Update.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure handling of Windows Junction / Mount Points, allowing a local user to manipulate file system paths.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local malicious user can exploit this vulnerability to create arbitrary folders, leading to a permanent Denial of Service (DOS).
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, requiring the attacker to have local access to the system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A low-privileged local user can exploit this vulnerability. The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the vulnerable machine.
