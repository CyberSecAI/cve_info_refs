| We have identified this bug in the code at /src/clp.c:2395. Specifically, the iopt variable is allocated by malloc with a size of 2 sizeof(Clp\_InternOption) elements. However, the code at line 2395 accesses iopt[2], which results in a heap-buffer-overflow bug. It's worth noting that this bug only manifests when compiling gifsicle with ASAN. |
