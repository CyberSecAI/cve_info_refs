Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-36622:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the lack of proper validation of user input when setting the timezone on the Loxone Miniserver Go Gen. 2 device. The timezone is set in a Linux shell context, using a symlink operation. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary OS commands by using backticks (`), which break out of the command.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **OS Command Injection (CWE-78):** The primary vulnerability is an OS command injection vulnerability. The application fails to neutralize special characters used in a system command, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution with root privileges on the device. This is demonstrated by the ability to create a file in the `/lx` directory.
*   **Full System Compromise:** The ability to execute arbitrary code as root means an attacker can potentially gain complete control of the smart home server. This could lead to data exfiltration, malware installation, or disruption of the device's functions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Websocket Connection:** The attack vector is through a websocket connection. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker needs to establish a websocket connection to the Loxone Miniserver Go.
*   **Administrative Access:** The attacker needs to authenticate as an administrative user to modify the timezone settings.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the Loxone Miniserver Go device.
*   **Administrative Credentials:** The attacker must have valid administrative credentials to authenticate to the device and modify the timezone.
*   **Understanding of the Loxone API:** The attacker should know how to establish a websocket connection, handle the encryption and send commands to the device.

**Additional Notes**
* The advisory indicates the vulnerability was fixed in version 14.1.5.9.
* The provided advisory is more detailed than the typical CVE description.
