{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `__parse_content_stream` function within the `pypdf` library. When parsing a PDF content stream, the code enters an infinite loop if a comment is not followed by a character or a newline character.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation when parsing PDF content streams.",
      "Lack of handling for a comment without a character following it, leading to an infinite loop.",
      "Missing check for empty byte string in the while loop condition"
     ],
    "impact": "An attacker can craft a malicious PDF that, when processed by `pypdf`, will cause an infinite loop. This loop will block the process and consume 100% of a single CPU core, effectively causing a denial-of-service (DoS).",
    "attack_vectors": "A crafted PDF document, that includes a malformed comment which is not followed by any character or a new line.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create and provide a specially crafted PDF document. The application or service that is using `pypdf` must attempt to process the provided malicious PDF document, specifically parsing content streams, for the vulnerability to be triggered."
  },
  "additional_information": {
     "patches": "The issue was fixed in `pypdf` version 3.9.0 by modifying the while loop condition to include an empty byte string as a stopping condition.",
     "workarounds": "Prior to the patch, users could modify `pypdf/generic/_data_structures.py` by adding `b""` to the list of characters that would cause the parsing loop to terminate.",
     "introduced_in": "The vulnerability was introduced with commit [#969](https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/pull/969)"
