Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2023-36469:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of user-controlled input within the XWiki notification RSS feed generation. Specifically, the system fails to sanitize the user's first name field when creating the RSS feed, leading to the execution of arbitrary script macros embedded within the first name.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Sanitization:** The primary weakness is the lack of sanitization of the user-provided first name field before including it in the generated RSS feed. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code.
*   **Script Macro Injection:** The XWiki platform's use of script macros (like Groovy and Python) for dynamic content generation is exploited. By injecting these macros, attackers gain the ability to execute arbitrary code.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** A low-privilege user can escalate their privileges to gain remote code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server. This includes Groovy and Python scripts.
*   **Unrestricted Data Access:** Attackers can gain unrestricted read and write access to all wiki content.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** A regular user can obtain administrative or higher privileges.
*   **Full System Compromise:** The ability to execute arbitrary code can potentially lead to full compromise of the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **User Profile Modification:** The attacker crafts a malicious payload within their user profile, specifically the first name field.
*   **Notification Trigger:**  The attack is triggered when a user generates an RSS feed of notifications that include the attacker's actions.
*   **RSS Feed Generation:**  The vulnerable `NotificationRSSService` parses the malicious data in the first name, leading to the execution of the injected script macros during RSS feed generation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low-Privilege User Account:** The attacker needs a valid user account on the XWiki platform, with the ability to edit their own profile and notification settings.
*   **Knowledge of XWiki Syntax:** The attacker needs to know the syntax for embedding script macros (like Groovy and Python) within the XWiki platform.
*   **Ability to trigger notifications:** The attacker needs to be able to generate an event that creates a notification, like a 'like' on their profile.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   The vulnerability is identified as **CVE-2023-36469** and **GHSA-94pf-92hw-2hjc.**
*   It affects XWiki versions **>= 9.6-rc-1, < 14.10.6** and **>= 15.0-rc-1, < 15.2-rc-1.**
*   The vulnerability is classified as **Critical** with a CVSS v3 base score of **10.0**.
*   The vulnerability is related to **CWE-95** (Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')).
*   The vulnerability was patched in **XWiki 14.10.6 and 15.2-rc-1.**
*   A workaround involves patching the affected document `XWiki.Notifications.Code.NotificationRSSService` but this can break the link to the differences.
