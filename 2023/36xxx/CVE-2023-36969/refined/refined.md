The provided content details a file upload vulnerability in CMS Made Simple v2.2.17, identified as CVE-2023-36969.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient file extension filtering during the file upload process in the "File Manager" module of the CMS. The system blocks PHP extensions, but allows the upload of files with the `.phtml` extension, which can be executed as PHP code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Inadequate file extension validation. The system fails to properly restrict the upload of executable file types.
- Allows `.phtml` files to bypass the restriction of php files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE). By uploading a malicious `.phtml` file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.
- Full compromise of the affected web server and potentially the underlying system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Authenticated file upload through the CMS's File Manager module.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have valid user credentials to log into the CMS.
- The attacker needs to navigate to the "File Manager" module under "Content" section.
- Ability to craft a malicious `.phtml` file containing executable PHP code.
