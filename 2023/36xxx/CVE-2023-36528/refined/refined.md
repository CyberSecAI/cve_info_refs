- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function within the WordPress kk Star Ratings Plugin. This allows an unprivileged user to execute higher privileged actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control, specifically a lack of proper authorization checks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated user could potentially perform actions they are not supposed to, which could lead to unauthorized modification of data or functionality. The specific impact can vary depending on the function being accessed without proper authorization.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the vulnerable plugin function, which can be accessed by unauthenticated users.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to interact with the vulnerable plugin function; no specific privilege or prior access to the system is needed since the vulnerability is exploitable by unauthenticated users.
