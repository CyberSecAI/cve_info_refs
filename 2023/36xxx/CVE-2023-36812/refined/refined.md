Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2023-36812:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the ability to inject user-controlled input into the Gnuplot configuration file. The application then executes Gnuplot using this manipulated configuration file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The core issue is that by controlling the Gnuplot configuration, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server hosting OpenTSDB.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user inputs that are used to generate the Gnuplot configuration.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full System Compromise:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code, potentially leading to a full compromise of the system. This includes the ability to read sensitive data, modify data, and disrupt services.
*   **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** The CVSS v3 metrics indicate high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over the network.
*   **HTTP Parameter Injection:** The attack is performed by injecting malicious parameters into HTTP requests that are used to generate the Gnuplot configuration. Specifically, parameters such as `yrange`, `y2range`, `ylabel`, `y2label`, `yformat`, `y2format`, `xformat`, `key`, `title`, `bgcolor`, `fgcolor`, `smooth`, `style`, and `wxh` are vulnerable if not properly validated.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Privileges Required:** An attacker doesn't need any prior privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **No User Interaction:** The attacker doesn't require any user interaction to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the OpenTSDB instance.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Bypass of Previous Fix:** This vulnerability bypasses the fix for a previous similar vulnerability (CVE-2020-35476) which affected version 2.4.0. This makes the RCE vulnerability operational in version 2.4.1.
*   **Patch:** The vulnerability is fixed in version 2.4.2.
*   **Workarounds:** Workarounds include disabling Gnuplot functionality (`tsd.core.enable_ui = true`) and removing the Gnuplot shell files.
*   **Input Validation:** The fix implements a stricter validation of inputs, ensuring that only plain ASCII printable characters are accepted for the various parameters. The `validateString` method checks if the characters are within allowed ranges.
*   **HTML Escaping:** The fix also implements HTML escaping for error messages, which prevents XSS attacks, but this is related to a different vulnerability (CVE-2018-13003), and not the root cause of the RCE in CVE-2023-36812.
* **CWEs:** The related CWEs are CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) and CWE-78 (OS Command Injection).
