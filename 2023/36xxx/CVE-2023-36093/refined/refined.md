- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application does not properly sanitize user input when setting the "filing number" in the "Basic Information" tab of the backend management page. Specifically, the application allows the input of arbitrary HTML, including `<script>` tags, without encoding or sanitizing them.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that is stored in the application's database and executed in the browsers of other users when they access the affected page. This can lead to various attacks such as session hijacking, defacement, phishing, or malware distribution.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to be logged into the backend management page and navigate to the "Basic Information" tab and insert the malicious payload `<script>alert(1)</script>` in the "filing number" field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have administrative access to the backend of the EyouCMS instance to exploit this vulnerability.
