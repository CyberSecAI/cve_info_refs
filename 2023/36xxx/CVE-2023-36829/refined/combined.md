# CORS misconfiguration

Moderate

[mdtro](/mdtro)
published
GHSA-4xqm-4p72-87h6
Jul 6, 2023

## Package

pip

sentry
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

>=23.6.0, <23.6.2

## Patched versions

23.6.2

## Description

### Impact

The Sentry API incorrectly returns the `access-control-allow-credentials: true` HTTP header if the `Origin` request header ends with the `system.base-hostname` option of Sentry installation. This only affects installations that have `system.base-hostname` option explicitly set, as it is empty by default.

Impact is limited since recent versions of major browsers have cross-site cookie blocking enabled by default. However, this flaw could allow other multi-step attacks.

### Patches

The patch has been released in [Sentry 23.6.2](https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted/releases/tag/23.6.2).

### Workarounds

For Sentry SaaS customers, no action is needed.

For self-hosted Sentry installations that have `system.base-hostname` explicitly set, it is recommended to upgrade the installation to 23.6.2 or higher. There are no known workarounds.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
