### **[psmoros](/psmoros)** commented [Mar 19, 2023](#issue-1630924239)

| Hello üëã  I run a security community that finds and fixes vulnerabilities in OSS. A researcher ([@nguyenngocquang700](https://github.com/nguyenngocquang700)) has found a potential issue, which I would be eager to share with you.  Could you add a `SECURITY.md` file with an e-mail address for me to send further details to? GitHub [recommends](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/getting-started/adding-a-security-policy-to-your-repository) a security policy to ensure issues are responsibly disclosed, and it would help direct researchers in the future.  Looking forward to hearing from you üëç  (cc [@huntr-helper](https://github.com/huntr-helper)) |
