Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-36747:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies within the `fstWritex` function of GTKWave when handling VCD (Value Change) data within `.fst` files. The core issue is a missing check on the size of the data being copied via `memcpy`.  Specifically, the `len` argument to `fstWritex`, which is derived from `xc->signal_lens[idx]`, is treated as a signed integer while the `xc->signal_lens[idx]` value is a 32 bit unsigned integer. This allows an attacker to provide an excessively large value for `xc->signal_lens[idx]` (greater than 0x7FFFFFFF) which then causes the `len` value to become negative. This negative value passed to `memcpy` leads to an out-of-bounds write when using the heap-allocated buffer `xc->writex_buf`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap-based buffer overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow. By providing a negative value for length, the `memcpy` function attempts to write before the beginning of the allocated buffer.
*   **Integer Overflow:** The conversion of the unsigned 32-bit `xc->signal_lens[idx]` to a signed `int` length without a range check allows an attacker to trigger a negative length value.
*   **Lack of bounds check:** The `fstWritex` function does not validate that the length of the data is within the bounds of the source buffer (`mu + sig_offs`) leading to out of bounds read.
*   **Unsafe use of memcpy:** The `memcpy` operation within `fstWritex` is vulnerable as it uses attacker-controlled length and data source.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** The buffer overflow results in memory corruption on the heap.
*   **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** Due to the nature of heap corruption and the multi-threaded nature of the application, it is possible for an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution by carefully crafting the malicious `.fst` file.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious `.fst` File:** The primary attack vector involves a user opening a specially crafted `.fst` file. This can occur through various means, such as:
    *   Opening an attached `.fst` file received via email.
    *   Opening a `.fst` file downloaded from a malicious source.
    *   Opening a `.fst` file from an untrusted network share

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **File Creation:** The attacker must be capable of creating a malicious `.fst` file containing specific crafted sections.
*   **File Delivery:** The attacker needs a method to deliver the malicious `.fst` file to a victim, often through social engineering.
*   **Victim Interaction:** The victim must open the malicious file using GTKWave. No specific user privileges are required.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   The vulnerability affects GTKWave version 3.3.115.
*   The vulnerability is triggered when parsing `FST_BL_VCDATA`, `FST_BL_VCDATA_DYN_ALIAS` and `FST_BL_VCDATA_DYN_ALIAS2` blocks within the `.fst` file.
*   The issue arises within the `fstReaderIterBlocks2` function, which iterates through these blocks.
*   The vulnerability is triggered via the `fstWritex` function which attempts to write to the temporary `.hier` file associated with the `.fst` being parsed.
*   The issue can be reached via two different paths. One via the `hier` block and another via the `beg_time` block.
*   The fix involves updating to GTKWave version 3.3.118.
*   The provided crash information also indicates a negative-size-param error with `memcpy`, which confirms the root cause.
*   The CVSS v3 score is 7.0, with a vector of AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
