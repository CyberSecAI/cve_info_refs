# Unauthenticated denial of service and crash via unchecked use of input with Python's marshal module

High

[dataflake](/dataflake)
published
GHSA-4hpj-8rhv-9x87
Jul 3, 2023

## Package

Products.CMFCore
(Plone)

## Affected versions

<2.7.1, < 3.2

## Patched versions

2.7.1, 3.2

## Description

### Impact

The use of Python's marshal module to handle unchecked input in a public method on `PortalFolder` objects can lead to an unauthenticated denial of service and crash situation. The code in question is exposed by all portal software built on top of `Products.CMFCore`, such as Plone. All deployments are vulnerable.

### Patches

The code has been fixed in `Products.CMFCore` version 3.2.

### Workarounds

Users can make the affected `decodeFolderFilter` method unreachable by editing the `PortalFolder.py` module in `Products.CMFCore` by hand and then restarting Zope. Go to line 233 of `PortalFolder.py` and remove both the `@security.public` decorator for `decodeFolderFilter` as well as the method's entire docstring. This is safe because the method is not actually used by current code.
