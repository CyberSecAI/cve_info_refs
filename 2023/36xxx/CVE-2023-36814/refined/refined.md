Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-36814:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of Python's `marshal` module to deserialize user-controlled input in the `decodeFolderFilter` method of the `PortalFolder` class. The `marshal` module is known to be insecure when used with untrusted data because it can lead to arbitrary code execution or denial-of-service.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Deserialization:** The primary vulnerability is the insecure deserialization of data using the `marshal.loads()` function on data received via an encoded string.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The `decodeFolderFilter` method did not adequately validate or sanitize the input before deserialization.
- **Public Method Exposure:** The vulnerable `decodeFolderFilter` method was exposed as a public method using the `@security.public` decorator, making it accessible to unauthenticated users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By providing a specially crafted, excessively large encoded string, an attacker can trigger excessive memory consumption or other resource exhaustion, causing the application to crash.
- **Code Execution:**  Although not explicitly stated in the advisory, the use of marshal can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution (RCE) if a suitable malicious payload is provided. This is not explicitly mentioned in the description but is a known potential of using marshal.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `decodeFolderFilter` method, which is publicly accessible.
- An attacker sends a malicious encoded string (that is processed by `base64_decode` and then `marshal.loads`) to the exposed `decodeFolderFilter` method.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated, as the vulnerable method is marked as public.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application using the exposed `decodeFolderFilter` endpoint.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges on the system.

**Additional Notes:**

- The fix involves changing from `marshal` to `json` for encoding and decoding the filter parameters in the `PortalFolder`.  The use of JSON and a check on input length was implemented to mitigate the risks.
- The advisory mentions a workaround to manually remove the `@security.public` decorator and the method's docstring from the `PortalFolder.py` file. This prevents external access to the method, acting as a patch until the application is updated.
- The vulnerability affects all software built on top of `Products.CMFCore`, including Plone.
