Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-36376:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the "Add Course" functionality of the Hostel Management System. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize user-provided input in three fields within this section.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS, which allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code which will be executed by the victim's browser when they access the vulnerable page.
- This could lead to a variety of attacks, including:
    - Stealing user session cookies, potentially gaining unauthorized access to accounts.
    - Redirecting users to phishing sites.
    - Defacing the web application.
    - Other malicious activities depending on the injected script.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker must be logged in as an admin to access the vulnerable section.
- The attacker injects the XSS payload into the vulnerable fields of the "Add Course" form within the admin panel.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker requires valid admin credentials to access the vulnerable "Add Course" functionality.
- The attacker needs to be able to navigate to the admin panel, locate the course section, and the add course functionality

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable software is identified as "Hostel Management System" version 2.1
- The vulnerability exists in the "Add Course" section of the admin panel.
-  The XSS payload is triggered when the page containing the injected script is loaded in a victim's browser.

The provided information is consistent with a typical XSS vulnerability. The attacker requires administrative privileges, but once achieved, they can inject JavaScript that will execute in the browsers of other users when they interact with the vulnerable page/data.
