Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-36810:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from inefficient processing within the `PdfFileReader` when attempting to locate the `xref` marker in a PDF file. Specifically, the `readNextEndLine` method constructs lines by iteratively concatenating bytes, which leads to a quadratic time complexity, O(n^2), where n is the size of the input file. This occurs because Python strings are immutable and thus every concatenation creates a copy.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Algorithmic Complexity Issue:** The core weakness is the quadratic time complexity of the string concatenation within the `readNextEndLine` method. For a large file without the expected `xref` marker at the end, the operation can take an excessive amount of time.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can craft a malicious PDF file that lacks an `xref` marker at the end (or has a large amount of arbitrary data at the end), which when processed by the vulnerable `PyPDF2` library, will result in the consuming excessive CPU resources and lead to a denial of service, effectively freezing the process.
- **Resource Exhaustion:** The quadratic time complexity causes CPU resource exhaustion, potentially leading to a single core being fully utilized.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious PDF File:** The attack vector is a specially crafted PDF file that doesn't have the `xref` marker at the expected location, or which contains a significant amount of junk data at the end.
- **Local attack:** The vulnerability is triggered when processing the malformed PDF file, meaning the attacker needs to provide the file to the victim through some means.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   The attacker needs the ability to provide a malformed PDF file to the victim who is processing it with the vulnerable version of `PyPDF2`
-   No special privileges are required.

**Additional Details:**

-   The vulnerability was reported by Google-Autofuzz.
-   The fix involves changing the string concatenation method within the `readNextEndLine` to have linear runtime, O(n). This was done in PR #808.
-   The issue was present in versions <= 1.27.8.
-   Version 1.27.9 and above contain the fix.
-   The issue was publicly disclosed and assigned CVE-2023-36810 by Github.
