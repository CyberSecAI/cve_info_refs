The provided content relates to CVE-2023-36097.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insecure file upload within the `localinstall` method of `app\backend\controller\Addon.php` in funadmin. The method fails to perform adequate checks for malicious content (e.g., webshells or sensitive functions) within the uploaded plugin files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure file upload: The system does not validate the contents of the uploaded plugin files.
- Lack of sanitization/validation: The `localinstall` method does not check for the presence of webshells or other potentially harmful code within the plugin files before installation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: An attacker can upload a malicious plugin containing a webshell, allowing them to execute arbitrary code on the server.
- Full system compromise: Successful exploitation can lead to complete compromise of the affected system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Plugin upload functionality: The attacker exploits the "install offline" feature in the backend to upload a malicious plugin.
- File upload bypass: The lack of checks allows the attacker to bypass upload restrictions by including malicious code within the plugin's archive.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Access to the funadmin backend: The attacker needs access to the backend interface where the plugin install function is located.
- Ability to create/modify zip files: The attacker needs to be able to create or modify a valid plugin zip file that contains the malicious payload.

The content provides a detailed description of the vulnerability, including the affected file and method, the steps to reproduce the exploit, and a proof of concept using a webshell, which goes beyond the basic CVE description.
