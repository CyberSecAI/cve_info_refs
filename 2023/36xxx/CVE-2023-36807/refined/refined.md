Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-36807:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how `PyPDF2` parses malformed PDF objects, specifically within the `read_object` function in `PyPDF2/generic/_data_structures.py`. The function could enter an infinite loop when encountering a PDF with an invalid object structure, particularly within the `/Info` dictionary.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Infinite Loop:** The core issue was a lack of proper handling for non-standard objects during parsing, leading to an infinite loop in the `read_object` function. Specifically, when the code expected an indirect reference or a number object but didn't find one, it would continue to read the stream indefinitely instead of exiting.
*   **Lack of Input Validation/Sanitization:** The parser did not properly validate the structure of the PDF objects, leading to the infinite loop when unexpected data was encountered.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker could craft a malicious PDF file that triggers the infinite loop, causing the affected process to consume 100% of a CPU core.
*   **Process Hang:** The infinite loop would block the current process, making the application unresponsive while the loop continues.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious PDF File:** The primary attack vector is a specially crafted PDF file containing malformed or non-standard objects.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to provide a malformed PDF file to an application using the vulnerable `PyPDF2` version. This could be achieved by:
    *   Uploading the PDF file to a web application using the library.
    *   Convincing a user to open a malicious PDF using an application with the vulnerable library.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerability was present in the `read_object` function which did not handle tokens not matching the expected cases. The code was changed from:

```python
    else:
        # number object OR indirect reference
        peek = stream.read(20)
        stream.seek(-len(peek), 1)  # reset to start
        if IndirectPattern.match(peek) is not None:
            return IndirectObject.read_from_stream(stream, pdf)
        else:
            return NumberObject.read_from_stream(stream)
```

to:

```python
    elif tok in b"0123456789+-.":
        # number object OR indirect reference
        peek = stream.read(20)
        stream.seek(-len(peek), 1)  # reset to start
        if IndirectPattern.match(peek) is not None:
            return IndirectObject.read_from_stream(stream, pdf)
        else:
            return NumberObject.read_from_stream(stream)
    else:
        raise PdfReadError(
            f"Invalid Elementary Object starting with {tok} @{stream.tell()}"
        )
```

This change adds explicit handling of number tokens and a default case that raises an error when unexpected tokens are encountered, effectively preventing the infinite loop.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue was reported against PyPDF2 version 2.10.5 and fixed in 2.10.6.
*   The recommended mitigation is to update to `pypdf > 3.1.0` as PyPDF2 is deprecated.
*   The vulnerability affects the availability of the application but does not impact confidentiality or integrity.
* The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 6.2 with the following vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H
*   The fix also addressed warnings related to cmap encoding and other possible issues related to PDF parsing.
