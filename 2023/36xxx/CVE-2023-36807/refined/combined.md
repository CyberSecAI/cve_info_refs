# Possible Infinite Loop when reading malformed objects

Moderate

[MartinThoma](/MartinThoma)
published
GHSA-hm9v-vj3r-r55m
Jun 30, 2023

## Package

pip

PyPDF2
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

PyPDF2==2.10.5

## Patched versions

PyPDF2>=2.10.6

## Description

### Impact

An attacker who uses this vulnerability can craft a PDF which leads to an infinite loop.

This infinite loop blocks the current process and can utilize a single core of the CPU by 100%. It does not affect memory usage. That is, for example, the case if the user extracted metadata from such a malformed PDF.

### Patches

The issue was fixed with [#1331](https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/pull/1331)

### Workarounds

If you cannot update your version of `PyPDF2` (preferably to `pypdf>3.1.0` as PyPDF2 is deprecated), you should modify `PyPDF2/generic/_data_structures.py::read_object`.

Replace:

```
    else:
        # number object OR indirect reference
        peek = stream.read(20)
        stream.seek(-len(peek), 1)  # reset to start
        if IndirectPattern.match(peek) is not None:
            return IndirectObject.read_from_stream(stream, pdf)
        else:
            return NumberObject.read_from_stream(stream)
```

by

```
    elif tok in b"0123456789+-.":
        # number object OR indirect reference
        peek = stream.read(20)
        stream.seek(-len(peek), 1)  # reset to start
        if IndirectPattern.match(peek) is not None:
            return IndirectObject.read_from_stream(stream, pdf)
        else:
            return NumberObject.read_from_stream(stream)
    else:
        raise PdfReadError(
            f"Invalid Elementary Object starting with {tok} @{stream.tell()}"
        )
```

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

| When I try to read the metadata of [Effective Java 3rd Edition by Joshua Bloch.pdf](https://github.com/bookyue/my_books/blob/53e6378b740807dc7d18f871acbf80ee72962d31/programming_language/java/Effective%20Java%203rd%20Edition%20by%20Joshua%20Bloch.pdf) it takes extremely long. It might even be an infinite loop.

Cope with such situation fixed also a warning on cmap encoding  some other possible issues detected and injected  My concern is about test: the test PDF file does not respect the licensing.

| The fix was in `PyPDF2/generic/_data_structures.py`:  The `elif tok in b"0123456789+-.":` and  ```     else:         raise PdfReadError("...")  ```  broke the infinite loop |
