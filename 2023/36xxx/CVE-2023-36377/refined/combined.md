### 2.3 (2022.03.06)

**CRITICAL SECURITY VULNERABILITIES**

This release fixes several critical memory corruption vulnerabilities.

A malicious attacker could create a file, which, when processed with

osslsigncode, triggers arbitrary code execution. Any previous version

of osslsigncode should be immediately upgraded if the tool is used for

processing of untrusted files.

* fixed several memory safety issues
* fixed non-interactive PVK (MSBLOB) key decryption
* added a bash completion script
* added CA bundle path auto-detection

Debian LTS Advisory DLA-3693-1                debian-lts@lists.debian.org
<https://www.debian.org/lts/security/>                         Tobias Frost
December 23, 2023                             <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : osslsigncode
Version        : 2.0+really2.5-4+deb10u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2023-36377
Debian Bug     : 1035875

A Buffer Overflow vulnerability has been found in osslsigncode, a
OpenSSL based Authenticode signing tool for PE/MSI/Java CAB files, which
possibly allows an malicious attacker to execute arbitrary code when
signing a crafted file.

For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
2.0+really2.5-4+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your osslsigncode packages.

For the detailed security status of osslsigncode please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/osslsigncode>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>
