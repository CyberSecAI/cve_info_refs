- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The SCEP CA Certificate Name parameter in the web interface of affected devices lacks server-side input sanitization, allowing for command injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit could allow an authenticated, privileged remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the affected device.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted request containing malicious code through the SCEP CA Certificate Name parameter within the web interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated and have privileged access to the web interface of the affected device.
