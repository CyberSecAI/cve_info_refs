Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization and output encoding in the Hostel Management System. Specifically, user-supplied data in the "book hostel" functionality is not sanitized before being stored and subsequently displayed, allowing the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. The application does not properly sanitize user input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into various fields such as Guardian name, Guardian Relation, Complimentary Address, City, Permanent Address, and City.
- The injected scripts can execute in the browsers of other users who access the affected pages, potentially leading to:
    - **Session hijacking:** Stealing user cookies to gain unauthorized access to accounts.
    - **Data theft:** Accessing sensitive user data.
    - **Redirection to malicious sites:** Redirecting users to phishing or other malicious websites.
    - **Defacement:** Altering the appearance of the website.
    - **Malware distribution:** Injecting scripts that download and execute malware on the user's system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the "book hostel" functionality.
- An attacker injects malicious JavaScript payloads into the vulnerable input fields within the booking form.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a registered user of the Hostel Management System with the ability to access the "book hostel" feature.
- The attacker requires the ability to input arbitrary strings into the vulnerable fields.
- No special privileges are required, as the vulnerability is exploitable by regular users of the system.

**Additional Details:**
- The affected version is V-2.1 of the Hostel Management System
- Vulnerable fields include: Guardian name, Guardian Relation, Complimentary Address, City, Permanent Address, and City
- The vulnerability can be triggered by adding a malicious payload in the vulnerable fields when booking a hostel, and is triggered when viewing the booking information ("My Room").
- The system uses PHP and XAMPP for the local hosting.
