AWS data.all is an open source development framework to help users build a data marketplace on Amazon Web Services. data.all versions 1.2.0 through 1.5.1 do not prevent remote code execution when a user injects Python commands into the ‘Template’ field when configuring a data pipeline. The issue can only be triggered by authenticated users. A fix for this issue is available in data.all version 1.5.2 and later. There is no recommended work around.
