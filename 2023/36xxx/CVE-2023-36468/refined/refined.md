Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-36468:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**
The provided content is highly relevant to CVE-2023-36468. The GitHub Security Advisory `GHSA-8q9q-r9v2-644m` directly corresponds to this CVE. The included Jira ticket `XWIKI-20594` also confirms the issue, and the commit `15a6f845d8206b0ae97f37aa092ca43d4f9d6e59` represents the fix for the vulnerability.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The core issue is that when an XWiki installation is upgraded, and the upgrade includes a fix for a vulnerability within a document, only a new version of that document is added. The old, vulnerable versions of the document remain accessible and exploitable. This means that even after upgrading to a patched version, an attacker can still exploit the vulnerability by accessing older revisions of affected documents, or deleted documents.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Inadequate Version Handling:** The system did not properly restrict the execution of potentially dangerous code within older versions of documents.
   - **Lack of Restricted Mode for Old Revisions:**  Older revisions of documents were not automatically restricted, allowing for script execution vulnerabilities to persist.
   - **Script Macro Execution:** The vulnerability stems from the ability to execute script macros within the content of XWiki documents.
   - **Improper access control for old revisions:** Access to older document revisions did not enforce the same security restrictions as the current version.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  Attackers with low privileges (view rights) could potentially execute arbitrary code on the server, which was demonstrated by the example of CVE-2022-36100.
    - **Confidentiality breach**: Unauthorized access to sensitive data stored within the XWiki installation.
   - **Integrity breach**: Modification of data, including content and configurations, by the attacker.
    - **Availability breach**: Denial of service through resource exhaustion or other malicious activities.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers can gain programming rights, allowing them to bypass access controls and manipulate the entire XWiki installation.
   - **Bypassing Security Fixes:** Upgrading to a patched version of XWiki did not inherently prevent exploitation via older document revisions.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - **Direct URL Manipulation:**  Attackers can access older versions of documents by appending `rev=x.y` to the document URL.
   - **Document History:** Attackers could exploit vulnerabilities by accessing historical versions of documents through the XWiki history feature.
   - **Recycle Bin:** Restored documents from the recycle bin could still be vulnerable.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **Low Privileges:** An attacker only needs view rights to the affected documents in most cases.
   - **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the XWiki instance to send the crafted URL request.
   - **Knowledge of vulnerable document and version**: Attacker needs to have knowledge of a vulnerable document and a specific older revision to exploit it.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability also affects manually added script macros that contained security vulnerabilities that were later fixed by changing the script macro without deleting the versions with the security vulnerability from the history.
*   The fix involves introducing a "restricted" attribute to `XWikiDocument` objects. Old document revisions are marked as restricted and transformations (like script macros) are not executed on restricted documents.
*   The fix includes changes to the DocumentModelBridge, DocumentContentAsyncRenderer, DocumentTitleDisplayer, XWikiDocument, XWikiDocumentOutputFilterStream, and XWikiHibernateStore classes.
*   The commit also introduces tests for document restriction and old revision handling.
*  The vulnerability does not affect fresh installations of XWiki.
*  The vulnerability does not affect content loaded only from the current document version (like wiki macros or UI extensions).
