This document describes multiple vulnerabilities affecting Ovarro TBox RTUs, including CVE-2023-36607.

**CVE-2023-36607 Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** Missing authorization checks for certain API commands.
*   **Vulnerability:**  The affected TBox RTUs lack proper authorization checks for some API commands.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can execute these commands to reveal sensitive information such as software versions and web server file contents.
*  **Attack Vector:** Remote exploitation.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** No special privileges needed. An unauthenticated attacker can remotely exploit the vulnerability.

**Summary of other vulnerabilities mentioned:**

*   **CVE-2023-36608:** Use of the insecure MD5 algorithm for password hashing.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of hashed passwords
    *   **Attack Vector:** Remote with low privilege access.
*  **CVE-2023-36609:** Inclusion of functionality from an untrusted control sphere. OpenVPN runs with root privileges, and user-defined scripts can be executed.
    *   **Impact:** Privilege escalation by executing malicious scripts pushed via a local OpenVPN server
    *   **Attack Vector:** Remote with high privilege access.
*   **CVE-2023-36610:** Insufficient entropy in software security token generation.
    *  **Impact:** Brute-force authentication.
    *  **Attack Vector:** Remote, high complexity.
*   **CVE-2023-36611:** Improper authorization that allows low-privilege users to access higher privilege tokens.
    *   **Impact:** Privilege escalation by accessing higher-privilege tokens through an SSH session.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Remote with low privilege access.
*   **CVE-2023-3395:** Plaintext storage of passwords in memory by the TWinSoft Configuration Tool.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of plaintext passwords through memory access.
    *  **Attack Vector:** Remote with low privilege access to system files.

**Mitigation:**
The primary mitigation is to update the affected TBox RTUs to the latest version. Additional workarounds are provided such as disabling SSH access, using password protected files and updating TWinSoft.
