Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-36041:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a use-after-free condition triggered by a malformed `ElementType` element within an Excel spreadsheet. Specifically, the `ElementType` contains an `AttributeType` that is not permitted according to the file format documentation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-After-Free (CWE-416):** The core issue is that memory associated with a `HtmlPivotTableInfo` structure is deallocated prematurely due to the malformed `ElementType`. However, a dangling pointer to this freed memory is not reset, leading to the use-after-free condition when this pointer is later dereferenced.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By carefully crafting the Excel spreadsheet and performing heap grooming, an attacker can achieve full control over the use-after-free condition. This can lead to memory corruption and ultimately allow arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Excel File:** The primary attack vector is a specially crafted Excel spreadsheet.
- **User Interaction Required:** The attacker needs to trick the victim into opening the malicious Excel file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create a specially crafted malicious Excel file.
- The attacker needs to be able to get the victim to open the malicious file (e.g., through social engineering, email, or a compromised website).

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability occurs in the `FCommitHtmlPivotCacheElement` function of Excel.
- The `PivotCache` element and the related `HtmlPivotTableInfo` structure are involved.
- The vulnerability is triggered by an invalid `AttributeType` within the `ElementType` sub-element.
- The vulnerability involves heap allocation, deallocation, and a dangling pointer.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Marcin 'Icewall' Noga of Cisco Talos.
- The vulnerable version of Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2019 is Excel ver 2307 Build 16626.20170.
- A patch was released by Microsoft on November 14, 2023.
- The CVSSv3 score is 7.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).
