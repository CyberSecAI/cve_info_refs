Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization in the "Search Booking" field of the Online Security Guards Hiring System. This allows an attacker to inject malicious script into the field.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application does not sanitize or encode user-supplied input before displaying it on a web page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can execute arbitrary web scripts (JavaScript or HTML) within the context of the victim's browser.
- Potential impacts include: stealing user information (like session cookies), hijacking user sessions, defacing the website, or redirecting users to malicious sites.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by submitting a crafted XSS payload in the "Search Booking" field in the request status page.
- The attacker injects the malicious script via a user interface element (search input field).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable web application.
- The attacker needs to identify the vulnerable "Search Booking" field and inject a malicious payload into it.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided exploit payload is `<script>alert(1)</script>`. This payload demonstrates that the input is not being sanitized or encoded.
- The vulnerability is located in the "Request Status" functionality of the Online Security Guards Hiring System, specifically when using the "Search Booking" feature.
