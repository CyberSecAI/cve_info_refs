- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The RSA key pair used for signing and verifying JWT tokens is hard-coded within the OVA/OVF packages of ProLion CryptoSpike 3.0.15P2, instead of being randomly generated during system installation. The private key, although encrypted, can be easily decrypted using a password found within the `docker-compose.yml` file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
  - Hard-coded cryptographic private key.
  - Insecure storage of private key encryption password within configuration files.
  - Lack of procedure to generate new private keys
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote attackers can impersonate any user and assume any role within the web management and REST API endpoints by crafting malicious JWT tokens signed with the compromised private key. This could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and full system compromise.
- **Attack vectors**:
  - Network-based attacks: An attacker can craft a valid JWT token using the hardcoded private key.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
  - The attacker needs to have knowledge of the hardcoded private key and the encryption password (obtainable by analyzing files included with the software) to craft valid JWT tokens.
  - The attacker requires network access to the CryptoSpike system to send the malicious JWT tokens.
