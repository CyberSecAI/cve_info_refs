Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a **Broken Access Control** issue. Specifically, it is due to missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks within a function. This allows an unprivileged user to execute actions that should be restricted to higher-privileged users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Broken Access Control:** The plugin lacks proper checks to verify if the user has the necessary permissions to perform certain actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The specific impact varies depending on the affected function. However, in general, an unprivileged user (specifically a "Subscriber" role, as stated in the "Required privilege" section) could potentially perform actions that they are not supposed to.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the vulnerable functions within the SW Product Bundles plugin that lack proper access control checks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a "Subscriber" level user to exploit this vulnerability, which means they need a valid account with that role on the vulnerable WordPress site.

**Additional Information**
- The vulnerability affects SW Product Bundles plugin versions <= 2.0.15.
- There is no official fix available from the plugin developer.
- Patchstack has issued a virtual patch to mitigate the issue.
- The vulnerability is classified as "low severity" with a CVSS score of 5.4
