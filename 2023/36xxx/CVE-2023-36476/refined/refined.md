Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2023-36476:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause lies in the way the `calamares-nixos-extensions` graphical installer handles LUKS encrypted root partitions when an unencrypted `/boot` partition is also used. Specifically, the installer was creating a second initrd that contained the LUKS decryption keyfile in plaintext within a CPIO archive, and storing this on the unencrypted `/boot` partition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Plaintext Keyfile Storage:** The most critical vulnerability is storing the LUKS decryption keyfile (`crypto_keyfile.bin`) in plaintext within a CPIO archive.
- **Unencrypted `/boot` Partition:** The vulnerability is only present in configurations where the `/boot` partition is unencrypted. This is because the initrd containing the keyfile is placed within this unencrypted partition.
- **Second initrd:** The creation of a second initrd containing the keyfile, separate from the main initrd, was not necessary and introduced the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Full Disk Access:** An attacker gaining access to the unencrypted `/boot` partition could extract the plaintext LUKS keyfile. This would allow them to decrypt the LUKS encrypted root partition, gaining full access to the system's data.
- **Confidentiality Breach:** The primary impact is a complete breach of confidentiality for the data stored on the encrypted partition.
- **Integrity Breach:** With the ability to access data, the attacker can also modify it, resulting in a loss of data integrity.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Physical Access:** An attacker with physical access to the system could boot from a live environment, mount the `/boot` partition and extract the keyfile.
- **Remote Access via Compromised `/boot` Partition:** If the `/boot` partition was accessible remotely through a network share or some other vulnerability, an attacker could extract the keyfile remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to `/boot` partition:** The attacker must have read access to the `/boot` partition.
- **Basic Linux Knowledge:** The attacker needs basic knowledge of Linux file systems and CPIO archives to extract the keyfile.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is specific to installations using the graphical `calamares-nixos-extensions` installer and is not present when using the command-line `nixos-install`.
- The issue was present in versions 0.3.12 and earlier of the `calamares-nixos-extensions` package, and was resolved in version 0.3.13.
- The initial report of the issue was tracked in linuxboot/heads#1348.
- A regression of this vulnerability was reported in the 24.05 version of the installer which was later fixed and assigned  GHSA-vfxf-gpmj-2p25.
- The vulnerability affects both non-UEFI systems, and UEFI systems with a LUKS partition different from `/`.
- The recommended workaround is to re-encrypt affected LUKS partitions.
- The fix involved removing the second initrd containing the plaintext keyfile.
