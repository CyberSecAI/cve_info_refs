Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-36085:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**
   - The provided content from github.com directly mentions CVE-2023-36085 and describes a host header injection vulnerability. This confirms that the content is related to the specified CVE.

**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**
   - The root cause is a failure to properly validate the Host header in HTTP requests when constructing redirect URLs. The application uses the provided `Host` header value to create the `Location` header in HTTP responses, specifically 302 redirects, without validating if it's a trusted or expected value.

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
   - **Host Header Injection:** The core vulnerability is the ability to inject a malicious hostname via the `Host` header.
   - **Unvalidated Redirect:** The application does not validate or sanitize the Host header before using it to generate the URL in the `Location` header, resulting in an open redirect vulnerability.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**
   - **Redirection to Malicious Sites:** An attacker can redirect users to an arbitrary, attacker-controlled domain.
   - **Phishing:** This can be used in phishing attacks, where users are tricked into submitting credentials or sensitive information on a fake website that appears to be the real application.
   - **Manipulated Webpage Links:** The attacker can manipulate webpage links to point to the malicious site.

**5. Attack vectors:**
   - **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker sends an HTTP request to a vulnerable endpoint, modifying the `Host` header to inject a malicious hostname.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**
   - **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
   - **No authentication is required** to exploit this.
   - **No special privileges are required.**
