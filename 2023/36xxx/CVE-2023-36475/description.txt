Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 5.5.2 and 6.2.1, an attacker can use a prototype pollution sink to trigger a remote code execution through the MongoDB BSON parser. A patch is available in versions 5.5.2 and 6.2.1.
