Based on the provided documents, here's information regarding CVE-2023-36475:

**Description:** Remote code execution via MongoDB BSON parser through prototype pollution.

**Vulnerability:** Prototype pollution in the MongoDB BSON parser. This likely arises from the way the application handles and deserializes BSON data from MongoDB, allowing an attacker to manipulate object prototypes.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input validation and sanitization when processing MongoDB BSON data, which allows attackers to inject malicious payloads that can pollute the prototype chain.

**Attack Vector:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted payload containing malicious BSON data to the parse-server. This payload leverages prototype pollution to achieve remote code execution.

**Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution, potentially allowing an attacker to gain full control of the affected system.

**Affected Versions:**
- Versions prior to 5.5.2
- Versions greater than or equal to 6.0.0 and less than 6.2.1

**Patched Versions:**
- Versions greater than or equal to 5.5.2 and less than 6.0.0
- Versions greater than or equal to 6.2.1

**Mitigation:** Prevent prototype pollution in MongoDB database adapter. Disable remote code execution through the MongoDB BSON parser. The fix involves checking for prohibited keywords in request data to prevent malicious BSON payloads from being processed.

**Code Changes:**
The fix includes changes to the following files:
- `.eslintrc.json`: Added "Parse": true to globals.
- `spec/vulnerabilities.spec.js`: Added tests to deny creating global config or direct database writes/updates with polluted data.
- `src/Controllers/DatabaseController.js`: Added `Utils.checkProhibitedKeywords` to `create` and `update` methods to prevent prohibited keywords in request data.
- `src/RestWrite.js`: Added `Utils.checkProhibitedKeywords` to prevent prohibited keywords in request data.
- `src/Routers/FilesRouter.js`: Added `Utils.checkProhibitedKeywords` to prevent prohibited keywords in request data for file uploads.
- `src/Utils.js`: Added `checkProhibitedKeywords` method to check for prohibited keywords in request data.
