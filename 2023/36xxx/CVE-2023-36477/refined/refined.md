Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-36477:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient access control on the CKEditor configuration pages within the XWiki platform. Specifically, users with basic "edit" rights could modify the CKEditor configuration, which includes an "Advanced Configuration" field. This field allows the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Access Control:** The primary weakness is that users with general edit rights could modify critical CKEditor configurations, which should be restricted to administrative roles.
*   **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The ability to inject JavaScript code into the CKEditor configuration leads to a persistent XSS vulnerability. This means that the malicious JavaScript is stored and executed whenever any user interacts with CKEditor.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Persistent XSS:** Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code that executes within the browser of any user interacting with CKEditor.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could potentially modify content, leading to data integrity issues, and remove technical documents, causing loss of service
*   **Account Takeover:** The injected JavaScript can be used for account hijacking by stealing cookies or session tokens.
*   **Arbitrary actions:** Attackers can use the injected javascript to perform any harmful actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The attack is network-based since an attacker needs to access the XWiki instance to exploit it.
*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited through the web interface of the XWiki platform via the CKEditor configuration pages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** An attacker needs to have an account on the XWiki platform with "edit" rights.
*   **Access to CKEditor Configuration:** The attacker needs to be able to access and modify the CKEditor configuration pages, specifically the "Advanced Configuration" field.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects multiple components, including `org.xwiki.contrib:application-ckeditor-ui` and `org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-ckeditor-ui`.
*   The issue was addressed in XWiki versions 14.10.6 and 15.1 and in the CKEditor Integration extension version 1.64.9 for older versions of XWiki.
*   A workaround is to restrict edit and delete rights for the CKEditor configuration to trusted users or groups such as `XWiki.XWikiAdminGroup`.
*   The vulnerability also affects other CKEditor configurations like `CKEditor.ConfigSheet`, `CKEditor.ConfigTemplate`, and `CKEditor.AdminSection`, which can also be used to inject malicious JavaScript.
* The CVSS score is 9.1 (Critical) with base metrics: AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

**CWE:**

*   CWE-80 (Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)).
