The provided content describes two heap-buffer-overflow vulnerabilities in the `libredwg` library's `dwg2SVG` tool, discovered through fuzzing.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   **BUG1:** A heap-buffer-overflow occurs in the `bit_utf8_to_TU` function (`/libredwg/src/bits.c:2883`). This is triggered when processing a specially crafted DWG file (`poc0.bit_utf8_to_TU`).
*  **BUG2:** A heap-buffer-overflow occurs in the `bit_wcs2nlen` function (`/libredwg/src/bits.c:1834`), triggered by a different crafted DWG (`poc1.bit_wcs2nlen`).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Heap-buffer-overflow in `bit_utf8_to_TU` during UTF-8 string conversion/processing.
*   Heap-buffer-overflow in `bit_wcs2nlen`, possibly related to wide character string handling.
*   The `dwg_is_valid_tag` function is present in the call stack of both vulnerabilities, suggesting it may be involved in the vulnerable code paths.
*   Both vulnerabilities occur during the decoding of ATTRIB entities within DWG files.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   The vulnerabilities lead to a crash of the `dwg2SVG` tool due to a heap-buffer-overflow, as demonstrated by the AddressSanitizer output.
*   Successful exploitation could potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, but this is not explicitly stated. The provided information indicates that an out-of-bounds write or read occurs, which can be used for further exploitation.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through a maliciously crafted DWG file that is processed by the `dwg2SVG` tool.
*   The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted DWG file (`poc0.bit_utf8_to_TU` or `poc1.bit_wcs2nlen`) as input to the vulnerable program, `dwg2SVG`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious DWG file as input to `dwg2SVG`.
*   No other special capabilities are required besides knowledge of the vulnerabilities.
