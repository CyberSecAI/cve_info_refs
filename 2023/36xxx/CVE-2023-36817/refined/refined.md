- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A Stripe API key was unintentionally committed and exposed in the public codebase.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Exposure of sensitive information (Stripe API key)
    - Hardcoded credentials in the codebase
    - Failure to use secure storage mechanisms for secrets
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Unauthorized transactions on behalf of the organization
    - Financial losses
    - Access to sensitive customer information
    - Privacy violations
    - Potential legal implications
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack. An attacker could gain access to the leaked API key through the public code repository.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs access to the public repository where the API key was committed and requires no user interaction. The attacker also needs to be able to use the API key with Stripe, implying some knowledge of the Stripe API. The attacker can be logically remote (network based).
