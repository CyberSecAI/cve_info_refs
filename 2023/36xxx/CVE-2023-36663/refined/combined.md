13.06.2023

[![openITCOCKPIT 4.6.5 released](/assets/images/blog/4.6.5/openITCOCKPIT_4.6.5.png)](/assets/images/blog/4.6.5/openITCOCKPIT_4.6.5.png)

With this release we resolve critical security vulnerabilities. **Please install this update as fast as possible!**

# Resolved security vulnerabilities

> On **Jun 4th 2023** [tuannq2299](https://github.com/tuannq2299) reported a security vulnerability to us.
> The issue is caused by a race condition and could lead to multiple user accounts, with the same email address.
>
> The report was created through the `huntr.dev` platform: <https://huntr.dev/bounties/94d50b11-20ca-46e3-9086-dd6836421675/>
> The issue could only be exploited, by logged in users with access to the user management of openITCOCKPIT.

Â

> On **Jun 7th 2023** Hieu Dang ([GitHub profile](https://github.com/hiu240900), [Twitter profile](https://twitter.com/H3nt4r2409)) reported a critical SQL injection in the `sort` parameter of the API interface.
>
> The issue could only be exploited, by logged in users.

The following issues will be resolved by updating to openITCOCKPIT 4.6.5

 Impact | CVE | Found by | ID | Vulnerability Summary || High | [CVE-2023-36663](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-36663) | [hiu240900](https://github.com/hiu240900) | ITC-3017 | **SQL injection:** The sort endpoints of the API are vulnerable for SQL injections. |
| Medium | [CVE-2023-3218](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-3218) | [tuannq2299](https://github.com/tuannq2299) | ITC-3014 | **Race Condition:** Create multiple user with the same username |

Both discovered vulnerabilities require a logged in user. We recommend to install the update as fast as possible.
