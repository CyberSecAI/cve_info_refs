Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-36663:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of proper sanitization of the `sort` parameter in the API interface of openITCOCKPIT. This allows for the injection of arbitrary SQL code when handling user-supplied data for sorting database queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw. User-controlled input (`sort` parameter) is directly incorporated into SQL queries without proper validation or sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker could potentially extract sensitive information from the database by injecting malicious SQL queries.
- **Data Manipulation:** It might be possible for an attacker to modify or delete data within the database, leading to data integrity issues.
- **Denial of Service:** An attacker could potentially execute resource-intensive queries to cause performance degradation or a denial of service.
- **Complete System Compromise:** Depending on the database user permissions, it may be possible to gain full control of the system through the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **API Interface:** The vulnerability exists within the API interface of openITCOCKPIT, specifically in the endpoints that handle sorting.
- **HTTP Parameter:** The `sort` parameter is used as the attack vector via HTTP requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in user with access to the API interface.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The fix for this vulnerability includes:
    - Sanitizing the `sort` parameter by using `SanitizeOrder::filterOrderColumn($sort)` to filter allowed characters/values in the `AngularRequest.php` file
    - Validating the sort order array `SanitizeOrder::filterOrderArray($this->order)` in various condition files including `ContainerConditions.php`, `HostConditions.php`, `HostgroupConditions.php`, `ListSettingsConditions.php`, `MapConditions.php`, `ServiceConditions.php`, `ServicegroupConditions.php`, `ServicetemplategroupsConditions.php`, and `SystemdowntimesConditions.php`.
    - Adding a new exception class `FishyQueryException.php` to prevent SQL execution if malicious sort values are provided.
    - Adding `SanitizeOrder.php` class for sanitizing order values.
- The vulnerability was reported by Hieu Dang ([hiu240900](https://github.com/hiu240900) ) on June 7th 2023.
- The issue is addressed in openITCOCKPIT version 4.6.5.
