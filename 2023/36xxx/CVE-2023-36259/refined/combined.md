In the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity, recent scrutiny has unveiled two critical vulnerabilities within CraftCMS, identified as CVE-2023-36259 (Stored XSS) and CVE-2023- 36260 (DoS).

The first vulnerability, CVE-2023-36259, highlights a Stored Cross-Site Scripting flaw stemming from deficient input validation within CraftCMS's Audit Plugin. Malicious actors are able to exploit this vulnerability by introducing malevolent JavaScript code during the user creation phase.

 After accessing the "audit" tab, users inadvertently trigger the execution of the injected code, potentially resulting in unauthorised access and data breaches.

Notably, CraftCMS promptly addressed this issue in version 3.0.2 of the Audit Plugin, signifying a dedication to enhancing security protocols.

The second vulnerability, CVE-2023-36260, manifests as a Denial of Service (DoS) hazard. This vulnerability capitalises on CraftCMS's susceptibility to injected JavaScript code, particularly within specific fields (Name and Feed URL).

 By adroitly manipulating these fields, cyber attackers can set off a sequence of errors upon accessing the "feed-me" page.

This effectively renders the targeted website non-responsive, inflicting significant financial losses and reputational harm.

Recognising the gravity of this threat, CraftCMS responded with a patch released in version >4.6.1.1, effectively mitigating the vulnerability and safeguarding against potential service disruptions.

AMR CyberSecurity, the security research entity behind the discovery of these vulnerabilities, strongly recommends a prompt and comprehensive response. Updating to version 3.0.2 of the Audit Plugin and CraftCMS version >4.6.1.1 (for the DoS vulnerability) is essential to mitigating these risks. These instances underscore the paramount importance of proactive security measures, robust input validation, and swift updates in the continuous endeavour to fortify digital systems against the evolving landscape of cybersecurity threats

This article makes it sound like these vulnerabilities are in the core CraftCMS product itself. That is not correct.
The Audit plugin ([https://plugins.craftcms.com/audit](https://plugins.craftcms.com/audit?trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_x-social-details_comments-action_comment-text)) is a third party plugin, and FeedMe ([https://plugins.craftcms.com/feed-me](https://plugins.craftcms.com/feed-me?trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_x-social-details_comments-action_comment-text)) is a first party plugin. Both need to be specifically installed separately to CraftCMS itself, and are not installed automatically as dependencies of CraftCMS. While it's obviously important to keep dependencies up to date, this significantly reduces the number of sites that will be affected.
Further, my personal view is that the language used in this article is misleading and, frankly, pretty overblown.
It doesn't make clear that both vulnerabilities require both the relevant plugin to be installed and for the attacker to already have authenticated access to the CraftCMS control panel and permissions to access the relevant plugins settings pages within that control panel. If an attacker already has that level of access then the site likely has a waaay bigger problem than injected XSS + DDOS via the vectors described.
For clarity, I don't work for Pixel & Tonic (the makers of Craft) but I do have 10+ years experience developing using their products for agencies and other third parties.

There is a persistent XSS vulnerabily within Audit that you can replicate when Creating or Amending a user within Craft.

I have sanitized user input to fix this issue.

Are you able to merge and tag?
