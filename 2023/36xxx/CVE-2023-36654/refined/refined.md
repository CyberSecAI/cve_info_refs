Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a directory traversal flaw in the `/logs/:filename` REST API endpoint of ProLion CryptoSpike 3.0.15P2. The application fails to properly sanitize user-provided input for the filename parameter, allowing attackers to inject directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`)

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of input sanitization, allowing attackers to navigate the file system outside the intended log directory.
*   **Lack of Access Control:** The endpoint allows users with only "Logs / DOWNLOAD" READ permissions to access and download sensitive files outside the log directory.
*   **Exposure of Sensitive Information:** The directory traversal vulnerability exposes the system's SSH private key (specifically, `../../ssh/update_key`), which grants root access to the host servers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full System Compromise:** By exploiting the directory traversal and obtaining the SSH private key, attackers can gain root access to all CryptoSpike host servers (both Leader and Agent servers).
*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can potentially access and exfiltrate sensitive data from the compromised servers.
*   **System Control:** Gaining root access allows attackers to perform any action on the systems, including modification, deletion, or further exploitation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The attack can be performed remotely over the network.
*   **REST API Endpoint:** The attack vector is through the vulnerable `/logs/:filename` REST API endpoint.
*   **Directory Traversal Injection:** The attacker injects directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) within the `filename` parameter of the API request.
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The API call uses a GET HTTP request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of CryptoSpike with the "Logs / DOWNLOAD" permission set to READ.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the CryptoSpike application.
*   **Knowledge of the API:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable API endpoint and its parameters.
