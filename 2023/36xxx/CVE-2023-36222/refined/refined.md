Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in the Github issue #206, which is linked to CVE-2023-36222:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper input sanitization in the `bbs-go` application. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize user-provided comments before displaying them in the admin panel.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to stored XSS. Malicious JavaScript code can be injected via user comments and stored in the database. When an administrator views these comments through the admin panel, the injected JavaScript code executes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Cookie Theft:**  The injected JavaScript can be used to steal the administrator's cookies, which can then be used to hijack the admin session.
- **Account Hijacking:** Successful exploitation can lead to the hijacking of the administrator's account.
- **Data Theft:** The attacker can potentially access or manipulate sensitive data.
- **Malicious Actions:** An attacker can perform administrative actions, including modifying content and settings, on the compromised platform.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **User Comment:** The primary attack vector is through user comments on articles within the bbs-go forum.
- **Admin Panel:** The vulnerability is triggered when an administrator views the comments in the admin panel (specifically under "Content Management - Article Management").

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Registered User:** An attacker needs to register as a normal user to post comments.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs knowledge of the XSS vulnerability to craft the malicious payload.
- **Access to the Forum:** The attacker needs access to the forum to comment.
- **Admin Interaction:** The attack requires the administrator to visit the admin panel and view the malicious comment to trigger the XSS.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in `bbs-go` versions up to and including 3.5.5.
- The vulnerability is located in the `comment_controller.go` file (specifically line 71) within the `server` module.
- The fix involves HTML-encoding the comment content before rendering it in the admin interface, using `html.EscapeString` ( `builder.Put("content", html.EscapeString(comment.Content))`)
- The exploit payload mentioned in the report is  `<img src onerror=alert(123)>`
