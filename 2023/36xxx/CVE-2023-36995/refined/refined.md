Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-36995:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-controlled data in the `COOKUSR` cookie and alliance tag/name, resulting in Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
*   Specifically, the `login.php` script uses `stripslashes` multiple times on the `COOKUSR` cookie, effectively un-escaping potentially malicious content before echoing it into the HTML.
*   Additionally, the alliance tag is not properly sanitized before being displayed on various pages, including the map and player list.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected XSS:**  The statistics page is vulnerable to reflected XSS, though not detailed.
*   **Persistent XSS:** The alliance tag/name, admin log, and the `COOKUSR` cookie are vulnerable to persistent XSS.
*   **Lack of Security Headers:** The application lacks a Content Security Policy (CSP) header, which would mitigate XSS attacks.
*   **Missing HTTP Cookie Flags:** HTTP cookie flags such as `HttpOnly` and `Secure` are missing, allowing JavaScript to access and modify cookies.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Session Hijacking:** An attacker can steal session cookies, potentially gaining access to user accounts, including admin accounts.
*   **Credential Theft:** Using the XSS vulnerability in the `COOKUSR` cookie and alliance tag, attackers can inject malicious JavaScript to steal usernames and passwords.
*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** The attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser when they interact with the vulnerable page elements.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Alliance Tag:** An attacker sets a malicious alliance tag/name containing JavaScript code. When other users view the map, player list, or user page where this tag is displayed, the malicious JavaScript executes.
*   **Malicious Admin Log:** Injecting malicious code into the admin log via failed login attempts. When an admin views the admin log the code executes.
*   **Malicious COOKUSR Cookie:** An attacker can set a malicious `COOKUSR` cookie using JavaScript to inject an XSS payload that steals user credentials upon login.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Modify Alliance Tag:** The attacker must be able to set a malicious alliance tag/name through the game interface.
*   **Ability to perform failed login attempts** The attacker must be able to perform failed login attempts to inject code into the admin log.
*   **Access to the victim's browser:** The attacker needs a victim to visit the game website and view the injected XSS.
*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs to be able to send collected data (e.g., stolen credentials) to an external server.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The blog post from bramdoessecurity.com provides extensive details on how the vulnerability can be exploited. It also includes a proof-of-concept exploit for stealing plaintext passwords.
*   The pull request #43 on GitHub indicates that a patch for this CVE has been released.
* The provided content indicates that self XSS is still dangerous if cookie flags are not properly configured.

This information is significantly more detailed than the placeholder CVE description and accurately reflects the vulnerability and its exploitation.
