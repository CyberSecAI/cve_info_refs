- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function. This allows an unprivileged user to execute higher privileged actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control, specifically missing authorization checks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user can execute actions that should be restricted to higher privileged users, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data modification, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**:  The vulnerability is exploitable by an unauthenticated user, suggesting it can be exploited remotely without prior login or authentication.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs no prior authentication and can exploit the vulnerability remotely.
