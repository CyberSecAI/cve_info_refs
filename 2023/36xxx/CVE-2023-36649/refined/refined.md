- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Sensitive JWT tokens are included in logs collected by Grafana. Additionally, Grafana's HTTP interface and Loki REST API are exposed without proper authentication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Inclusion of sensitive JWT tokens in logs.
    - Grafana web interface accessible over HTTP without redirection to HTTPS or another port.
    - Exposure of Loki REST API without authentication.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - An attacker can impersonate other users on the CryptoSpike web management interface by obtaining JWT tokens from the logs.
    - Full access to the Grafana logs through unauthenticated Loki REST API access.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Accessing Grafana logs, either through the Grafana web interface (potentially over HTTP) or the unauthenticated Loki REST API.
    - Using extracted JWT tokens to impersonate other users.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Access to the Grafana system, either directly or through the unauthenticated Loki REST API.
    - Ability to read logs in Grafana
