- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The affected devices are configured to offer weak ciphers by default.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Inadequate Encryption Strength (CWE-326).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthorized attacker in a man-in-the-middle position can read and modify any data passed to and from the affected device.
- **Attack vectors**: Man-in-the-middle attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be in a man-in-the-middle position to intercept communications. User interaction is required.
