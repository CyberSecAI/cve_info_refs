Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-36617:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content clearly relates to CVE-2023-36617. The Red Hat Bugzilla entry, the NetApp advisory, and the Ruby-lang.org post all specifically mention this CVE ID and describe a ReDoS vulnerability in the `rubygem-uri` library.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Incomplete Fix:** The vulnerability arises from an incomplete fix for a previous ReDoS issue (CVE-2023-28755) in the `uri` component of Ruby. The original fix didn't fully address the underlying problem, leaving the parser vulnerable to specific character sequences in invalid URLs.
*   **Mishandling of Invalid URLs:** The vulnerability stems from how the URI parser mishandles invalid URLs that contain specific characters leading to increased execution time. The vulnerability exists in `rfc2396_parser.rb` and `rfc3986_parser.rb`.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service):** The core vulnerability is a ReDoS, which occurs when a regular expression exhibits extremely long processing times given certain input. This is due to the way the parser handles crafted URLs with specific characters.
*   **Incomplete Patch:**  The previous patch for CVE-2023-28755 was not comprehensive, leaving a similar attack vector open.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact of successful exploitation is a denial-of-service condition. By providing specially crafted URLs, an attacker can cause the affected system to consume excessive CPU resources, leading to performance degradation or a complete service outage.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malformed URLs:** The attack vector involves providing a malformed URL to the URI parser. The malformed URLs contain specific character sequences that trigger the vulnerable regex.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Special Privileges:** The attacker does not require any special privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send malformed URL strings to the affected system or application. This implies network access to the affected service.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   **Affected Components:** The `rubygem-uri` component of Ruby versions prior to 0.12.2 and 0.10.3.
*   **Specific Files:** The vulnerability is in  `rfc2396_parser.rb` and `rfc3986_parser.rb` within the `uri` gem.
*   **NetApp Products:** Several NetApp products may be affected, although many were explicitly listed as not affected. Some products were listed as under investigation and therefore, potentially vulnerable.
*   **Red Hat Products:** Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and 9 were listed as affected and have released errata to address this issue.
*  **Upstream Fix:**  The fix is available in rubygem-uri versions 0.12.2 and 0.10.3.
*   **Mitigation:** The primary method of remediation is upgrading the `rubygem-uri` library or upgrading Ruby to a patched version.
