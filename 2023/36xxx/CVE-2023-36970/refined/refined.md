{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize the filename parameter during file upload, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to session hijacking, defacement of the website, or redirection to malicious websites.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker uploads a file with a malicious payload embedded in the filename parameter via the file manager.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with access to the 'File Manager' functionality."
