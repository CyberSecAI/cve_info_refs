# What is WManager

WManager is a business process manager and a development framework for companies.
As a process manager it implements the concept of POA (plan-of-activities)
and includes an innovative CMS like templating mechanisms for forms.
As a development framework WManager allows developers to write custom code
or to use extensions from third parties. By combining configuration and development tasks,
WManager helps creating a winning scenario for final users, business analysis partners,
system integrators and developers.

For instance: WManager helps final users to reduce the time-to-market of their projects;
it can increase the governance thanks to the growing community of skilled partners;
it creates business opportunities for developers through the possibility to reuse code in
form of extensions.
