Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-36461:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient timeout handling when Mastodon makes outbound HTTP requests. While individual read operations had timeouts, the overall response duration could be extended indefinitely by a malicious server using slowloris-type attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Inadequate timeout enforcement on the complete HTTP response, specifically for slow responses from remote servers.
- The read timeout was not cumulative, allowing malicious servers to send data slowly to bypass the read timeouts.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS). By keeping Mastodon workers occupied for extended periods, the server can become unresponsive, effectively denying service to legitimate users.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attacks. A malicious server can exploit this vulnerability by sending slow responses to requests made by the Mastodon server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to control a server that responds to HTTP requests made by a Mastodon instance.
- No specific user interaction is required to trigger this vulnerability.
- No special privileges are needed to exploit this vulnerability, it can be triggered remotely and by anyone.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Cure53 during an audit requested by Mozilla.
- Patches were released in Mastodon versions 4.1.3, 4.0.5, and 3.5.9, which addressed the vulnerability by improving the timeout handling of outbound HTTP requests. The fix involved using `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` instead of `Time.now` and making read timeouts cumulative.
- The patched code introduces a loop that checks the remaining time until a deadline, raising an exception if the timeout is reached. It also handles cases where a socket might be closed unexpectedly.
- The commit message associated with the fix is "Fix timeout handling of outbound HTTP requests".
- The advisory is referenced by GHSA-9pxv-6qvf-pjwc.
