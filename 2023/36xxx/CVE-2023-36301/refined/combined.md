| CVE-2023-33247 | High | All versions of the Talend Data Catalog remote harvesting server before 8.0-20230413 contain an /upgrade endpoint which allows an unauthenticated WAR file to be deployed on the server.  A mitigation is that the remote harvesting server should be behind a firewall which only allows access to the Talend Data Catalog server.  Users of Talend Data Catalog should upgrade to 8.0-20230413 or a later release.  Credit: Ryan Wincey of Securifera, Stephen Yackey of Securifera, and Christian Weiler | 8.0-20230413 | Published:  2023-05-24  Updated:  2023-06-09 | [Read more](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-33247) |
| CVE-2023-31444 | High | Talend Studio microservices allow unauthenticated access to the Jolokia endpoint of the microservice. This allows for remote access to the JVM via the Jolokia JMX-HTTP bridge.  Please note that only Talend Studio microservice deployments are impacted, Talend Studio itself and other Talend Studio components are not impacted. The ESB Runtime is also not impacted. Please update to at least versions 8.0.1-R2022-09 or 7.3.1-R2022-10 to fix the issue. | 8.0.1-R2022-09  7.3.1-R2022-10 | Published:  2023-04-28  Updated:  2023-04-28 | [Read more](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-31444) |
| CVE-2023-26264 | Medium | All versions before 8.0-20220907 are potentially vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks in the license parsing code. Users of Talend Data Catalog should upgrade to 8.0-20220907 or a later release. | 8.0-20220907 | Published:  2023-03-28  Updated:  2023-04-21 | [Read more](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-26264) |
| CVE-2023-26263 | Medium | All versions before 8.0-20230110 are potentially vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks in the /MIMBWebServices/license endpoint of the remote harvesting server. Users of Talend Data Catalog who are using the remote harvesting server should upgrade to 8.0-20230110 or a later release.  A mitigation is that the remote harvesting server should have the remote address valve configured to only allow the MM server to connect.  Credit: Ryan Wincey of Securifera, Stephen Yackey of Securifera, and Christian Weiler | 8.0-20230110 | Published:  2023-03-28  Updated:  2023-04-21 | [Read more](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-26263) |
| CVE-2022-45588 | High | All versions before R2022-09 of Talend's Remote Engine Gen 2 are potentially vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) type of attacks. Users should download the R2022-09 release or later and use it in place of the previous version. Talend Remote Engine Gen 1 and Talend Cloud Engine for Design are not impacted.

Other Talend ESB Runtime services are not impacted by this vulnerability.  Talend Analysis: The impact is limited as it requires administrative privileges to exploit. | 8.0.1-R2022-10-RT  7.3.1-R2022-09-RT | Published:  2023-02-01  Updated:  2023-04-04 | [Read more](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-45589) |
