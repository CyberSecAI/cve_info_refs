Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2023-36223:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the application's failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the "website announcement" section within the administrative panel. Specifically, the `bbs-go` application does not sanitize the input before rendering it on the front-end for all users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS flaw. Malicious JavaScript code injected by an admin in the website announcement field is stored in the database and executed whenever a user accesses the site, because the input is not sanitized/escaped before being displayed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser.
- **Cookie Theft/Session Hijacking:** The attacker can steal user cookies, potentially leading to session hijacking and unauthorized access to user accounts.
- **Data Exfiltration:** Sensitive data can be exfiltrated by executing javascript that sends the data to an attacker controlled server
- **Malicious redirection:** The injected javascript could redirect users to malicious websites.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Admin Panel:** The attack vector is through the admin panelâ€™s "website announcement" configuration.
- **Front-end User Browsing:** The malicious script gets triggered when any user visits the website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Administrative Privileges:** The attacker needs to have administrative privileges to access the admin panel and modify the website announcement settings.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Input:** The attacker has to know the specific input that is not sanitized (website announcement).
- **Knowledge of payload:** The attacker has to know the structure of a valid javascript payload to inject.

**Additional Details:**
- **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability affects `bbs-go` versions 3.5.5 and earlier.
- **Payload Example:** The provided content uses `<script>alert(123)</script>` as a proof of concept payload.
- **Suggested Fix:** The suggested fix involves sanitizing user input using `render.HandleHtmlContent` before storing it in the database. This method will escape HTML special characters in order to prevent XSS execution. The fix is suggested for the following files:
    - `bbs-go\server\controllers\api\config_controller.go`
    - `bbs-go\server\controllers\render\misc_render.go`
    - `controllers/render/article_render.go`
    - `controllers/render/comment_render.go`
    - `controllers/render/topic_render.go`
- The issue was closed with the reasoning that if an administrator wants to configure the website in such a way, it should not be restricted.
