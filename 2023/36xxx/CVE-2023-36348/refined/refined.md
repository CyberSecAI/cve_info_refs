Based on the provided content, here's the analysis for CVE-2023-36348:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The application does not properly sanitize the `filename` parameter when processing file uploads in the `/fungsi/edit/edit.php?gambar=user` endpoint. This allows an attacker to upload a file with a malicious extension (e.g., .php).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure File Upload:** The application relies solely on mime-type checks and lacks proper file extension validation during file uploads, allowing for the upload of arbitrary files, including executable ones like PHP files.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading a PHP file and then accessing it directly, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Full System Compromise:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain complete control of the web server by executing arbitrary code. This can lead to data breaches, malware deployment, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** An attacker sends a multipart/form-data POST request to the `/fungsi/edit/edit.php?gambar=user` endpoint.
- **File Upload:** The POST request includes a file with a malicious extension (e.g., .php) in the `foto` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user of the application to access the vulnerable upload functionality.
