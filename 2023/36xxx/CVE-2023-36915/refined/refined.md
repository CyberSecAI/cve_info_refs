Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-36915

**Root Cause:** Integer overflow in `fstReaderIterBlocks2` during the allocation of `chain_table`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The `vc_maxhandle` value, read from the FST file, is used to calculate the size of the `chain_table` buffer. When `vc_maxhandle` is set to a very large value (e.g., -1 as a 64-bit unsigned integer), the addition (`vc_maxhandle + 1`) can wrap around to 0 or a small number, leading to a small memory allocation.
*   **Heap Out-of-Bounds Write:**  The `chain_table` and `chain_table_lengths` buffers are later written to based on data from the file within a loop, controlled by an independent value (`chain_clen`).  If the initial allocation was small due to the integer overflow, this leads to writing beyond the bounds of the allocated buffer in the heap.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By carefully crafting a malicious FST file, an attacker can cause the integer overflow, leading to an out-of-bounds write. This can be leveraged to overwrite other heap structures and eventually gain arbitrary code execution on the target system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious FST File:** The vulnerability is triggered by opening a specially crafted `.fst` file. This could occur by double-clicking on the file, or by opening it through GTKWave's UI or command line.
*   **User Interaction:** The user needs to open the malicious file to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **File Creation:** The attacker needs to be able to create or modify a `.fst` file.
*   **User Lure:** The attacker needs to convince a user to open the malicious `.fst` file with GTKWave.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is in the `fstReaderIterBlocks2` function.
*   The `chain_table` and `chain_table_lengths` buffers are allocated based on the `vc_maxhandle` value, which is read from the file.
*   The `chain_clen` value, also read from the file, controls how much data is written into the `chain_table` and `chain_table_lengths` buffers in a loop.
*   The vulnerability can be triggered by both `FST_BL_VCDATA` and `FST_BL_VCDATA_DYN_ALIAS` sections.
*   The fix was released in GTKWave version 3.3.118.
