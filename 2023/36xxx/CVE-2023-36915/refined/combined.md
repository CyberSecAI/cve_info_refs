# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2023-1798

## GTKWave FST fstReaderIterBlocks2 chain\_table allocation integer overflow vulnerabilities

##### January 8, 2024

##### CVE Number

CVE-2023-36915,CVE-2023-36916

##### SUMMARY

Multiple integer overflow vulnerabilities exist in the FST fstReaderIterBlocks2 chain\_table allocation functionality of GTKWave 3.3.115. A specially crafted .fst file can lead to arbitrary code execution. A victim would need to open a malicious file to trigger these vulnerabilities.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

GTKWave 3.3.115

##### PRODUCT URLS

GTKWave - <https://gtkwave.sourceforge.net>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

7.8 - CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

##### CWE

CWE-190 - Integer Overflow or Wraparound

##### DETAILS

GTKWave is a wave viewer, often used to analyze FPGA simulations and logic analyzer captures. It includes a GUI to view and analyze traces, as well as convert across several file formats (`.lxt`, `.lxt2`, `.vzt`, `.fst`, `.ghw`, `.vcd`, `.evcd`) either by using the UI or its command line tools. GTKWave is available for Linux, Windows and MacOS. Trace files can be shared within teams or organizations, for example to compare results of simulation runs across different design implementations, to analyze protocols captured with logic analyzers or just as a reference when porting design implementations.

GTKWave sets up mime types for its supported extensions. For example, itâ€™s enough for a victim to double-click on a wave file received by e-mail to trigger the vulnerability described in this advisory.

The function `fstReaderOpen` is used to parse `.fst` files.

```
     void *fstReaderOpen(const char *nam)
     {
[1]  struct fstReaderContext *xc = (struct fstReaderContext *)calloc(1, sizeof(struct fstReaderContext));

[2]  if((!nam)||(!(xc->f=fopen(nam, "rb"))))
             {
             free(xc);
             xc=NULL;
             }
             else
             {
             int flen = strlen(nam);
             char *hf = (char *)calloc(1, flen + 6);
             int rc;

     #if defined(FST_UNBUFFERED_IO)
             setvbuf(xc->f, (char *)NULL, _IONBF, 0);   /* keeps gzip from acting weird in tandem with fopen */
     #endif

             memcpy(hf, nam, flen);
             strcpy(hf + flen, ".hier");
             xc->fh = fopen(hf, "rb");

             free(hf);
             xc->filename = strdup(nam);
[3]          rc = fstReaderInit(xc);

```

At [1] the `xc` structure is created. This big (about 65KB) structure is used to hold information regarding the `.fst` file.

At [2] the `xc->f` field is set to the file pointer returned by `fopen` after opening the file being parsed.

Then, the function `fstReaderInit` is called [3] to parse the various `.fst` sections from the input file.

```
     int fstReaderInit(struct fstReaderContext *xc)
     {
     fst_off_t blkpos = 0;
     fst_off_t endfile;
     uint64_t seclen;
     int sectype;
     uint64_t vc_section_count_actual = 0;
     int hdr_incomplete = 0;
     int hdr_seen = 0;
     int gzread_pass_status = 1;

     sectype = fgetc(xc->f);
     ...
     if(gzread_pass_status)
             {
             fstReaderFseeko(xc, xc->f, 0, SEEK_END);
             endfile = ftello(xc->f);

             while(blkpos < endfile)
                     {
                     fstReaderFseeko(xc, xc->f, blkpos, SEEK_SET);

[4]                  sectype = fgetc(xc->f);
                     seclen = fstReaderUint64(xc->f);

                     if(sectype == EOF)
                             {
                             break;
                             }

[5]                  if((hdr_incomplete) && (!seclen))
                             {
                             break;
                             }

[6]                  if(!hdr_seen && (sectype != FST_BL_HDR))
                             {
                             break;
                             }

                     blkpos++;
                     ...

```

At [4], the `sectype` (1 byte) is read off the file. This variable will tell us which kind of sector weâ€™re parsing. The checks at [5] and [6] are important because we donâ€™t want to trigger them in order to reach the vulnerable code: we need to make sure `hdr_incomplete` stays 0 and we start with a `FST_BL_HDR` sector, which will set `hdr_seen` to 1.

So, if the input file starts with a `0x00`, weâ€™ll land inside the following condition:

```
     ...
     if(sectype == FST_BL_HDR)
             {
             if(!hdr_seen)
                     {
                     int ch;
                     double dcheck;

                     xc->start_time = fstReaderUint64(xc->f);
                     xc->end_time = fstReaderUint64(xc->f);

[7]                  hdr_incomplete = (xc->start_time == 0) && (xc->end_time == 0);

                     ...
[8]                  hdr_seen = 1;

[9]                  xc->mem_used_by_writer = fstReaderUint64(xc->f);
                     xc->scope_count = fstReaderUint64(xc->f);
                     xc->var_count = fstReaderUint64(xc->f);
                     ...
                     }
             }
     ...

```

`fstReaderUint64` is used to read a 64-bit unsigned integer (big endian) off the file, incrementing the current file offset.

We need to make sure that either `start_time` or `end_time` are not 0, to not set `hdr_incomplete` [7].

At [8] `hdr_seen` is set, so we can pass the check at [6] when parsing the next sections.

Finally at [9], other values are read off the file and saved into the `xc` structure.

After parsing the header, `fstReaderInit` then proceeds to parse other blocks which are not relevant for this advisory.

Upon return from `fstReaderOpen`, GTKWave eventually calls `fstReaderIterBlocks2` to parse all VCDATA blocks, as they havenâ€™t been fully parsed in `fstReaderInit`.

`fstReaderIterBlocks2` is a pretty large function, so weâ€™ll focus on the interesting lines only:

```
     int fstReaderIterBlocks2(void *ctx,
                              void (*value_change_callback)(void *user_callback_data_pointer, uint64_t time, fstHandle facidx, const unsigned char *value),
                              void (*value_change_callback_varlen)(void *user_callback_data_pointer, uint64_t time, fstHandle facidx, const unsigned char *value, uint32_t len),
                              void *user_callback_data_pointer, FILE *fv) {
         struct fstReaderContext *xc = (struct fstReaderContext *)ctx;

         uint64_t previous_time = UINT64_MAX;
         uint64_t *time_table = NULL;
         uint64_t tsec_nitems;
         unsigned int secnum = 0;
         int blocks_skipped = 0;
         fst_off_t blkpos = 0;
         uint64_t seclen, beg_tim;
         uint64_t end_tim;
         uint64_t frame_uclen, frame_clen, frame_maxhandle, vc_maxhandle;
         fst_off_t vc_start;
         fst_off_t indx_pntr, indx_pos;
         fst_off_t *chain_table = NULL;
         uint32_t *chain_table_lengths = NULL;
         unsigned char *chain_cmem;
         unsigned char *pnt;
         long chain_clen;
         fstHandle idx, pidx = 0, i;
         uint64_t pval;
         uint64_t vc_maxhandle_largest = 0;
         uint64_t tsec_uclen = 0, tsec_clen = 0;
         int sectype;
         uint64_t mem_required_for_traversal;
         unsigned char *mem_for_traversal = NULL;
         uint32_t traversal_mem_offs;
         uint32_t *scatterptr, *headptr, *length_remaining;
         uint32_t cur_blackout = 0;
         int packtype;
         unsigned char *mc_mem = NULL;
         uint32_t mc_mem_len; /* corresponds to largest value encountered in chain_table_lengths[i] */
         int dumpvars_state = 0;

         ...
[10]     for (;;) {
             uint32_t *tc_head = NULL;
             traversal_mem_offs = 0;

             fstReaderFseeko(xc, xc->f, blkpos, SEEK_SET);

[11]         sectype = fgetc(xc->f);
             seclen = fstReaderUint64(xc->f);

             if ((sectype == EOF) || (sectype == FST_BL_SKIP)) {
     #ifdef FST_DEBUG
                 fprintf(stderr, FST_APIMESS "<< EOF >>\n");
     #endif
                 break;
             }

             blkpos++;
[12]         if ((sectype != FST_BL_VCDATA) && (sectype != FST_BL_VCDATA_DYN_ALIAS) && (sectype != FST_BL_VCDATA_DYN_ALIAS2)) {
                 blkpos += seclen;
                 continue;
             }

             if (!seclen) break;
         ...

```

As previously said, all blocks are scanned [10], and only the blocks with a `sectype` [11] containing VCDATA are parsed [12]. These blocks are `FST_BL_VCDATA`, `FST_BL_VCDATA_DYN_ALIAS` and `FST_BL_VCDATA_DYN_ALIAS2`.

Later on, the code extracts `vc_maxhandle`, declared as a `uint64_t` variable:

```
        fstReaderFseeko(xc, xc->f, (fst_off_t)frame_clen, SEEK_CUR); /* skip past compressed data */

[13]    vc_maxhandle = fstReaderVarint64(xc->f);
        vc_start = ftello(xc->f); /* points to '!' character */
        packtype = fgetc(xc->f);

```

Right after this, the `chain_clen` is extracted [14], which is the size of the `chain` section, extracted at [15].

```
        indx_pntr = blkpos + seclen - 24 - tsec_clen - 8;
        fstReaderFseeko(xc, xc->f, indx_pntr, SEEK_SET);
[14]    chain_clen = fstReaderUint64(xc->f);
        indx_pos = indx_pntr - chain_clen;
        ...
[15]    chain_cmem = (unsigned char *)malloc(chain_clen);
        if (!chain_cmem) goto block_err;
        fstReaderFseeko(xc, xc->f, indx_pos, SEEK_SET);
        fstFread(chain_cmem, chain_clen, 1, xc->f);

        if (vc_maxhandle > vc_maxhandle_largest) {
            free(chain_table);
            free(chain_table_lengths);

            vc_maxhandle_largest = vc_maxhandle;
[16]        chain_table = (fst_off_t *)calloc((vc_maxhandle + 1), sizeof(fst_off_t));
[17]        chain_table_lengths = (uint32_t *)calloc((vc_maxhandle + 1), sizeof(uint32_t));
        }

```

The `chain_table` and `chain_table_lengths` buffers are cached across the parsing of the different FST blocks. However, initially `chain_table` and `chain_table_lengths` will be zero, so the initialization happens at [16] and [17], allocating `vc_maxhandle+1` items. `vc_maxhandle` should correspond to the number of VC elements in VCDATA.

Note that the first parameter for `calloc` (number of elements) is set as `vc_maxhandle + 1`. However, as we can control `vc_maxhandle` arbitrarily, its value could be -1 (0xffffffffffffffff for 64-bit and 0xffffffff for 32-bit). This would make the addition wrap around, leading to calling `calloc(0, 8)`, which results in allocating a zero (or small, depending on the malloc implementation) sized buffer.

Moreover, `calloc` internally multiplies `vc_maxhandle+1` by `sizeof(fst_off_t)`, which could lead to an integer overflow, depending on the `calloc` implementation: some implementations (for example glibc) will detect the overflow and return 0, leading to just crashing GTKWave. If the `calloc` implementation, however, doesnâ€™t detect the overflow, `calloc` may end up allocating a very small buffer. For example, on 64-bit systems, a `vc_maxhandle` value of `0x1fffffffffffffff` (or `0x1fffffff` for 32-bit systems) will lead to allocating a small buffer (again, the actual size depends on the implementation).

Later on, these tables are written to:

```
     pnt = chain_cmem;
     idx = 0;
     pval = 0;

     if (sectype == FST_BL_VCDATA_DYN_ALIAS2) {
        ...
[18] } else {
         do {
             int skiplen;
[20]         uint64_t val = fstGetVarint32(pnt, &skiplen);

[21]         if (!val) {
                 pnt += skiplen;
                 val = fstGetVarint32(pnt, &skiplen);
[22]             chain_table[idx] = 0;            /* need to explicitly zero as calloc above might not run */
[23]             chain_table_lengths[idx] = -val; /* because during this loop iter would give stale data! */
                 idx++;
             } else if (val & 1) {
[22]             pval = chain_table[idx] = pval + (val >> 1);
                 if (idx) {
[23]                 chain_table_lengths[pidx] = pval - chain_table[pidx];
                 }
                 pidx = idx++;
             } else {
                 fstHandle loopcnt = val >> 1;
                 for (i = 0; i < loopcnt; i++) {
[22]                 chain_table[idx++] = 0;
                 }
             }

             pnt += skiplen;
[19]     } while (pnt != (chain_cmem + chain_clen));
     }

[22] chain_table[idx] = indx_pos - vc_start;
[23] chain_table_lengths[pidx] = chain_table[idx] - chain_table[pidx];

```

For `FST_BL_VCDATA` and `FST_BL_VCDATA_DYN_ALIAS` sections, we enter the block at [18]. At each iteration of the loop [19], a varint is read [20], which eventually leads to a controlled write in both the `chain_table` [22] and `chain_table_lengths` arrays.

The loop termination depends on `chain_clen`, which is independent from `vc_maxhandle`. This means that an attacker can allocate a very small buffer at [16] and [17] by controlling `vc_maxhandle` and later write out-of-bounds an arbitrary amount of data (controlled by `chain_clen`) with arbitrary contents out-of-bounds in the heap. An attacker can exploit this to execute arbitrary code.

#### CVE-2023-36915 - `fstReaderIterBlocks2` `chain_table` allocation

By not checking the value of `vc_maxhandle`, the calculation at [16] may overflow (or the `calloc` calculation may overflow). The loop at [19], controlled by an independent value `chain_clen`, can be used to control the amount of bytes written in the heap, while the contents are controlled with varints read at [20]. An attacker can exploit this to execute arbitrary code.

#### CVE-2023-36916 - `fstReaderIterBlocks2` `chain_table_lengths` allocation

By not checking the value of `vc_maxhandle`, the calculation at [16] may overflow (or the `calloc` calculation may overflow). The loop at [19], controlled by an independent value `chain_clen`, can be used to control the amount of bytes written in the heap, while the contents are controlled with varints read at [20]. An attacker can exploit this to execute arbitrary code.
