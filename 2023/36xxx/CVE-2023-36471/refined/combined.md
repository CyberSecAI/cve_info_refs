#### Description

**Steps to reproduce:**

1. As a user without script or programming right, edit the sheet of a document or create a new sheet and bind it to a document. I suggest to edit Help.Applications.Movies.Code.MoviesSheet for the reproduction steps.
2. Change the content of the sheet to
   ```
   {{html}}
   <input type="hidden" name="content" value="{{groovy}}println(&quot;Hello from Groovy!&quot;)" />
   {{/html}}
   ```
3. Get an admin user to edit the document that uses the sheet.
4. View the edited document without sheet (add sheet= to the URL parameters).

**Expected result:**

No text Hello from Groovy! is displayed.

**Actual result:**

The text Hello from Groovy! is displayed.

The attack might seem a bit artificial as it seems unlikely for the admin to click the "Save"-button on an empty document. However, the attack can be adapted by, e.g., integrating some text in the sheet. Also, there could be inputs displayed. Without script right, I think it is not possible to differentiate between edit and view mode so everything would be displayed in both modes but I think in particular this broken view could actually get admins to perform an edit in order to attempt to fix the mess. Further, the attacker could also directly send the attacker to the edit action or the admin could get there, e.g., through a LiveTable that displays all entries and provides direct edit links. In this case, a plausible edit form could be constructed using the HTML macro that could even contain values for all properties (they would need to be static values, though).

In a similar attack, an attacker could create a fake login form that submits the login information to an attacker-controlled server.

The proposed fix is to forbid form-related HTML tags (form, input, select, submit, textarea, datalist) in the HTML sanitizer. This would affect only users without script right.

## Package

maven

org.xwiki.commons:xwiki-commons-xml
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

>= 14.6-rc-1, < 14.10.6
>= 15.0-rc-1, < 15.2-rc-1

## Patched versions

14.10.6
15.2-rc-1

## Description

### Impact

The HTML sanitizer that is included in XWiki since version 14.6RC1 allowed form and input HTML tags. In the context of XWiki, this allows an attacker without script right to either create forms that can be used for phishing attacks or also in the context of a sheet, the attacker could add an input like `{{html}}<input type="hidden" name="content" value="{{groovy}}println(&quot;Hello from Groovy!&quot;)" />{{/html}}` that would allow remote code execution when it is submitted by an admin (the sheet is rendered as part of the edit form). The attacker would need to ensure that the edit form looks plausible, though, which can be non-trivial as without script right the attacker cannot display the regular content of the document.

### Patches

This has been patched in XWiki 14.10.6 and 15.2RC1 by removing the central form-related tags from the list of allowed tags.

### Workarounds

An admin can manually disallow the tags by adding `form, input, select, textarea, button` to the configuration option `xml.htmlElementSanitizer.forbidTags` in the `xwiki.properties` configuration file.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
