Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-36471:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the HTML sanitizer within XWiki not properly filtering form-related HTML tags (form, input, select, textarea, button). This allows the injection of malicious HTML form elements.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Inadequate HTML sanitization: The HTML sanitizer failed to block form-related tags, which can be exploited to inject arbitrary HTML into pages.
- Privilege Escalation: The vulnerability enables users without script rights to potentially execute code by injecting malicious forms that are later processed by admin users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): By crafting a hidden form element containing Groovy code, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server when an administrator submits the form.
- Phishing Attacks: Attackers can create fake login forms to steal user credentials.
- Manipulation of Admin actions: Attackers can manipulate data and actions by creating plausible forms.
- Loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability: Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information, modification of data, and potential disruption of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Crafted HTML within a sheet or document: An attacker with edit rights can inject malicious HTML code through the HTML macro into a document's sheet.
- Social Engineering: The attacker may need to use social engineering tactics to trick an administrator into interacting with the malicious form and submitting it. The attacker needs to make the form look plausible to encourage the admin to perform an edit.
- Direct Edit Links: Attackers can send direct edit links or the admin can get to the edit form through, for example, a LiveTable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Edit rights: The attacker needs at least edit rights on a document or sheet to inject the malicious HTML form elements.
- No script rights: The attack is targeted at users who do not have script rights but can still edit documents.
- Social Engineering skills:  The attacker needs social engineering skills to make the malicious forms look legitimate to the victim.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects XWiki versions from 14.6-rc-1 up to, but not including, 14.10.6 and from 15.0-rc-1 up to, but not including, 15.2-rc-1.
- The fix involves explicitly disallowing form-related HTML tags in the HTML sanitizer.
- A workaround involves manually adding the tags `form, input, select, textarea, button` to the configuration option `xml.htmlElementSanitizer.forbidTags` in the `xwiki.properties` configuration file.
- The vulnerability is classified as Critical with a CVSS v3 base score of 9.1.
- The vulnerability has the CWE identifier CWE-791.
