- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Stored XSS vulnerability on the Bulk User Actions page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** The vulnerability has been assessed to have a CVSS v3 impact of 7.5 (High). Although the CVSS vector provided (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N) indicates high confidentiality impact, the text explicitly states it is a stored XSS vulnerability, which has an impact on integrity and potentially availability as well. The CVSS vector appears to be incorrect.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is located in the Bulk User Actions page of the affected applications.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The specific attacker capabilities or position are not detailed beyond the fact that it's a stored XSS vulnerability. It can be inferred that an attacker would need to inject malicious script into a field that will be stored and rendered when a user visits the Bulk User Actions page.
