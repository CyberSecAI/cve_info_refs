Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-36236:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of SVG files uploaded through the Bagisto admin panel. Specifically, the application did not correctly sanitize SVG files before storing them, allowing malicious code embedded within the SVG to be executed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core weakness is the ability to inject malicious scripts via SVG file uploads, leading to a stored XSS vulnerability.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application failed to sanitize the uploaded SVG files, allowing for the execution of embedded scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Cookie Theft:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript within an SVG file. Upon upload and access of the image, the script can execute, potentially allowing the attacker to steal session cookies of other users.
- **Account Takeover:** By stealing cookies, attackers can potentially hijack user sessions, leading to unauthorized access and control over user accounts, including admin accounts.
- **Malicious Actions:** The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, allowing for a range of malicious activities such as redirecting users to malicious websites, modifying page content, or other actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File Upload:** The primary attack vector is the file upload functionality within the admin panel, specifically the image upload section.
- **SVG File:** The attacker crafts a malicious SVG file with embedded JavaScript payloads.
- **Admin Panel:** The attacker leverages the admin panel to upload the malicious SVG.
- **Front-End & Admin Panel Exposure**: The malicious script can be executed both in the storefront and admin panel upon accessing the uploaded image, thus affecting a wider range of users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Admin Access:** The attacker needs access to the Bagisto admin panel to upload the malicious SVG file.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerability to craft a malicious SVG payload effectively.
- **Ability to Upload:** The attacker needs permission to upload files, specifically SVG files, via the designated upload functionality within the admin panel.

**Additional details:**
The provided content also includes the fix for the vulnerability by enhancing the SVG Sanitizer. The patch includes:
- Addition of mime-type checking
- Sanitization of SVG files with a dedicated sanitizer class

The vulnerable URL was `https://localhost/admin/velocity/meta-data` and the fix was introduced in version 1.5.1 of Bagisto.
