The provided content relates to CVE-2023-36271.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerabilities are heap-buffer-overflows in `bit_utf8_to_TU` and `bit_wcs2nlen` functions when processing specially crafted DWG files. The `bit_utf8_to_TU` function attempts to write past allocated memory. The `bit_wcs2nlen` function attempts to read past allocated memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   Heap-based buffer overflows in `bit_utf8_to_TU` (BUG1) and `bit_wcs2nlen` (BUG2). These functions are used during the processing of DWG files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   The heap-buffer-overflow vulnerabilities can lead to denial of service, program crash, and potentially arbitrary code execution if exploited maliciously.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerabilities are triggered by processing a specially crafted DWG file using the `dwg2SVG` tool or by using `dwgread` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted DWG file to the vulnerable application (`dwg2SVG` or via `dwgread` function).
*   No special privileges are required beyond the ability to execute `dwg2SVG` or call the vulnerable `dwgread` function with a malicious DWG file.
