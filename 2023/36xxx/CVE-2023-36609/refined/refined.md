Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2023-36609:

**Vulnerability:** Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere (CWE-829)

*   **Root Cause:** The affected Ovarro TBox RTUs run OpenVPN with root privileges and allow user-defined configuration scripts. This means the device trusts and executes scripts provided via OpenVPN.
*   **Weakness:** The system allows the execution of scripts from an untrusted control sphere (the OpenVPN configuration).
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to gain root privileges on the affected device. This could lead to full control of the device, potentially disrupting operations, stealing data, or using the device as a pivot point for further attacks.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker would need to set up a local OpenVPN server and push a malicious script onto the TBox host using the user defined configuration option.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to have the ability to push a configuration to the affected TBox device, which requires a high level of access.
