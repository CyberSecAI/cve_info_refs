Root cause of vulnerability: The WordPress Schema Pro Plugin <= 2.7.7 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: CSRF vulnerability allowing malicious actors to force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions.

Impact of exploitation: A successful CSRF attack could allow an attacker to force higher privileged users to perform actions they did not intend to. The specific impact varies case by case.

Attack vectors: The attack vector is through Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). An attacker would need to craft a malicious request and trick a logged-in administrator into submitting it.

Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user with higher privileges to submit a crafted request. This does not require the attacker to be authenticated.
