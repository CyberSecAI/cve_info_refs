# SecLists.Org Security Mailing List Archive

Any hacker will tell you that the latest news and exploits are not
found on any web site—not even [Insecure.Org](https://insecure.org). No, the cutting edge
in security research is and will continue to be the full
disclosure mailing lists such as Bugtraq. Here we provide web
archives and RSS feeds (now including message extracts), updated in real-time, for many of our favorite lists.
Browse the individual lists below, or search them all using the Site Search box above.

## Other Excellent Security Lists

[![bugtraq logo](/images/bugtraq-logo.png)](/bugtraq/)

**[Bugtraq](/bugtraq/)** — The premier general security mailing list. Vulnerabilities are often announced here first, so check frequently!

[![basics logo](/images/basics-logo.png)](/basics/)

**[Security Basics](/basics/)** — A high-volume list which permits people to ask "stupid questions" without being derided as "n00bs". I recommend this list to network security newbies, but be sure to read Bugtraq and other lists as well.

[![pen-test logo](/images/pen-test-logo.png)](/pen-test/)

**[Penetration Testing](/pen-test/)** — While this list is intended for "professionals", participants frequenly disclose techniques and strategies that would be useful to anyone with a practical interest in security and network auditing.

[![webappsec logo](/images/webappsec-logo.png)](/webappsec/)

**[Web App Security](/webappsec/)** — Provides insights on the unique challenges which make web applications notoriously hard to secure, as well as attack methods including SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery, and more.

[![dailydave logo](/images/dailydave-logo.png)](/dailydave/)

**[Daily Dave](/dailydave/)** — This technical discussion list covers vulnerability research, exploit development, and security events/gossip. It was started by [ImmunitySec](http://www.immunitysec.com/) founder Dave Aitel and many security luminaries participate. Many posts simply advertise Immunity products, but you can't really fault Dave for being self-promotional on a list named DailyDave.
