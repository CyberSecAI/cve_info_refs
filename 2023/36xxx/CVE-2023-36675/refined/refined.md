After analyzing the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2023-36675:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content directly relates to CVE-2023-36675. The Red Hat Bugzilla entry for Bug 2217429 explicitly states that it is tracking "CVE-2023-36675 mediawiki: cross site scripting [fedora-all]". Furthermore, the Phabricator task T332889, titled "CVE-2023-36675: XSS in BlockLogFormatter due to unsafe message use", clearly identifies the vulnerable component and the nature of the vulnerability. The Debian Security Advisory DSA-5447-1 also lists CVE-2023-36675 as one of the vulnerabilities fixed in a MediaWiki security update.

**2. Root Cause of the Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the `BlockLogFormatter.php` file within MediaWiki. Specifically, the code that handles partial blocks uses `Message::text()` to format messages, and then passes this output to `Message::rawParams()` and `Message::rawParam()`. This is unsafe, because the output of `Message::text()` is not escaped, and when `rawParams()` or `rawParam()` are used, they do not perform additional escaping which leads to XSS vulnerability.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

The primary vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The weakness is the unsafe usage of the `rawParams` and `rawParam` methods with unescaped input from `Message::text()`, which allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code through specially crafted messages.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser who is viewing the affected log entries. This could lead to:

*   **Session Hijacking:** Stealing user session cookies to gain unauthorized access to accounts.
*   **Data Theft:** Exfiltrating sensitive information displayed on the page.
*   **Malware Distribution:** Redirecting users to malicious sites or injecting malware.
*   **Defacement:** Modifying the appearance of the page.
*   **Privilege Escalation**: Perform actions on behalf of another user.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

The attack vector involves:

*   **Modifying vulnerable messages:** Attackers could inject malicious JavaScript code into messages like `ipb-action-*` and `logentry-partialblock-block-*` via MediaWiki's i18n system.
*   **Triggering Log Display:** Then, by performing actions that trigger a block log, the attacker's injected code is executed when the vulnerable code formats and displays the log entry.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **User with Permissions:** An attacker would need permission to edit MediaWiki messages to inject malicious content into the translation system.
*   **Access to the application:** Once injected, any user with access to view a log that utilizes the vulnerable formatting code would have the script run in their browser.

**Additional Notes**

*   The provided content highlights the fix which includes using `escaped()` or `parse()` instead of `text()` when preparing the parameters for `rawParams()` and `rawParam()`.
*   The fixes were backported to multiple MediaWiki versions (1.35, 1.38, 1.39, and 1.40), as mentioned in the Phabricator task T332889.
*   The Red Hat Bugzilla entry indicates that this affects Fedora distributions and provides a template for creating an update.
*   The Debian Security Advisory DSA-5447-1 also mentions the fix for this CVE within their MediaWiki package.

In summary, CVE-2023-36675 is a XSS vulnerability in MediaWiki's BlockLogFormatter that arises from improperly handling messages, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code via specially crafted messages. The vulnerability could be exploited by anyone with the permissions to create the specially crafted message, and the code is then run when viewing log pages formatted by the vulnerable component.
