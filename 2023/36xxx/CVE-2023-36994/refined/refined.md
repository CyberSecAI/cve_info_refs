Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-36994:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the ability to access the `install/process.php` file even after installation. This file allows overwriting the `config.php` file, which stores server configurations. Because the install folder is not always deleted after install, the file remains accessible.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unrestricted Access:** The `install/process.php` file remains accessible after installation, and does not require authentication.
- **Direct Config Modification:** The `install/process.php` allows direct modification of `config.php`
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The server name parameter is not sanitized before being written into the config.php file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By injecting malicious code into the `servername` parameter within `install/process.php`, an attacker can achieve RCE on the server by overwriting the `config.php` file, and subsequently accessing the injected code via a crafted GET parameter.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Overwriting the `config.php` file will also cause other configurations to be lost including database credentials, causing the game to become unplayable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct HTTP Requests:** The attacker sends a POST request to `install/process.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server where TravianZ is hosted.
- **No Authentication Required:** This attack does not require any form of authentication.
- **Knowledge of Installation Time:** The attacker needs to have some idea of when the server was installed to be able to locate the renamed installation folder. However, this is not strictly required for RCE if one does not care about making the server unplayable.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is exploitable if the installation folder is not deleted or renamed by the server administrator. This is often the default.
- This vulnerability provides an alternative way to get RCE which does not require admin access.
- The blogpost mentions the install folder is renamed to `installed_[timestamp]` and details how to determine this timestamp.
- The vulnerability was found in TravianZ versions 8.3.4 and 8.3.3.
- A patch was released to secure the instance.
