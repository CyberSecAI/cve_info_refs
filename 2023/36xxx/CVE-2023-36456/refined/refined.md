{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not validate the source of the `X-Forwarded-For` and `X-Real-IP` headers.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Lack of validation for `X-Forwarded-For` and `X-Real-IP` headers."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Spoofing of IP addresses in logs and user sessions. Bypassing of IP-based restrictions in custom flows. Manipulation of IP addresses passed to proxied applications.",
  "Attack vectors": "HTTP requests with crafted `X-Forwarded-For` and `X-Real-IP` headers.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the authentik server directly, without an intermediate reverse proxy that would normally sanitize or validate headers. "
