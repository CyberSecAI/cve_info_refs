{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Memory allocation failure in the `xml_on_metadata_tag_only` function due to a crafted input file.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "A crafted input file leads to a segmentation fault within the `strcmp` function, due to memory corruption when parsing metadata tags in FLV files.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of Service (DoS). The application crashes due to a segmentation fault.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by providing a specially crafted FLV file as input to the `flvmeta` tool.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to supply the vulnerable application, flvmeta, with a malicious input file. No specific position or privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability. "
