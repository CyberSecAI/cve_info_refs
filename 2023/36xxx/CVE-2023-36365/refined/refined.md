The provided content is related to CVE-2023-36365.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The MonetDB server crashes due to an issue in the `sql_trans_copy_key` function when creating foreign key constraints on temporary tables.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The code allows creation of foreign key constraints referencing temporary tables, which leads to a crash when the server tries to copy the key information during the transaction.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The MonetDB server crashes, leading to a denial-of-service. This can disrupt database operations and potentially lead to data loss if transactions are not properly handled.

**Attack vectors:**
- By sending specific SQL statements via ODBC (or directly, as confirmed) to the MonetDB server, a user can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to execute SQL statements on a MonetDB server. This implies a user with database access.
