Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**Vulnerability:** Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)

**Root Cause:** The QloApps application, specifically in the order refund request process at the front office, was vulnerable to IDOR. The application failed to properly validate if a user had the authority to access or modify data related to orders. This allowed users to access or manipulate order information that they should not have access to.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **IDOR:** The core issue is the lack of proper authorization checks before accessing order data. The system relies on direct object references (e.g., order IDs) without verifying if the user making the request is authorized to view or modify that specific order.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker could gain access to order details of other customers, including personal information and potentially payment information (depending on how much is revealed in the order details).
*   **Data Modification:**  An attacker might be able to modify or cancel orders belonging to other customers.
*   **Financial Loss:** Unauthorized refunds or cancellations could lead to financial losses for both customers and the business.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Direct Manipulation of Order IDs:** An attacker could intercept a legitimate request, modify the order ID to a different order, and resend the request. Without proper authorization, the server might process the request as if it were legitimate.
*   **Front Office Exploit:** The vulnerability is located within the front office functionality of the QloApps application during the refund request process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the QloApps application.
*   **Basic Understanding of Web Requests:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of how web requests work and how to manipulate parameters in those requests (e.g., using browser developer tools or intercepting proxies like Burp Suite).
*   **No Special Privileges:** The attacker does not require any special administrative or elevated privileges.

**Additional Details from the Content**
*   **Fix:** The GitHub content indicates that a fix has been implemented through a pull request. The pull request description explicitly mentions "Fix IDOR at order detail page". This fix includes order and customer relationship checks during the refund request process to ensure proper authorization.
*   **Specific Code Areas:**  The fixes involve checking Booking IDs during cancellation and refund requests, implying that these were the specific areas affected by the IDOR.
*   **Multiple Commits:** Multiple commits were made to address the issue, including resolving merge conflicts, which highlights the complexity of the vulnerability.
*   **Related Commit Messages:** Commit messages like "Check Booking ID when canceling booking from front office" and "Fix IDOR at order detail page" directly pinpoint the vulnerability and the actions taken to mitigate it.
