- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control. This allows unprivileged users to execute higher privileged actions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The specific impact varies, but could lead to unauthorized actions due to missing access control checks.
- **Attack vectors**: Unspecified, but likely involves sending requests to vulnerable functions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a subscriber.
