{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow caused by insufficient validation of WebSocket packet payload size.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Heap-buffer-overflow due to missing size check when handling websocket packets. Specifically, the `capture_ws_check_packet` function in `capture.c` does not properly validate the size of a WebSocket packet payload before copying it, leading to a buffer overflow when the payload is larger than expected.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The impact of exploitation is a heap-buffer-overflow, which can lead to a crash, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is a malformed WebSocket packet with a crafted payload size.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted network packet containing a malformed websocket packet with a payload size exceeding the buffer allocated for it. This could be achieved by sending such a packet to the sngrep application that is monitoring the network traffic."
