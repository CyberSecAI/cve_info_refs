- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The MonetDB server crashes in the `BLOBcmp` function when comparing a BLOB column with a value after inserting a NULL value into the BLOB column. This occurs because of a missing null check in the `BLOBcmp` function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is a missing null check when comparing BLOB data, which leads to a crash.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The impact is a denial-of-service condition, as the MonetDB server crashes, making the database unavailable.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by an authenticated user executing a specific SQL query involving a comparison of a BLOB column with a value after a NULL value has been inserted into that column.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have the ability to execute SQL queries on the MonetDB server.
