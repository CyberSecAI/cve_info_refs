Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
*   The vulnerability stems from a "Broken Access Control" issue within the WordPress Cryptocurrency Widgets â€“ Price Ticker & Coins List plugin. This indicates a flaw in how the plugin manages user permissions and authorization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Missing Authorization/Authentication/Nonce Check:**  The core issue is a lack of proper checks in a function that allows an unprivileged user to execute actions intended for higher-privileged users. This means the plugin does not properly verify if the user attempting an action has the necessary permissions to do so.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   The specific impact is not detailed, but the general description indicates that an unprivileged user could perform actions they should not be authorized to do. The severity is considered low, and the likelihood of exploitation is also low.
*   CVSS score is 5.3, which is considered medium. However, the text mentions that CVSS is not ideal for CMSs, therefore, it might be not accurate

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector involves exploiting a function within the plugin that lacks proper access control checks. An attacker could leverage this to execute privileged actions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be an unauthenticated user. No specific user role or elevated privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.
*   The attacker must have access to the WordPress site where the vulnerable plugin is installed.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is present in plugin versions <= 2.6.2 and has been fixed in version 2.6.3.
*   A virtual patch is available from Patchstack to mitigate the vulnerability until users can update to the fixed version.
*   The vulnerability is classified as "A5: Broken Access Control" according to OWASP Top 10.
