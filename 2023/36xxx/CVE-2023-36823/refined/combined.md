|  |  | ## 6.0.2 (2023-07-06) |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ### Bug Fixes |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | \* CVE-2023-36823: Fixed an HTML+CSS sanitization bypass that could allow XSS |
|  |  | (cross-site scripting). This issue affects Sanitize versions 3.0.0 through |
|  |  | 6.0.1. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | When using Sanitize's relaxed config or a custom config that allows `<style>` |
|  |  | elements and one or more CSS at-rules, carefully crafted input could be used |
|  |  | to sneak arbitrary HTML through Sanitize. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | See the following security advisory for additional details: |

## Sanitize vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting via insufficient neutralization of `style` element content

High severity

[Vulnerability details](/advisories/GHSA-f5ww-cq3m-q3g7)
[Dependabot alerts
0](/advisories/GHSA-f5ww-cq3m-q3g7/dependabot)

## Package

bundler

sanitize
([RubyGems](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arubygems))

## Affected versions

>= 3.0.0, < 6.0.2

## Patched versions

6.0.2

## Description

### Impact

Using carefully crafted input, an attacker may be able to sneak arbitrary HTML and CSS through Sanitize `>= 3.0.0, < 6.0.2` when Sanitize is configured to use the built-in "relaxed" config or when using a custom config that allows `style` elements and one or more CSS at-rules. This could result in XSS (cross-site scripting) or other undesired behavior when the malicious HTML and CSS are rendered in a browser.

### Patches

Sanitize `>= 6.0.2` performs additional escaping of CSS in `style` element content, which fixes this issue.

### Workarounds

Users who are unable to upgrade can prevent this issue by using a Sanitize config that doesn't allow `style` elements, using a Sanitize config that doesn't allow CSS at-rules, or by manually escaping the character sequence `</` as `<\/` in `style` element content.

### Credit

This issue was found by [@cure53](https://github.com/cure53) during an audit of a project that uses Sanitize and was reported by one of that project's maintainers. Thank you!

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

### Bug Fixes

* [CVE-2023-36823](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-f5ww-cq3m-q3g7 "CVE-2023-36823"): Fixed an HTML+CSS sanitization bypass that could allow XSS (cross-site scripting). This issue affects Sanitize versions 3.0.0 through 6.0.1.

  When using Sanitize's relaxed config or a custom config that allows `<style>` elements and one or more CSS at-rules, carefully crafted input could be used to sneak arbitrary HTML through Sanitize.

  See the following security advisory for additional details: [GHSA-f5ww-cq3m-q3g7](https://github.com/rgrove/sanitize/security/advisories/GHSA-f5ww-cq3m-q3g7)

  Thanks to [@cure53](https://github.com/cure53) for finding this issue.

Package        : ruby-sanitize
Version        : 4.6.6-2.1~deb10u2
CVE ID         : CVE-2023-36823
Debian Bug     : 1041430

It was discovered that there was a potential cross-site scripting
(XSS) in ruby-sanitize, a whitelist-based HTML sanitizer.

Using carefully crafted input, an attacker may have be able to sneak
arbitrary HTML and CSS through Sanitize when configured to use the
built-in "relaxed" config or when using a custom config that allowed
"style" elements and one or more CSS "at"-rules. This could have
resulted in cross-site scripting (XSS) or other undesired behavior
if the malicious HTML and CSS were then rendered in a browser.

For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
4.6.6-2.1~deb10u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your ruby-sanitize packages.

For the detailed security status of ruby-sanitize please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/ruby-sanitize>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

# Insufficient neutralization of `style` element content may allow XSS in Sanitize

High

[rgrove](/rgrove)
published
GHSA-f5ww-cq3m-q3g7
Jul 6, 2023

## Package

bundler

sanitize
([RubyGems](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arubygems))

## Affected versions

>= 3.0.0, < 6.0.2

## Patched versions

6.0.2

## Description

### Impact

Using carefully crafted input, an attacker may be able to sneak arbitrary HTML and CSS through Sanitize `>= 3.0.0, < 6.0.2` when Sanitize is configured to use the built-in "relaxed" config or when using a custom config that allows `style` elements and one or more CSS at-rules. This could result in XSS (cross-site scripting) or other undesired behavior when the malicious HTML and CSS are rendered in a browser.

### Patches

Sanitize `>= 6.0.2` performs additional escaping of CSS in `style` element content, which fixes this issue.

### Workarounds

Users who are unable to upgrade can prevent this issue by using a Sanitize config that doesn't allow `style` elements, using a Sanitize config that doesn't allow CSS at-rules, or by manually escaping the character sequence `</` as `<\/` in `style` element content.

### Credit

This issue was found by [@cure53](https://github.com/cure53) during an audit of a project that uses Sanitize and was reported by one of that project's maintainers. Thank you!

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
