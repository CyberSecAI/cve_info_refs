  "CVE-2023-36478": {
    "description": "Two remotely exploitable security vulnerabilities were discovered in Jetty 9, a Java based web server and servlet engine. The HTTP/2 protocol implementation did not sufficiently verify if HPACK header values exceed their size limit. Furthermore the HTTP/2 protocol allowed a denial of service (server resource consumption) because request cancellation can reset many streams quickly. This problem is also known as Rapid Reset Attack.",
    "root_cause": "The HTTP/2 protocol implementation did not sufficiently verify if HPACK header values exceed their size limit. Also, HTTP/2 allowed a denial of service due to rapid stream resets.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow",
      "Insufficient verification of HPACK header size limits",
      "Vulnerability to Rapid Reset Attack"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (server resource consumption).",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending HTTP/2 requests with oversized HPACK header values",
       "Sending a large number of rapid request cancelations"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Unauthenticated remote attacker",
     "more_info": "The vulnerability is caused by an integer overflow when calculating the size of a header value, and also by not handling negative sizes which leads to very large buffer allocations, which can trigger a denial of service on the server."
