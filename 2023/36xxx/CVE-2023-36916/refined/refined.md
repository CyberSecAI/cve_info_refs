Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-36916:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `fstReaderIterBlocks2` function of GTKWave when handling FST files. Specifically, it occurs due to an integer overflow or wraparound during the allocation of the `chain_table` and `chain_table_lengths` buffers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The code calculates the size of the `chain_table` and `chain_table_lengths` buffers by adding 1 to the `vc_maxhandle` value and then multiplying by the size of the data type. When `vc_maxhandle` is large (or -1 due to an overflow), this calculation can lead to an integer overflow, resulting in a much smaller buffer than intended. The use of `calloc` may or may not detect this overflow depending on the implementation.
*   **Out-of-bounds Write:** After the small buffer is allocated, the code proceeds to write into it based on the `chain_clen` value, which is independent of `vc_maxhandle`. This allows an attacker to write data beyond the bounds of the allocated buffer, resulting in heap corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By controlling the out-of-bounds write, an attacker can overwrite heap metadata or other crucial data structures, leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Crash:** If the `calloc` detects the overflow, it might return `NULL` and crash the application. However, some `calloc` implementations may allocate a small buffer and cause a heap overflow, which could lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Maliciously crafted FST file:** An attacker can create a specially crafted FST file that contains a large or overflowing value for `vc_maxhandle` and a corresponding `chain_clen` value that triggers the out-of-bounds write.
*   **User Interaction:** A victim needs to open the malicious FST file with GTKWave for the vulnerability to be triggered. GTKWave sets up mime types for its supported extensions. For example, it's enough for a victim to double-click on a wave file received by e-mail to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **File Creation:** The attacker must be able to create a malicious FST file.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick the victim into opening the malicious FST file using GTKWave.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in GTKWave versions up to 3.3.115.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in GTKWave version 3.3.118.
*   The advisory mentions the `chain_table` and `chain_table_lengths` are both affected. This CVE specifically relates to the `chain_table_lengths` allocation.
*   The CVSSv3 score for this vulnerability is 7.8, indicating a high severity.
