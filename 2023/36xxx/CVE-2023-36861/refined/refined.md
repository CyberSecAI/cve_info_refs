Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2023-36861:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a stack-based buffer overflow in the `LZMA_read_varint` function within the GTKWave's lzma library. This function is responsible for decoding variable-length integers from an LZMA-compressed stream within a VZT file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Out-of-bounds write:** The `LZMA_read_varint` function uses a fixed-size 16-byte buffer on the stack (`buf`). It reads bytes from the input stream into this buffer until a byte with the most significant bit set is encountered. There is no check to ensure the index doesn't exceed the buffer's boundary (index 15), leading to a buffer overflow when reading specially crafted files with long varint values.
*   The vulnerability exists due to the lack of boundary checks when reading data into a fixed-size buffer on the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary code execution:** By overflowing the stack buffer, an attacker can overwrite return addresses or other data on the stack, leading to arbitrary code execution when the function returns.
*   A successful exploit can allow a malicious actor to take control of the vulnerable system, potentially leading to data breaches, malware installation or complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious VZT file:** The primary attack vector involves crafting a malicious VZT file containing a specially crafted LZMA-compressed stream with long varint values to cause an out-of-bounds write.
*   **User interaction:** The user must open the malicious VZT file with GTKWave. This can be done by double-clicking on the file or by loading it through the GUI.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to create malicious files:** An attacker needs the ability to generate a specially crafted VZT file.
*   **Social Engineering:** An attacker needs to convince a user to open a crafted VZT file using GTKWave. This could be achieved by sending the file via email.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the `LZMA_read_varint` function in `LzmaLib.c`
*   The function reads the varint data byte by byte, and does not check for buffer overflow while storing it in a local buffer `buf`
*   The vulnerable function is called when GTKWave is parsing the `facnames` or `facgeometry` compressed data in a .vzt file.
