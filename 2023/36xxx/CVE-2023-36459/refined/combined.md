Subject: CVE-2023-36459: mastodon: XSS through oEmbed preview cards

(I have no affiliation with the project, but posting
this here because it seems to me that increasingly
non-packaged / GitHub distributed projects tend not to
send out announcements here.)

<https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/security/advisories/GHSA-ccm4-vgcc-73hp>

(This advisory describes an issue found by Cure53 as
part of an audit performed at Mozilla's request)

Using carefully crafted oEmbed data, an attacker can
bypass the HTML sanitization performed by Mastodon and
include arbitrary HTML in oEmbed preview cards.

Impact
This introduces a vector for Cross-site-scripting
(XSS) payloads that can be rendered in the user's
browser when a preview card for a malicious link is
clicked through.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N

Severity: 9.3/10

CVE-2023-36459

Affected versions: >= 1.3
Patched versions:  4.1.3, 4.0.5, 3.5.9

```

## Upgrade notes

To get the code for v4.1.3, use `git fetch && git checkout v4.1.3`.

> As always, **make sure you have backups of the database before performing any upgrades**. If you are using docker-compose, this is how a backup command might look: docker exec mastodon\_db\_1 pg\_dump -Fc -U postgres postgres > name\_of\_the\_backup.dump

### Dependencies

Apart from ImageMagick, external dependencies have not changed compared to v4.1.2, the compatible Ruby, PostgreSQL, Node, Elasticsearch and Redis versions are the same, that is:

* Ruby: 2.7 to 3.0
* PostgreSQL: 9.5 or newer
* Elasticsearch (optional, for full-text search): 7.x
* Redis: 4 or newer
* Node: >= 14, < 18
* ImageMagick: 6.9.7-7 or newer

If your uploaded images are broken after the upgrade, it means your installed ImageMagick version is older than the new minimum version (6.9.7-7), for example if you are running Ubuntu 18.04. If this happens, you can find more informations and ways to fix it [on this page](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/issues/25776).

### Update steps

The following instructions are for updating from 4.1.2.

If you are upgrading directly from an earlier release, please carefully read the upgrade notes for the skipped releases as well, as they often require extra steps such as database migrations.

**Non-Docker only:**

1. Install dependencies: `bundle install` and `yarn install`

**Both Docker and non-Docker:**

ℹ️ The recommended configuration for reverse proxies has been updated. Unlike updating Mastodon itself, this is not urgent, but hardening. The change is about setting `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'; form-action 'none'` and `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` on assets. Check `dist/nginx.conf` for more information, and [the documentation](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/admin/optional/object-storage-proxy/) if you are proxying external object storage.

1. Restart all Mastodon processes

## Upgrade notes

To get the code for v3.5.9, use `git fetch && git checkout v3.5.9`.

> As always, **make sure you have backups of the database before performing any upgrades**. If you are using docker-compose, this is how a backup command might look: docker exec mastodon\_db\_1 pg\_dump -Fc -U postgres postgres > name\_of\_the\_backup.dump

### Dependencies

Apart from ImageMagick, external dependencies have not changed compared to v3.5.8, the compatible Ruby, PostgreSQL, Node, Elasticsearch and Redis versions are the same, that is:

* Ruby: 2.7 to 3.0
* PostgreSQL: 9.5 or newer
* Elasticsearch (optional, for full-text search): 7.x
* Redis: 4 or newer
* Node: >= 12.22, < 18
* ImageMagick: 6.9.7-7 or newer

If your uploaded images are broken after the upgrade, it means your installed ImageMagick version is older than the new minimum version (6.9.7-7), for example if you are running Ubuntu 18.04. If this happens, you can find more informations and ways to fix it [on this page](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/issues/25776).

### Update steps

The following instructions are for updating from 3.5.8.

If you are upgrading directly from an earlier release, please carefully read the upgrade notes for the skipped releases as well, as they often require extra steps such as database migrations.

**Non-Docker only:**

1. Install dependencies: `bundle install` and `yarn install`

**Both Docker and non-Docker:**

ℹ️ The recommended configuration for reverse proxies has been updated. Unlike updating Mastodon itself, this is not urgent, but hardening. The change is about setting `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'; form-action 'none'` and `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` on assets. Check `dist/nginx.conf` for more information, and [the documentation](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/admin/optional/object-storage-proxy/) if you are proxying external object storage.

1. Restart all Mastodon processes

# XSS through oEmbed preview cards

Critical

[Gargron](/Gargron)
published
GHSA-ccm4-vgcc-73hp
Jul 6, 2023

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

>= 1.3

## Patched versions

4.1.3, 4.0.5, 3.5.9

## Description

(This advisory describes an issue found by Cure53 as part of an audit performed at Mozilla's request)

Using carefully crafted oEmbed data, an attacker can bypass the HTML sanitization performed by Mastodon and include arbitrary HTML in oEmbed preview cards.

### Impact

This introduces a vector for Cross-site-scripting (XSS) payloads that can be rendered in the user's browser when a preview card for a malicious link is clicked through.

### Severity

Critical

9.3

# CVSS overall score

More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N
