- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a type confusion issue within the Javascript implementation of the Acrobat-based PDF engine in Microsoft Edge (MSDCPDF). The `addIcon()` function, designed to add icon resources to a document, fails to properly validate the object type passed as a parameter. This allows specially crafted objects, such as field objects, to bypass the type check, leading to unexpected memory access and potential corruption.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Type Confusion: The primary vulnerability is the failure to properly validate the type of object passed to the `addIcon()` function.
    - Memory Corruption: The type confusion leads to the dereferencing of an invalid pointer, resulting in a crash and potentially allowing for arbitrary memory writes.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to:
    - Arbitrary memory writes: By manipulating the type of the passed object, an attacker can potentially control the invalid pointer that gets dereferenced. If shifted to point to writable memory, the attacker could change its value and corrupt memory.
    - Code Execution: Due to memory corruption, arbitrary code execution might become possible.
    - Other side effects: Exploitation could lead to unpredictable behavior within the browser.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - The attack vector is through a specially crafted PDF document.
    - The vulnerability is triggered when a user opens the malicious PDF file in Microsoft Edge.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to craft a malicious PDF document that exploits the type confusion vulnerability in the `addIcon()` function.
    - The attacker needs to convince the victim to open the malicious PDF document using a vulnerable version of Microsoft Edge.
