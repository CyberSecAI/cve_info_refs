# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2023-1747

## Microsoft Edge MSDCPDF Javascript addIcon type confusion vulnerability

##### July 17, 2023

##### CVE Number

CVE-2023-36887

##### SUMMARY

A memory corruption vulnerability exists in the Javascript implementation of the Acrobat-based PDF engine in Microsoft Edge 112.0.1722.58 and 114.0.1776.0 Canary. A specially crafted PDF document can trigger type confusion vulnerability when manipulating icons, which could lead to writes to arbitrary memory and possibly code execution or other side effects. Victim would need to open a malicious file in the browser to trigger this vulnerability.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

Microsoft Edge 112.0.1722.58

Microsoft Edge 114.0.1776.0 Canary

##### PRODUCT URLS

Edge - <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

8.1 - CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

##### CWE

CWE-843 - Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type (‘Type Confusion’)

##### DETAILS

Microsoft Edge is a modern, full featured Internet browser application aimed primarily at Windows users, but available on other platforms as well. Based on Chromium it aims to have feature parity with Chrome browser, has a large market share and is one of Microsoft’s flagship products.

In a recent version, Microsoft Edge has replaced PDFium PDF rendering engine with a more full-featured one based on Adobe Acrobat code. While the new PDF engine, likely called `MSDCPDF`, shares similarities with Adobe Acrobat Reader, there are significant differences, especially in the Javascript support and implementation. As in all other PDF engines, Javascript support in MSDCPDF is present to enable interactive documents and aims to implement full Javascript API specs as prescribed by Adobe.

One of the features enabled by Javascript API is manipulation of several different types of icons (for annotations, buttons, etc.). There exists a document level function `addIcon()` intended to add an icon resource to a list of document level icons. Native implementation behind this function contains a vulnerability when validating the object type passed as a parameter. Usually, an object passed as an argument would be shaped like an icon object or it would be rejected by the engine by throwing a “Wrong type of argument value” exception. This validation can fail for certain shapes of objects and can result in the following NULL pointer dereference crash:

```
27d0.12a8): Access violation - code c0000005 (first chance)
First chance exceptions are reported before any exception handling.
This exception may be expected and handled.

```

However, depending on the object shape and memory layout, type confusion can take a different route, which can lead to memory corruption. For example, the attached proof of concept uses a field object of a certain type to trigger the vulnerability:

```
var f = getField(getNthFieldName(0));
this.addIcon("sd",f);

```

The above PoC code results in a following crash:

```
    0:003> g

    mspdf!OQS_SIG_verify+0x755a8

```

Above crash is due to access violation when dereferencing a pointer in `rcx`. If we examine the code immediately before the crash we can observe the following:

```
.text:00000001804EECD1                 lea     rbp, [rsp+30h]
.text:00000001804EECD6                 mov     [rbp+10h+var_18], 0FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFEh
.text:00000001804EECDE                 mov     rsi, rdx

.text:00000001804A690C sub_1804A690C proc near

.text:00000001804A6911 mov     rax, [rcx+28h]

```

Invalid pointer being dereferenced comes from `rdx`, which is in turn located on the stack. Following memory references further back reveals that the initial pointer value was initialized and written to memory in what appears to be unrelated part of the code:

```

0:003> u rax
mspdf!OQS_SIG_verify+0x755a8:

```

More specifically, in the example crash above, the invalid pointer points to a `.rdata` section of the `mspdf.dll`, to a VTable entry for `field_group`. Type confusion has occurred, andan unexpected pointer is being dereferenced to increment the value it points to.

While not under direct control, by changing the field types in the document, the value of the invalid pointer can be influenced. If successfully shifted to point to writable memory, the invalid pointer could be used to change values and possibly cause further memory corruption.
