  "CVE-2023-36328": {
    "description": "Integer Overflow vulnerability in mp_grow in libtom libtommath before commit beba892bc0d4e4ded4d667ab1d2a94f4d75109a9, allows attackers to execute arbitrary code and cause a denial of service (DoS).",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a missing check for negative size arguments in the `mp_grow` function. This can lead to an integer overflow.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer Overflow (CWE-190)"
    ],
    "impact": "Attackers can potentially execute arbitrary code and/or cause a denial of service (DoS).",
     "attack_vectors": [
       "Network"
     ],
    "required_capabilities": "The vulnerability can be triggered remotely with low attack complexity and without requiring any privileges or user interaction.",
    "additional_details": "The fix involves adding checks to prevent negative size arguments in the `mp_grow` function and several other related functions. The vulnerability was reported by 'gal1ium'."
