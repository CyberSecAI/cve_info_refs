Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2023-36629:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `NfcStExtensions::getProprietaryConfigSettings` function in the `ST54-android-packages-apps-Nfc` library. This function is part of the NFC (Near Field Communication) functionality on Android devices.
*   The root cause is an **out-of-bounds memory read** vulnerability due to the lack of proper validation of user-provided input to the `byteNb` argument which is used as an index into a stack array `mPropConfig.config`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-Bounds Memory Read:** The `byteNb` argument, which is provided through an IPC call, is not validated before being used as an index for the stack array. This allows a malicious actor to read arbitrary memory locations within the NFC service process.
*   **Lack of Privilege Check:** The `nfc.st_ext` service allows any application to interact with it without requiring special permissions (like `android.permission.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS` or `android.permission.NFC`). This bypasses the intended Android security model which isolates apps.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Memory Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially read sensitive information from the NFC service's memory.
*   **Potential Code Execution:** By gaining knowledge of the memory layout using the read primitive, an attacker could further exploit a memory corruption issue to perform code injection in the context of the NFC service.
*   **NFC Service Disruption:**  While this CVE is specifically related to memory read, other related vulnerabilities in the same service, such as `programHceParameters`, can cause denial-of-service by disrupting NFC communication.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Application Exploitation:** Any application installed on the victim device can exploit this vulnerability. The lack of permission checks on the `nfc.st_ext` service makes this easily achievable, bypassing the typical restrictions placed on Android apps.
*   **IPC Calls:** The vulnerability is triggered through Inter-Process Communication (IPC) calls to the vulnerable service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Installed Application:** The attacker needs to have an application installed on the target Android device. No special permissions are required for the attacking application.
*   **Knowledge of Service Interface:** The attacker needs to know how to interact with the `nfc.st_ext` service through the available IPC calls.

**Technical Details:**

*   The `getProprietaryConfigSettings` function takes two integers, `prop_config_id` and `byteNb`, as arguments. The value of `byteNb` is used to access an array element of the `mPropConfig.config` stack variable without proper bounds checking.
*   The `NfcStExtensions::setProprietaryConfigSettings` function has an out-of-bounds write vulnerability (not directly related to this CVE but in the same advisory), which, upon incorrect execution, can irreversibly damage the NFC chip.

**Additional Information**

*   The advisory mentions that seven memory corruption issues in total were reported in the "ST54-android-packages-apps-Nfc" library, all documented in `TWSL2023-007`.
*   The vulnerability was found on a Xiaomi Redmi Note 10S (MIUI 13.0.5 Stable).
*   The `nfc.st_ext` service is located in `/system/system_ext/app/Nfc_st/Nfc_st.apk` on the affected device.
*   The vulnerable native code is located in `/system/system_ext/lib64/libstnfc_nci_jni.so` library.
*   The vulnerability was addressed by the vendor (STMicroelectronics), and patches were made available on GitHub: [https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/ST54-android-packages-apps-Nfc/releases/tag/130-20230215-23W07p0](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/ST54-android-packages-apps-Nfc/releases/tag/130-20230215-23W07p0)
