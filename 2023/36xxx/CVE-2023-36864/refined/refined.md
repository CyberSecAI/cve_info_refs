{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer overflow during allocation of `temp_signal_value_buf` due to a large `longest_signal_value_len` value derived from a crafted .fst file.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Integer overflow, heap-based buffer overflow",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution due to out-of-bounds write to heap memory.",
  "Attack vectors": "Maliciously crafted .fst file opened by the victim.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to create a malicious .fst file and convince the victim to open it using GTKWave."
