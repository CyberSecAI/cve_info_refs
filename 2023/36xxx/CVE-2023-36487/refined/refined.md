*   **#37243: [¥ File System] Remote Code Execution through ZIP upload (CVE-2023-32778) (Armin Stock)**
    *   **Root cause:** A vulnerability in how ILIAS handles ZIP file uploads.
    *   **Weaknesses:**  Improper handling of uploaded ZIP files, leading to potential code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *  **Attack Vectors:** Uploading a specially crafted ZIP file.
    *   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attacker needs to be able to upload files to the ILIAS platform.
*   **#37244: [¥ Init] Possible authentication bypass (CVE-2023-32779) (Armin Stock)**
    *   **Root cause:** A vulnerability in the initialization process of ILIAS.
    *   **Weaknesses:**  A flaw in the authentication process, allowing bypass.
    *   **Impact:** Allows an attacker to bypass the authentication mechanism and potentially gain unauthorized access.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Exploiting the flaw in the initialization process.
    *   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  Attacker needs to interact with the login process.
*   **#37249: [¥ Init] Possible Account Takeover via the password reset form (Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik (BSI))**
    *   **Root cause:** A vulnerability in the password reset form.
    *   **Weaknesses:**  A flaw in the password reset process allowing account takeover.
    *   **Impact:** Enables an attacker to take control of user accounts using the password reset function.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Exploiting the password reset form.
    *   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attacker needs to access the password reset functionality.
*   **#37242: [¥ Web Access Checker]: Path Traversal / Local File Inclusion in WebAccessChecker (CVE-2023-31467) (Armin Stock)**
    *   **Root cause:** A path traversal/local file inclusion vulnerability in the Web Access Checker.
    *  **Weaknesses:**  Improper validation of file paths, allowing access to restricted areas.
    *   **Impact:** Allows an attacker to read local files on the server, potentially leading to information disclosure.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Exploiting the vulnerability in the WebAccessChecker.
    *  **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attacker needs to interact with the Web Access Checker.
