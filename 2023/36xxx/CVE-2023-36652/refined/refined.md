- **Root cause of vulnerability**: SQL injection vulnerability in the `search` parameter of the `/audit/users` REST API endpoint.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL commands.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated attacker can read sensitive data from an auxiliary database, potentially revealing information about the underlying software infrastructure.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote exploitation via HTTP requests to the vulnerable API endpoint `/audit/users` using the `search` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be an authenticated user of the application. They can use SQL injection techniques to read data from the database.
