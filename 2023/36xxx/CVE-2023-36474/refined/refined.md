Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-36474:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a default configuration in `interactsh` server versions prior to 1.0.0. Specifically, the server automatically created a CNAME record for the `app` subdomain, pointing it to `projectdiscovery.github.io`. This was intended for hosting the interactsh web client using GitHub Pages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Subdomain Takeover:** The primary vulnerability is a subdomain takeover. If a user runs a self-hosted `interactsh` server but does not configure their own web client, the default CNAME record for the `app` subdomain remains pointing to GitHub Pages. This allows an attacker to claim the subdomain.
*   **Default Configuration:** The automatic creation of the CNAME record without explicit user configuration is the core issue.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By taking over the subdomain, an attacker can host arbitrary client-side code (XSS) which could be executed in a user's browser when they browse to the vulnerable subdomain.
*   **Credential Theft:** The attacker could build a clone of the legitimate site, add a login form, and redirect users, potentially stealing credentials.
*   **Loss of Credibility:** Subdomain takeovers can severely damage business credibility.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **DNS Misconfiguration:** The attack vector is based on a DNS misconfiguration. The CNAME record for the `app` subdomain is present even when the user does not need or intend it to be present.
*   **External Service Abuse:** Attackers abuse the default behavior of the `interactsh` server, by setting up content on `projectdiscovery.github.io`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Register on GitHub Pages:** The attacker needs to be able to register on `projectdiscovery.github.io` (or similar services) and configure it to respond to the vulnerable subdomain.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know that the default CNAME record exists and is vulnerable to takeover.
*   **No direct access to the victim's server required:** The attacker does not need direct access to the victim's server or network, the vulnerability is based on the DNS configuration and the default behavior of `interactsh`.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was initially reported as a subdomain takeover of a domain running the `interactsh` server.
*   The fix involves removing the default CNAME entry in the `interactsh` server and making it optional via a flag (`-app-cname`).
*   The vulnerability is related to a broader class of subdomain takeover issues where services allow claiming subdomains when the DNS records point to them without verification of the domain owner's intent.
* The provided write-up from Detectify provides an overview of the generic subdomain takeover vulnerability.

In summary, CVE-2023-36474 is a subdomain takeover vulnerability in `interactsh` server due to a default configuration that creates a CNAME record for the `app` subdomain. This allows attackers to host arbitrary client-side code, steal credentials, and damage the credibility of organizations using a vulnerable version of the software.
