# Interactsh server < 1.0.0 Subdomain Takeover

High

[ehsandeep](/ehsandeep)
published
GHSA-m36x-mgfh-8g78
Jan 24, 2022

## Package

gomod

github.com/projectdiscovery/interactsh
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

< 1.0.0

## Patched versions

1.0.0

## Description

A domain configured with interactsh server was vulnerable to subdomain takeover for specfic subdomain, i.e `app`, Interactsh server before `< 1.0.0` used to create cname entries for `app` pointing to `projectdiscovery.github.io` as default which intended to used for hosting interactsh [web client](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/interactsh-web) using GitHub pages. It turns out to be a security issue with a self-hosted interactsh server in which the user may not have configured a web client but still have a cname entry pointing to GitHub pages, making them vulnerable to subdomain takeover.

This issue was initially reported to us as a subdomain takeover for one of our domains that runs interactsh server by **Melih** at `security@projectdiscovery.io`, and after conducting an internal investigation, we determined that it was an issue with the default config of interactsh server affecting all the server running self-hosted instance of interactsh, as a result - cname entry has been removed in the latest release.

#### Impact

This allows one to host / run arbitrary client side code (XSS) in a user's browser when browsing the vulnerable subdomain, for more details on the impact, please read this [detailed blogpost](https://labs.detectify.com/2014/10/21/hostile-subdomain-takeover-using-herokugithubdesk-more/) from Detectify.

#### Patches

Update to [Interactsh server v1.0.0](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/interactsh/releases/tag/v1.0.0) with `go install -v github.com/projectdiscovery/interactsh/cmd/interactsh-server@latest`

### @Mzack9999 **[Mzack9999](/Mzack9999)** commented [Dec 29, 2021](#issue-1090543561) • edited Loading

## Description

This PR disables, by default, the CNAME record for the web app. The newly introduced flag (`-app-cname`) controls the behavior.

## Reproduction Steps

* `interactsh-server` with cname disabled (default behavior):

```
$ sudo go run . -listen-ip 192.168.1.9 -skip-acme -debug -domain example -debug
```

* `interactsh-server` with cname enabled:

```
$ sudo go run . -listen-ip 192.168.1.9 -skip-acme -debug -domain example -debug -app-cname
```

Sorry, something went wrong.

# Hostile subdomain takeover using Heroku/Github/Desk + more

**Hackers can [claim subdomains](https://detectify.com/solutions/prevent-subdomain-takeover) with the help of external services. This attack is practically non-traceable, and affects at least 17 large service providers and multiple domains are affected. Find out if you are one of them by [using our quick tool](https://detectify.com), or go through your DNS-entries and remove all which are active and unused OR pointing to External Services which you do not use anymore.**

The team at Detectify has recently identified a serious [attack vector](https://detectify.com/attack-vector) resulting from a widespread DNS misconfiguration. The misconfiguration allows an attacker to take full control over subdomains pointing to providers such as Heroku, Github, Bitbucket, Desk, Squarespace and Shopify.

## Attack Scenario

1. Your company starts using a new service, eg an external Support Ticketing-service.
2. Your company points a subdomain to the Support Ticketing-service, eg support.your-domain.com
3. Your company stops using this service but does not remove the subdomain redirection pointing to the ticketing system.
4. Attacker signs up for the Service and claims the domain as theirs. No verification is done by the Service Provider, and the DNS-setup is already correctly setup.
5. Attacker can now build a complete clone of the real site, add a login form, redirect the user, steal credentials (e.g. admin accounts), cookies and/or completely destroy business credibility for your company.

### Three things that make this scenario dangerous

* It’s SUPER easy. Sign up for a new account and claim the domain. Done.
* It’s completely hidden. The Domain Owner won’t notice. The attacker won’t leave any traces for the Domain Owner. Good luck monitoring this in an IDS!
* The Service Provider is unlikely to be able to fix this in a feasible way.

### Now if this wasn’t bad enough, imagine this scenario

1. A Domain Owner points their \* (wildcard) DNS-entry to e.g. Heroku.
2. They forget to add the wildcard-entry to their Heroku-app.
3. Attacker can now claim any subdomain they want from the Domain Owner.
4. A Domain Owner will be unaware of the subdomain being exploited.

## Technical Details

This attack vector utilizes DNS entries pointing to Service Providers where the pointed subdomain is currently not in use. Depending on the DNS-entry configuration and which Service Provider it points to, some of these services will allow unverified users to claim these subdomains as their own.

In the not so rare case, the attacker can also “inherit” the Domain Owner’s Wildcard SSL used inside the Service Provider.

Here’s an example of a DNS entry that could be used for this attack:

[![](https://labsdetectifycom.cdn.triggerfish.cloud/uploads/2023/09/27084232/example-dns.png)](https://labsdetectifycom.cdn.triggerfish.cloud/uploads/2023/09/27084232/example-dns.png)

If x.example.com has no service attached to it, the subdomain could be taken over by an attacker. Below are examples of how some of the services will indicate the existence of this vulnerability:

[![](https://labsdetectifycom.cdn.triggerfish.cloud/uploads/2023/09/27084231/how-some-of-the-services-will-indicate-the-existence-of-this-vulnerability.png)](https://labsdetectifycom.cdn.triggerfish.cloud/uploads/2023/09/27084231/how-some-of-the-services-will-indicate-the-existence-of-this-vulnerability.png)

### Affected Service Providers and Domain Owners

We’ve identified at least 17 Service Providers which do not handle the subdomain ownership verification properly – allowing this vulnerability to be exploited, Heroku, Github, Bitbucket, Squarespace, Shopify, Desk, Teamwork, Unbounce, Helpjuice, HelpScout, Pingdom, Tictail, Campaign Monitor, CargoCollective, StatusPage.io and Tumblr.

We’ve also identified at least 200 organizations which are currently affected. In many cases, we are talking NASDAQ-listed, top 100 Alexa rank domains that basically allowed us to set up a Hello World on their domains.

We have notified both the affected Service Providers as well as the Domain Owners under responsible disclosure programs.

## Recommendations

* Check your DNS-configuration for subdomains pointing to services not in use.
* Set up your external service so it fully listens to your wildcard DNS. In Heroku’s case, this means running the following command in your App: heroku domains:add \*.example.com

Our advice is to keep your DNS entries constantly vetted and restricted.

***Update 2017-02-20: The original article states 17 services, we have now identified 100+ different ways that you can be vulnerable to a domain takeover***

## Detectify Surface Monitoring

[Surface Monitoring](https://detectify.com/product/surface-monitoring) is a service for monitoring your subdomains for potential subdomain takeovers. It monitors changes within public DNS resolvers and warns you as soon as we detect any anomalies. Contact us on hello [at] detectify.com  for more information.

CloudKit, the data storage framework by Apple, has various access controls. These access controls could be misconfigured, even by Apple themselves, which affected Apple’s own apps using CloudKit. This blog post explains in detail three bugs found in iCrowd+, Apple News and Apple Shortcuts with different criticality uncovered by Frans Rosen while hacking Cloudkit. All bugs were reported to and fixed by the Apple Security Bounty program.

## Description

![@ehsandeep](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8293321?u=ae3abc7734bd873f76ae355b60423e16d6006a6e&v=4&size=48)[ehsandeep](https://github.com/ehsandeep)opened [on Dec 19, 2021](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/interactsh/issues/136#issue-1084131737)

Currently, a **cname** entry for `app.INTERACTSH-DOMAIN` gets created as default for any user using a self-hosted server. This is intended to use for hosting the [web client](https://app.interactsh.com) at <https://app.interactsh.com> and should not be enabled for all users as default.

This support can be optional with the additional boolean flag `app-cname` and will be **disabled as default**.
