- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The CPCI85 firmware of SICAM A8000 devices contains a hard-coded ID in the SSH `authorized_keys` configuration file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Hard-coded credentials (CWE-798). Specifically, a hard-coded SSH key is present in the `authorized_keys` file.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with knowledge of the corresponding private key could login to the device via SSH, gaining unauthorized access.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based. An attacker needs network access to the affected device to exploit the vulnerability via SSH.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker must have network access to the device and knowledge of the private key corresponding to the hard-coded public key. This vulnerability only affects devices with activated debug support.
