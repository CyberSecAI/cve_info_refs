### **[fuboat](/fuboat)** commented [Jun 16, 2023](#issue-1761035852)

| **Describe the bug** MonetDB server 11.46.0 crashes at `gc_col` after executing SQL statements through ODBC.  **To Reproduce**   1. Configure the unixODBC with MonetDB ODBC drivers 2. Use the command line like `isql monetdb -v -e` to connect (**to trigger the crash, the '-e' option is necessary.** But I don't know why) 3. Execute the following SQL statements:  ``` START TRANSACTION; CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE t1 (keyc INT, c1 VARCHAR(100), c2 VARCHAR(100), PRIMARY KEY(keyc)); CREATE TABLE c1(c2 DECIMAL(9,4) NOT NULL); SAVEPOINT a_a; TRUNCATE TABLE t1; DELETE FROM w; COMMIT; SELECT 1; ```  **Expected behavior** Executing statements successfully or throwing errors, instead of breaking down the whole MonetDB server.  **Backtrace**  ``` #0 0x7ff2e7285dd6 (gc_col+0x26) #1 0x7ff2e7282cd5 (tc_gc_col+0x15) #2 0x7ff2e7251307 (store_pending_changes+0x307) #3 0x7ff2e7255a87 (sql_trans_commit+0x567) #4 0x7ff2e7260353 (sql_trans_end+0x83) #5 0x7ff2e72a310c (mvc_commit+0x4fc) #6 0x7ff2e71a4564 (SQLengine_+0x284) #7 0x7ff2e71a3343 (SQLengine+0x23) #8 0x7ff2e75326cf (runScenario+0x4f) #9 0x7ff2e753316c (MSscheduleClient+0x68c) #10 0x7ff2e75dac2b (doChallenge+0xfb) #11 0x7ff2e7c59ba0 (THRstarter+0x100) #12 0x7ff2e7cc9cc4 (thread_starter+0x34) #13 0x7ff2e703e609 (start_thread+0xd9) #14 0x7ff2e6f63133 (clone+0x43)  ```  **Software versions**   * MonetDB server version: 11.46.0 (hg id: [63a42c2](https://github.com/MonetDB/MonetDB/commit/63a42c2569c6ef1d3c36b161c544d7b1d93fe9a8)) (pulled from the master branch) * MonetDB client version: mclient, version 11.48.0 (hg id: [63a42c2](https://github.com/MonetDB/MonetDB/commit/63a42c2569c6ef1d3c36b161c544d7b1d93fe9a8)) * OS and version: ubuntu 20.04 * Self-installed and compiled. The command line of compilation: `CC=clang-12 CXX=clang++-12 cmake /root/monetdb_master -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo`   **Issue labeling** bug  **Additional context** The MonetDB here runs in-memory database. The command line of starting MonetDB server is `mserver5 --in-memory`.  If the crash cannot be reproduced easily, please tell me. I will try to provide the whole steps to trigger the crash as possible. |

### **[mvdvm](/mvdvm)** commented [Jun 19, 2023](#issuecomment-1597405263)

| Could **not** reproduce the crash with MonetDB 5 server v11.45.17 (Sep2022-SP3). The statement `TRUNCATE TABLE t1;` fails with error: `TRUNCATE: no such table 't1'`. The statement `DELETE FROM w;` fails with error: `DELETE FROM: no such table 'w'`. The next statement `COMMIT;` therefore fails with error: `COMMIT: transaction is aborted, will ROLLBACK instead` No crash of server. I noticed that without the `SAVEPOINT a_a;` statement the `TRUNCATE TABLE t1;` statement succeeds, so setting the savepoint apparently 'looses' the temp table information, which is incorrect. |
