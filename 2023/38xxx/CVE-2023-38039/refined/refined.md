  "CVE-2023-38039": {
    "description": "The vulnerability is an out-of-heap memory issue caused by a missing limit on the number or size of HTTP headers that curl will accept in a response. A malicious server can stream an endless series of headers, causing curl to consume all available heap memory.",
    "root_cause": "The root cause is a missing limit in curl on the number or size of HTTP headers it would accept in a response, leading to unbounded memory allocation.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Heap memory exhaustion",
       "Denial of Service"
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to denial of service (DoS) by exhausting heap memory.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A malicious server streams an endless series of HTTP headers to a client."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control or influence the HTTP server. No specific client-side capabilities are needed to exploit this vulnerability."
