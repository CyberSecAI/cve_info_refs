Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability in the openSIS Classic Community Edition version 9.0

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The application allows direct access to student files based on a predictable URL structure.
- There is no authentication or authorization check performed before serving the requested file.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated remote attacker can gain unauthorized access to any student's files.
- This can lead to the exposure of sensitive student information, such as personal documents, grades, or other confidential files.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker can directly craft a URL by knowing the studentId and the filename and access the file.
- The vulnerable URL path is `/assets/studentfiles/<studentId>-<filename>`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to know or guess a valid student ID and filename within the application.
- The attacker can be an unauthenticated remote user.
