- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Deserialization of untrusted data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application is vulnerable to arbitrary code execution due to unsafe deserialization of data. Specifically, the application is deserializing data without proper validation which allows an attacker to inject malicious code by sending crafted data.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based, meaning a remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability. No user interaction or special privileges are required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable ColdFusion instance and the ability to send a specially crafted serialized object to the server.
