- **Root cause of vulnerability:** XML Injection (aka Blind XPath Injection)
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper handling of XML data, leading to the possibility of injecting malicious XML payloads. Specifically, the vulnerability is described as a "Blind XPath Injection," suggesting that the attacker might not directly see the output of the injection but can infer information from the server's behavior.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary file system read. An attacker can potentially read sensitive files from the server's file system.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack (AV:N), low attack complexity (AC:L), no privileges required (PR:N), no user interaction (UI:N)
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not require any authentication, or administrative privileges and can exploit the vulnerability remotely over the network.
