    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is located in the `render_block_core_post_navigation_link` function. The code directly appends the value of `$attributes['arrow']` to `$format` without sanitization, which is later reflected as HTML via the `$content` variable. This lack of proper sanitization allows for DOM-based XSS.",

      "Improper input sanitization",
       "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"

    "cve_id": "CVE-2023-38000",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `wp_ajax_parse_media_shortcode` function. There is no validation on the `$shortcode` variable. The code directly processes the variable using the `do_shortcode` function, allowing any authenticated user to execute arbitrary shortcodes.",
