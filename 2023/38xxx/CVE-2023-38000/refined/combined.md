## Contributor+ Stored XSS via Navigation Link Block

Credits to our own security research team at Patchstack for discovering this vulnerability.

The underlying vulnerable code is located in the `render_block_core_post_navigation_link` function:

```
function render_block_core_post_navigation_link( $attributes, $content ) {
----------------- CUTTED HERE -----------------
	$arrow_map = array(
		'none'    => '',
		'arrow'   => array(
			'next'     => '→',
			'previous' => '←',
		),
		'chevron' => array(
			'next'     => '»',
			'previous' => '«',
		),
	);
----------------- CUTTED HERE -----------------
	// Display arrows.
	if ( isset( $attributes['arrow'] ) && ! empty( $attributes['arrow'] ) && 'none' !== $attributes['arrow'] ) {
		$arrow = $arrow_map[ $attributes['arrow'] ][ $navigation_type ];

		if ( 'next' === $navigation_type ) {
			$format = '%link <span class="wp-block-post-navigation-link__arrow-next is-arrow-' . $attributes['arrow'] . '" aria-hidden="true">' . $arrow . '</span>';
		} else {
			$format = '<span class="wp-block-post-navigation-link__arrow-previous is-arrow-' . $attributes['arrow'] . '" aria-hidden="true">' . $arrow . '</span> %link';
		}
	}

	// The dynamic portion of the function name, `$navigation_type`,
	// refers to the type of adjacency, 'next' or 'previous'.
	$get_link_function = "get_{$navigation_type}_post_link";
	$content           = $get_link_function( $format, $link );
	return sprintf(
		'<div %1$s>%2$s</div>',
		$wrapper_attributes,
		$content
	);
}
```

The function itself acts as a process handler of the `wp:post-navigation-link` block. The vulnerable process was located when the code tried to directly append `$attributes['arrow']` value to $format which will eventually reflect as HTML via `$content` variable. Since there is no proper sanitization and escaping, we could escape the `class` attribute and perform a DOM-based XSS.

### Potential impact

This allows authenticated users with a Contributor role and higher to inject a script into the WordPress page via the Navigation Link block and could result from stealing sensitive information to potentially privilege escalation on the WordPress site. Since the vulnerability is originally coming from the Gutenberg block, this issue also affected the stand-alone Gutenberg plugin.

### The patch

Since the main issue is the lack of validation process on the `$attributes['arrow']`, implementing a check where the `$attributes['arrow']` value should be a valid `$arrow_map` key value should fix the issue. The [patch](https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/2978318/gutenberg/trunk/build/block-library/blocks/post-navigation-link.php) can be seen below:

## Contributor+ Comment Read on Private and Password Protected Post

Credits to our security research team at Patchstack for discovering this vulnerability.

The main vulnerable feature exists on the overall WP-ADMIN Comments page. Generally, a user with a Contributor role can view all the comments made to Posts. The feature does not restrict read access to comments made to private and password-protected posts for the Contributor role.

### Potential impact

This allows users with the minimum role of Contributor to read comments on the private and password-protected posts.

### The patch

Since the main issue is there is no permission check on the comments page, applying a permission check should fix the issue. The [patch](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/56836/) can be seen below:

## Subscriber+ Arbitrary Shortcode Execution via parse-media-shortcode

Credits to John Blackbourn (WordPress Security Team), [James Golovich](https://hackerone.com/jamesgol?type=user), [J.D Grimes](https://hackerone.com/jdgrimes), [Numan Turle](https://hackerone.com/numan), and [WhiteCyberSec](https://hackerone.com/whitecybersec?type=user) for discovering this vulnerability.

The underlying vulnerable code is located in the `wp_ajax_parse_media_shortcode` function:

```
function wp_ajax_parse_media_shortcode() {
	global $post, $wp_scripts;

	if ( empty( $_POST['shortcode'] ) ) {
		wp_send_json_error();
	}

	$shortcode = wp_unslash( $_POST['shortcode'] );

	if ( ! empty( $_POST['post_ID'] ) ) {
		$post = get_post( (int) $_POST['post_ID'] );
	}

	// The embed shortcode requires a post.
	if ( ! $post || ! current_user_can( 'edit_post', $post->ID ) ) {
		if ( 'embed' === $shortcode ) {
			wp_send_json_error();
		}
	} else {
		setup_postdata( $post );
	}

	$parsed = do_shortcode( $shortcode );

	if ( empty( $parsed ) ) {
		wp_send_json_error(
			array(
				'type'    => 'no-items',
				'message' => __( 'No items found.' ),
			)
		);
	}

	$head   = '';
	$styles = wpview_media_sandbox_styles();

	foreach ( $styles as $style ) {
		$head .= '<link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="' . $style . '">';
	}

	if ( ! empty( $wp_scripts ) ) {
		$wp_scripts->done = array();
	}

	ob_start();

	echo $parsed;

	if ( 'playlist' === $_REQUEST['type'] ) {
		wp_underscore_playlist_templates();

		wp_print_scripts( 'wp-playlist' );
	} else {
		wp_print_scripts( array( 'mediaelement-vimeo', 'wp-mediaelement' ) );
	}

	wp_send_json_success(
		array(
			'head' => $head,
			'body' => ob_get_clean(),
		)
	);
}
```

The function is used to handle `parse-media-shortcode` ajax action. Since there is no validation on the `$shortcode` variable and the code will process the variable directly to `do_shortcode` function, any authenticated user can execute an arbitrary shortcode.

### Potential impact

This allows any authenticated user with a minimum Subscriber role and higher to execute an arbitrary shortcode. The actual impact of this vulnerability depends on the available shortcode on the site which can come from plugins or themes component.

### The patch

Since the main issue is the lack of filtering on the executed media shortcode, implementing a whitelist check on the shortcode should fix the issue. The [patch](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/56846/) can be seen below:

![WordPress Core 6.3.2](https://patchstack.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-5-1024x524.png)
## Reflected XSS via Application Password Requests

Credits to [[mascara7784](https://facebook.com/zino.abdrahim)](https://profiles.wordpress.org/jorgefilipecosta/) for discovering this vulnerability.

The underlying vulnerable code is located in the `wp_is_authorize_application_password_request_valid` function :

```
function wp_is_authorize_application_password_request_valid( $request, $user ) {
	$error    = new WP_Error();
	$is_local = 'local' === wp_get_environment_type();

	if ( ! empty( $request['success_url'] ) ) {
		$scheme = wp_parse_url( $request['success_url'], PHP_URL_SCHEME );

		if ( 'http' === $scheme && ! $is_local ) {
			$error->add(
				'invalid_redirect_scheme',
				__( 'The success URL must be served over a secure connection.' )
			);
		}
	}

	if ( ! empty( $request['reject_url'] ) ) {
		$scheme = wp_parse_url( $request['reject_url'], PHP_URL_SCHEME );

		if ( 'http' === $scheme && ! $is_local ) {
			$error->add(
				'invalid_redirect_scheme',
				__( 'The rejection URL must be served over a secure connection.' )
			);
		}
	}

	if ( ! empty( $request['app_id'] ) && ! wp_is_uuid( $request['app_id'] ) ) {
		$error->add(
			'invalid_app_id',
			__( 'The application ID must be a UUID.' )
		);
	}

	/**
	 * Fires before application password errors are returned.
	 *
	 * @since 5.6.0
	 *
	 * @param WP_Error $error   The error object.
	 * @param array    $request The array of request data.
	 * @param WP_User  $user    The user authorizing the application.
	 */
	do_action( 'wp_authorize_application_password_request_errors', $error, $request, $user );

	if ( $error->has_errors() ) {
		return $error;
	}

	return true;
}
```

The function itself acts as a process handler to check if the Authorize Application Password request is valid. An application password itself is a password that we can create inside our User Profile for each WordPress website. If we give this password to another application, that application can use the password to authenticate to our WordPress site programmatically through the REST API.

The specific vulnerable variable exists on `$request['success_url']` and `$request['reject_url']`. There is no proper validation on the given redirect URL value when the user decides to reject or approve an application password. This condition could be used to trigger reflected cross-site scripting by supplying the variable with a `data:` or `javascript:` protocol.

### Potential impact

This allows unauthenticated users to inject a script into the WordPress page via the application password feature by tricking users into clicking to reject or approve an application password and could result from stealing sensitive information to potentially privilege escalation on the WordPress site.

### The patch

Since the main issue is a lack of sanitization on the redirect URL value, implementing a protocol check fixes the issue. The [patch](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/56844/) can be seen below:

![](https://patchstack.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-6-1024x800.png)

## Contributor+ Stored XSS via Footnotes Block

Credits to [Jorge Costa](https://profiles.wordpress.org/jorgefilipecosta/) of the WordPress Core Team for discovering this vulnerability.

The origin of the vulnerable process is located in the `render_block_core_footnotes` function :

```
function render_block_core_footnotes( $attributes, $content, $block ) {
	// Bail out early if the post ID is not set for some reason.
	if ( empty( $block->context['postId'] ) ) {
		return '';
	}

	if ( post_password_required( $block->context['postId'] ) ) {
		return;
	}

	$footnotes = get_post_meta( $block->context['postId'], 'footnotes', true );

	if ( ! $footnotes ) {
		return;
	}

	$footnotes = json_decode( $footnotes, true );

	if ( ! is_array( $footnotes ) || count( $footnotes ) === 0 ) {
		return '';
	}

	$wrapper_attributes = get_block_wrapper_attributes();

	$block_content = '';

	foreach ( $footnotes as $footnote ) {
		$block_content .= sprintf(
			'<li id="%1$s">%2$s <a href="#%1$s-link">↩︎</a></li>',
			$footnote['id'],
			$footnote['content']
		);
	}

	return sprintf(
		'<ol %1$s>%2$s</ol>',
		$wrapper_attributes,
		$block_content
	);
}
```

This function will handle the process of footnotes block display. Notice that it will directly construct an HTML from the `$footnote['content']` which come from the `footnotes` meta value of a post. The `footnotes` meta value itself could be set from the `_wp_rest_api_autosave_meta` function :

```
function _wp_rest_api_autosave_meta( $autosave ) {
	// Ensure it's a REST API request.
	if ( ! defined( 'REST_REQUEST' ) || ! REST_REQUEST ) {
		return;
	}

	$body = rest_get_server()->get_raw_data();
	$body = json_decode( $body, true );

	if ( ! isset( $body['meta']['footnotes'] ) ) {
		return;
	}

	// `wp_creating_autosave` passes the array,
	// `_wp_put_post_revision` passes the ID.
	$id = is_int( $autosave ) ? $autosave : $autosave['ID'];

	if ( ! $id ) {
		return;
	}

	update_post_meta( $id, 'footnotes', wp_slash( $body['meta']['footnotes'] ) );
}
```

The function to store the `footnotes` meta doesn’t apply a proper filter and sanitization to the given value.

### Potential impact

This allows authenticated users with a Contributor role and higher to inject a script into the WordPress page via the Footnotes block and could result from stealing sensitive information to potentially privilege escalation on the WordPress site. Since the vulnerability is originally coming from the Gutenberg block, this issue also affected the stand-alone Gutenberg plugin.

### The patch

Since the main issue is the lack of sanitization process on the `footnotes` meta value, implementing a filter and sanitization with `wp_filter_post_kses` to the `footnotes` meta value should fix the issue. The [patch](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/56839/) can be seen below:

![](https://patchstack.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-8-1024x629.png)

## DoS via Cache Poisoning

Credits to [s5s](https://hackerone.com/s5s) and [raouf\_maklouf](http://twitter.com/Raoufmaklouf) for discovering this vulnerability.

The underlying vulnerable code is located in the serve\_request function:

```
public function serve_request( $path = null ) {
    ----------------- CUTTED HERE -----------------

    /**
     * Filters whether to send nocache headers on a REST API request.
     *
     * @since 4.4.0
     *
     * @param bool $rest_send_nocache_headers Whether to send no-cache headers.
     */
    $send_no_cache_headers = apply_filters( 'rest_send_nocache_headers', is_user_logged_in() );
    if ( $send_no_cache_headers ) {
        foreach ( wp_get_nocache_headers() as $header => $header_value ) {
            if ( empty( $header_value ) ) {
                $this->remove_header( $header );
            } else {
                $this->send_header( $header, $header_value );
            }
        }
    }

    ----------------- CUTTED HERE -----------------

    $request = new WP_REST_Request( $_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'], $path );

    $request->set_query_params( wp_unslash( $_GET ) );
    $request->set_body_params( wp_unslash( $_POST ) );
    $request->set_file_params( $_FILES );
    $request->set_headers( $this->get_headers( wp_unslash( $_SERVER ) ) );
    $request->set_body( self::get_raw_data() );

    /*
     * HTTP method override for clients that can't use PUT/PATCH/DELETE. First, we check
     * $_GET['_method']. If that is not set, we check for the HTTP_X_HTTP_METHOD_OVERRIDE
     * header.
     */
    if ( isset( $_GET['_method'] ) ) {
        $request->set_method( $_GET['_method'] );
    } elseif ( isset( $_SERVER['HTTP_X_HTTP_METHOD_OVERRIDE'] ) ) {
        $request->set_method( $_SERVER['HTTP_X_HTTP_METHOD_OVERRIDE'] );
    }

    ----------------- CUTTED HERE -----------------
```

The function handles the serving of a REST API request. There is a case where an attacker could perform a DoS by supplying a `X-HTTP-Method-Override` header to a public API endpoint available on the site. In the case where the crafted request performed to the API returns a 4xx status code, other unauthenticated users will also face a 4xx status code when trying to access the API endpoint. The 4xx status code response could be caused by the restriction applied by the service to the given endpoint or the request method for the specific endpoint is not supported.

### Potential impact

This allows unauthenticated users to deny access to the API endpoint via cache poisoning.

### The patch

Since the main issue is a lack of proper validation checks, implementing a no cache for HTTP method override which causes a 4xx status code should fix the issue. The [patch](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/56841/) can be seen below:

## Sensitive Information Exposure via User Search REST Endpoint

Credits to Marc Montpas of Automattic for discovering this vulnerability.

The underlying vulnerable code is located in the `get_items` function from `WP_REST_Users_Controller` class :

```
public function get_items( $request ) {

    // Retrieve the list of registered collection query parameters.
    $registered = $this->get_collection_params();

    /*
     * This array defines mappings between public API query parameters whose
     * values are accepted as-passed, and their internal WP_Query parameter
     * name equivalents (some are the same). Only values which are also
     * present in $registered will be set.
     */
    $parameter_mappings = array(
        'exclude'      => 'exclude',

        }
    }

    if ( isset( $registered['offset'] ) && ! empty( $request['offset'] ) ) {
        $prepared_args['offset'] = $request['offset'];
    } else {
        $prepared_args['offset'] = ( $request['page'] - 1 ) * $prepared_args['number'];
    }

    if ( isset( $registered['orderby'] ) ) {
        $orderby_possibles        = array(
            'id'              => 'ID',
            'include'         => 'include',

        $prepared_args['orderby'] = $orderby_possibles[ $request['orderby'] ];
    }

    if ( isset( $registered['who'] ) && ! empty( $request['who'] ) && 'authors' === $request['who'] ) {
        $prepared_args['who'] = 'authors';
    } elseif ( ! current_user_can( 'list_users' ) ) {
        $prepared_args['has_published_posts'] = get_post_types( array( 'show_in_rest' => true ), 'names' );
    }

    if ( ! empty( $request['has_published_posts'] ) ) {
        $prepared_args['has_published_posts'] = ( true === $request['has_published_posts'] )
            ? get_post_types( array( 'show_in_rest' => true ), 'names' )
            : (array) $request['has_published_posts'];
    }

    ----------------- CUTTED HERE -----------------
```

The function handles the process of searching for users on the WordPress site via the REST API endpoint. Since the search process could involve a user’s email address, unauthorized users, in this case, are able to perform brute force and gain verification regarding the user’s email address on the published posts or pages.

### Potential impact

This allows unauthenticated users to perform a verification of existing users’ email addresses on the published posts or pages by only including the partial part of the targeted email.

### The patch

Since the main issue is a lack of proper permission checks on the search process, restricting unauthorized users from including email addresses in the search process should fix the issue. The [patch](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/56840/) can be seen below:

## Possible RCE Pop Chain Gadgets

Credits to Marc Montpas of Automattic for discovering this possible security issue.

In this security release, the core team has made a patch for possible RCE POP Chain Gadgets. These gadgets are observed to exist on several classes such as Requests/Session, Requests/Hooks, Request/Iri, WP\_Theme, WP\_Block\_Type\_Registry, and WP\_Block\_Patterns\_Registry. POP Chain Gadgets itself could be very useful to maximize the impact of PHP Object Injection vulnerability.

Until this article is published, we still weren’t able to directly verify the exploitability of the possible gadgets and will continue to analyze the vulnerable classes and the patches.

### Potential impact

This possibly could allow a PHP Object Injection (if it exists) vulnerability in the WordPress site to be escalated to a Remote Code Execution.

### The patch

The core team made changes to prevent unintended behavior when certain objects are unserialized. The patch can be seen [here](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/56835/).

## Conclusion

In this article, we covered 7 medium severity vulnerabilities and 1 possible security issue that were patched in WordPress 6.3.2. Our research team also contributed to 2 out of 7 reported vulnerabilities.

See the official [WordPress.org](http://WordPress.org) announcement: <https://wordpress.org/news/2023/10/wordpress-6-3-2-maintenance-and-security-release/>

How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.
