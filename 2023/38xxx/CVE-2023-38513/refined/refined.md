**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) in the WordPress Photo Engine Plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would likely need to be an authenticated user of the WordPress site with the "author" privilege, to be able to exploit this vulnerability. However, the report does not explicitly mention the need to be authenticated and implies the author privilege is needed.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability is classified as low priority and has a CVSS score of 5.4.
