- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An authenticated administrator with the privilege to commit a specifically crafted configuration can read local files and resources from the system during the configuration commit process.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-610: Externally Controlled Reference to a Resource in Another Sphere. This indicates that the system is using an external reference in an insecure way, allowing access to files and resources beyond the intended scope.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit allows a high-privileged attacker to read sensitive files and resources from the PAN-OS system, potentially leading to data leakage or further exploitation. The impact on integrity is rated as low.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is network-based and requires an attacker to have administrative access to PAN-OS. The attacker must be able to commit a specially crafted configuration.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated administrator with the privilege to commit configurations. The attack complexity is low and does not require user interaction.
