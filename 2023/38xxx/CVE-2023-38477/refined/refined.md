Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check within a function of the WordPress QR code MeCard/vCard generator plugin. This lack of proper access control allows unprivileged users to execute actions that should be restricted to higher-privileged users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Broken Access Control:** The core issue is a failure to enforce proper access control mechanisms, enabling unauthorized access to functions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An unprivileged user (specifically, a "Subscriber" as mentioned in the details) can perform actions that are intended for users with higher privileges. The specific impact is not detailed and described as varying on a case-by-case basis.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is exploitable by sending requests to the vulnerable function, bypassing security checks due to missing authentication/authorization/nonce verification. The specific vector is not described in detail.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be a registered user on the WordPress site, with "Subscriber" level privileges.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability is classified as "Low" priority with a CVSS score of 4.3.
*   A virtual patch is available from Patchstack to mitigate the issue until the plugin is updated.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.6.1 of the plugin.
*   The vulnerability is classified under OWASP Top 10 A5: Broken Access Control.
