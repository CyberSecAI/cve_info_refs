Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in an authentication bypass in the web management interface of Fujitsu Si-R series and SR-M series network devices.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Authentication bypass (CWE-287).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker who can access the product (likely adjacent network access) can:
  - Obtain the product's configuration information.
  - Change the product's configuration settings.
  - Reset the device configuration.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is adjacent network (AV:A) according to CVSS v3 and v2. This means the attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the vulnerable device.
- The vulnerability is in the web management interface.
- It is not clear from the document if specific HTTP requests or actions are required, but the web interface is the vulnerable point.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have adjacent network access to the vulnerable device.
- No user interaction is required (UI:N).
- No prior authentication is required due to the bypass vulnerability (PR:N) according to CVSS v3.

**CVSS Metrics**
- CVSS v3: AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L (Base Score: 6.4)
- CVSS v2: AV:A/AC:H/Au:N/C:P/I:C/A:P (Base Score: 5.8)
