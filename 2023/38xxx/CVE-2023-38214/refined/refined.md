- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is a reflected Cross-site Scripting (XSS) issue.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before reflecting it back in the web page's output.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the victim's browser.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based (AV:N). The attacker would need to craft a malicious URL containing a XSS payload, and trick the victim into accessing the URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs a low privilege account to be able to perform the attack. User interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability (UI:R).
