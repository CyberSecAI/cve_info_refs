Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-38321:

**Summary:**

CVE-2023-38321 is a vulnerability in OpenNDS, a captive portal software, that can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS). It involves a NULL pointer dereference caused by a crafted HTTP GET request to `/opennds_auth/`.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a NULL pointer dereference within the OpenNDS code when processing a crafted GET request to the `/opennds_auth/` endpoint lacking the `custom` parameter, but having arbitrary values set for the `client-token` and `redirect` parameters. This specific combination of missing and present parameters leads to the dereferencing of a NULL pointer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- NULL pointer dereference.
- Insufficient input validation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Exploitation leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- The OpenNDS daemon crashes.
- Internet access is denied to any client attempting to connect through the affected captive portal.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `/opennds_auth/` endpoint.
- The request must be crafted to lack a `custom` parameter while having arbitrary values for `client-token` and `redirect`.
- The attack can be performed remotely.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/opennds_auth/` endpoint of a vulnerable OpenNDS instance.
- No authentication is required.
- The attacker does not need a privileged position. The vulnerability can be triggered remotely.
- The attacker must be able to access the captive portal.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is present in ALEOS versions prior to 4.17.0.12.
- The vulnerability is triggered during client authentication.
- The vulnerability is one of a series of similar vulnerabilities (CVE-2023-38313, CVE-2023-38314, CVE-2023-38315, CVE-2023-38320, CVE-2023-38322) affecting OpenNDS.
- Sierra Wireless mentions that the vulnerability is not exploitable if the "Simple Captive Portal" feature is not enabled.

This analysis provides more detail than the official CVE description, particularly on the specific HTTP request parameters needed to trigger the vulnerability and the conditions under which the vulnerability is exploitable.
