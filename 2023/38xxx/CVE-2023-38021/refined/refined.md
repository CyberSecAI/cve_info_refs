  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Incorrectly aligned reads from the xAPIC MMIO page on some processors return stale data from CPU buffers.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper isolation of shared resources in some Intel Processors may allow a privileged user to potentially enable information disclosure via local access.",
      "Non-8-byte aligned reads from host memory within an SGX enclave can leak data due to CPU buffer issues."
    ],
    "impact": "Information disclosure through the leakage of stale data from CPU buffers.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A privileged attacker with local access can exploit the vulnerability.",
      "A malicious host can cause an SGX enclave to receive unexpected enclave data via unaligned memory access."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Privileged access to the system (e.g., host OS, VMM). The attacker needs to have the ability to control memory mappings and perform reads from the xAPIC MMIO page.",
     "additional_information": "The vulnerability stems from hardware bugs rather than software issues. The use of Intel SGX enclaves and the xAPIC MMIO page is relevant to the exploitation. Mitigations include microcode updates and disabling Hyper-Threading.  The x2APIC mode, which disables the xAPIC MMIO page, is recommended as a mitigation by intel."
