{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer overflow in the calculation of buffer sizes for `rows`, `msb`, `lsb`, `flags`, `len`, and `vindex_offset` arrays within the `vzt_rd_init_smp` function when parsing VZT files. The multiplication of `numfacs` by 4 can wrap around in 32-bit mode if numfacs is sufficiently large, leading to a smaller than expected buffer allocation.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Integer overflow leading to heap-based buffer overflows. Specifically, incorrect buffer sizes are calculated due to an integer overflow, leading to out-of-bounds writes.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution. By manipulating the heap and overwriting specific data structures, an attacker can redirect execution flow to execute arbitrary code.",
  "Attack vectors": "A specially crafted .vzt file that, when opened by GTKWave, triggers the integer overflows and subsequent heap-based buffer overflows.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to create a malicious .vzt file and have a user open it with a vulnerable version of GTKWave. No special privileges are needed beyond the ability to craft a file."
