- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper handling of user input when generating user invite messages in the backoffice. Specifically, HTML code is not sanitized when generating the invite email body.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** HTML injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject HTML code into the user invite message. While the CVSS score indicates low impact (confidentiality, integrity, and availability are none), the injected HTML could be used for phishing attacks, social engineering, or other malicious purposes.
- **Attack vectors:** Network. The attacker needs to have access to the backoffice, and the vulnerable functionality is exposed over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have high privileges (access to the backoffice and the "users" section). The attacker also needs to be able to trigger sending of a user invite which requires user interaction.
