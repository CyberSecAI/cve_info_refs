Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2023-38587:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Improper input validation in some Intel® NUC BIOS firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The primary weakness is the lack of proper input validation within the BIOS firmware. This allows for the possibility of supplying malicious input that could lead to unintended behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Escalation of Privilege: A successful exploit could allow a privileged user to gain higher levels of access, potentially compromising the system.
*   The CVSS score also indicates High impact on Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Local Access: The vulnerability requires local access to the system to exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have privileged access to the system.
*   The attacker would need to interact with the BIOS firmware.

**Affected Products:**
*   Intel® NUC 8 Home: NUC8i3BEHFA, NUC8i5BEHFA, NUC8i5BEKPA
*   Intel® NUC 8 Enthusiast: NUC8i7BEHGA, NUC8i7BEKQA
*   Intel® NUC Kit: NUC8i3BEH, NUC8i3BEK, NUC8i5BEH, NUC8i5BEK, NUC8i7BEH, NUC8i3BEHS, NUC8i5BEHS, NUC8i7BEK

**Mitigation:**
*   Intel recommends updating the affected Intel® NUC BIOS firmware to the latest version.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The CVSS vector string is `CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H` which translates to:
    *   AV:L (Attack Vector: Local)
    *   AC:H (Attack Complexity: High)
    *   PR:H (Privileges Required: High)
    *   UI:N (User Interaction: None)
    *   S:C (Scope: Changed)
    *   C:H (Confidentiality: High)
    *   I:H (Integrity: High)
    *   A:H (Availability: High)
