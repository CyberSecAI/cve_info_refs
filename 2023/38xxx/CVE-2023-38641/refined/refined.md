- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application executes with unnecessary high privileges, specifically as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local attacker can execute arbitrary operating system commands with elevated (SYSTEM) privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access to the system is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker requires local access to the system and a low-privileged account.
