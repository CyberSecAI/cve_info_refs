The provided content relates to CVE-2023-38653.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Integer overflow in the calculation of buffer size when allocating memory for `change_dict` in the `vzt_rd_block_vch_decode` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Integer overflow: The size of the `change_dict` buffer is calculated by multiplying `num_sections` and `num_dict_entries`, which can overflow, leading to a smaller-than-required allocation.
- Heap-based buffer overflow: Due to the inadequate allocation size, subsequent writes to the `change_dict` buffer result in an out-of-bounds write, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Memory corruption: The out-of-bounds write corrupts the heap, potentially leading to a crash or other unexpected behavior.
- Potential arbitrary code execution: In a multithreaded environment, corrupting heap memory in one thread may lead to corruption in other threads and potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious .vzt file: The vulnerability is triggered by opening a specially crafted .vzt file.
- User interaction: A victim needs to open the malicious file to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to create a malicious .vzt file with specific values for `num_sections` and `num_dict_entries` that will cause an integer overflow.
- The attacker has to convince a victim to open the malicious .vzt file with GTKWave.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in the `vzt_rd_block_vch_decode` function within the `vzt_read.c` file.
- The vulnerability is triggered during the processing of VZT (Verilog Zipped Trace) files.
- The issue was fixed in GTKWave version 3.3.118.
- The vulnerability is triggered by the `vzt2vcd` command-line utility and the GUI component of the GTKWave application.
- The `change_dict` buffer size is calculated as `(num_sections * num_dict_entries) * sizeof(vztint32_t)`. The `num_sections` and `num_dict_entries` values are extracted from the compressed data block.
- The content also references CVE-2023-38652, which has a very similar root cause also related to an integer overflow in the same `vzt_rd_block_vch_decode` function.
