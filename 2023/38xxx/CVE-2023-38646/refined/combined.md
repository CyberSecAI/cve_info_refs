> We’ve [patched an additional vulnerability](./security-advisory-h2) since this post was published.

TL;DR: Upgrade your Metabase installation IMMEDIATELY.

A recently discovered security vulnerability almost certainly affects you (see below for details), and we recommend you upgrade your Metabase installation right away.

## If you are a Metabase Enterprise customer

You can access the latest patched release version at:

* JAR: <https://downloads.metabase.com/enterprise/v1.52.5/metabase.jar>
* Docker image via `metabase/metabase-enterprise:latest` or `metabase/metabase-enterprise:v1.46.6.1`.

## If you are using the open source edition of Metabase

You can access the latest patched release version at:

* JAR: <https://downloads.metabase.com/v0.52.5/metabase.jar>
* Docker image via `metabase/metabase:latest` or `metabase/metabase:v0.46.6.1`.

## For older versions of Metabase

We have also issued the following versions to patch prior versions of Metabase that were affected by the vulnerability:

* v0.45.4.1 and v1.45.4.1
* v0.44.7.1 and v1.44.7.1
* v0.43.7.2 and v1.43.7.2

These versions are available at <https://github.com/metabase/metabase/releases>.

## What happened?

We were informed by a third party security researcher that they discovered a vulnerability in Metabase.

## What is the severity of the vulnerability?

Extremely severe. An unauthenticated attacker can run arbitrary commands with the same privileges as the Metabase server on the server you are running Metabase on.

## Has this been exploited?

To the best of our current knowledge, there has been no known exploitation of this vulnerability. We audited our own systems, and were not able to find any malicious use of this.

## If I am running a fork, what should I do?

Reach out to help@metabase.com and we’ll walk you through patching your systems.

## Am I at risk?

If you are not on Metabase Cloud and you are running version X.43 of Metabase or later, you are at risk. Please upgrade immediately.

## I’m a Metabase Cloud customer, do I need to do anything?

You don’t need to do anything. We already fixed and patched your Metabase as soon as we knew about the vulnerability.
We have also audited network access to all customer instances and have not been able to find any non-pen test exploitation of this vulnerability.

## Will you release any information about the vulnerability?

Yes, we’ll be releasing the patch publicly, as well as a CVE and an explanation in two weeks. We’re delaying release to give our install base a bit of extra time before this is widely exploited.

Always write your analytics data to a separate DB in a periodically run job. Only store aggregated anonymized data in the analytics DB you expose to internal stakeholders via tools like Metabase. | | --- | --- | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  |  | [jimmytucson](user?id=jimmytucson) [on July 21, 2023](item?id=36816154)   | [parent](#36813757) | [next](#36813893) [–]  Also your production database is optimized for different workloads than your analytics database. Usually production is used for fetching and updating a small number of records at a time (think updating a shopping cart), and has strict latency requirements whereas analytics involves reading a large amount of data in columns (think count group by one or two columns), and can be done in batches where the results can get a more and more stale until the next batch runs. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [bingemaker](user?id=bingemaker) [on July 21, 2023](item?id=36817567)   | [root](#36813757) | [parent](#36816154) | [next](#36813893) [–]  How do you batch write the results (say updating shopping carts) when frontend has to reflect whats in the database? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [patmorgan23](user?id=patmorgan23) [on July 22, 2023](item?id=36822814)   | [root](#36813757) | [parent](#36817567) | [next](#36813893) [–]  They're talking about moving data between two different back end databases.

There are some considerations for late arriving data, which is a classic DE interview question, but for the most part, big nightly dumps of the last day’s data/transactions/snapshots to date-partitioned columnar stores using an orchestration engine like Airflow is sufficient for 99% of use cases. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [patmorgan23](user?id=patmorgan23) [on July 22, 2023](item?id=36822777)   | [root](#36813757) | [parent](#36817397) | [next](#36818666) [–]  Tangent: I hate OLTP and OLAP as acronyms.

Zero Trust does not mean: "No mor VPNs and private IP network ranges, everything is public. ::elitist hipster noises::" Zero Trust simply means: "Just \_because\_ you're on a private network [or coming from a known ip], doesn't mean you're authenticated." You should have every single one of your internal network services (like Metabase) behind a VPN like Wireguard or numerous other options. The sole purpose of this is to reduce your firewall log noise to a manageable level that can be reviewed by hand if necessary. Obviously this isn't perfect security, but that's the \_entire\_ point: every security researcher says security should be an onion, not a glass sphere; many layers of independent security. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [kevincox](user?id=kevincox) [on July 21, 2023](item?id=36812746)   | [prev](#36816336) | [next](#36812656) [–]  This is why I try to put everything behind NGINX with basic auth.

If you are network isolated or have a proxy in front of it, you can take the weekend off. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [MuffinFlavored](user?id=MuffinFlavored) [on July 21, 2023](item?id=36813272)   | [parent](#36812776) | [prev](#36813474) | [next](#36813810) [–]  How would an attacker exploit that? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [ac2u](user?id=ac2u) [on July 21, 2023](item?id=36813446)   | [root](#36812776) | [parent](#36813272) | [next](#36813810) [–]  A vulnerability (not necessarily this one, just hypothesising) could be exploited via a payload result from an outbound request to the internet. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [MuffinFlavored](user?id=MuffinFlavored) [on July 21, 2023](item?id=36813529)   | [root](#36812776) | [parent](#36813446) | [next](#36813810) [–]  I thought when the OP of this comment thread said locally they meant like, it isn't exposed to the Internet | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [ac2u](user?id=ac2u) [on July 21, 2023](item?id=36813749)   | [root](#36812776) | [parent](#36813529) | [next](#36813810) [–]  "exposed" as a word does a lot of heavy lifting here. When someone is asking me casually "hey, is this server exposed to the public internet"? I take it to mean "can someone connect to it in an inbound manner from the public internet?" If the answer is no, it doesn't necessarily mean that packets don't have other ways of making their way to the server, for example, a service running locally could have a webhook mechanism that fires events to an internet-accessible server whenever certain events happen. You might trust the services you're sending requests to as part of that, but they could become compromised and send exploits as a response. Other vulnerabilities could be services running locally but that reach out to the internet to check for updates... more surface area to exploit. If the OP was asking "I'm running this locally and I've set up my machine and firewalls to disallow any packets outside of the loopback interface", then the risk of the unpatched server is certainly reduced, but they could still be affected by another piece of software running on the same machine with internet access that is compromised first. Anything beyond an isolated machine with 100% air-gapping is theoretically at risk. Doesn't mean that the OP's question was a bad question or anything, they can use the answer to know how quickly they should worry about patching based on their own situation and risk tolerance. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [thomasfromcdnjs](user?id=thomasfromcdnjs) [on July 21, 2023](item?id=36820488)   | [root](#36812776) | [parent](#36813749) | [next](#36813810) [–]  Great answer btw.

AFAIK the container has network access and access to the mounted volumes and that's it right? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [JJJollyjim](user?id=JJJollyjim) [on July 21, 2023](item?id=36813779)   | [parent](#36813679) | [next](#36813751) [–]  Presumably the metabase instance also has credentials to access some databases, some of which may be have enough privileges to also get RCE on the database machines (as well as messing with the data they hold). | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [Dachande663](user?id=Dachande663) [on July 21, 2023](item?id=36813795)   | [root](#36813679) | [parent](#36813779) | [next](#36813751) [–]  We issue separate read-only credentials for database access fortunately.
