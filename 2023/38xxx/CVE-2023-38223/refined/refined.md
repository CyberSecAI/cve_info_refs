- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Access of uninitialized pointer
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability stems from accessing an uninitialized pointer, which can lead to unpredictable behavior and potential security issues.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution, allowing an attacker to potentially gain control of the affected system.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local (AV:L), meaning the attacker needs local access to the system. The attack requires user interaction (UI:R), meaning the user needs to perform an action to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have local access and needs the user to interact with the malicious content. The attacker does not require any special privileges (PR:N).
