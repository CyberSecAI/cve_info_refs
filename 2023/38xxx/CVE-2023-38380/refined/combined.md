| Last Update: | 2021-09-14 |
| Current Version: | V1.2 |
| CVSS v3.1 Base Score: | 9.8 |

SUMMARY

Several SCALANCE X switches contain vulnerabilities in the web server of the affected devices.

An unauthenticated attacker could reboot, cause denial-of-service conditions and potentially impact the system by other means through heap and buffer overflow vulnerabilities.

Siemens has released updates for several affected products and recommends to update to the latest versions. Siemens recommends specific countermeasures for products where updates are not, or not yet available.

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND SOLUTION

| Affected Product and Versions | Remediation |
| --- | --- |
| SCALANCE X-200 switch family (incl. SIPLUS NET variants): All versions < V5.2.5 | Update to V5.2.5 or later version <https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109801131/> |
| SCALANCE X-200IRT switch family (incl. SIPLUS NET variants): All versions < V5.5.0 | Update to V5.5.0 or later version <https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109792534/> |
| SCALANCE X-300 switch family (incl. X408 and SIPLUS NET variants): All versions < V4.1.0   only affected by CVE-2020-15800 | Update to V4.1.0 or later version <https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109773547/> |

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to reduce the risk:

* Limit network traffic of web servers of Scalance X switches to trusted connections by firewall rules (port 443/tcp).

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends to configure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial Security (Download: <https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security>), and to follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at: <https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity>

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SCALANCE X switches are used to connect industrial components like Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) or Human Machine Interfaces (HMIs).

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the same firmware as the product they are based on.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classification has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) ([https://www.first.org/cvss](https://www.first.org/cvss/)). The CVSS environmental score is specific to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually defined by the customer to accomplish final scoring.

An additional classification has been performed using the CWE classification, a community-developed
list of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identification, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found
at: <https://cwe.mitre.org/>.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-15799

The vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated attacker to reboot the device over the network by using special urls from integrated web server of the affected products.

| CVSS v3.1 Base Score | 7.5 |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS Vector | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C |
| CWE: | CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function |

Vulnerability CVE-2020-15800

The webserver of the affected devices contains a vulnerability that may lead to a heap overflow condition. An attacker could cause this condition on the webserver by sending specially crafted requests. This could stop the webserver temporarily.

| CVSS v3.1 Base Score | 9.8 |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS Vector | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:X/RC:C |
| CWE: | CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow |

Vulnerability CVE-2020-25226

The web server of the affected devices contains a vulnerability that may lead to a buffer overflow condition. An attacker could cause this condition on the webserver by sending a specially crafted request. The webserver could stop and not recover anymore.

| CVSS v3.1 Base Score | 9.8 |

Vulnerability CVE-2022-2097

AES OCB mode for 32-bit x86 platforms using the AES-NI assembly optimised implementation will not encrypt the entirety of the data under some circumstances. This could reveal sixteen bytes of data that was preexisting in the memory that wasn't written. In the special case of "in place" encryption, sixteen bytes of the plaintext would be revealed. Since OpenSSL does not support OCB based cipher suites for TLS and DTLS, they are both unaffected.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-3643

Guests can trigger NIC interface reset/abort/crash via netback It is possible for a guest to trigger a NIC interface reset/abort/crash in a Linux based network backend by sending certain kinds of packets. It appears to be an (unwritten?) assumption in the rest of the Linux network stack that packet protocol headers are all contained within the linear section of the SKB and some NICs behave badly if this is not the case. This has been reported to occur with Cisco (enic) and Broadcom NetXtrem II BCM5780 (bnx2x) though it may be an issue with other NICs/drivers as well. In case the frontend is sending requests with split headers, netback will forward those violating above mentioned assumption to the networking core, resulting in said misbehavior.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-4304

A timing based side channel exists in the OpenSSL RSA Decryption implementation which could be sufficient to recover a plaintext across a network in a Bleichenbacher style attack. To achieve a successful decryption an attacker would have to be able to send a very large number of trial messages for decryption. The vulnerability affects all RSA padding modes: PKCS#1 v1.5, RSA-OEAP and RSASVE. For example, in a TLS connection, RSA is commonly used by a client to send an encrypted pre-master secret to the server. An attacker that had observed a genuine connection between a client and a server could use this flaw to send trial messages to the server and record the time taken to process them. After a sufficiently large number of messages the attacker could recover the pre-master secret used for the original connection and thus be able to decrypt the application data sent over that connection.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-4450

The function PEM\_read\_bio\_ex() reads a PEM file from a BIO and parses and decodes the "name" (e.g. "CERTIFICATE"), any header data and the payload data. If the function succeeds then the "name\_out", "header" and "data" arguments are populated with pointers to buffers containing the relevant decoded data. The caller is responsible for freeing those buffers. It is possible to construct a PEM file that results in 0 bytes of payload data. In this case PEM\_read\_bio\_ex() will return a failure code but will populate the header argument with a pointer to a buffer that has already been freed. If the caller also frees this buffer then a double free will occur. This will most likely lead to a crash. This could be exploited by an attacker who has the ability to supply malicious PEM files for parsing to achieve a denial of service attack. The functions PEM\_read\_bio() and PEM\_read() are simple wrappers around PEM\_read\_bio\_ex() and therefore these functions are also directly affected. These functions are also called indirectly by a number of other OpenSSL functions including PEM\_X509\_INFO\_read\_bio\_ex() and SSL\_CTX\_use\_serverinfo\_file() which are also vulnerable. Some OpenSSL internal uses of these functions are not vulnerable because the caller does not free the header argument if PEM\_read\_bio\_ex() returns a failure code. These locations include the PEM\_read\_bio\_TYPE() functions as well as the decoders introduced in OpenSSL 3.0. The OpenSSL asn1parse command line application is also impacted by this issue.

Vulnerability CVE-2023-0215

The public API function BIO\_new\_NDEF is a helper function used for streaming ASN.1 data via a BIO. It is primarily used internally to OpenSSL to support the SMIME, CMS and PKCS7 streaming capabilities, but may also be called directly by end user applications. The function receives a BIO from the caller, prepends a new BIO\_f\_asn1 filter BIO onto the front of it to form a BIO chain, and then returns the new head of the BIO chain to the caller. Under certain conditions, for example if a CMS recipient public key is invalid, the new filter BIO is freed and the function returns a NULL result indicating a failure. However, in this case, the BIO chain is not properly cleaned up and the BIO passed by the caller still retains internal pointers to the previously freed filter BIO. If the caller then goes on to call BIO\_pop() on the BIO then a use-after-free will occur. This will most likely result in a crash. This scenario occurs directly in the internal function B64\_write\_ASN1() which may cause BIO\_new\_NDEF() to be called and will subsequently call BIO\_pop() on the BIO. This internal function is in turn called by the public API functions PEM\_write\_bio\_ASN1\_stream, PEM\_write\_bio\_CMS\_stream, PEM\_write\_bio\_PKCS7\_stream, SMIME\_write\_ASN1, SMIME\_write\_CMS and SMIME\_write\_PKCS7. Other public API functions that may be impacted by this include i2d\_ASN1\_bio\_stream, BIO\_new\_CMS, BIO\_new\_PKCS7, i2d\_CMS\_bio\_stream and i2d\_PKCS7\_bio\_stream. The OpenSSL cms and smime command line applications are similarly affected.

Vulnerability CVE-2023-0286

There is a type confusion vulnerability relating to X.400 address processing inside an X.509 GeneralName. X.400 addresses were parsed as an ASN1\_STRING but the public structure definition for GENERAL\_NAME incorrectly specified the type of the x400Address field as ASN1\_TYPE. This field is subsequently interpreted by the OpenSSL function GENERAL\_NAME\_cmp as an ASN1\_TYPE rather than an ASN1\_STRING. When CRL checking is enabled (i.e. the application sets the X509\_V\_FLAG\_CRL\_CHECK flag), this vulnerability may allow an attacker to pass arbitrary pointers to a memcmp call, enabling them to read memory contents or enact a denial of service. In most cases, the attack requires the attacker to provide both the certificate chain and CRL, neither of which need to have a valid signature. If the attacker only controls one of these inputs, the other input must already contain an X.400 address as a CRL distribution point, which is uncommon. As such, this vulnerability is most likely to only affect applications which have implemented their own functionality for retrieving CRLs over a network.

Vulnerability CVE-2023-0464

A security vulnerability has been identified in all supported versions of OpenSSL related to the verification of X.509 certificate chains that include policy constraints. Attackers may be able to exploit this vulnerability by creating a malicious certificate chain that triggers exponential use of computational resources, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack on affected systems.

Policy processing is disabled by default but can be enabled by passing the `-policy` argument to the command line utilities or by calling the `X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies()` function.

Vulnerability CVE-2023-0465

Applications that use a non-default option when verifying certificates may be
vulnerable to an attack from a malicious CA to circumvent certain checks.

Invalid certificate policies in leaf certificates are silently ignored by
OpenSSL and other certificate policy checks are skipped for that certificate.
A malicious CA could use this to deliberately assert invalid certificate policies
in order to circumvent policy checking on the certificate altogether.

Policy processing is disabled by default but can be enabled by passing
the `-policy` argument to the command line utilities or by calling the
`X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies()` function.

Vulnerability CVE-2023-0466

The function X509\_VERIFY\_PARAM\_add0\_policy() is documented to
implicitly enable the certificate policy check when doing certificate
verification. However the implementation of the function does not
enable the check which allows certificates with invalid or incorrect
policies to pass the certificate verification.

As suddenly enabling the policy check could break existing deployments it was
decided to keep the existing behavior of the X509\_VERIFY\_PARAM\_add0\_policy()
function.

Instead the applications that require OpenSSL to perform certificate
policy check need to use X509\_VERIFY\_PARAM\_set1\_policies() or explicitly
enable the policy check by calling X509\_VERIFY\_PARAM\_set\_flags() with
the X509\_V\_FLAG\_POLICY\_CHECK flag argument.

Certificate policy checks are disabled by default in OpenSSL and are not
commonly used by applications.

Vulnerability CVE-2023-29469

An issue was discovered in libxml2 before 2.10.4. When hashing empty dict strings in a crafted XML document, xmlDictComputeFastKey in dict.c can produce non-deterministic values, leading to various logic and memory errors, such as a double free. This behavior occurs because there is an attempt to use the first byte of an empty string, and any value is possible (not solely the '\0' value).
