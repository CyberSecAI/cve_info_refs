**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Out-of-bounds Read (CWE-125)

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read, meaning the software attempts to access memory outside of the allocated buffer. This can lead to a memory leak, where the contents of unauthorized memory locations are exposed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Memory Leak:** Successful exploitation can result in a memory leak, potentially exposing sensitive data residing in the process's memory space.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is local (AV:L), meaning an attacker needs to have local access to the vulnerable system.
- The attack requires user interaction (UI:R), implying a user must perform an action (e.g., opening a malicious file) that triggers the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs local access to the system.
- The attacker needs to convince a user to perform an action that triggers the vulnerability.
