- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper sanitization of user input in the `adminname` field within the admin panel of the Cyber Cafe Management System v1.0.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the admin user's session, potentially leading to account takeover or system manipulation.
- **Attack vectors**: Local attacker can exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to log in as an admin and navigate to the "Manage Admins" section to inject malicious code through the `adminname` field.
