Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2023-38075:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a use-after-free error. This occurs when the application attempts to access memory that has already been freed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
Use-after-free (CWE-416)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.

**Attack Vectors:**
The vulnerability is triggered when the application parses specially crafted WRL files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious WRL file with a vulnerable application. This suggests a need for user interaction (UI:R) and a local attack vector (AV:L). No special privileges are required (PR:N).

**Affected Products:**
*   Siemens JT2Go
*   Siemens Teamcenter Visualization
*   Siemens Tecnomatix Plant Simulation

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is referenced as ZDI-CAN-20842.
*   The CVSS v3.1 base score is 7.8 with the vector string: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C
*   Siemens recommends updating to the latest versions of the affected products to remediate this vulnerability.
*   A workaround for Tecnomatix Plant Simulation is to avoid opening untrusted WRL files.
