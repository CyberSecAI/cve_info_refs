Based on the provided information, I was unable to retrieve the CVE description. After analyzing the rest of the content, here is what I found:

The content consists of two parts:

1.  **packetstormsecurity.com:** This appears to be a website with sections for files, news, users, and CVEs. It also includes links to "About," "Terms," "Copyright," and "Privacy" pages, as well as social media links.

2.  **forums.ivanti.com:** This seems to be an Ivanti forum page that is experiencing a CSS error and prompting the user to refresh.

Neither of these snippets provides any information related to CVE-2023-38035 or any other CVE. Therefore, it is not possible to extract vulnerability details.
