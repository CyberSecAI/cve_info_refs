  "CVE-2023-38908": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The provided content describes a vulnerability related to the lack of randomness during symmetric encryption in TP-Link Tapo smart devices. This vulnerability is assigned CVE-2023-38908.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The Initialization Vectors (IVs) used by the Tapo app and smart bulb are static, and each communication session uses a single, fixed IV for each message.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation (CWE-1240) in the Tapo L503E allows an adjacent attacker to make the cryptographic scheme deterministic."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can distinguish repeated messages without deciphering them, and infer what messages lead to what consequences, such as turning the bulb off. They can then manipulate the bulb by repeating those messages.  An attacker can also replay messages and operate the device, potentially leading to a Denial-of-Service attack.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Adjacent network access"
      ],
     "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be within the adjacent network of the target device and have the ability to intercept and replay network traffic. No special privileges are required, but user interaction with the smart device is necessary to generate the traffic to be analyzed and replayed."
