  "CVE-2023-38633": {
    "Description": "Multiple NetApp products incorporate librsvg. librsvg versions 2.56.0 prior to 2.56.3, 2.55.0 prior to 2.55.3, 2.54.0 prior to 2.54.6, 2.52.0 prior to 2.52.10, 2.50.0 prior to 2.50.8, 2.48.0 prior to 2.48.11, and prior to 2.46.6 are susceptible to a vulnerability which when successfully exploited could lead to disclosure of sensitive information.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to a mismatch in how URLs are parsed within the librsvg library. The `UrlResolver::resolve_href()` method uses one parser to validate URLs, while the method that actually loads content uses a different parser. This discrepancy allows an attacker to bypass security checks and include arbitrary files by crafting a malicious URL with special characters.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Inconsistent URL parsing logic",
      "Path traversal vulnerability via crafted URLs",
        "Improper validation of URLs leading to path traversal"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information by reading arbitrary files from the local file system.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious SVG file, which uses the `xi:include` element with a specially crafted URL in the href attribute. This URL can contain path traversal sequences to access files outside the intended directory.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious SVG file to an application using a vulnerable version of librsvg.",
      "details": [
        "The vulnerability exists within the librsvg library, specifically when processing external URL references in SVG files (such as `<image href>` or `<xi:include href>`).",
        "The `url_resolver.resolve_href` method implements security checks to restrict file access, such as: matching schemes,  files in same directory or subdirectory as the current document and rejecting other schemes.",
         "The validation step uses Rust's `url` crate, while the loading step uses GIO's URI parser (GFile::for_uri) which causes the vulnerability due to parsing mismatches."
