- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the use of a symmetric key encryption algorithm to encrypt OpenPages user passwords used in Native authentication. This algorithm is susceptible to certain malicious attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The weakness lies in the use of a symmetric key encryption algorithm for password storage, which is less secure than one-way hashing algorithms like PBKDF2. This allows for potential compromise of user passwords if the encryption key is exposed.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow unauthorized access to accounts and potentially lead to privilege escalation within the system.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves exploiting the weak symmetric key encryption algorithm used for storing user passwords within IBM OpenPages native authentication mechanism.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need to gain access to the encrypted passwords and the encryption key.
