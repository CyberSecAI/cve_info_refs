When the Node.js policy feature checks the integrity of a resource against a trusted manifest, the application can intercept the operation and return a forged checksum to the node's policy implementation, thus effectively disabling the integrity check.
Impacts:
This vulnerability affects all users using the experimental policy mechanism in all active release lines: 18.x and, 20.x.
Please note that at the time this CVE was issued, the policy mechanism is an experimental feature of Node.js.
