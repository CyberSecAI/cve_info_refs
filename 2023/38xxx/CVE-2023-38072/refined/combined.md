SSA-278349: Multiple WRL File Parsing Vulnerabilities in Teamcenter
Visualization and JT2Go

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 7.8

2023-09-12

V1.0

SUMMARY

Siemens JT2Go and Teamcenter Visualization are affected by ﬁle parsing vulnerabilities that could be
triggered when the application reads ﬁles in WRL format. If a user is tricked to open a malicious ﬁle with
any of the affected products, this could lead the application to crash or potentially lead to arbitrary code
execution.

Siemens has released updates for several affected products and recommends to update to the latest
versions. Siemens recommends countermeasures for products where updates are not, or not yet
available.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by
Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

JT2Go is a 3D JT viewing tool to allow users to view JT, PDF, Solid Edge, PLM XML with available JT,
VFZ, CGM, and TIF data.

Teamcenter Visualization software enables enterprises to enhance their product lifecycle management
(PLM) environment with a comprehensive family of visualization solutions. The software enables enter-
prise users to access documents, 2D drawings and 3D models in a single environment.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Tecnomatix Plant Simulation allows you to model, simulate, explore and optimize logistics systems and
their processes. These models enable analysis of material flow, resource utilization and logistics for all
levels of manufacturing planning from global production facilities to local plants and specific lines, well in
advance of production execution.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classification has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.first.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is specific to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually defined by the customer to accomplish final scoring.

An additional classification has been performed using the CWE classification, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identification, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
