    "information": {
      "root_cause": "The `get_query()` function in OpenNDS does not properly validate the length of the query string parameters received in GET requests. It uses `strlen()` to determine the length of the parameter value, which allows an attacker to control the length by inserting null bytes. Then copies the parameter to a fixed-size stack buffer. This leads to a buffer overflow if the length exceeds the buffer's capacity.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Stack-based buffer overflow.",
         "Insufficient input validation.",
          "Use of `strlen` to calculate the size of the input data.",
          "Unsafe memory copy operation."
      ],
       "impact": "An attacker can overwrite data on the stack, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or a denial of service.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Sending a crafted GET request with a long query string parameter, without embedded null bytes before overflowing the stack buffer.",
        "Send an HTTP GET request to the openNDS captive portal with a query string parameter longer than 8192 bytes.",
          "Exploiting the lack of PIE by using ROP (return-oriented programming) to gain code execution."

        "required_attacker_capabilities": [
        "Network access to the openNDS captive portal, either through the local network or by being in range of the WiFi network.",

     "additional_details": "The provided content contains additional details than the official CVE description. Specifically, it describes the exploitation process, such as leaking addresses and utilizing gadgets for code execution. It also mentions that the same vulnerability exists in the NoDogSplash project and describes that version 9.x is affected by a stack-based buffer overflow, while 10.x and onward are affected by a heap-based one. Finally, it describes the limitations of the exploit, due to the use of `strlen()` and the lack of PIE, and how to bypass them."
