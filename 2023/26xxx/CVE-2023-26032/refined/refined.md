- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application trusts the username field within a JWT token when performing an SQL query to load the user. This allows an attacker who can determine the HASH key used by ZoneMinder to generate a malicious JWT token and execute arbitrary SQL.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, leading to potential data breaches, data modification, and denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack via crafted JWT tokens.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to determine the HASH key used by ZoneMinder to forge malicious JWT tokens. No user interaction is needed, and no special privileges are required for the attack.
