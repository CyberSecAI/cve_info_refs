Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of sanitization of user-provided input when creating or editing modules. Specifically, the `main.vue` file within a module can be edited by a user, allowing the injection of malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The ability to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the `main.vue` file leads to a stored XSS vulnerability. This means the malicious script is stored on the server and executed when other users access the module.
- Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWH): The vulnerability description also mentions that by exploiting the XSS, attackers can interact with the WebSocket server using a valid origin, potentially bypassing origin checks. This is due to a missing origin check at a specific location in the code (`pkg/app/api/server/proto/proto.go#L111`).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Code Execution: Successful XSS exploitation can lead to arbitrary JavaScript code execution within the context of the victim's browser.
- Privilege Escalation: The attacker can potentially affect higher-privileged users by executing malicious code within their sessions.
- Data Theft/Manipulation: Attackers could potentially steal sensitive data or manipulate data related to the application, since the XSS vulnerability allows for interaction with the application's backend services through WebSocket hijacking using valid origin, due to the missing origin check.

**Attack vectors:**
-  Editing the main.vue file of a module via the application interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Low-privileged user access to the application with the ability to create or edit modules.
- Ability to insert malicious Javascript into the main.vue file.

**Additional details from the content:**
- The issue was reported by user `artemy-ccrsky` on February 8, 2023.
- The affected component is related to module creation and editing within the `soldr` project.
- The description includes steps to reproduce the vulnerability: creating/editing a module, adding a JavaScript `alert("xss")` within a `<script>` tag inside the `main.vue` file, and then opening the module.
- The vulnerable code point for websocket connection is mentioned.
- The user mentions a potential impact of low privilege user affecting high privilege users.
- The content indicates that a fix for the issue was not present in the diff between `v1.1.0` and `v1.2.0`.
