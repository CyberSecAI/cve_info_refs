The provided content includes information related to CVE-2023-26509.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the abuse of the AnyDesk discovery service, which operates on UDP port 50001.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The AnyDesk discovery service on UDP port 50001 is susceptible to abuse. Specifically, an attacker can leverage this service to perform a Distributed Reflection Denial of Service (DRDoS) attack. The amplification factor of the attack is approximately 33.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation leads to a DRDoS attack. In a network with multiple AnyDesk clients, the amplification factor can be further increased by sending packets to a specific multicast IP. This could result in significant disruption of services to the target.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves sending specially crafted packets to the AnyDesk discovery service on UDP port 50001.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs the ability to send UDP packets to the AnyDesk discovery service (port 50001). This suggests the attacker needs to be on a network that can reach systems running the vulnerable version of AnyDesk, or be able to spoof source IPs. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
