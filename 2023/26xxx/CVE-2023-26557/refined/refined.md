Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-26557:

**CVE-2023-26557: Non-Constant Time Scalar Multiplication**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The implementation of scalar multiplication for the secp256k1 curve is not performed in constant time. This means the execution time of the operation can vary depending on the input values.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    *   **Timing Side-Channel**: Non-constant time operations leak information about the inputs through variations in execution time.
    *   Specifically, the scalar multiplication for the secp256k1 curve is vulnerable to timing attacks.
*   **Impact of exploitation**:
    *   **Private Key Leakage**: An attacker can potentially deduce the private key data by analyzing the execution time of cryptographic operations.
    *   **Forged Signatures**: With knowledge of the private key, an attacker could forge signatures.
    *   **Unauthorized Transactions**: Attackers can manipulate transactions without authorization.
    *   **Loss of Sensitive Data**: Attackers can steal sensitive information protected by the cryptographic scheme.
*   **Attack vectors**:
    *   **Timing analysis**: Attacker measures the time taken for the scalar multiplication operation to complete. The attacker analyzes the timing differences to infer private key information.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    *   Attacker needs the ability to measure precise timing information of the vulnerable scalar multiplication operations.
    *   Attacker needs to be able to induce the vulnerable operations with chosen inputs, or observe the timing of operations performed by the vulnerable system.

**Additional Details**
* The vulnerability exists within the TSS-Lib library, which is used for implementing threshold signature schemes (TSS) for ECDSA and EdDSA.
* The fix involves replacing the non-constant time scalar multiplication function with a constant-time version.
* The provided content references "Montgomery Ladder Point Multiplication" as a technique to achieve constant-time scalar multiplication.
* This vulnerability is similar to CVE-2023â€“26556, which involves non-constant time arithmetic within the Go language's `big.Int` operations.
