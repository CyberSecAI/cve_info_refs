Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-26046:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `teler-waf`'s failure to properly sanitize and filter HTML entities within user inputs. Specifically, before version v0.1.1, `teler-waf` did not unescape HTML entities present in the request URI and body before performing threat checks. This allowed attackers to bypass the web attack rules by encoding malicious payloads as HTML entities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper Input Sanitization: The core weakness is the lack of proper decoding and unescaping of HTML entities in user-supplied data (request URI and body).
- Bypass of Security Checks:  By using HTML entities, attackers can successfully bypass the common web attack threat rules that the middleware is designed to enforce.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary impact is the ability to launch XSS attacks. Attackers can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code on the victim's browser.
- Data Theft: Exploitation could lead to the theft of sensitive data such as login credentials and session tokens.
- Browser Control: Attackers could potentially take control of the victim's browser to perform malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP Requests: The attack vector involves sending crafted HTTP requests with malicious payloads encoded as HTML entities. These payloads can be placed in the request URI or the request body.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application protected by the `teler-waf` middleware.
- No specific privilege is needed; an attacker can exploit the vulnerability through a standard web request.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was patched in version v0.1.1 of `teler-waf` by adding a function to unescape HTML entities before performing checks.
- The vulnerability was reported by Aidil Arief ([@aidilarf](https://github.com/aidilarf)).
- The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-80 (Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)).
