  "cve": "CVE-2023-26489",
  "extracted_information": {
    "root_cause": "A bug in Cranelift's x86_64 backend caused incorrect address computation. When a WebAssembly address is left-shifted by a constant amount (1 to 3), the shift is folded into x86_64 addressing modes. The issue is that the address computation happens with 64-bit values instead of truncating the 32-bit shift result to 32-bits. This results in a 35-bit effective address calculation instead of the correct 33-bit calculation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-125",
      "CWE-787"
    ],
    "impact": "A guest WebAssembly module can perform out-of-bounds reads and writes within approximately 34GB of the linear memory base. This could allow malicious modules to read or write memory belonging to other WebAssembly instances or the embedder, depending on memory layout. This arbitrary read/write is not semantically correct, and could cause a silent arbitrary read/write or, at best, a normal WebAssembly trap.",
    "attack_vectors": "A malicious WebAssembly module can exploit the incorrect address calculation through a load or store instruction involving a left shift of a 32-bit address.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to control the WebAssembly code being executed. No special privileges or user interaction are required, however."
