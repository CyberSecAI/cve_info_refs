{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `extend` function in `rangy-core.js` performs a recursive merge without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to modify properties of `Object.prototype` via a crafted `__proto__` property in the source object.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Prototype Pollution"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject properties into the `Object.prototype`, which can lead to denial of service by triggering JavaScript exceptions, remote code execution if specific attributes are evaluated and executed, or property injection to manipulate application behavior (e.g., privilege escalation)",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "By crafting a JSON object with a `__proto__` property and using it as an argument to the vulnerable `extend` function."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to influence the input of the `extend` function. This could be achieved by manipulating data that is passed to the function or controlling the JSON parsing mechanism.",
        "details": "The vulnerability arises from the use of an unsafe recursive merge function. If the attacker provides a source object with a `__proto__` property defined with `Object.defineProperty()`, the function will recursively merge the properties, thus polluting the `Object` prototype. This pollution affects all JavaScript objects through the prototype chain, leading to various attack vectors depending on the application's use of modified or newly created properties. The provided proof of concept demonstrates how setting the `test` property on `__proto__` of a crafted JSON object leads to the pollution of the Object prototype where `{}.test` then becomes defined."
