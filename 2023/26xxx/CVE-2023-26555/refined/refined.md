{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `praecis_parse` function in `ntpd/refclock_palisade.c` has an out-of-bounds write vulnerability due to insufficient input validation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow",
      "Out-of-bounds Write",
      "Insufficient input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can cause a denial of service by sending specially crafted packets to the NTP server. Code execution may also be possible, but is not confirmed by all sources.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "Remote network attack",
        "Manipulated GPS receiver (physical access or compromised host)"
      ],
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send malicious data to a vulnerable ntpd server. In the case of the GPS receiver exploit, physical access to the device, or the ability to compromise a host with firmware update capability."
  },
  "additional_details": {
    "mstolfp_issues": "The issue is related to the `mstolfp()` function, which has multiple potential overflow locations due to missing length checks. Although initially reported as separate CVEs, it is clarified that these are variations of the same underlying issue in `mstolfp()` related to missing length checks.",
    "ntpq_vs_ntpd": "The first four CVEs (CVE-2023-26551, CVE-2023-26552, CVE-2023-26553, and CVE-2023-26554) primarily affect `ntpq`, not `ntpd`. The `mstolfp` function is used by `ntpq` to parse data from the server. A MITM attacker can craft a response to `ntpq -c rv` containing a floating point value that will cause an overflow when parsed by the problematic function. The `-c raw` option can be used as a workaround.",
    "palisade_driver": "The CVE-2023-26555 vulnerability affects the `refclock_palisade.c` driver, specifically with the `praecis_parse()` function. This driver is for specific (old) GPS devices, and is only used if a palisade GPS receiver is explicitly configured in ntp.conf. The `praecis_parse()` function only processes data from the TTY received from the GPS receiver, not from network data. The vulnerability can be triggered if the GPS receiver is manipulated to send overlong lines to the driver, requiring physical access or a compromised host with serial firmware update capability.",
    "patch_info": "A minimal patch for the `mstolfp()` vulnerability involves adding a length check at the start of the function. Version 4.2.8p16 of NTP includes fixes for this vulnerability, with 4.2.8p17 addressing a regression introduced in the prior release.",
        "mitre_response": "MITRE declined to mark CVEs 2023-26552, 2023-26553 and 2023-26554 as duplicates of CVE-2023-26551, stating that they do not change the level of abstraction after CVE records are published. They did update the CVE descriptions to reflect the `ntpq` issue for the first four CVEs and the manipulated GPS receiver attack vector for CVE-2023-26555."
