Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-26470

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way XWiki handles object numbers within a document. When an object is created with a very large object number, the system attempts to store null entries for all object numbers that do not have an associated object. This can lead to excessive memory allocation, as each null entry requires a 64-bit pointer, consuming significant memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory exhaustion:** The primary vulnerability is the potential for out-of-memory (OOM) errors due to the storage of numerous null entries. This occurs when a large object number is used, resulting in the system allocating memory for a large number of non-existent objects.
- **Inefficient Data Storage:** Using a list-like structure with null entries to store objects is inefficient and consumes unnecessary memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploiting this vulnerability can lead to a denial of service. By adding an object with a huge number to a document, an attacker can cause the XWiki instance to run out of memory and become unusable. This impacts not just the manipulated document but the whole farm since the memory is exhausted by this action.
- **Persistent Unusability:** Once a document has been manipulated, it can render the XWiki instance unusable every time the document is accessed. This is because any action to display or modify the document requires loading a copy of the document into memory, which quickly triggers the OOM error.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack can be performed remotely by an attacker with network access to the XWiki instance.
- **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited through the web interface by manipulating the HTML code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Privilege:** The attacker needs low privileges to edit and save a document.
- **User Interaction:** The attack requires user interaction to modify the object editor and insert malicious data into the object number.
- **Knowledge of Web Tools:** The attacker needs to know how to modify the HTML code using web developer tools to inject the large object number.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when creating an object with a very large object number (e.g., 67108863).
-  The system attempts to store null entries for all object numbers that don't have a corresponding object.
- Each null entry consumes a 64-bit pointer in memory, leading to large memory consumption per copy of the document.
- The fix involves using a `Map<Integer, BaseObject>` to store objects and optimizing the list operations.
- The vulnerability is addressed in XWiki version 14.0-rc-1.

**Additional Notes:**
- The issue is tracked in XWiki's Jira as XWIKI-19223.
- The fix includes changes to `BaseObjects.java`, which uses a map to avoid storing null entries, and updates to `XWikiDocument.java` to use the new `BaseObjects` implementation.
- The provided content includes the commit history, showcasing the code changes related to the fix for this vulnerability, specifically the introduction of the `BaseObjects` class which uses a map.
- The CVSS score is 5.7 with vector string `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H`
- CWE-400 is identified as the weakness.
