- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Use After Free
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A use-after-free vulnerability exists in Adobe Substance 3D Designer.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, requiring user interaction (i.e., opening a malicious file).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to craft a malicious file that exploits the use-after-free vulnerability. The attacker needs a user to open the malicious file locally.
