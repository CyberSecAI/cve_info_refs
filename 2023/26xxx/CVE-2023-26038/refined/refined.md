- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the `web/ajax/modal.php` file where an arbitrary PHP file path can be passed through the 'modal' request parameter and included using `include('modals/'.$modal.'.php')`. The `$modal` variable is passed through `validJsStr` before being used in the include statement, however, this does not prevent local file inclusion.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Local File Inclusion (LFI). The application allows an attacker to include arbitrary local files by manipulating the 'modal' parameter.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially read sensitive files on the server, execute arbitrary PHP code if they can upload a malicious file, or perform other attacks allowed by the included file. This can result in confidentiality and integrity breaches.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based. An attacker can send a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable `web/ajax/modal.php` file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to make network requests to the vulnerable server, and be logged in as a low privilege user.
