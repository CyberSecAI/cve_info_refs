The provided content is related to CVE-2023-26806.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a stack-based buffer overflow in the `formSetSysTime` function of the Tenda W20E router firmware. Specifically, the `sscanf` function is used to parse the `manualTime` parameter into separate year, month, day, hour, minute, and second values without any size validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow: The `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`, `min`, and `sec` variables are stored on the stack and have a fixed size of 8 bytes each. If the `manualTime` parameter contains a string with a component (e.g., year) that exceeds the capacity of its corresponding buffer, a buffer overflow occurs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): A buffer overflow can overwrite critical data on the stack, leading to crashes and denial of service.
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): By carefully crafting the overflow data, an attacker could potentially overwrite return addresses on the stack and achieve remote code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request: The vulnerability is triggered when a user makes an HTTP POST request to the `goform/setSysTime` endpoint with the vulnerable `manualTime` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable router. This could be an attacker on the same network or someone who can access the router's web interface remotely.
- The attacker needs to be able to authenticate to the router to send the malicious HTTP POST request, implying they need valid credentials.
