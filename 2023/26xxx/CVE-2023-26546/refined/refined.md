Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2023-26546:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) flaw. This occurs because the IUCLID application improperly handles user-uploaded report template files, allowing for the execution of arbitrary code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server. This could lead to a complete compromise of the application and the server it is running on.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the upload of a specially crafted report template file.
- This is a remote attack and exploitable over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be an authenticated user.
- The attacker must have "template manager" permission within the IUCLID application.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is considered critical.
- The vulnerability is present in IUCLID 6 Server and Desktop versions 5.15.0 up to 6.27.5.
- The recommended resolution is to update to IUCLID version 6.27.6.
- Workarounds/mitigations include: removing the template manager permission from users, running IUCLID with a dedicated OS account with minimal privileges, monitoring for unusual custom reports and log file entries, and restricting network access to the IUCLID application.
