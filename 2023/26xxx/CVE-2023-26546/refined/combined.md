Cloud, Desktop or Server - which version of IUCLID is best for me?

IUCLID 6 is available in three different versions. These provide the same main functionalities, but are designed to cater to different sets of user requirements.

**IUCLID 6 ECHA Cloud services**

A IUCLID Cloud service is provided by the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) for preparing dossiers under REACH and CLP; and notifications for Poison Centres and SCIP. Companies and their consultants are encouraged to use the cloud service as it means they no longer have to install IUCLID locally on a computer, but will have direct access to the latest version in a web browser – anytime, anywhere. The service comes with up to 5 GB of data storage, fully managed backups and dedicated helpdesk support, at no charge. Go to [ECHA Cloud Services](https://echa.europa.eu/support/dossier-submission-tools/echa-cloud-services).

**IUCLID 6 Desktop**

In IUCLID 6 Desktop, IUCLID 6 runs on a single machine. One user accesses one database, with no network connection necessary. There can be more than one user account for the installation, but only one user uses the installation at a time. The database is integrated into the IUCLID 6 application. There is no need to install database software separately. The installation process, maintenance and upgrades are designed to be as simple as possible. This is aimed at SMEs, and those who simply want to try out the software.

**IUCLID 6 Server**

In IUCLID 6 Server, IUCLID 6 runs in an application server. A user connects to the application over a network using a client program that can be run on any machine that has network access to the server. Many users can access the same instance of the application and therefore the database, at the same time. Access to documents can be restricted per document, per user, and per groups of users. The database software can be installed separately from the IUCLID 6 application server and client(s). This type of installation is intended for use by larger companies and organisations.

IUCLID 6 Server is marked out from IUCLID 6 Desktop visually by having a grey ring around the orange icon.

IUCLID 6 installer and updater - which one should I download?

In case **you already have IUCLID 6** and want to upgrade to the latest version available, please download the IUCLID 6 updater.

If **you do not have IUCLID 6 yet**, please download the IUCLID 6 Desktop version installer or the IUCLID 6 Server installation package.

The latest version of IUCLID 6, as published for all users on this website, is **8****.13.3**. Instances in the ECHA Cloud Services (ECS) have been upgraded to **8.13.4**. The version of IUCLID 6 is stated in its interface in the main menu under *About*.
### Release notes

### Data extraction and search tools for IUCLID

In addition to the IUCLID software itself, additional tools can be downloaded to be used in connection with a IUCLID installation. These tools extend the IUCLID features that are provided by default:

* [Text Analytics:](/text-analytics) this is a powerful search engine for IUCLID data, and attachments within IUCLID documents.
* [Data Extractor:](/data-extractor) this tool helps you to extract information from dossiers stored in your IUCLID database.
* [Data Uploader Knime plug-in](/data-uploader): this tool helps transform sources of chemical information to the IUCLID format.

### Data transfer tool

* A standalone command line tool is available for moving existing IUCLID installations to a different database. This tool is primarily meant to support the transfer of existing IUCLID databases from Derby or Oracle to PostgreSQL, supported since April 2022. You can download the tool from [this page](/data-transfer-tool).

### Patches and test versions

* Patches made available by the IUCLID Helpdesk and test versions can be downloaded from [this page](/patchesandtesting). Please pay attention to the usage restrictions that apply.

IUCLID 6 – Notes on vulnerabilities fixed in version 6.27.6

Page | 3

1. Introduction

Multiple vulnerabilities in IUCLID 6 application were privately reported to ECHA.
IUCLID 6 version 6.27.6 is available to remediate all these vulnerabilities.

2. Vulnerabilities

2.1. Authentication bypass vulnerability (CVE-2023-26089)

2.1.1. Description

A vulnerability exists in IUCLID 6 application that allows an attacker to bypass the
authentication and have an unauthorised access to an IUCLID instance. Because a weak
hard coded secret is used to sign the authentication token (JWT), an attacker could have
unauthorised access to any affected IUCLID instances as any valid user. The vulnerability
can be exploited over network in case the attacker has network access to the IUCLID 6
application.

Please note that versions older than 6.27.1 are also affected even if the hard coded
secret in those versions is stronger. The vulnerability has been fixed in version 6.27.6.

2.1.2. Affected versions and severity

IUCLID Version

Severity

IUCLID 6 Server versions 6.27.1 – 6.27.5
IUCLID 6 Server versions 5.15.0 – 6.27.0
IUCLID 6 Desktop versions 5.15.0 – 6.27.5

Critical
High
High

2.1.3. Resolution

Update IUCLID to version 6.27.6.

2.1.4. Workarounds and mitigations

1.  For versions 6.27.1 – 6.27.5: change the jwt signing secret by executing the

following steps on the system where IUCLID 6 is installed

a.  start IUCLID 6
b.  go to the <iuclid6-installation>/payara5/glassfish/bin folder
c.  execute the command: asadmin update-password-alias iuclid6-idp-

secret

i.

if the command fails with "Password alias for the alias iuclid6-idp-
secret does not exist." then execute the command: asadmin
create-password-alias iuclid6-idp-secret

ii.   the command will prompt the user to enter the password twice.

d.  execute the command: asadmin create-system-properties --

target=server-config eu.echa.iuclid6.idp.secret=${ALIAS=iuclid6-
idp-secret}
e.  Restart IUCLID6

2.  Limit network access to the IUCLID application. Particularly, ensure that
IUCLID is not available directly from the Internet. In case a necessary
reason to access IUCLID from outside of your internal network exists, then
provide such access via VPN or by using another secure remote access solution.

3.  Exploitation can be identified by monitoring unusual records in audit_iuclid6.log

IUCLID 6 – Notes on vulnerabilities fixed in version 6.27.6

Page | 4

and user_actions_iuclid6.log log files (in <iuclid6-install-folder>
\payara5\glassfish\domains\domain1\logs\iuclid6)

2.2. Server-side Template Injection (SSTI) Vulnerability (CVE-
2023-26546)

2.2.1. Description

A vulnerability in IUCLID application allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code by
uploading a special crafted report template file. The vulnerability can be exploited
remotely over network by an authenticated user with template manager permission.

2.2.2. Affected versions and severity

IUCLID 6 Server & Desktop versions 5.15.0 - 6.27.5

Critical

IUCLID Version

Severity

2.2.3. Resolution

Update IUCLID to the version 6.27.6.

2.2.4. Workarounds and mitigations

1.  Remove the template manager permission from users.

2.  Impact of successful exploitation can be mitigated by running IUCLID application

with a dedicated operating system account without any unnecessary privileges.

3.  Potential exploitation can be identified by checking if any report template file has

been uploaded:

a.  The easiest is to check if there are any suspicious custom reports via the

IUCLID user interface: Main menu -> Manage Reports

b.  In addition, one could check the user_actions_iuclid6.log (in <iuclid6-
install-folder> \payara5\glassfish\domains\domain1\logs\iuclid6) for
entries with pattern: “TemplateLoader <report-name> has been
registered”

4.  Limit network access to IUCLID application. Particularly, ensure that IUCLID
is not available directly from the Internet. In case a necessary reason to
access IUCLID from outside of your internal network exists, then provide such
access via VPN or by using another secure remote access solution.

2.3. Cross site scripting (XSS) vulnerability

2.3.1. Description

A reflected XSS vulnerability has been identified in the IUCLID application. The
vulnerability allows to run a malicious script on a client device, but exploitation requires
user interaction. Thus, an attacker must convince a user to act, typically by clicking a
crafted link.

2.3.2. Affected versions and severity

IUCLID Version

Severity

IUCLID Server versions 5.15.0 - 6.27.5
IUCLID Desktop versions 5.15.0 - 6.27.5

Moderate
Low

2.3.3. Resolution

Update IUCLID to the version 6.27.6.

2.3.4. Workarounds and mitigations

There are no known workarounds for this issue.
