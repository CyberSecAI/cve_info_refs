Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2023-26360:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Deserialization of untrusted data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the way Adobe ColdFusion handles deserialization of untrusted data (CWE-502). This can allow an attacker to inject malicious serialized data, which, when deserialized, can lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to arbitrary code execution on the server. This means an attacker can potentially gain full control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is network-based (AV:N). This means an attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely over a network.
*   The attack complexity is low (AC:L), meaning it's relatively easy to exploit.
*   No privileges are required (PR:N), meaning an attacker doesn't need any prior authentication or user-level access to exploit this.
*   No user interaction is required (UI:N).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to send malicious data to a vulnerable ColdFusion server. They do not need to be authenticated or have any special privileges on the target system.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was actively exploited in the wild in limited attacks targeting Adobe ColdFusion.
*   Adobe recommends applying updates to ColdFusion 2018 and 2021 and setting specific JVM flags as outlined in the bulletin. The bulletin also recommends updating the JDK/JRE to the latest LTS version and applying the security configuration settings.
*  The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 8.6 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N), which indicates a high severity vulnerability.
