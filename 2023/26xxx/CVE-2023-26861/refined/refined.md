Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-26861:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the improper neutralization of several SQL parameters within the `vivawallet` module for PrestaShop. Specifically, the module uses unsanitized input (specifically `$_GET['s']` and `$OrderCode`) directly in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The module is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks due to the lack of proper sanitization of input parameters before using them in SQL queries. This affects the `fail.php`, `success.php`, and `webhook.php` front controllers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to:

*   **Admin Access Compromise:** Attackers can potentially gain unauthorized access to the PrestaShop admin panel.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can remove or modify data within the PrestaShop database.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** Attackers can copy sensitive data from the database, potentially exposing tokens and admin ajax scripts.
*   **Email Hijacking:** Attackers could potentially rewrite SMTP settings, allowing them to intercept and control emails.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, meaning the attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely.
*   **PrestaShop Front Controllers:** The vulnerability resides in the module's front controllers (`fail.php`, `success.php`, and `webhook.php`). These controllers are accessible via the web, making them easily exploitable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need any prior privileges or user accounts on the PrestaShop instance to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **No User Interaction Required:** The attacker can trigger the vulnerability without requiring any interaction from legitimate users.
*   **Concealed Exploit Path:** Attackers can conceal the module's controller path during the exploit, making it difficult to detect in conventional frontend logs. The logs will only show "POST /".
*   **Knowledge of vulnerable module:**  Attackers need to know the vulnerable module exists in the target's installation.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability exists in versions of the `vivawallet` module prior to 1.7.9.
*   The module was removed from Github on Oct 19, 2022.
*   The provided patches use the `pSQL()` function to sanitize input before using it in database queries.
*   The advisory recommends removing the vulnerable module and installing `vivawalletsmartcheckout` instead.
*   Other recommendations include upgrading PrestaShop, changing the database prefix and using a web application firewall.

This vulnerability is considered critical due to its high impact and ease of exploitation.
