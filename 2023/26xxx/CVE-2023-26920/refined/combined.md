## Druid ingestion system Authenticated users can read data from other sources than intended

[Dependabot alerts
0](/advisories/GHSA-793h-6f7r-6qvm/dependabot)

## Package

maven

org.apache.druid:druid-core
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

< 0.21.0

## Patched versions

0.21.0

## Description

In the Druid ingestion system, the InputSource is used for reading data from a certain data source. However, the HTTP InputSource allows authenticated users to read data from other sources than intended, such as the local file system, with the privileges of the Druid server process. This is not an elevation of privilege when users access Druid directly, since Druid also provides the Local InputSource, which allows the same level of access. But it is problematic when users interact with Druid indirectly through an application that allows users to specify the HTTP InputSource, but not the Local InputSource. In this case, users could bypass the application-level restriction by passing a file URL to the HTTP InputSource.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

Taking an example code from the github repo to demonstrate the bug:

```
const { XMLParser, XMLBuilder, XMLValidator} = require("fast-xml-parser");

let XMLdata = "<__proto__><polluted>hacked</polluted></__proto__>"

const parser = new XMLParser();
let jObj = parser.parse(XMLdata);

console.log(jObj.polluted) // should return hacked
```

[![Code_G3UvvJcSv5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31372554/218308540-86792929-3631-4580-8373-4651487418b5.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31372554/218308540-86792929-3631-4580-8373-4651487418b5.png)

In the above screenshot you can see the `jObj` was polluted with a new property.

```
jObj
>{}
jObj.__proto__
>{polluted: 'hacked'}
jObj.__proto__.polluted
>'hacked'
```

More information on prototype pollution can be found here: <https://learn.snyk.io/lessons/prototype-pollution/javascript/>

As it is common for developers to pass user controllable input to `XMLParser` , this can to do unexpected results. By chaining it with some prototype pollution gadget it might even can lead to RCE in some cases <https://research.securitum.com/prototype-pollution-rce-kibana-cve-2019-7609/>
