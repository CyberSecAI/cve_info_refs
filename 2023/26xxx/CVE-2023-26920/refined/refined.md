The provided content relates to CVE-2021-26920 and a prototype pollution vulnerability in the `fast-xml-parser` library.

**CVE-2021-26920**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Druid ingestion system's HTTP InputSource allows authenticated users to read data from unintended sources, including the local file system, with the privileges of the Druid server process. This occurs because the HTTP InputSource can be manipulated to access file URLs, bypassing application-level restrictions that might prevent direct access via the Local InputSource.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    *   **Unintended Data Access:** Authenticated users can use HTTP InputSource to read local files and potentially other sensitive data.
    *   **Bypass of Application-Level Restrictions:** The vulnerability allows users to circumvent restrictions imposed by an application using Druid by using file URLs through HTTP InputSource.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to potentially sensitive data residing on the Druid server, compromising confidentiality.
*   **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by manipulating the HTTP InputSource to point to a file URL. This can be achieved when users interact with Druid indirectly through an application that allows specifying HTTP InputSource, but not Local InputSource.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    *   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Druid system.
    *   **Indirect Interaction:** Attackers exploit this vulnerability by using an application that indirectly interacts with Druid and allows specifying the HTTP InputSource.

**Prototype pollution vulnerability in `fast-xml-parser`**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `fast-xml-parser` library is vulnerable to prototype pollution due to its handling of XML input. Specifically, it allows the `__proto__` property to be set in the parsed object, which can lead to modification of the Object prototype and potentially unexpected behaviors or even Remote Code Execution (RCE) if chained with other vulnerabilities.
*  **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability stems from the library's failure to sanitize the `__proto__` property, allowing it to be directly set by user-controlled XML input, leading to prototype pollution.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** This allows attackers to modify the prototype of JavaScript objects, potentially leading to application crashes, unexpected behavior, or, in more serious cases when chained with other vulnerabilities, RCE.
*   **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by providing maliciously crafted XML input that includes the `__proto__` property to the XML parser.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    *   **Control over XML input:** An attacker needs to be able to control or influence the XML data that is parsed by the `fast-xml-parser` library.
    *   **Application usage:** The application using `fast-xml-parser` must be vulnerable to the effects of prototype pollution for an exploit to be impactful.
*   **Mitigation:** The commit `2b032a4f799c63d83991e4f992f1c68e4dd05804` in the `fast-xml-parser` repository addresses this issue by replacing `__proto__` with `#\_\_proto\_\_` within the library to prevent prototype pollution attacks.
