Full-text autocomplete search allows user-provided SQL syntax to be injected to SQL statements. With existing sanitization in place, this can be abused to trigger benign SQL Exceptions but could potentially be escalated to a malicious SQL injection vulnerability. We now properly encode single quotes for SQL FULLTEXT queries. No publicly available exploits are known.
