{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Servlets using multipart support that call `HttpServletRequest.getParameter()` or `HttpServletRequest.getParts()` may cause an `OutOfMemoryError` when a client sends a multipart request with a part that has a name but no filename and very large content.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-400",
      "CWE-770"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can cause a Denial of Service (DoS) by sending a large multipart request that results in an `OutOfMemoryError`. The server may recover after the error, but it may take some time.",
    "attack_vectors": "A client sends a crafted multipart request with a part that has a name but no filename, and very large content.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server and the ability to send HTTP requests. No user interaction or privileges are required."
  },
  "affected_products": [
    "Active IQ Unified Manager for Linux",
    "Active IQ Unified Manager for Microsoft Windows",
    "E-Series SANtricity OS Controller Software 11.x",
     "E-Series SANtricity Unified Manager and Web Services Proxy"
   ],
 "fixed_versions": [
      "Jetty versions 9.4.51",
      "Jetty version 10.0.14",

     "E-Series SANtricity OS Controller Software 11.x",
      "E-Series SANtricity Unified Manager and Web Services Proxy"
   ],
  "additional_notes": "The vulnerability occurs even with the default `fileSizeThreshold=0` setting. A large number of parts in the multipart request may also cause the same issue. The `maxRequestSize` parameter can be set to limit the total size of the request, although the content is still read into memory. Limiting the `maxFileSize` parameter is insufficient because the attacker can send multiple parts."
