Debian LTS Advisory DLA-3592-1                debian-lts@lists.debian.org
<https://www.debian.org/lts/security/>                      Markus Koschany
September 30, 2023                            <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : jetty9
Version        : 9.4.16-0+deb10u3
CVE ID         : CVE-2023-26048 CVE-2023-26049 CVE-2023-36479 CVE-2023-40167

Multiple security vulnerabilities were found in Jetty, a Java based web server
and servlet engine.

The org.eclipse.jetty.servlets.CGI class has been deprecated. It is potentially
unsafe to use it. The upstream developers of Jetty recommend to use Fast CGI
instead. See also CVE-2023-36479.

CVE-2023-26048

    In affected versions servlets with multipart support (e.g. annotated with
    `@MultipartConfig`) that call `HttpServletRequest.getParameter()` or
    `HttpServletRequest.getParts()` may cause `OutOfMemoryError` when the
    client sends a multipart request with a part that has a name but no
    filename and very large content. This happens even with the default
    settings of `fileSizeThreshold=0` which should stream the whole part
    content to disk.

CVE-2023-26049

    Nonstandard cookie parsing in Jetty may allow an attacker to smuggle
    cookies within other cookies, or otherwise perform unintended behavior by
    tampering with the cookie parsing mechanism.

CVE-2023-40167

    Prior to this version Jetty accepted the `+` character proceeding the
    content-length value in a HTTP/1 header field. This is more permissive than
    allowed by the RFC and other servers routinely reject such requests with
    400 responses. There is no known exploit scenario, but it is conceivable
    that request smuggling could result if jetty is used in combination with a
    server that does not close the connection after sending such a 400
    response.

CVE-2023-36479

    Users of the CgiServlet with a very specific command structure may have the
    wrong command executed. If a user sends a request to a
    org.eclipse.jetty.servlets.CGI Servlet for a binary with a space in its
    name, the servlet will escape the command by wrapping it in quotation
    marks. This wrapped command, plus an optional command prefix, will then be
    executed through a call to Runtime.exec. If the original binary name
    provided by the user contains a quotation mark followed by a space, the
    resulting command line will contain multiple tokens instead of one.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
9.4.16-0+deb10u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your jetty9 packages.

For the detailed security status of jetty9 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/jetty9>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

| As part of the cleanup, we need to address the `Part.write()` API. This is currently always copying the part into a new file. However the API allows for this to be a move operation. Potentially the parts should be stored in the non-context temp directory and only moved the the location directory when given a filename here . This will allows the DelayedHandler to avoid being context specific with its temp file usage. |

Package        : jetty9
CVE ID         : CVE-2023-26048 CVE-2023-26049 CVE-2023-36479 CVE-2023-40167
                 CVE-2023-41900

Multiple security vulnerabilities were found in Jetty, a Java based web server
and servlet engine.

The org.eclipse.jetty.servlets.CGI class has been deprecated. It is potentially
unsafe to use it. The upstream developers of Jetty recommend to use Fast CGI
instead. See also CVE-2023-36479.

CVE-2023-26048

    In affected versions servlets with multipart support (e.g. annotated with
    `@MultipartConfig`) that call `HttpServletRequest.getParameter()` or
    `HttpServletRequest.getParts()` may cause `OutOfMemoryError` when the
    client sends a multipart request with a part that has a name but no
    filename and very large content. This happens even with the default
    settings of `fileSizeThreshold=0` which should stream the whole part
    content to disk.

CVE-2023-26049

    Nonstandard cookie parsing in Jetty may allow an attacker to smuggle
    cookies within other cookies, or otherwise perform unintended behavior by
    tampering with the cookie parsing mechanism.

CVE-2023-40167

    Prior to this version Jetty accepted the `+` character proceeding the
    content-length value in a HTTP/1 header field. This is more permissive than
    allowed by the RFC and other servers routinely reject such requests with
    400 responses. There is no known exploit scenario, but it is conceivable
    that request smuggling could result if jetty is used in combination with a
    server that does not close the connection after sending such a 400
    response.

CVE-2023-36479

    Users of the CgiServlet with a very specific command structure may have the
    wrong command executed. If a user sends a request to a
    org.eclipse.jetty.servlets.CGI Servlet for a binary with a space in its
    name, the servlet will escape the command by wrapping it in quotation
    marks. This wrapped command, plus an optional command prefix, will then be
    executed through a call to Runtime.exec. If the original binary name
    provided by the user contains a quotation mark followed by a space, the
    resulting command line will contain multiple tokens instead of one.

CVE-2023-41900

    Jetty is vulnerable to weak authentication. If a Jetty
    `OpenIdAuthenticator` uses the optional nested `LoginService`, and that
    `LoginService` decides to revoke an already authenticated user, then the
    current request will still treat the user as authenticated. The
    authentication is then cleared from the session and subsequent requests
    will not be treated as authenticated. So a request on a previously
    authenticated session could be allowed to bypass authentication after it
    had been rejected by the `LoginService`. This impacts usages of the
    jetty-openid which have configured a nested `LoginService` and where that
    `LoginService` is capable of rejecting previously authenticated users.

For the oldstable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed
in version 9.4.39-3+deb11u2.

For the stable distribution (bookworm), these problems have been fixed in
version 9.4.50-4+deb12u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your jetty9 packages.

its security tracker page at:

# OutOfMemoryError for large multipart without filename read via request.getParameter()

Moderate

[jmcc0nn3ll](/jmcc0nn3ll)
published
GHSA-qw69-rqj8-6qw8
Apr 18, 2023

## Package

maven

jetty-server
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

<=9.4.50, <=10.0.13, <=11.0.13

## Patched versions

9.4.51, 10.0.14, 11.0.14

## Description

### Impact

Servlets with multipart support (e.g. annotated with `@MultipartConfig`) that call `HttpServletRequest.getParameter()` or `HttpServletRequest.getParts()` may cause `OutOfMemoryError` when the client sends a multipart request with a part that has a name but no filename and a very large content.

This happens even with the default settings of `fileSizeThreshold=0` which should stream the whole part content to disk.

An attacker client may send a large multipart request and cause the server to throw `OutOfMemoryError`.

However, the server may be able to recover after the `OutOfMemoryError` and continue its service -- although it may take some time.

A very large number of parts may cause the same problem.

### Patches

Patched in Jetty versions

* 9.4.51.v20230217 - via PR [#9345](https://github.com/jetty/jetty.project/pull/9345)
* 10.0.14 - via PR [#9344](https://github.com/jetty/jetty.project/pull/9344)
* 11.0.14 - via PR [#9344](https://github.com/jetty/jetty.project/pull/9344)

### Workarounds

Multipart parameter `maxRequestSize` must be set to a non-negative value, so the whole multipart content is limited (although still read into memory).

Limiting multipart parameter `maxFileSize` won't be enough because an attacker can send a large number of parts that summed up will cause memory issues.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
