# On a compromised node, the virt-handler service account can be used to modify all node specs

## Description

### Impact

If a malicious user has taken over a Kubernetes node where virt-handler (the KubeVirt node-daemon) is running, the virt-handler service account can be used to modify all node specs.

This can be misused to lure-in system-level-privileged components (which can for instance read all secrets on the cluster, or can exec into pods on other nodes). This way a compromised node can be used to elevate privileges beyond the node until potentially having full privileged access to the whole cluster.

The simplest way to exploit this, once a user could compromise a specific node, is to set with the virt-handler service account all other nodes to unschedulable and simply wait until system-critical components with high privileges appear on its node.

Since this requires a node to be compromised first, the severity of this finding is considered Medium.

### Patches

Not yet available.

### Workarounds

Gatekeeper users can add a webhook which will block the `virt-handler` service account to modify the spec of a node.

An example policy, preventing virt-handler from changing the node spec may look like this:

```
apiVersion: templates.gatekeeper.sh/v1
kind: ConstraintTemplate
metadata:
  name: virthandlerrestrictions
spec:
[...]
  targets:
    - libs:
        - |
[...]
          is_virt_handler(username) {
              username == "system:serviceaccount:kubevirt:virt-handler"
          }
          mutates_node_in_unintended_way {
            # TODO
            # only allow kubevirt.io/ prefixed metadata node changes
          }
      rego: |
[...]

        violation[{"msg": msg}] {
          is_virt_handler(username)
          mutates_node_in_unintended_way(input.review.object, input.review.oldObject)
          msg := sprintf("virt-handler tries to modify node <%v> in an unintended way.", [input.review.object.name])
        }
```

and applying this template to node modifications.

## Description

![@younaman](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52592519?v=4&size=48)[younaman](https://github.com/younaman)opened [on Jan 27, 2023](https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/issues/9109#issue-1559151655)

Description:

* There are three components of kubevirt with default installation: kubevirt-handler, kubevirt-controller, kubevirt-api, and kubevirt-operator, the kubevirt-handler is a daemon set running on each node, the controller&api&operator are deployments, each of them is two-pod deployments running on worker nodes randomly.
* There are different cluster roles of these components:
  + The cluster role of the kubevirt-handler can patch nodes, which can be leveraged to make nodes unschedulable.
  + The cluster role of the kubevirt-controller can create pods/eviction, which can be leveraged to make pods evicted. While the cluster role of kubevirt-api can delete pods, which can be leveraged to make pods recreated and rescheduled to worker nodes.
  + The cluster role of the kubevirt-operator can list all secrets, which can be leveraged to get the admin secret of the entire cluster and make cluster-level privilege escalation.
* If a malicious user controls a worker node, which has kubevirt-handler, and one of kubevirt-api/controller:
  1. He/she can leverage the kubevirt-handler to path all other nodes with unschedulable: true". And when the kubevirt-operator is rescheduled, the kubevirt-operator will be rescheduled to the malicious worker node.
  2. He/She can use the token of kubevirt-api/controller to evict/delete kubevirt-operator pods, which will be recreated and run on the malicious worker node.
  3. After the kubevirt-operator runs on the malicious worker node, he/she can leverage the operator's token to list all secrets in the whole cluster, get the cluster admin's token and make a cluster-level privilege escalation.
* Mitigation Discussion:
  + The cluster role of the kubevirt-operator can use the Resource Names to restrain the secrets which can be listed by the operator itself, however, it may need a careful review of the kubevirt-operator to identify all secrets needed by the operator exactly.
  + The kubevirt-handler can remove the patch verbs of nodes, and the controller/api can remove the evict and delete of pods. However, similar to the first mitigation, it still needs a careful revisit of the components' source code.
  + The kubevirt can let the kubevirt-operator/controller/api runs on worker nodes (which we called "controller worker node") without running users' workloads, and leverage the isolation of nodes to mitigate the risk. However, if a malicious user leverages some method(i.e., scale-up of kubevirt-handler) and moves to the "controller worker node" horizontally, it still can break the worker nodes' isolation and make privilege escalation.
* Installation and environment:
  + We follow the Kubevirt's [official guide](https://kubevirt.io/user-guide/operations/installation/) to install the Kubevirt on a four-node Kubernetes cluster(1.24.2).

    I'm looking forward to hearing back from you!
