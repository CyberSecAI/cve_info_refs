# The armv8\_dec\_aes\_gcm\_full() API fails to the verify the authentication tag of AES-GCM protected data

Moderate

[WonderfulVoid](/WonderfulVoid)
published
GHSA-47c6-7x5x-r74g
Feb 21, 2023

## Package

AArch64cryptolib

## Affected versions

All versions committed before 20230220

## Patched versions

86065c6

## Description

### Impact

Due to an improperly initialized variable in the armv8\_dec\_aes\_gcm\_full() function, the computed AES-GCM authentication tag is believed to be of zero length and is thus not verified, instead the authentication is always reported as successful.

A man-in-the-middle could modify data (e.g. network packets) which would not be detected by the AES-GCM authentication mechanism. The resulting cleartext data corruption would be random as only the encrypted ciphertext can be modified. If AArch64cryptolib is used with e.g. IPsec, replay attacks (of unmodified encrypted data) might also be possible.

### Patches

The problem is fixed in commit [86065c6](https://github.com/ARM-software/AArch64cryptolib/commit/86065c6cbdf84e3b49ed4ae2ac1be9a1de5db01f)

### Workarounds

Use the alternate armv8\_dec\_aes\_gcm\_from\_state() API where the authentication tag size is specified by the caller.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
