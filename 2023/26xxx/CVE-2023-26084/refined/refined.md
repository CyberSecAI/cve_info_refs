{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "An improperly initialized variable in the `armv8_dec_aes_gcm_full()` function leads to a zero-length computed AES-GCM authentication tag.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The AES-GCM authentication tag is not verified, and authentication is always reported as successful due to the zero-length tag.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A man-in-the-middle attacker can modify encrypted data, which would go undetected by the AES-GCM authentication. This results in random cleartext data corruption. When used with protocols like IPsec, replay attacks of unmodified encrypted data are also possible.",
  "Attack vectors": "Network. A man-in-the-middle attack is possible by intercepting and modifying network packets.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify network traffic. No user interaction or special privileges are needed."
