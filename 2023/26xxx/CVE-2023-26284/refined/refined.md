- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient authorization checks in the IBM MQ Advanced for Integration container image.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** All users authenticated with the cluster are granted administrative access to the MQ Console, bypassing IAM access rights checks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unintended administrative access to the MQ Console, potentially leading to unauthorized actions and data exposure.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation occurs through network access to the MQ Console.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user within the cluster.
