Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a directory traversal issue. This means an attacker can manipulate file paths in a request to access files outside the intended directory.
*   Specifically, the vulnerability allows reading files from the `WEB-INF` directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper input sanitization or validation of file paths, allowing directory traversal.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can read files from the `WEB-INF` directory. While the advisory states that this directory "does not contain sensitive information by default", it still represents a security risk.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending specially crafted HTTP requests. The specific nature of the crafted request (e.g., presence of `..` sequences in file path) is not specified, but this is the standard method for directory traversal.
*   **Remote Attack:** The attacker can be remote, as the vulnerability is triggered through HTTP requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected service.
*   **No Authentication:** The provided information does not indicate that authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Affected Products/Versions:**

*   Oxygen XML Web Author versions before 25.0.0.3 build 2023021715, 24.1.0.3 build 2023021714, and 23.1.1.4 build 2023021715.
*   Oxygen Content Fusion versions 5.0.2 and older

**Mitigation:**

*   Upgrade to the fixed versions of the products
*   Disable caching in Tomcat as a temporary measure (as detailed in the mitigation steps provided in the content).
