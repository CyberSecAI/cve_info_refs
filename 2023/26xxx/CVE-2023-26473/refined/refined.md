Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of database queries within the `DatabaseListProperty` feature in XWiki. Specifically, the `suggest.vm` component allows unprivileged users to execute arbitrary SQL `SELECT` queries through a crafted `Database List` property, bypassing intended access controls. This occurs because the system does not properly check if the user has the necessary permissions to run the query when accessed via `suggest.vm`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate Access Control:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper authorization checks in `suggest.vm` when processing `DatabaseListProperty` queries. This allows users without scripting rights (normally required for database interactions) to execute arbitrary queries.
*   **Direct SQL Query Execution:** The system directly executes the provided Hibernate Query without sufficient sanitization or permission validation in the context of `suggest.vm`.
*   **Bypass of REST API Security:** The REST API correctly blocks the query by checking for programming rights, but the `suggest.vm` endpoint bypasses this security measure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Exposure (Confidentiality):** An attacker can craft SQL queries to retrieve sensitive data stored in the database, including content from private pages, user information, or any other data accessible via SQL.
*   **Unauthorized Data Access:** By circumventing the intended access controls, an attacker gains unauthorized access to data that would otherwise be protected.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited via the web interface using a crafted URL targeting the `suggest.vm` endpoint.
*   **Database List Property:** The attacker leverages the `Database List` property type and its "Hibernate Query" configuration to inject a malicious SQL query.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low Privileges:** The attacker requires only edit rights on a page to create a new class and add a `Database List` property.
*   **Advanced User Status:** The user must be set as an "advanced user" to access the class editor.
*   **Access to XWiki Instance:** The attacker needs access to a vulnerable XWiki instance.
