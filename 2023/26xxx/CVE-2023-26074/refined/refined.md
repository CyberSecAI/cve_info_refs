    "additional_information": "This vulnerability is part of a group of eighteen 0-day vulnerabilities discovered by Google Project Zero. Four of the vulnerabilities allowed for internet-to-baseband remote code execution. The remaining vulnerabilities required either a malicious mobile network operator or an attacker with local access to the device. Users can protect themselves from the baseband RCE vulnerabilities by turning off Wi-Fi calling and Voice-over-LTE (VoLTE). Patches are available for the most severe vulnerabilities."
