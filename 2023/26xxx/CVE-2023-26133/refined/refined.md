Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the `extend()` function within the `utils.js` file of the `progressbar.js` library. This function is used for merging objects, and it is vulnerable to prototype pollution due to how it handles the `__proto__` property.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The `extend()` function performs an unsafe recursive merge, allowing an attacker to inject properties into the prototype of the base object by manipulating the `__proto__` attribute.
- The function does not properly sanitize or validate input, leading to the ability to overwrite or pollute the JavaScript application object prototype.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By polluting `Object.prototype` with unexpected values or data types (e.g., setting `toString` to an integer), the code might crash due to type mismatch errors.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** If the codebase uses `eval()` on an attribute, an attacker can inject malicious code by polluting the `Object.prototype`.
- **Property Injection:** Sensitive properties, including security properties like isAdmin, cookies, or tokens, can be polluted, leading to privilege escalation or other unauthorized access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered via the `extend()` function.
- An attacker needs to be able to control the input that is passed to the vulnerable `extend()` function. Specifically, the attacker provides a JSON object containing a `__proto__` property.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide or influence the input that the `extend` function receives. No prior authentication or user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in versions of `progressbar.js` prior to 1.1.1.
- The content provides a PoC that demonstrates the prototype pollution via the `extend()` function.
- The content also elaborates on the different types of attacks possible with Prototype Pollution and includes some suggestions on how to prevent it.
- The Snyk CVSS score is 8.2 (High), while NVD CVSS score is 9.8 (Critical), which indicates different interpretations of the impact.
