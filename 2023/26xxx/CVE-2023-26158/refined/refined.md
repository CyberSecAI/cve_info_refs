The provided content is related to CVE-2023-26158.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing check in the `Util.extend` function of the `mockjs` library. This function doesn't properly validate if an attribute being extended resolves to the object prototype.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Prototype Pollution: The `Util.extend` function allows an attacker to modify or add attributes to the object prototype by injecting properties through the `__proto__`, `constructor`, or `prototype` attributes.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): By polluting the `Object.prototype` with unexpected values or functions, the application can fail, leading to a denial of service.
- Remote Code Execution: In certain cases, if the application evaluates a polluted attribute, the attacker could achieve remote code execution.
- Property Injection: The attacker can inject properties into the prototype that the application relies on for security or informational purposes, potentially gaining unauthorized access or privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- User-controlled inputs passed to the `extend()` method of the `Mock.Handler`, `Mock.Random`, `Mock.RE.Handler`, or `Mock.Util` objects can be exploited. Specifically, the attacker injects a JSON payload with `__proto__` attributes to modify the prototype chain through the vulnerable extend function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply malicious JSON input to the `extend()` method of `Mock.Handler`, `Mock.Random`, `Mock.RE.Handler`, or `Mock.Util`. No prior access or authentication is required.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in all versions of the `mockjs` package as there is no fixed version available.
- The provided workaround suggests adding a check to the `Util.extend` function to prevent the use of `__proto__`, `constructor`, or `prototype` as property names to extend.
- The report includes proof-of-concept code that shows how the vulnerability can be exploited using the `__proto__` property within a JSON object.
- The report highlights the concepts of unsafe recursive merges and property definition by path as common vectors for prototype pollution.
- The report also suggests ways to prevent such attacks including: freezing prototypes, schema validation of JSON input, avoiding unsafe recursive merge functions and using objects without prototypes.
