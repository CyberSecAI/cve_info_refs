Hi [@Marsman1996](https://github.com/Marsman1996)

Looks good except for the magic number. Can you put the 256 into a constant or a define and then use it in the declaration of `initialLogFileName` and in the if stamement?

Thanks

| I checked other `strcpy()` functions in this library, they are OK since the size of the src and the dest buffer is equal.  Except for the `strcpy()` in `print_dots()` at lou\_trace.c:   [liblouis/tools/lou\_trace.c](https://github.com/liblouis/liblouis/blob/018edce262d65d99bf80ce7af5a82c0b32a898e9/tools/lou_trace.c#L100-L105)  Lines 100 to 105 in [018edce](/liblouis/liblouis/commit/018edce262d65d99bf80ce7af5a82c0b32a898e9)   |  | static char \* | | --- | --- | |  | print\_dots(const widechar \*buffer, int length) { | |  | static char dots[BUFSIZE]; | |  | strcpy(dots, \_lou\_showDots(buffer, length)); | |  | return dots; | |  | } |      The max size of the src buffer (i.e., `scratchBuf`) returned by `_lou_showDots()` is 2048.   [liblouis/liblouis/utils.c](https://github.com/liblouis/liblouis/blob/1cf768700e9b42e4bf655c72f041a03f30b865a6/liblouis/utils.c#L260-L275)  Lines 260 to 275 in [1cf7687](/liblouis/liblouis/commit/1cf768700e9b42e4bf655c72f041a03f30b865a6)   |  | \_lou\_showDots(widechar const \*dots, int length) { | | --- | --- | |  | int bufPos = 0; | |  | static char scratchBuf[MAXSTRING]; | |  | for (int dotsPos = 0; dotsPos < length && bufPos < (MAXSTRING - 1); dotsPos++) { | |  | for (int mappingPos = 0; dotMapping[mappingPos].key; mappingPos++) { | |  | if ((dots[dotsPos] & dotMapping[mappingPos].key) && | |  | (bufPos < (MAXSTRING - 1))) | |  | scratchBuf[bufPos++] = dotMapping[mappingPos].value; | |  | } | |  | if ((dots[dotsPos] == LOU\_DOTS) && (bufPos < (MAXSTRING - 1))) | |  | scratchBuf[bufPos++] = '0'; | |  | if ((dotsPos != length - 1) && (bufPos < (MAXSTRING - 1))) | |  | scratchBuf[bufPos++] = '-'; | |  | } | |  | scratchBuf[bufPos] = 0; | |  | return scratchBuf; |      While the size of the dest buffer (i.e., `dots`) is 512.  However, the above is my static analysis result, and for now I cannot trigger the overflow from the program or API entry. So maybe it is a false positive. |
