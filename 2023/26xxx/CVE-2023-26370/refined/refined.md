- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Access of Uninitialized Pointer (CWE-824)
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software attempts to use a pointer without proper initialization.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, which means that the attacker needs to have local access to the system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have a low privilege and user interaction is required.
