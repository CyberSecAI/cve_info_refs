**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability within the Pega Platform.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected XSS:** The application does not properly sanitize user input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are reflected back to the user's browser when a malicious link is clicked.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Cross-site scripting (XSS):** Attackers can inject malicious scripts into the code of a trusted application or website. This can lead to various impacts:
    - Stealing sensitive user information (session cookies, personal data)

    - Defacing the website
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user
- The advisory states that they are not aware of any clients being compromised due to the vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Link:** The primary attack vector involves an attacker sending a crafted malicious link to a user. When the user clicks this link, the malicious script is executed in their browser within the context of the vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with the malicious script embedded. They don't need direct access to the Pega platform, only the ability to entice a user to click the malicious link.
- They need to understand the vulnerable parameter(s) in the Pega Platform to create the malicious link.
- They need to have the ability to distribute the crafted malicious URL to a target user.
