Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of CVE-2023-26547:

**CVE-2023-26547:**

*   **Vulnerability:** Serialization/deserialization mismatch in the InputMethod module.
*   **Root Cause:**  The vulnerability stems from a mismatch in how data is serialized and deserialized within the InputMethod module.
*   **Weakness:** Improper handling of serialized data during deserialization. This can occur when the data format or structure expected during deserialization does not match the actual serialized data.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation may lead to privilege escalation.
*  **Affected Versions:** EMUI 13.0.0, EMUI 12.0.1, EMUI 12.0.0, EMUI 11.0.1
*   **Attack Vector:** The specific attack vector is not detailed, but it likely involves crafting malicious input data that, when processed by the vulnerable InputMethod module during deserialization, triggers a flaw leading to privilege escalation.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker likely needs the ability to influence input data processed by the InputMethod module on a target device. The level of access required isn't specified but likely requires the ability to interact with the Input Method or its data in some way.
