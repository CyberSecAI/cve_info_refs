- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A DNS server closing connections without sending a response could cause excessive TCP reconnections by the resolver.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Excessive TCP reconnections leading to increased resource consumption.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious or faulty DNS server could cause the resolver to perform excessive work, potentially leading to denial of service for the resolver and the attacker's server.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious DNS server could close connections without sending a response, triggering the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to act as a DNS server and be able to intercept or respond to the resolver's queries.
