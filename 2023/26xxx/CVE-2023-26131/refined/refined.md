Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-26131:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the `themes.NoPage(filename, theme)` function not properly sanitizing user input. Specifically, when a file or resource is not found, the function includes unsanitized user input in the error message that is rendered in the browser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The lack of proper input sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the error page. This script is then executed by the victim's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
- Potential impacts include:
    - Stealing cookies and hijacking user sessions.
    - Exposing sensitive information.
    - Gaining access to privileged services and functionality.
    - Delivering malware.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is initiated via a crafted URL. When a user requests a non-existent resource using a URL containing a malicious script, the application's error handling mechanism renders the unsanitized input, leading to script execution in the user's browser.
- The vulnerability is classified as a "Reflected XSS" attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL that includes malicious JavaScript code.
- The attacker needs to induce the user to visit the malicious URL.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability exists in both `github.com/xyproto/algernon/engine` and `github.com/xyproto/algernon/themes` packages.
- The specific vulnerable code snippets can be found in these files:
    - `engine/handlers.go` (lines 512 and 514)
    - `themes/html.go` (line 145)
- The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) URL is `http://localhost:3000/<img%20src=x%20onerror=alert(document.domain)%20/>`. This URL demonstrates the injection of JavaScript code within the `<img>` tag.
- The attack is considered "remotely exploitable" over the network.
- The attacker requires user interaction to trigger the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 5.4 (Snyk) and 6.1 (NVD), both indicating a medium severity.
