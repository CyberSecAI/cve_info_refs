- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Command injection in the `daemonControl()` function located in `/web/api/app/Controller/HostController.php`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands due to insufficient input sanitization in the `daemonControl()` function.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an authenticated user to execute arbitrary shell commands with the privileges of the web user. This could lead to a variety of attacks, such as data theft, system compromise or denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based, meaning the attacker can exploit this remotely over a network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the ZoneMinder system. No user interaction is required for the attack to be successful.
