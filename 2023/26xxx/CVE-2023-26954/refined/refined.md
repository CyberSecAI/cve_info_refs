{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when saving a user group title. Specifically, the `title` parameter in the JSON payload of the POST request to `/admin1/userGroup/save` is vulnerable to stored XSS.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the `title` field of a user group. When this title is displayed to other users, the injected JavaScript code will execute in their browsers. This allows the attacker to potentially perform actions on behalf of the victim, steal cookies, or redirect users to malicious sites.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker sends a crafted POST request to `/admin1/userGroup/save` with a malicious JavaScript payload embedded in the `title` field of a JSON object. Then, when the saved title is viewed, the payload executes.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have the ability to make authenticated requests to the `/admin1/userGroup/save` endpoint."
