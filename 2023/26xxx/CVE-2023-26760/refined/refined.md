Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2023-26760:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a Path Traversal vulnerability in the Sme.UP ERP application. Specifically, the application does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input when accessing files on the server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The application allows an authenticated user to manipulate file paths using "../" or ".." sequences. This enables them to access files and directories outside of the intended web root.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Access:** An attacker can read any file on the server that the application has read permissions for. This can include sensitive files such as application source code, configuration files, and system files.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Exposure of sensitive files, such as those containing credentials or system configurations can lead to further compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Requests:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a POST request to the `/debug` URL.
*   **`filepath` Parameter:** The malicious file path is provided through the `filepath` parameter in the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have valid credentials for the Sme.UP ERP application to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Sme.UP ERP application.

**Technical Details**

*   The vulnerability is located at the `/debug` endpoint.
*   An attacker uses the `filepath` parameter to specify the path to the file they wish to access.
