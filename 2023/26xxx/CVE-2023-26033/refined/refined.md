Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-26033:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the application's use of a `search_history` cookie to display recently visited packages on the index page.
- The value of this cookie, which is a base64-encoded comma-separated list of atoms, is directly inserted into an SQL query without proper sanitization.
- Specifically, the code uses format string `atom = '%s'` directly in the SQL query. This allows for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection (CWE-89). By crafting a malicious `search_history` cookie, an attacker can insert arbitrary SQL queries.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize the cookie value before using it in the SQL query.
- **Direct String Formatting in SQL Queries:**  Using string formatting (`%s`) to build SQL queries is a significant security risk and allows for injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Modification/Loss:** An attacker could modify or delete data in the database, as demonstrated by the proof of concept that wiped the database.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability could be used to cause a DoS by executing resource-intensive queries that could potentially crash the server.
- **Arbitrary Query Execution:**  Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL commands, leading to potential data breaches or other unintended consequences

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is network-based as it involves crafting a malicious cookie in the user's browser.
- **HTTP Cookie Manipulation:** The attacker modifies the `search_history` cookie in the user's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need any specific privileges on the application or server.
- **User Interaction Not Required:**  The attacker does not require interaction from the application users as they directly control the crafted cookie value in the HTTP request.
- **Ability to Manipulate Cookies:** The attacker needs to be able to modify the `search_history` cookie value in their browser.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix implemented in commit `5ae9ca83b73` replaces the vulnerable format string with a parameterized query using `pg.In` function from the `pg` library. This prevents SQL injection by properly escaping and handling the user-supplied data.
- The vulnerability is categorized as High severity, scoring 7.5 using CVSS v3.1 metrics (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N).
- The affected versions are before 1.0.1, and the patched version is 1.0.1.
- Workarounds are provided, which include dropping the `search_history` cookie using a proxy or sanitizing the cookie's value after base64 decoding.
