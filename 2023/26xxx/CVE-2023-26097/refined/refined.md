The provided content includes detailed information about CVE-2023-26097.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application performs client-side checks only, without server-side validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Lack of server-side validation allows manipulation of the application behavior by altering client-side code. This allows the circumvention of intended access controls and functionality.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can modify client-side code to perform unauthorized actions, potentially leading to a complete compromise of data integrity and application availability. Successful manipulation of the client code could result in unauthorized access to data (confidentiality), modification of data (integrity) without proper checks.

**Attack vectors:**
By modifying the client-side application code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to modify the client-side application code. This is possible for an attacker with low privileges on the local machine where the client application runs.
