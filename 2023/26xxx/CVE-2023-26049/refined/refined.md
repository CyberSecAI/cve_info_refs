It\n   describes three new headers, Cookie, Cookie2, and Set-Cookie2, which\n   carry state information between participating origin servers and user\n   agents.  The method described here differs from Netscape's Cookie\n   proposal [[Netscape](#ref-Netscape \"\\\"Persistent Client State -- HTTP Cookies\\\"\")], but it can interoperate with HTTP/1.0 user\n   agents that use Netscape's method.  (See the HISTORICAL section.)\n\n   This document reflects implementation experience with [RFC 2109](./rfc2109) and\n   obsoletes it.\n\n[1](#section-1).  TERMINOLOGY\n\n   The terms user agent, client, server, proxy, origin server, and\n   http_URL have the same meaning as in the HTTP/1.1 specification\n   [[RFC2616](./rfc2616 \"\\\"Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1\\\"\")].  The terms abs_path and absoluteURI have the same meaning\n   as in the URI Syntax specification [[RFC2396](./rfc2396 \"\\\"Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI): Generic Syntax\\\"\")].\n\nKristol & Montulli          Standards Track                     [Page 1]\n```\n\n---\n\n```\n\n[RFC 2965](./rfc2965)            HTTP State Management Mechanism         October 2000\n\n   Host name (HN) means either the host domain name (HDN) or the numeric\n   Internet Protocol (IP) address of a host.  The fully qualified domain\n   name is preferred; use of numeric IP addresses is strongly\n   discouraged.\n\n   The terms request-host and request-URI refer to the values the client\n   would send to the server as, respectively, the host (but not port)\n   and abs_path portions of the absoluteURI (http_URL) of the HTTP\n   request line.  Note that request-host is a HN.\n\n   The term effective host name is related to host name.  If a host name\n   contains no dots, the effective host name is that name with the\n   string .local appended to it.  Otherwise the effective host name is\n   the same as the host name.  Note that all effective host names\n   contain at least one dot.\n\n   The term request-port refers to the port portion of the absoluteURI\n   (http_URL) of the HTTP request line.  If the absoluteURI has no\n   explicit port, the request-port is the HTTP default, 80.  The\n   request-port of a cookie is the request-port of the request in which\n   a Set-Cookie2 response header was returned to the user agent.\n\n   Host names can be specified either as an IP address or a HDN string.\n   Sometimes we compare one host name with another.  (Such comparisons\n   SHALL be case-insensitive.)  Host A's name domain-matches host B's if\n\n      *  their host name strings string-compare equal; or\n\n      * A is a HDN string and has the form NB, where N is a non-empty\n         name string, B has the form .B', and B' is a HDN string.  (So,\n         x.y.com domain-matches .Y.com but not Y.com.)\n\n   Note that domain-match is not a commutative operation: a.b.c.com\n   domain-matches .c.com, but not the reverse.\n\n   The reach R of a host name H is defined as follows:\n\n      *  If\n\n         -  H is the host domain name of a host; and,\n\n         -  H has the form A.B; and\n\n         -  A has no embedded (that is, interior) dots; and\n\n         -  B has at least one embedded dot, or B is the string \"local\".\n            then the reach of H is .B.\n\nKristol & Montulli          Standards Track                     [Page 2]\n```\n\n---\n\n```\n\n[RFC 2965](./rfc2965)            HTTP State Management Mechanism         October 2000\n\n      *  Otherwise, the reach of H is H.\n\n   For two strings that represent paths, P1 and P2, P1 path-matches P2\n   if P2 is a prefix of P1 (including the case where P1 and P2 string-\n   compare equal).  Thus, the string /tec/waldo path-matches /tec.\n\n   Because it was used in Netscape's original implementation of state\n   management, we will use the term cookie to refer to the state\n   information that passes between an origin server and user agent, and\n   that gets stored by the user agent.\n\n[1.1](#section-1.1)  Requirements\n\n   The key words \"MAY\", \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"OPTIONAL\", \"RECOMMENDED\",\n   \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](./rfc2119) [[RFC2119](./rfc2119 \"\\\"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels\\\"\")].\n\n[2](#section-2).  STATE AND SESSIONS\n\n   This document describes a way to create stateful sessions with HTTP\n   requests and responses.  Currently, HTTP servers respond to each\n   client request without relating that request to previous or\n   subsequent requests; the state management mechanism allows clients\n   and servers that wish to exchange state information to place HTTP\n   requests and responses within a larger context, which we term a\n   \"session\".  This context might be used to create, for example, a\n   \"shopping cart\", in which user selections can be aggregated before\n   purchase, or a magazine browsing system, in which a user's previous\n   reading affects which offerings are presented.\n\n   Neither clients nor servers are required to support cookies.  A\n   server MAY refuse to provide content to a client that does not return\n   the cookies it sends.\n\n[3](#section-3).  DESCRIPTION\n\n   We describe here a way for an origin server to send state information\n   to the user agent, and for the user agent to return the state\n   information to the origin server.  The goal is to have a minimal\n   impact on HTTP and user agents.\n\n[3.1](#section-3.1)  Syntax:  General\n\n   The two state management headers, Set-Cookie2 and Cookie, have common\n   syntactic properties involving attribute-value pairs.  The following\n   grammar uses the notation, and tokens DIGIT (decimal digits), token\n\nKristol & Montulli          Standards Track                     [Page 3]\n```\n\n---\n\n```\n\n[RFC 2965](./rfc2965)            HTTP State Management Mechanism         October 2000\n\n   (informally, a sequence of non-special, non-white space characters),\n   and http_URL from the HTTP/1.1 specification [[RFC2616](./rfc2616 \"\\\"Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1\\\"\")] to describe\n   their syntax.\n\n   av-pairs    =     av-pair *(\";\" av-pair)\n   av-pair     =     attr [\"=\" value]              ; optional value\n   attr        =     token\n   value       =     token | quoted-string\n\n   Attributes (names) (attr) are case-insensitive.  White space is\n   permitted between tokens.  Note that while the above syntax\n   description shows value as optional, most attrs require them.\n\n   NOTE: The syntax above allows whitespace between the attribute and\n   the = sign.\n\n[3.2](#section-3.2)  Origin Server Role\n\n   3.2.1  General  The origin server initiates a session, if it so\n   desires.  To do so, it returns an extra response header to the\n   client, Set-Cookie2.  (The details follow later.)\n\n   A user agent returns a Cookie request header (see below) to the\n   origin server if it chooses to continue a session.  The origin server\n   MAY ignore it or use it to determine the current state of the\n   session.  It MAY send back to the client a Set-Cookie2 response\n   header with the same or different information, or it MAY send no\n   Set-Cookie2 header at all.  The origin server effectively ends a\n   session by sending the client a Set-Cookie2 header with Max-Age=0.\n\n   Servers MAY return Set-Cookie2 response headers with any response.\n   User agents SHOULD send Cookie request headers, subject to other\n   rules detailed below, with every request.\n\n   An origin server MAY include multiple Set-Cookie2 headers in a\n   response.  Note that an intervening gateway could fold multiple such\n   headers into a single header.\n\nKristol & Montulli          Standards Track                     [Page 4]\n```\n\n---\n\n```\n\n[RFC 2965](./rfc2965)            HTTP State Management Mechanism         October 2000\n\n   3.2.2  Set-Cookie2 Syntax  The syntax for the Set-Cookie2 response\n   header is\n\n   set-cookie      =       \"Set-Cookie2:\" cookies\n   cookies         =       1#cookie\n   cookie          =       NAME \"=\" VALUE *(\";\" set-cookie-av)\n   NAME            =       attr\n   VALUE           =       value\n   set-cookie-av   =       \"Comment\" \"=\" value\n                   |       \"CommentURL\" \"=\" <\"> http_URL <\">\n                   |       \"Discard\"\n                   |       \"Domain\" \"=\" value\n                   |       \"Max-Age\" \"=\" value\n                   |       \"Path\" \"=\" value\n                   |       \"Port\" [ \"=\" <\"> portlist <\"> ]\n                   |       \"Secure\"\n                   |       \"Version\" \"=\" 1*DIGIT\n   portlist        =       1#portnum\n   portnum         =       1*DIGIT\n\n   Informally, the Set-Cookie2 response header comprises the token Set-\n   Cookie2:, followed by a comma-separated list of one or more cookies.\n   Each cookie begins with a NAME=VALUE pair, followed by zero or more\n   semi-colon-separated attribute-value pairs.  The syntax for\n   attribute-value pairs was shown earlier.  The specific attributes and\n   the semantics of their values follows.  The NAME=VALUE attribute-\n   value pair MUST come first in each cookie.  The others, if present,\n   can occur in any order.  If an attribute appears more than once in a\n   cookie, the client SHALL use only the value associated with the first\n   appearance of the attribute; a client MUST ignore values after the\n   first.\n\n   The NAME of a cookie MAY be the same as one of the attributes in this\n   specification.  However, because the cookie's NAME must come first in\n   a Set-Cookie2 response header, the NAME and its VALUE cannot be\n   confused with an attribute-value pair.\n\n   NAME=VALUE\n      REQUIRED.  The name of the state information (\"cookie\") is NAME,\n      and its value is VALUE.  NAMEs that begin with $ are reserved and\n      MUST NOT be used by applications.\n\n      The VALUE is opaque to the user agent and may be anything the\n      origin server chooses to send, possibly in a server-selected\n      printable ASCII encoding.  \"Opaque\" implies that the content is of\n      interest and relevance only to the origin server.  The content\n      may, in fact, be readable by anyone that examines the Set-Cookie2\n      header.\n\nKristol & Montulli          Standards Track                     [Page 5]\n```\n\n---\n\n```\n\n[RFC 2965](./rfc2965)            HTTP State Management Mechanism         October 2000\n\n   Comment=value\n      OPTIONAL.  Because cookies can be used to derive or store private\n      information about a user, the value of the Comment attribute\n      allows an origin server to document how it intends to use the\n      cookie.  The user can inspect the information to decide whether to\n      initiate or continue a session with this cookie.  Characters in\n      value MUST be in UTF-8 encoding. [[RFC2279](./rfc2279 \"\\\"UTF-8, a transformation format of Unicode and ISO-10646\\\"\")]\n\n   CommentURL=\"http_URL\"\n      OPTIONAL.  Because cookies can be used to derive or store private\n      information about a user, the CommentURL attribute allows an\n      origin server to document how it intends to use the cookie.  The\n      user can inspect the information identified by the URL to decide\n      whether to initiate or continue a session with this cookie.\n\n   Discard\n      OPTIONAL.  The Discard attribute instructs the user agent to\n      discard the cookie unconditionally when the user agent terminates.\n\n   Domain=value\n      OPTIONAL.  The value of the Domain attribute specifies the domain\n      for which the cookie is valid.  If an explicitly specified value\n      does not start with a dot, the user agent supplies a leading dot.\n\n   Max-Age=value\n      OPTIONAL.  The value of the Max-Age attribute is delta-seconds,\n      the lifetime of the cookie in seconds, a decimal non-negative\n      integer.  To handle cached cookies correctly, a client SHOULD\n      calculate the age of the cookie according to the age calculation\n      rules in the HTTP/1.1 specification [[RFC2616](./rfc2616 \"\\\"Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1\\\"\")].  When the age is\n      greater than delta-seconds seconds, the client SHOULD discard the\n      cookie.  A value of zero means the cookie SHOULD be discarded\n      immediately.\n\n   Path=value\n      OPTIONAL.  The value of the Path attribute specifies the subset of\n      URLs on the origin server to which this cookie applies.\n\n   Port[=\"portlist\"]\n      OPTIONAL.  The Port attribute restricts the port to which a cookie\n      may be returned in a Cookie request header.  Note that the syntax\n      REQUIREs quotes around the OPTIONAL portlist even if there is only\n      one portnum in portlist.\n\nKristol & Montulli          Standards Track                     [Page 6]\n```\n\n---\n\n```\n\n[RFC 2965](./rfc2965)            HTTP State Management Mechanism         October 2000\n\n   Secure\n      OPTIONAL.  The Secure attribute (with no value) directs the user\n      agent to use only (unspecified) secure means to contact the origin\n      server whenever it sends back this cookie, to protect the\n      confidentially and authenticity of the information in the cookie.\n\n      The user agent (possibly with user interaction) MAY determine what\n      level of security it considers appropriate for \"secure\" cookies.\n      The Secure attribute should be considered security advice from the\n      server to the user agent, indicating that it is in the session's\n      interest to protect the cookie contents.  When it sends a \"secure\"\n      cookie back to a server, the user agent SHOULD use no less than\n      the same level of security as was used when it received the cookie\n      from the server.\n\n   Version=value\n      REQUIRED.  The value of the Version attribute, a decimal integer,\n      identifies the version of the state management specification to\n      which the cookie conforms.  For this specification, Version=1\n      applies.\n\n   3.2.3  Controlling Caching  An origin server must be cognizant of the\n   effect of possible caching of both the returned resource and the\n   Set-Cookie2 header.  Caching \"public\" documents is desirable.  For\n   example, if the origin server wants to use a public document such as\n   a \"front door\" page as a sentinel to indicate the beginning of a\n   session for which a Set-Cookie2 response header must be generated,\n   the page SHOULD be stored in caches \"pre-expired\" so that the origin\n   server will see further requests.  \"Private documents\", for example\n   those that contain information strictly private to a session, SHOULD\n   NOT be cached in shared caches.\n\n   If the cookie is intended for use by a single user, the Set-Cookie2\n   header SHOULD NOT be cached.  A Set-Cookie2 header that is intended\n   to be shared by multiple users MAY be cached.\n\n   The origin server SHOULD send the following additional HTTP/1.1\n   response headers, depending on circumstances:\n\n      *  To suppress caching of the Set-Cookie2 header:\n\n         Cache-control: no-cache=\"set-cookie2\"\n\n   and one of the following:\n\n      *  To suppress caching of a private document in shared caches:\n\n         Cache-control: private\n\nKristol & Montulli          Standards Track                     [Page 7]\n```\n\n---\n\n```\n\n[RFC 2965](./rfc2965)            HTTP State Management Mechanism         October 2000\n\n      *  To allow caching of a document and require that it be validated\n         before returning it to the client:\n\n         Cache-Control: must-revalidate, max-age=0\n\n      *  To allow caching of a document, but to require that proxy\n         caches (not user agent caches) validate it before returning it\n         to the client:\n\n         Cache-Control: proxy-revalidate, max-age=0\n\n      *  To allow caching of a document and request that it be validated\n         before returning it to the client (by \"pre-expiring\" it):\n\n         Cache-control: max-age=0\n\n         Not all caches will revalidate the document in every case.\n\n   HTTP/1.1 servers MUST send Expires: old-date (where old-date is a\n   date long in the past) on responses containing Set-Cookie2 response\n   headers unless they know for certain (by out of band means) that\n   there are no HTTP/1.0 proxies in the response chain.  HTTP/1.1\n   servers MAY send other Cache-Control directives that permit caching\n   by HTTP/1.1 proxies in addition to the Expires: old-date directive;\n   the Cache-Control directive will override the Expires: old-date for\n   HTTP/1.1 proxies.\n\n[3.3](#section-3.3)  User Agent Role\n\n   3.3.1  Interpreting Set-Cookie2  The user agent keeps separate track\n   of state information that arrives via Set-Cookie2 response headers\n   from each origin server (as distinguished by name or IP address and\n   port).  The user agent MUST ignore attribute-value pairs whose\n   attribute it does not recognize.  The user agent applies these\n   defaults for optional attributes that are missing:\n\n   Discard The default behavior is dictated by the presence or absence\n           of a Max-Age attribute.\n\n   Domain  Defaults to the effective request-host.

Moreover, a user agent rejects (SHALL NOT\n   store its information) if any of the following is true of the\n   attributes explicitly present in the Set-Cookie2 response header:\n\n      *  The value for the Path attribute is not a prefix of the\n         request-URI.\n\n      *  The value for the Domain attribute contains no embedded dots,\n         and the value is not .local.\n\n      *  The effective host name that derives from the request-host does\n         not domain-match the Domain attribute.\n\n      *  The request-host is a HDN (not IP address) and has the form HD,\n         where D is the value of the Domain attribute, and H is a string\n         that contains one or more dots.\n\n      *  The Port attribute has a \"port-list\", and the request-port was\n         not in the list.\n\n   Examples:\n\n      *  A Set-Cookie2 from request-host y.x.foo.com for Domain=.foo.com\n         would be rejected, because H is y.x and contains a dot.\n\n      *  A Set-Cookie2 from request-host x.foo.com for Domain=.foo.com\n         would be accepted.\n\n      *  A Set-Cookie2 with Domain=.com or Domain=.com., will always be\n         rejected, because there is no embedded dot.\n\n      *  A Set-Cookie2 with Domain=ajax.com will be accepted, and the\n         value for Domain will be taken to be .ajax.com, because a dot\n         gets prepended to the value.\n\nKristol & Montulli          Standards Track                     [Page 9]\n```\n\n---\n\n```\n\n[RFC 2965](./rfc2965)            HTTP State Management Mechanism         October 2000\n\n      *  A Set-Cookie2 with Port=\"80,8000\" will be accepted if the\n         request was made to port 80 or 8000 and will be rejected\n         otherwise.\n\n      *  A Set-Cookie2 from request-host example for Domain=.local will\n         be accepted, because the effective host name for the request-\n         host is example.local, and example.local domain-matches .local.\n\n   3.3.3  Cookie Management  If a user agent receives a Set-Cookie2\n   response header whose NAME is the same as that of a cookie it has\n   previously stored, the new cookie supersedes the old when: the old\n   and new Domain attribute values compare equal, using a case-\n   insensitive string-compare; and, the old and new Path attribute\n   values string-compare equal (case-sensitive).  However, if the Set-\n   Cookie2 has a value for Max-Age of zero, the (old and new) cookie is\n   discarded.  Otherwise a cookie persists (resources permitting) until\n   whichever happens first, then gets discarded: its Max-Age lifetime is\n   exceeded; or, if the Discard attribute is set, the user agent\n   terminates the session.\n\n   Because user agents have finite space in which to store cookies, they\n   MAY also discard older cookies to make space for newer ones, using,\n   for example, a least-recently-used algorithm, along with constraints\n   on the maximum number of cookies that each origin server may set.\n\n   If a Set-Cookie2 response header includes a Comment attribute, the\n   user agent SHOULD store that information in a human-readable form\n   with the cookie and SHOULD display the comment text as part of a\n   cookie inspection user interface.\n\n   If a Set-Cookie2 response header includes a CommentURL attribute, the\n   user agent SHOULD store that information in a human-readable form\n   with the cookie, or, preferably, SHOULD allow the user to follow the\n   http_URL link as part of a cookie inspection user interface.\n\n   The cookie inspection user interface may include a facility whereby a\n   user can decide, at the time the user agent receives the Set-Cookie2\n   response header, whether or not to accept the cookie.  A potentially\n   confusing situation could arise if the following sequence occurs:\n\n      *  the user agent receives a cookie that contains a CommentURL\n         attribute;\n\n      *  the user agent's cookie inspection interface is configured so\n         that it presents a dialog to the user before the user agent\n         accepts the cookie;\n\nKristol & Montulli          Standards Track                    [Page 10]\n```\n\n---\n\n```\n\n[RFC 2965](./rfc2965)            HTTP State Management Mechanism         October 2000\n\n      *  the dialog allows the user to follow the CommentURL link when\n         the user agent receives the cookie; and,\n\n      *  when the user follows the CommentURL link, the origin server\n         (or another server, via other links in the returned content)\n         returns another cookie.\n\n   The user agent SHOULD NOT send any cookies in this context.  The user\n   agent MAY discard any cookie it receives in this context that the\n   user has not, through some user agent mechanism, deemed acceptable.\n\n   User agents SHOULD allow the user to control cookie destruction, but\n   they MUST NOT extend the cookie's lifetime beyond that controlled by\n   the Discard and Max-Age attributes.  An infrequently-used cookie may\n   function as a \"preferences file\" for network applications, and a user\n   may wish to keep it even if it is the least-recently-used cookie. One\n   possible implementation would be an interface that allows the\n   permanent storage of a cookie through a checkbox (or, conversely, its\n   immediate destruction).\n\n   Privacy considerations dictate that the user have considerable\n   control over cookie management.  The PRIVACY section contains more\n   information.\n\n   3.3.4  Sending Cookies to the Origin Server  When it sends a request\n   to an origin server, the user agent includes a Cookie request header\n   if it has stored cookies that are applicable to the request, based on\n\n      * the request-host and request-port;\n\n      * the request-URI;\n\n      * the cookie's age.\n\n   The syntax for the header is:\n\ncookie          =  \"Cookie:\" cookie-version 1*((\";\" | \",\") cookie-value)\ncookie-value    =  NAME \"=\" VALUE [\";\" path] [\";\" domain] [\";\" port]\ncookie-version  =  \"$Version\" \"=\" value\nNAME            =  attr\nVALUE           =  value\npath            =  \"$Path\" \"=\" value\ndomain          =  \"$Domain\" \"=\" value\nport            =  \"$Port\" [ \"=\" <\"> value <\"> ]\n\n   The value of the cookie-version attribute MUST be the value from the\n   Version attribute of the corresponding Set-Cookie2 response header.\n   Otherwise the value for cookie-version is 0.

Otherwise\n   the attribute SHOULD be omitted from the Cookie request header.  The\n   value for the domain attribute MUST be the value from the Domain\n   attribute, if one was present, of the corresponding Set-Cookie2\n   response header.  Otherwise the attribute SHOULD be omitted from the\n   Cookie request header.\n\n   The port attribute of the Cookie request header MUST mirror the Port\n   attribute, if one was present, in the corresponding Set-Cookie2\n   response header.  That is, the port attribute MUST be present if the\n   Port attribute was present in the Set-Cookie2 header, and it MUST\n   have the same value, if any.  Otherwise, if the Port attribute was\n   absent from the Set-Cookie2 header, the attribute likewise MUST be\n   omitted from the Cookie request header.\n\n   Note that there is neither a Comment nor a CommentURL attribute in\n   the Cookie request header corresponding to the ones in the Set-\n   Cookie2 response header.  The user agent does not return the comment\n   information to the origin server.\n\n   The user agent applies the following rules to choose applicable\n   cookie-values to send in Cookie request headers from among all the\n   cookies it has received.\n\n   Domain Selection\n      The origin server's effective host name MUST domain-match the\n      Domain attribute of the cookie.\n\n   Port Selection\n      There are three possible behaviors, depending on the Port\n      attribute in the Set-Cookie2 response header:\n\n      1. By default (no Port attribute), the cookie MAY be sent to any\n         port.\n\n      2. If the attribute is present but has no value (e.g., Port), the\n         cookie MUST only be sent to the request-port it was received\n         from.\n\n      3. If the attribute has a port-list, the cookie MUST only be\n         returned if the new request-port is one of those listed in\n         port-list.\n\n   Path Selection\n      The request-URI MUST path-match the Path attribute of the cookie.\n\nKristol & Montulli          Standards Track                    [Page 12]\n```\n\n---\n\n```\n\n[RFC 2965](./rfc2965)            HTTP State Management Mechanism         October 2000\n\n   Max-Age Selection\n      Cookies that have expired should have been discarded and thus are\n      not forwarded to an origin server.\n\n   If multiple cookies satisfy the criteria above, they are ordered in\n   the Cookie header such that those with more specific Path attributes\n   precede those with less specific.  Ordering with respect to other\n   attributes (e.g., Domain) is unspecified.\n\n   Note: For backward compatibility, the separator in the Cookie header\n   is semi-colon (;) everywhere.  A server SHOULD also accept comma (,)\n   as the separator between cookie-values for future compatibility.\n\n   3.3.5  Identifying What Version is Understood:  Cookie2  The Cookie2\n   request header facilitates interoperation between clients and servers\n   that understand different versions
