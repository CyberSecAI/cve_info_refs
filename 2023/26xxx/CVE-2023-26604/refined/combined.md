The following article describes common security issues regarding misconfigured sudoers’ files. The article focuses on a single entry which contains several security issues:

```
hacker10 ALL= (root) /bin/less /var/log/*
```

[![](https://blog.compass-security.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/main1.png "main")](https://blog.compass-security.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/main1.png)

The article is split into the following five chapters:

* [PART 1: Command Execution](https://blog.compass-security.com/2012/10/dangerous-sudoer-entries-part-1-command-execution/ "PART 1: Command Execution")
* **PART 2: Insecure Functionality**
* [PART 3: Permissions](https://blog.compass-security.com/2012/10/dangerous-sudoers-entries-part-3-permissions/)
* [PART 4: Wildcards](https://blog.compass-security.com/2012/10/dangerous-sudoers-entries-part-4-wildcards/)
* [PART 5: Recapitulation](https://blog.compass-security.com/2012/10/dangerous-sudoers-entries-part-5-recapitulation/)

In this article we are going to focus on insecure functionality “less” offers. The example with “less” is just to illustrate that the functionality of each application we use with “sudo” has to be checked carefully to ensure that a malicious user won’t be able to abuse it.

“less” offers a command to read other files on the system. Again, the current permissions of “less” are used to read these files.

Excerpt from the man page:

```
:e [filename]

Examine a new file. If the filename is missing, the "current" file
(see the :n and :p commands below) from the list of files in the
command line is re-examined. A percent sign (%) in the filename
is replaced by the name of the current file. A pound sign (#) is
replaced by the name of the previously examined file. However, two
consecutive percent signs are simply replaced with a single percent
sign. This allows you to enter a filename that contains a percent
sign in the name. Similarly, two consecutive pound signs are
replaced with a single pound sign. The filename is inserted into
the command line list of files so that it can be seen by subsequent
:n and :p commands. If the filename consists of several files, they
are all inserted into the list of files and the first one is
examined. If the filename contains one or more spaces, the entire
filename should be enclosed in double quotes (also see the -"
option).
```

In the following example the /etc/shadow file has been read.

[![](https://blog.compass-security.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/examine.png "examine")](https://blog.compass-security.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/examine.png)

[![](https://blog.compass-security.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/shadow.png "shadow")](https://blog.compass-security.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/shadow.png)

**Solution**

The environment variable “LESSSECURE” can be set to “1” to disable dangerous features of “less”.

Excerpt from the man pages:

```
When the environment variable LESSSECURE is set to 1, less
runs in a "secure" mode. This means these features are disabled:
!      the shell command
|      the pipe command
:e     the examine command.
v      the editing command
s -o  log files
-k     use of lesskey files
-t     use of tags files
metacharacters in filenames, such as *
filename completion (TAB, ^L)
Less can also be compiled to be permanently in "secure" mode.
```

There are now two steps we have to take to ensure that this works as expected. First, the current user must have the “LESSSECURE” environment variable set as read-only. Otherwise the user would be able to change its value. This can be achieved by adding the following line to a file in the path “/etc/profile.d/”. We use a new file called “/etc/profile.d/lesssecure.sh” and add the following content:

```
LESSSECURE=1
readonly LESSSECURE
export LESSSECURE
```

The second step is to tell “sudo” to keep the “LESSSECURE” variable from the user. This is achieved by adding the *env\_keep* option in the sudoer’s file:

```
Defaults        env_reset, env_keep=LESSSECURE
```

The following message appears now if someone tries to use one of the insecure commands.

On one of the pentest project, an unprivileged account was accessed on rhel 8. It was spelled out in sudoers that the command /usr/bin/systemctl status \*random\_service\* could be run from mine user. Coincidentally, the size of my terminal turned out to be small. There is a feature in systemctl which outputs information to pager less instead of cat if the size of the terminal is less than the length of any line output. Pager less has the ability to execute commands, in example you can triger new shell with command !sh.

## Why it works?

Rhel 8.x and ubuntu use 20.x systemd 245. System 245 does not check the eUID and UID , which coupled with misconfig in /etc/sudoers allows for local privilege escalation. This works not only with *systemctl status*, but also with the other commands that systemd supplies.
A screenshot to prove my point below:

![]()

LPE in ubuntu 20.04.5 through misconfiguration in /etc/sudoers

## Fixes

Update systemd at least to systemd 247

Safeguards have been added to systemd 247 to prevent commands from being executed if the eUID is different from the UID. [Link](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/blob/main/NEWS#L4335) to check it.
And just in case, I’ll duplicate it here:

> The autopaging logic in systemd’s various tools (such as systemctl) has been updated to turn on “secure” mode in “less”(i.e. $LESSECURE=1) if execution in a “sudo” environment is detected. This disables invoking external programs from the pager, via the pipe logic. This behaviour may be overridden via the new $SYSTEMD\_PAGERSECURE environment variable.

Ubuntu 22.x uses systemd 249, so it’s not possible to elevate privileges locally in this way on this version
