### @StephGit **[StephGit](/StephGit)** commented [Dec 15, 2022](#issue-1498237889)

With this pull request, the freemarker-template-processor prevents the usage of `api()` and `new()`-functions in template-expressions with the updated configuration and limits server-side-code-execution.

Sorry, something went wrong.
