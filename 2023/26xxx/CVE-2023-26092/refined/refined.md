The provided content describes a fix for a Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability in the `liimaorg/liima` project. The vulnerability was present due to the usage of the Freemarker template engine, which allowed for the execution of arbitrary code through template expressions.

Here's a breakdown:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The use of the Freemarker template engine without proper restrictions on its functionality.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability.
- Unrestricted use of Freemarker template expressions, specifically the `api()` and `new()` functions, which could lead to server-side code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary server-side code execution
- Complete system compromise

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious input via template expressions in Freemarker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to inject malicious template expressions into a field processed by the vulnerable Freemarker template engine.

**Mitigation:**
- The vulnerability was mitigated by updating the Freemarker template processor configuration to prevent the usage of `api()` and `new()` functions in template expressions, thereby limiting server-side code execution.
