- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin is missing proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to execute actions on behalf of authenticated users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor could force higher privileged users to perform unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious request that targets a vulnerable endpoint of the plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to trick an authenticated user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website that makes the crafted request. The user must be logged in to the vulnerable website.
