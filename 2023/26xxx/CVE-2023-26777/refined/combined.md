Edit Status Page 2. Footer text: <script></script> 3. Save and json is added to top of the page. 4. Console error: Uncaught SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token  üëÄ Expected behavior window.preloadData should escape script to avoid parse error üòì Actual Behavior window.preloadData crashes when script tag is in Footer Text. üêª Uptime-Kuma Version 1.18.0 üíª Operating System and Arch Windows 10 üåê Browser Edge latest üêã Docker Version *No response* üü© NodeJS Version *No response* üìù Relevant log output *No response* |

| ~~window.preloadData did parse to an JSON object. The real problem is that, cheerio removed the end tag unexpectedly.~~  Oh no, just spent some time on it. In the past, I always think JSON.stringify is the best way to escape. Turned out it is not. It is more complex than I thought.  <https://www.man42.net/blog/2016/12/safely-escape-user-data-in-a-script-tag/> |
