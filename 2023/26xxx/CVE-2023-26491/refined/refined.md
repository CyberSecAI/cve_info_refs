Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-26491:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of URL parameters, specifically the `brief` parameter, within the RSSHub application. When this parameter contains special characters, it triggers an error page that doesn't sanitize the input, leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XSS Vulnerability:** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. The application displays user-provided input within the error message without proper sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can craft a malicious URL that, when accessed by a user, will execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser. This could lead to various attacks, including session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious websites.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is a crafted URL. The attacker must create a URL with a malicious value for the `brief` parameter, then entice a victim to click on this URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to generate a URL and deliver it to a victim. The attacker does not need any special access to the application itself. They need to be able to get the victim to access the crafted URL.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `lib/middleware/parameter.js` file.
- The fix involves properly sanitizing the input within the error message to prevent the execution of malicious scripts.
- The vulnerability was fixed in commit `c910c4d28717fb860fbe064736641f379fab2c91`
- The vulnerability is considered to be of moderate severity.
