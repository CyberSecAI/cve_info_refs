The provided content is related to CVE-2023-26338.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds read
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists. This means the software is attempting to read data from a memory location outside the bounds of the allocated buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exploitation can lead to a memory leak. The severity is rated as "Important" with a CVSS base score of 5.5. While the specific impact of a memory leak is not detailed here, it generally implies that sensitive information could be read by an attacker, which may facilitate further attacks.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local (AV:L), meaning the attacker needs local access to the system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires no privileges (PR:N) and a user interaction (UI:R) is needed for the exploit to occur. This likely means the user must perform an action, such as opening a malicious file, that triggers the vulnerability.
