- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Out-of-bounds Read (CWE-125)
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Memory leak.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local, requiring user interaction, with no special privileges needed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need a user to open a specially crafted file, or other means of triggering the out-of-bounds read. The attacker does not need any privileges or special access other than the ability to make the user interact with a malicious file.
