Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from unsanitized user-controlled input within the `filter[Query][terms][0][attr]` query string parameter in the `/zm/index.php` endpoint. This input is directly concatenated into an SQL query without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection (CWE-89). The lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code through the `filter[Query][terms][0][attr]` parameter.
- **Blind SQL Injection:** The specific type of SQL injection is blind, as indicated in the description. This means that the attacker cannot directly see the results of their injected queries, but can still exploit the vulnerability through techniques like time-based or boolean-based exploitation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary SQL Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the affected database.
- **Unauthorized Data Access/Modification:** This can lead to unauthorized access and modification of sensitive data.
- **Authentication/Authorization Bypass:** Attackers could bypass authentication or authorization mechanisms.
- **Remote Code Execution (Potentially):** The description mentions that remote code execution is a possible impact, although it's not explicitly demonstrated in the provided proof-of-concept.
**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, meaning the attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely.
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/zm/index.php` endpoint.
- **`filter[Query][terms][0][attr]` Parameter:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code using this specific query string parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable ZoneMinder instance.
- **View/Edit Permissions for Events:** The attacker must have at least "View" or "Edit" permissions for Events within the ZoneMinder application.
- **Knowledge of SQL Injection:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL injection techniques to craft malicious payloads.
- **No User Interaction:** No user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The content provides a detailed proof of concept demonstrating both time-based and boolean-based SQL injection. This goes beyond a simple description.
- The vulnerability is present in ZoneMinder versions <= 1.36.32 and < 1.37.33.
- Patched versions are 1.36.33 and 1.37.33.
- The vulnerable code is located in `web/ajax/events.php`, specifically at line 192.
