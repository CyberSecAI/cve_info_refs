Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-26818:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of the "hardened" flag in the Telegram application for macOS. This means that the application does not have the Hardened Runtime enabled, which makes it vulnerable to Dynamic Library (Dylib) injection via the `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES` environment variable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Hardened Runtime:** The Telegram app on macOS is not built with Hardened Runtime, a security feature designed to prevent code injection and other tampering.
*   **Unrestricted Dylib Loading:** Because of the absence of the hardened flag, the application will load any Dylib specified via `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES` environment variable, without validating its signature.
*   **TCC Bypass:** By injecting a custom Dylib, an attacker can leverage the existing permissions granted to the Telegram application to access privacy-protected resources like the camera and microphone.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privacy Violation:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the user's camera and microphone, record video and audio without the user's knowledge or explicit consent.
*   **Local Privilege Escalation:** By using a LaunchAgent to execute the vulnerable application with the injected Dylib, the attacker can bypass the Terminal's sandbox restrictions and execute code with the permissions of the Telegram application, which may have more access than the terminal itself, effectively escalating local privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker with local access to the macOS system.
*   **Environment Variable Manipulation:** The attacker uses the `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES` environment variable to specify the path to the malicious Dylib.
*   **LaunchAgent:** The attacker utilizes a LaunchAgent to execute the vulnerable Telegram application outside the restrictive sandbox environment of the Terminal.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the target macOS system.
*   **File Creation:** The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious Dylib and save it on the filesystem.
*   **LaunchAgent Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to create and load a LaunchAgent.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The blog post provides a detailed walkthrough of how the exploit was developed, including code samples for the Dylib and the LaunchAgent configuration.
*   The vulnerability was discovered on 03/02/2023 and reported to MITRE on 10/02/2023 after failing to get a response from Telegram security team.
*   The exploit bypasses macOS's Transparency, Consent, and Control (TCC) framework.
*   Even root users are restricted from accessing the camera or microphone without explicit user consent, highlighting the importance of the TCC and the severity of bypassing it with this exploit.
* The vulnerability can be exploited in order to record the user even if the user is not currently running or interacting with Telegram. This was demonstrated by the usage of `LaunchAgent`.
