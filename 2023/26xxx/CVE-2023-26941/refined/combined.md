Technical Report – CVE-2022-46480, CVE-2023-26941, CVE-2023-26942,
and CVE-2023-26943

Introduction
The  following  technical  report  provides  background  information  relating  to  four  CVEs  found  in  the
following products:

Ultraloq UL3 BT (2nd Generation) (Firmware 02.27.0012) – CVE-2022-46480

Yale Conexis L1 Smart Lock (Firmware v1.1.0) – CVE-2023-26941

Yale IA-210 Intruder Alarm (Firmware v1.0) – CVE-2023-26942

Yale Keyless Smart Lock (Firmware v1.0) – CVE-2023-26943

The work discussed here was carried out by Ash Allen, Dr. Alexios Mylonas, and Dr. Stilianos Vidalis as part
of a wider research project into smart device security. Responsible disclosure of all four issues has been
made with the appropriate vendors, and they have been acknowledged as vulnerabilities.

CVE-2022-46480
The Ultraloq UL3 BT (2nd Generation) (hereafter referred to as the UL3) is one of the most popular smart
locks in the United States (“#1 Selling Smart Lock Online” - https://u-tec.com/). Previous non-academic
research1  discusses  flaws  found  with  the  companion app,  and  the  ability  to  brute-force  the  Bluetooth
encryption. Our work uncovered an even more fundamental flaw with the Bluetooth implementation. The
device unlocks by receiving a 16-byte value to a service specified via the GATT (General ATTribute Profile).
Our work uncovers that this value is changed on a per session basis, rather than per unlock event. This
means that whilst a session remains open, unlock commands using replayed data will be successful, even
if they do not come from the original client.

Furthermore, our work uncovered poor session management while a user attempts to unlock the device.
We were able to force sessions to remain open for more than 12 minutes, giving an attacker plenty of
opportunity to exploit the vulnerability.

CVE-2023-26941
The Yale Conexis L1 was until recently the flagship model of the Yale smart lock range (the Conexis L2 has
now  taken  that  spot).  Winning  plaudits  in  many  consumer  surveys234,  the  Conexis  L1  has  a  significant
number  of  installed  units.  The  Conexis  L1  uses  standard  Mifare  Classic  1K  cards  (larger  cards  can  be
provisioned, but the extra space is not required and is not used). Initial setup is done using a master key
card. We were able to crack the encryption on the card using a Proxmark3. Easy RFID development tool
and dump the contents to a text file. The first seven blocks on the card use non-standard encryption keys
(the default is FFFFFFFFFFFF). We were able to recover these within 20 seconds in almost every case. Data
was written in several places, all of which protected by the non-default keys. During the initial pairing
process  a  counter  is  incremented  in  block  2.  This  is incremented  again  after  each  factory  reset  of  the
device, as demonstrated below:

"blocks": {
"0": "95E43AA5EE08040002E9981FA7F5D11D",
"1": "095FCA99D806ECCEB9328A6466CA3D10",
"2": "08080700000000000000000000000000",

"blocks": {
"0": "95E43AA5EE08040002E9981FA7F5D11D",
"1": "095FCA99D806ECCEB9328A6466CA3D10",
"2": "09090700000000000000000000000000",

Of greater interest is a batch of data written to a pair of neighboring blocks, the locations of which are
chosen  at  random  during  the  initial  pairing  of  the  RFID  tag.  These  values  are  updated  in  a  “tick-tock”
manner during the unlock process:

"4": "F55129991B0000000000000000000000",
"5": "60E0E0E0870000000000000000000000",

"4": "FF931B6B230000000000000000000000",
"5": "60E0E0E0870000000000000000000000",

"4": "FF931B6B230000000000000000000000",
"5": "E6EEBEDE6F0000000000000000000000",

"4": "3070F0F0470000000000000000000000",
"5": "E6EEBEDE6F0000000000000000000000",

If the values in these blocks are altered in any way, then the card will not work. We were able to create
duplicate cards from the text file dump and were able to successfully open the lock. Additionally, as data
on the duplicate card was updated as part of the unlock process, the original card is locked out and no

longer works. The reverse is also true – if the original card is used before the duplicate then the duplicate
will fail to open the lock.

CVE-2023-26942
The Yale IA-210 intruder alarm is a consumer-grade device designed for home installation. The keypad
supports  both  PIN  entry  and  RFID  tag  disarming.  Investigating  the  tag  provided  with  the  device,  we
attempted to dump the contents to a text file. Investigation showed that all sectors were using the default
encryption key (the sector 0 key can be seen in block 3):

[=] ----+-------------------------------------------------+
[=] blk | data                                            |
[=] ----+-------------------------------------------------+
[=]   0 | 3D 06 CD 45 B3 88 04 00 C8 42 00 20 00 00 00 16 |
[=]   1 | 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |
[=]   2 | 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |
[=]   3 | FF FF FF FF FF FF FF 07 80 69 FF FF FF FF FF FF |

This makes cloning the fob incredibly easy – it is possible to clone the tag with an NFC-enabled mobile
phone or a dedicated cloning tool with just a couple of seconds access to the tag. The only authentication
step performed by the alarm is to ensure that the tag can be decrypted using the default keys, and that
the contents of block 0 also match. This block is read-only and contains data that can be used to identify
the tag. Special tags known as “magic” tags are available, and these allow the rewriting of this sector. This
is how we are able to duplicate the original tag.

CVE-2023-26943
The Yale Keyless Smart Lock is a mid-range device that supports PIN entry, RFID, and 868MHz RF remote
control via an optional add-in module. As with the Conexis L1, this lock uses RFID tags with a non-default
set of encryption keys for the first seven sectors, as shown below:

[+] -----+-----+--------------+---+--------------+----
[+]  Sec | Blk | key A        |res| key B        |res
[+] -----+-----+--------------+---+--------------+----
[+]  000 | 003 | 681E9E9B3FE9 | N | FFFFFFFFFFFF | D
[+]  001 | 007 | ADAE73113441 | N | FFFFFFFFFFFF | D
[+]  002 | 011 | 6C6FAAC8E598 | N | FFFFFFFFFFFF | D
[+]  003 | 015 | BFBCF91B36CB | N | FFFFFFFFFFFF | D
[+]  004 | 019 | 58599AF4D3A4 | N | FFFFFFFFFFFF | D
[+]  005 | 023 | 828340E60956 | N | FFFFFFFFFFFF | D
[+]  006 | 027 | 5F5E9D3BD48B | N | FFFFFFFFFFFF | D
[+]  007 | 031 | FFFFFFFFFFFF | D | FFFFFFFFFFFF | D
[+]  008 | 035 | FFFFFFFFFFFF | D | FFFFFFFFFFFF | D
[+]  009 | 039 | FFFFFFFFFFFF | D | FFFFFFFFFFFF | D
[+]  010 | 043 | FFFFFFFFFFFF | D | FFFFFFFFFFFF | D
[+]  011 | 047 | FFFFFFFFFFFF | D | FFFFFFFFFFFF | D
[+]  012 | 051 | FFFFFFFFFFFF | D | FFFFFFFFFFFF | D
[+]  013 | 055 | FFFFFFFFFFFF | D | FFFFFFFFFFFF | D
[+]  014 | 059 | FFFFFFFFFFFF | D | FFFFFFFFFFFF | D
[+]  015 | 063 | FFFFFFFFFFFF | D | FFFFFFFFFFFF | D
[+] -----+-----+--------------+---+--------------+----

Unlike  the  Conexis  L1,  however,  no  extra  data  is  written  on  the  tag.  During  authentication  the  tag  is
decrypted using the given encryption keys, then checking that the data in block 0 matches that stored
during the initial pairing of the tag. We were able to consistently duplicate these tags with approximately
20  seconds  of  access to  the  original  tag.  Furthermore,  once  duplicated,  no  indication  of  duplication  is
given to the original user. There is no audit log available, and users are not alerted of duplicate tag usage.

Unlike with the Conexis L1, there is no tripwire (the “tick-tock” updates) that can be triggered to indicate
that a duplicate card exists.

   Prostate segmentation from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a challenging task. In recent years, several network architectures have been proposed to automate this process and alleviate the burden of manual annotation. Although the performance of these models has achieved promising results, there is still room for improvement before these models can be used safely and effectively in clinical practice. One of the major challenges in prostate MR image segmentation is the presence of class imbalance in the image labels where the background pixels dominate over the prostate. In the present work we propose a DL-based pipeline for cropping the region around the prostate from MRI images to produce a more balanced distribution of the foreground pixels (prostate) and the background pixels and improve segmentation accuracy. The effect of DL-cropping for improving the segmentation performance compared to standard center-cropping is assessed using five popular DL networks for prostate segmentation, namely U-net, U-net+, Res Unet++, Bridge U-net and Dense U-net. The proposed smart-cropping outperformed the standard center cropping in terms of segmentation accuracy for all the evaluated prostate segmentation networks. In terms of Dice score, the highest improvement was achieved for the U-net+ and ResU-net++ architectures corresponding to 8.9% and 8%, respectively.

   Cooperation is fundamental to the evolution of human society. We regularly observe cooperative behaviour in everyday life and in controlled experiments with anonymous people, even though standard economic models predict that they should deviate from the collective interest and act so as to maximise their own individual payoff. However, there is typically heterogeneity across subjects: some may cooperate, while others may not. Since individual factors promoting cooperation could be used by institutions to indirectly prime cooperation, this heterogeneity raises the important question of who these cooperators are. We have conducted a series of experiments to study whether benevolence, defined as a unilateral act of paying a cost to increase the welfare of someone else beyond one's own, is related to cooperation in a subsequent one-shot anonymous Prisoner's dilemma. Contrary to the predictions of the widely used inequity aversion models, we find that benevolence does exist and a large majority of people behave this way. We also find benevolence to be correlated with cooperative behaviour. Finally, we show a causal link between benevolence and cooperation: priming people to think positively about benevolent behaviour makes them significantly more cooperative than priming them to think malevolently. Thus benevolent people exist and cooperate more.

   This presentation covered the benefits of registering astronomy research software with the Astrophysics Source Code Library (ASCL, ascl.net), a free online registry for software used in astronomy research. Indexed by ADS and Clarivate's Web of Science, the ASCL currently contains over 3600 codes, and its entries have been cited over 17,000 times. Registering your code with the ASCL is easy with our online submissions system. Making your software available for examination shows confidence in your research and makes your research more transparent, reproducible, and falsifiable. ASCL registration allows your software to be cited on its own merits and provides a citation method that is trackable and accepted by all astronomy journals, and by journals such as \textit{Science} and \textit{Nature}. Adding your code to the ASCL also allows others to find your code more easily, as it can then be found not only in the ASCL itself, but also in ADS, Web of Science, and Google Scholar.

   Many people expect robots to move fairly quietly, or make pleasant "beep boop" sounds or jingles similar to what they have observed in videos of robots. Unfortunately, this expectation of quietness does not match reality, as robots make machine sounds, known as 'consequential sounds', as they move and operate. As robots become more prevalent within society, understanding the sounds produced by robots and how these sounds are perceived by people is becoming increasingly important for positive human robot interactions (HRI). This paper investigates how people respond to the consequential sounds of robots, specifically how robots make a participant feel, how much they like the robot, would be distracted by the robot, and a person's desire to colocate with robots. Participants were shown 5 videos of different robots and asked their opinions on the robots and the sounds they made. This was compared with a control condition of completely silent videos. The results in this paper demonstrate with data from 182 participants (858 trials) that consequential sounds produced by robots have a significant negative effect on human perceptions of robots. Firstly there were increased negative 'associated affects' of the participants, such as making them feel more uncomfortable or agitated around the robot. Secondly, the presence of consequential sounds correlated with participants feeling more distracted and less able to focus. Thirdly participants reported being less likely to want to colocate in a shared environment with robots.

   Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a prevalent chronic liver disorder characterized by the excessive accumulation of fat in the liver in individuals who do not consume significant amounts of alcohol, including risk factors like obesity, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, etc. We aim to identify subgroups of NAFLD patients based on demographic, clinical, and genetic characteristics for precision medicine. The genomic and phenotypic data (3,408 cases and 4,739 controls) for this study were gathered from participants in Mayo Clinic Tapestry Study (IRB#19-000001) and their electric health records, including their demographic, clinical, and comorbidity data, and the genotype information through whole exome sequencing performed at Helix using the Exome+$^\circledR$ Assay according to standard procedure (www$.$helix$.$com). Factors highly relevant to NAFLD were determined by the chi-square test and stepwise backward-forward regression model. Latent class analysis (LCA) was performed on NAFLD cases using significant indicator variables to identify subgroups. The optimal clustering revealed 5 latent subgroups from 2,013 NAFLD patients (mean age 60.6 years and 62.1% women), while a polygenic risk score based on 6 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variants and disease outcomes were used to analyze the subgroups. The groups are characterized by metabolic syndrome, obesity, different comorbidities, psychoneurological factors, and genetic factors. Odds ratios were utilized to compare the risk of complex diseases, such as fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), as well as liver failure between the clusters. Cluster 2 has a significantly higher complex disease outcome compared to other clusters.
   Keywords: Fatty liver disease; Polygenic risk score; Precision medicine; Deep phenotyping; NAFLD comorbidities; Latent class analysis.

   Learning from data has led to substantial advances in a multitude of disciplines, including text and multimedia search, speech recognition, and autonomous-vehicle navigation. Can machine learning enable similar leaps in the natural and social sciences? This is certainly the expectation in many scientific fields and recent years have seen a plethora of applications of non-linear models to a wide range of datasets. However, flexible non-linear solutions will not always improve upon manually adding transforms and interactions between variables to linear regression models. We discuss how to recognize this before constructing a data-driven model and how such analysis can help us move to intrinsically interpretable regression models. Furthermore, for a variety of applications in the natural and social sciences we demonstrate why improvements may be seen with more complex regression models and why they may not.

   Zebrafish are a common model organism used to identify new disease therapeutics. High-throughput drug screens can be performed on larval zebrafish in multi-well plates by observing changes in behaviour following a treatment. Analysis of this behaviour can be difficult, however, due to the high dimensionality of the data obtained. Statistical analysis of individual statistics (such as the distance travelled) is generally not powerful enough to detect meaningful differences between treatment groups. Here, we propose a method for classifying zebrafish models of Parkinson's disease by genotype at 5 days old. Using a set of 2D behavioural features, we train a multi-layer perceptron neural network. We further show that the use of integrated gradients can give insight into the impact of each behaviour feature on genotype classifications by the model. In this way, we provide a novel pipeline for classifying zebrafish larvae, beginning with feature preparation and ending with an impact analysis of said features.

   Studies of dynamics on temporal networks often represent the network as a series of "snapshots," static networks active for short durations of time. We argue that successive snapshots can be aggregated if doing so has little effect on the overlying dynamics. We propose a method to compress network chronologies by progressively combining pairs of snapshots whose matrix commutators have the smallest dynamical effect. We apply this method to epidemic modeling on real contact tracing data and find that it allows for significant compression while remaining faithful to the epidemic dynamics.

   The Astrophysics Source Code Library (ASCL ascl.net), started in 1999, is a free open registry of software used in refereed astronomy research. Over the past few years, it has spearheaded an effort to form a consortium of scientific software registries and repositories. In 2019 and 2020, ASCL contacted editors and maintainers of discipline and institutional software registries and repositories in math, biology, neuroscience, geophysics, remote sensing, and other fields to develop a list of best practices for these research software resources. At the completion of that project, performed as a Task Force for a FORCE11 working group, members decided to form SciCodes as an ongoing consortium. This presentation covered the consortium's work so far, what it is currently working on, what it hopes to achieve for making scientific research software more discoverable across disciplines, and how the consortium can benefit astronomers.

    Software citation has accelerated in astrophysics in the past decade, resulting in the field now having multiple trackable ways to cite computational methods. Yet most software authors do not specify how they would like their code to be cited, while others specify a citation method that is not easily tracked (or tracked at all) by most indexers. Two metadata file formats, codemeta.json and CITATION.cff, developed in 2016 and 2017 respectively, are useful for specifying how software should be cited. In 2020, the Astrophysics Source Code Library (ASCL, ascl.net) undertook a year-long effort to generate and send these software metadata files, specific to each computational method, to code authors for editing and inclusion on their code sites. We wanted to answer the question, "Would sending these files to software authors increase adoption of one, the other, or both of these metadata files?" The answer in this case was no. Furthermore, only 41% of the 135 code sites examined for use of these files had citation information in any form available. The lack of such information creates an obstacle for article authors to provide credit to software creators, thus hindering citation of and recognition for computational contributions to research and the scientists who develop and maintain software.

    Robots are increasingly being deployed in public spaces. However, the general population rarely has the opportunity to nominate what they would prefer or expect a robot to do in these contexts. Since most people have little or no experience interacting with a robot, it is not surprising that robots deployed in the real world may fail to gain acceptance or engage their intended users. To address this issue, we examine users' understanding of robots in public spaces and their expectations of appropriate uses of robots in these spaces. Furthermore, we investigate how these perceptions and expectations change as users engage and interact with a robot. To support this goal, we conducted a participatory design workshop in which participants were actively involved in the prototyping and testing of a robot's behaviours in simulation and on the physical robot. Our work highlights how social and interaction contexts influence users' perception of robots in public spaces and how users' design and understanding of what are appropriate robot behaviors shifts as they observe the enactment of their designs.

    Scientific software registries and repositories serve various roles in their respective disciplines. These resources improve software discoverability and research transparency, provide information for software citations, and foster preservation of computational methods that might otherwise be lost over time, thereby supporting research reproducibility and replicability. However, developing these resources takes effort, and few guidelines are available to help prospective creators of registries and repositories. To address this need, we present a set of nine best practices that can help managers define the scope, practices, and rules that govern individual registries and repositories. These best practices were distilled from the experiences of the creators of existing resources, convened by a Task Force of the FORCE11 Software Citation Implementation Working Group during the years 2019-2020. We believe that putting in place specific policies such as those presented here will help scientific software registries and repositories better serve their users and their disciplines.

    Software is the most used instrument in astronomy, and organizations such as NASA and the Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Physics (HITS) fund, develop, and release research software. NASA, for example, has created sites such as code.nasa.gov to share its software with the world, but how easy is it to see what NASA has? Until recently, searching NASA's Astrophysics Data System (ADS) for NASA astronomy research software has not been fruitful. Through its ADAP program, NASA funded the Astrophysics Source Code Library to improve the discoverability of these codes. Adding institutional tags to ASCL entries makes it easy to find this software not only in the ASCL but also in ADS and other services that index the ASCL. This presentation covered the changes the ASCL made as a result of this funding and how you can use the results of this work to better find organizational software in ASCL and ADS.

    The increasing presence of robots alongside humans, such as in human-robot teams in manufacturing, gives rise to research questions about the kind of behaviors people prefer in their robot counterparts. We term actions that support interaction by reducing future interference with others as supportive robot actions and investigate their utility in a co-located manipulation scenario. We compare two robot modes in a shared table pick-and-place task: (1) Task-oriented: the robot only takes actions to further its own task objective and (2) Supportive: the robot sometimes prefers supportive actions to task-oriented ones when they reduce future goal-conflicts. Our experiments in simulation, using a simplified human model, reveal that supportive actions reduce the interference between agents, especially in more difficult tasks, but also cause the robot to take longer to complete the task. We implemented these modes on a physical robot in a user study where a human and a robot perform object placement on a shared table. Our results show that a supportive robot was perceived as a more favorable coworker by the human and also reduced interference with the human in the more difficult of two scenarios. However, it also took longer to complete the task highlighting an interesting trade-off between task-efficiency and human-preference that needs to be considered before designing robot behavior for close-proximity manipulation scenarios.

    Astrophysics papers often rely on software which may or may not be available, and URLs are often used as proxy citations for software and data. We extracted all URLs from two journals' 2015 research articles, removed those from certain long-term reliable domains, and tested the remainder to determine what percentage of these URLs were accessible in October 2018.

    AutoML serves as the bridge between varying levels of expertise when designing machine learning systems and expedites the data science process. A wide range of techniques is taken to address this, however there does not exist an objective comparison of these techniques. We present a benchmark of current open source AutoML solutions using open source datasets. We test auto-sklearn, TPOT, auto\_ml, and H2O's AutoML solution against a compiled set of regression and classification datasets sourced from OpenML and find that auto-sklearn performs the best across classification datasets and TPOT performs the best across regression datasets.

    We examined software usage in a sample set of astrophysics research articles published in 2015 and searched for source code for the software mentioned in these research papers. We categorized the software to indicate whether source code is available for download and whether there are restrictions to accessing it, and if source code is not available, whether some other form of the software, such as a binary, is. We also extracted hyperlinks from one journal's 2015 research articles, as links in articles can serve as an acknowledgment of software use and lead to data used in the research, and tested them to determine which of these URLs are still accessible. For our sample of 715 software instances in the 166 articles we examined, we were able to categorize 418 records as to availability of source code and found that 285 unique codes were used, 58% of which offer source code available online for download. Of the 2,558 hyperlinks extracted from 1,669 research articles, at best, 90% of them were available over our testing period.

    Broad efforts are underway to capture metadata about research software and retain it across services; notable in this regard is the CodeMeta project. What metadata are important to have about (research) software? What metadata are useful for searching for codes? What would you like to learn about astronomy software? This BoF sought to gather information on metadata most desired by researchers and users of astro software and others interested in registering, indexing, capturing, and doing research on this software. Information from this BoF could conceivably result in changes to the Astrophysics Source Code Library (ASCL) or other resources for the benefit of the community or provide input into other projects concerned with software metadata.

    The past year has seen movement on several fronts for improving software citation, including the Center for Open Science's Transparency and Openness Promotion (TOP) Guidelines, the Software Publishing Special Interest Group that was started at January's AAS meeting in Seattle at the request of that organization's Working Group on Astronomical Software, a Sloan-sponsored meeting at GitHub in San Francisco to begin work on a cohesive research software citation-enabling platform, the work of Force11 to "transform and improve" research communication, and WSSSPE's ongoing efforts that include software publication, citation, credit, and sustainability.
    Brief reports on these efforts were shared at the BoF, after which participants discussed ideas for improving software citation, generating a list of recommendations to the community of software authors, journal publishers, ADS, and research authors. The discussion, recommendations, and feedback will help form recommendations for software citation to those publishers represented in the Software Publishing Special Interest Group and the broader community.

    The Astrophysics Source Code Library (ASCL; ascl.net) is a free online registry of codes used in astronomy research; it currently contains over 900 codes and is indexed by ADS. The ASCL has recently moved a new infrastructure into production. The new site provides a true database for the code entries and integrates the WordPress news and information pages and the discussion forum into one site. Previous capabilities are retained and permalinks to ascl.net continue to work. This improvement offers more functionality and flexibility than the previous site, is easier to maintain, and offers new possibilities for collaboration. This presentation covers these recent changes to the ASCL.

    What lessons can be learned from examining numerous efforts to create a repository or directory of scientist-written software for a discipline? Astronomy has seen a number of efforts to build such a resource, one of which is the Astrophysics Source Code Library (ASCL). The ASCL (ascl.net) was founded in 1999, had a period of dormancy, and was restarted in 2010. When taking over responsibility for the ASCL in 2010, the new editor sought to answer the opening question, hoping this would better inform the work to be done. We also provide specific steps the ASCL is taking to try to improve code sharing and discovery in astronomy and share recent improvements to the resource.

BoF session, participants separated into groups to brainstorm ideas to mitigate factors which inhibit code sharing and nurture those which encourage code sharing. The BoF concluded with the sharing of ideas that arose from the brainstorming sessions and a brief summary by the moderator.

    The Astrophysics Source Code Library (ASCL, http://ascl.net/) is an online registry of over 700 source codes that are of interest to astrophysicists, with more being added regularly. The ASCL actively seeks out codes as well as accepting submissions from the code authors, and all entries are citable and indexed by ADS. All codes have been used to generate results published in or submitted to a refereed journal and are available either via a download site or froman identified source. In addition to being the largest directory of scientist-written astrophysics programs available, the ASCL is also an active participant in the reproducible research movement with presentations at various conferences, numerous blog posts and a journal article. This poster provides a description of the ASCL and the changes that we are starting to see in the astrophysics community as a result of the work we are doing.

    While software and algorithms have become increasingly important in astronomy, the majority of authors who publish computational astronomy research do not share the source code they develop, making it difficult to replicate and reuse the work. In this paper we discuss the importance of sharing scientific source code with the entire astrophysics community, and propose that journals require authors to make their code publicly available when a paper is published. That is, we suggest that a paper that involves a computer program not be accepted for publication unless the source code becomes publicly available. The adoption of such a policy by editors, editorial boards, and reviewers will improve the ability to replicate scientific results, and will also make the computational astronomy methods more available to other researchers who wish to apply them to their data.

    The Astrophysics Source Code Library (ASCL), founded in 1999, is a free on-line registry for source codes of interest to astronomers and astrophysicists. The library is housed on the discussion forum for Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) and can be accessed at http://ascl.net. The ASCL has a comprehensive listing that covers a significant number of the astrophysics source codes used to generate results published in or submitted to refereed journals and continues to grow. The ASCL currently has entries for over 500 codes; its records are citable and are indexed by ADS. The editors of the ASCL and members of its Advisory Committee were on hand at a demonstration table in the ADASS poster room to present the ASCL, accept code submissions, show how the ASCL is starting to be used by the astrophysics community, and take questions on and suggestions for improving the resource.

    Progress is being made in code discoverability and preservation, but as discussed at ADASS XXI, many codes still remain hidden from public view. With the Astrophysics Source Code Library (ASCL) now indexed by the SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS), the introduction of a new journal, Astronomy & Computing, focused on astrophysics software, and the increasing success of education efforts such as Software Carpentry and SciCoder, the community has the opportunity to set a higher standard for its science by encouraging the release of software for examination and possible reuse. We assembled representatives of the community to present issues inhibiting code release and sought suggestions for tackling these factors.
    The session began with brief statements by panelists; the floor was then opened for discussion and ideas. Comments covered a diverse range of related topics and points of view, with apparent support for the propositions that algorithms should be readily available, code used to produce published scientific results should be made available, and there should be discovery mechanisms to allow these to be found easily. With increased use of resources such as GitHub (for code availability), ASCL (for code discovery), and a stated strong preference from the new journal Astronomy & Computing for code release, we expect to see additional progress over the next few years.

   As the internet continues to be populated with new devices and emerging technologies, the attack surface grows exponentially. Technology is shifting towards a profit-driven Internet of Things market where security is an afterthought. Traditional defending approaches are no longer sufficient to detect both known and unknown attacks to high accuracy. Machine learning intrusion detection systems have proven their success in identifying unknown attacks with high precision. Nevertheless, machine learning models are also vulnerable to attacks. Adversarial examples can be used to evaluate the robustness of a designed model before it is deployed. Further, using adversarial examples is critical to creating a robust model designed for an adversarial environment. Our work evaluates both traditional machine learning and deep learning models' robustness using the Bot-IoT dataset. Our methodology included two main approaches. First, label poisoning, used to cause incorrect classification by the model. Second, the fast gradient sign method, used to evade detection measures. The experiments demonstrated that an attacker could manipulate or circumvent detection with significant probability.

# About arXiv

arXiv is a curated research-sharing platform open to anyone. As a pioneer in digital open access, arXiv.org now hosts more than two million scholarly articles in eight subject areas, curated by our strong community of volunteer moderators.

arXiv offers researchers a broad range of services: article submission, compilation, production, retrieval, search and discovery, web distribution for human readers, and API access for machines, together with content curation and preservation. Our emphasis on openness, collaboration, and scholarship provide the strong foundation on which arXiv thrives.

arXiv currently serves the fields of physics, mathematics, computer science, quantitative biology, quantitative finance, statistics, electrical engineering and systems science, and economics. arXiv was founded by Paul Ginsparg in 1991 and is now maintained and operated by [Cornell Tech](https://www.tech.cornell.edu/).

Operations are maintained by the [arXiv Leadership Team](people/leadership_team.html) and arXiv staff at Cornell University. Governance of arXiv is led by the Leadership Team with guidance from the arXiv [Editorial Advisory Council](people/editorial_advisory_council.html), [Institutions Advisory Council](people/institutions_advisory_council.html), and [Science Advisory Council](people/science_advisory_council.html). arXiv is a community-supported resource funded by [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/), the [Simons Foundation](https://www.simonsfoundation.org), [member institutions](ourmembers.html), and [donors](give.html).

Registered users may [submit articles](../help/submit/index.html) to be announced by arXiv. There are no fees or costs for article submission. Submissions to arXiv are subject to a [moderation process](../help/moderation/index.html) that classifies material as topical to the subject area and checks for scholarly value. Material is not peer-reviewed by arXiv - the contents of arXiv submissions are wholly the responsibility of the submitter and are presented âas isâ without any warranty or guarantee. By hosting works and other materials on this site, arXiv, Cornell University, and their agents do not in any way convey implied approval of the assumptions, methods, results, or conclusions of the work.
