{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Yale Conexis L1 Smart Lock utilizes Mifare Classic 1K cards for access control. The vulnerability stems from the use of non-standard encryption keys for the first seven blocks of the card, which can be easily recovered. Furthermore, a pair of neighboring blocks are updated in a tick-tock manner during the unlock process. If these values are altered, the card will not work.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use of easily crackable non-standard encryption keys on the Mifare Classic 1K cards.",
      "The 'tick-tock' mechanism, while designed to prevent replay attacks, can be exploited by creating a duplicate card."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can clone the master key card using readily available tools. The cloned card can be used to open the lock. When a cloned card is used, the original card is rendered unusable.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Physical access to a valid master key card.",
      "Use of a Proxmark3 or similar RFID tool to dump the card's contents."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs physical access to a valid master key card, an RFID reader/writer capable of interacting with Mifare Classic 1K cards (like Proxmark3), and some knowledge of how to dump and clone the card. The ability to recover the non-standard keys within 20 seconds."
