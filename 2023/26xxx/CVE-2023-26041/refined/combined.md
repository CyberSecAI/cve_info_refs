# Messages can still be seen on conversation after expiring when cron is misconfigured

Low

[nickvergessen](/nickvergessen)
published
GHSA-j53p-r755-v4jf
Feb 27, 2023

## Package

Talk
(Nextcloud)

## Affected versions

>= 15.0.0

## Patched versions

15.0.3

## Description

### Impact

When cron jobs were misconfigured and therefore messages are not expired, the API would still return them while they were then hidden by the frontend code.

### Patches

It is recommended that the Nextcloud Talk is upgraded to 15.0.3

### Workarounds

* No workaround available

### References

* [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/reports/1784310)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N

### CVE ID
