Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-26475:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the annotation displayer in XWiki not executing content within a restricted context. This lack of restriction allows for the execution of arbitrary code by leveraging the rights of the document's author.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted Code Execution:** The core weakness is the ability to embed and execute code (like Groovy, Python) within annotations without proper sanitization or sandboxing.
*   **Lack of Contextual Restriction:** The annotation displayer fails to enforce a restricted execution context, leading to the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A low-privileged user can execute arbitrary code on the server by adding a malicious annotation.
*   **Full System Compromise:** Successful exploitation allows for complete compromise of the application, server, and its data.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker gains privileges equivalent to the author of the annotated document.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Annotation Injection:** Attackers insert malicious code into an annotation on an XWiki page.
*   **Viewing Annotations:** The code is executed when the annotation is displayed (e.g., by appending `?viewer=annotations` to the URL).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low-Privilege User:** The attacker needs to be a registered user with basic privileges to add annotations.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to access the XWiki instance through the network.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability can be exploited using code within the annotation such as `{{groovy}}print "hello"{{/groovy}}`
*   The fix involves ensuring a restricted context for annotation execution.

**Affected Versions:**

*   XWiki versions >= 2.3-milestone-1, < 13.10.11
*   XWiki versions >= 14.0-rc-1, < 14.4.7
*    XWiki versions >= 14.5, < 14.10-rc-1

**Patched Versions:**

*   XWiki 13.10.11
*   XWiki 14.4.7
*   XWiki 14.10
