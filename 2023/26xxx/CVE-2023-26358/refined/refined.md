- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Untrusted search path vulnerability (CWE-426).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application is vulnerable due to an untrusted search path, which can lead to loading of malicious DLLs.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can result in arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local (AV:L).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have local access and be able to trick the user into loading the malicious executable (UI:R). The attacker does not require any privileges (PR:N).
