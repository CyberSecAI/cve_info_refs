- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Quiz And Survey Master plugin for WordPress versions 8.0.10 and earlier is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. This means an attacker could potentially modify settings, add content, or perform other administrative actions if they can trick a logged-in admin into submitting a crafted request.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker would need to craft a malicious link or webpage that, when accessed by a logged-in admin, would trigger an unintended action within the Quiz And Survey Master plugin. This could be done through social engineering, email phishing, or by injecting malicious code into another website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker does not need to be authenticated; they need to trick an authenticated user (with higher privileges) into clicking the crafted link or form to trigger the malicious action.
