{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The function `lysp_stmt_validate_value` does not check if the input `val` is NULL before dereferencing it, which can lead to a null pointer dereference.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "NULL pointer dereference"
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit of this vulnerability can lead to a crash due to a segmentation fault, resulting in denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by providing a crafted input to the `lys_parse_mem` function, which eventually calls `lysp_stmt_validate_value` with a NULL value for `val`.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to provide input to the vulnerable function `lys_parse_mem`.",
     "cvss_vector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H",
      "details":"The vulnerability exists in libyang versions 2.0.164 to 2.1.30. The `lysp_stmt_validate_value` function in `lys_parse_mem.c` doesn't check for a NULL `val`, leading to a crash when dereferenced. A fuzzer was used to discover the issue. The vulnerability is triggered within the context of parsing YANG data models. Specifically, the crash occurs in a `while` loop that iterates over the characters pointed to by `val`. If `val` is NULL, dereferencing it will cause the program to crash. The input causing the issue was made available in a github repository."
