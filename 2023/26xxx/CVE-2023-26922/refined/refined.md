Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `execute-command.php` file takes a `command` parameter via a GET request, directly passes it to the `shell_exec()` function, and then echoes the output. This allows for arbitrary command execution on the server.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Command Injection:** The application directly uses user-supplied input from the GET parameter in a system call, without sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the server with the privileges of the web server user, potentially leading to:
    - Data exfiltration
    - System compromise
    - Installation of malware
    - Complete control over the system
- In this specific case, the code is used for a tbox in the Internet of Vehicles, potentially granting attackers control over the car's systems.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET request:** Attacker crafts a URL with a `command` parameter to be executed on the server.
    - Example: `/execute-command.php?command=ls` to list directory contents
    - Example: `/execute-command.php?command=echo "" > shell.php` to create a PHP shell

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- **No Authentication Required**: The vulnerability does not appear to require any form of authentication, meaning anyone with network access to the server can exploit it.
