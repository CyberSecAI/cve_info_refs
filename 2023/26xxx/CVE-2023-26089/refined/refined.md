Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2023-26089:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the use of a weak, hard-coded secret key for signing JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) used for authentication within the IUCLID 6 application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Hard-coded secret:** The primary weakness is the use of a static, easily discoverable secret key.
*   **Authentication bypass:** This weak secret allows an attacker to forge valid authentication tokens.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to an IUCLID instance.
*   **Privilege escalation:** The attacker would have the same level of access as any valid user on the system.
*   **Data breach:** The attacker could access and potentially manipulate sensitive data stored within the IUCLID application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited over a network.
*   **Remote exploitation:** If the application is exposed to a network accessible by the attacker (e.g., the internet), it is remotely exploitable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network access:** The attacker must have network access to the IUCLID 6 application.
*   **No authentication required:** The attacker does not need valid user credentials. They can bypass authentication through token forging.

**Affected versions (More detail than CVE description):**
*   IUCLID 6 Server versions 6.27.1 – 6.27.5 (Critical)
*   IUCLID 6 Server versions 5.15.0 – 6.27.0 (High)
*   IUCLID 6 Desktop versions 5.15.0 – 6.27.5 (High)

**Mitigation:**
* Update to version 6.27.6.
* Change the jwt signing secret by executing the provided steps.
* Limit network access to the IUCLID application (e.g., using VPN).
* Monitor audit logs for unusual records.
