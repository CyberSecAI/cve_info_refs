Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- Missing input validation in the "working set manager application" when creating a working set. Specifically, the application does not sanitize user-provided input when naming the working set.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Cross-Site Template Injection (CSTI):** The vulnerability lies in the ability to inject client-side template injection payloads through the working set name. This is possible due to lack of sanitization/validation of user input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the client-side. This may allow for exfiltration of information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the "working set manager application" of Nokia NetAct.
- The attacker needs to create a working set with a crafted name.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An internal user with access to the NetAct application is required to perform this attack.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Nokia NetAct v 20.1.
- The fix is available in NetAct 22 FP2211 and onwards.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Vladimir Razov and Aleksandr Ustinov (Positive Technologies).
