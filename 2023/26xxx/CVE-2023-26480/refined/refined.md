Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-26480:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of HTML content within the "Live Data" macro of XWiki. Specifically, when the `html` displayer is used for a property within the Live Data configuration, it renders the provided HTML without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Malicious HTML code can be injected via the "description" field and be rendered when the "html" displayer is used.
- **Arbitrary HTML Injection:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML, not just script, potentially leading to layout manipulation or other malicious content injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Execution of arbitrary JavaScript:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
- **Session hijacking/cookie theft:** The attacker could potentially steal session cookies or other sensitive information.
- **Defacement:** The attacker could modify the appearance of pages by injecting malicious HTML.
- **Redirection:** The attacker could redirect the user to a malicious website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the user profile's "about" section.
- An attacker can inject malicious HTML into the "description" field of the Live Data configuration within a user profile.
- The vulnerability is triggered when a user views the profile with the malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low privileges:** An attacker only needs a regular user account and does not require special script rights to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Ability to edit user profile:** The attacker needs to be able to edit their own user profile to inject the malicious code.
- **User interaction required:** The victim needs to view the profile of the attacker for the XSS code to be executed.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability exists within the `xwiki-platform-livedata-macro` component.
- It affects versions of XWiki >= 12.10.
- Patched versions include 13.10.10, 14.4.7, and 14.9.
- The vulnerability is related to the Live Data macro's `html` displayer.
- The vulnerability can also be triggered using `Livetable` data source, if the column displayer is changed to HTML, but this requires script rights.
- The vulnerability is rated as "High" severity with a CVSS score of 8.9.
- A fix was implemented with changes to the `LiveDataMacro.java`, `DisplayerHtml.vue`, and related components, which involved improvements to Live Data escaping.
- The fix also adds missing components in `LiveDataMacroComponentList`.
