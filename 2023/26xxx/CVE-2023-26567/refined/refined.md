Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2023-26567:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the inclusion of cleartext credentials ( `AMPDBUSER`, `AMPDBPASS`, `AMPMGRUSER`, `AMPMGRPASS` ) as global variables within the Asterisk configuration during installation of Sangoma FreePBX Linux from official ISO images.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cleartext Storage of Credentials:** Storing database and manager interface credentials in plain text within Asterisk global variables is a major security flaw.
*   **Insecure Permissions:** Although not explicitly stated as the root cause, the vulnerability is described as "Sangoma FreePBX Linux Insecure Permissions" which might indicate permission issues related to accessing the Asterisk configuration where the credentials are stored.
*   **Exposed API Endpoint:** The Asterisk REST Interface (ARI) provides an API endpoint `/ari/asterisk/variable` which allows retrieval of these variables, enabling access to the cleartext credentials.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** An attacker can retrieve the credentials for the Asterisk Database (MariaDB/MySQL) and the Asterisk Manager Interface.
*   **Remote Command Execution:** With database access, an attacker could issue Asterisk commands, read events, make configuration changes, and potentially gain complete control over the system.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can extract sensitive information such as extension passwords, SIP trunk information, and other valuable data stored within the system.
*   **Arbitrary File Access:** The attacker can download files from the filesystem and upload files to it. This could lead to uploading a webshell for further access.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** Attackers must be able to connect to the target FreePBX system's HTTP (8088/tcp) or HTTPS (8089/tcp) ports.
*   **Asterisk REST Interface (ARI):** The vulnerability is exploited through the ARI by authenticating with the service.
*   **API Request:** The attacker sends a specific request to the `/ari/asterisk/variable?variable=AMPDBPASS` endpoint to extract the credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the FreePBX server on either port 8088 or 8089.
*   **ARI Authentication:** The attacker needs to authenticate with the Asterisk REST Interface (ARI).
*   **Knowledge of API:** The attacker must know about the `/ari/asterisk/variable` API endpoint to retrieve the credentials.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects a range of Sangoma FreePBX Linux versions.
*   The provided CVSS score is 6.8, indicating a medium to high severity.
*   The `S:C` scope modifier means that the vulnerability affects resources outside the security scope of the vulnerable component, in this case, the credentials leak gives access to the entire system.
