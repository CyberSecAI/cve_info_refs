It is caused by the use of long IDs for PGP keys in dependency verification metadata, making it susceptible to collision attacks. An attacker with high privileges could potentially exploit this vulnerability. NetApp products incorporating these vulnerable versions of Gradle are also susceptible. The fix involves failing dependency verification if anything other than a full fingerprint is used in trusted key elements.",
