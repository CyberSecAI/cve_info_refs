| * The first four of these CVEs affect a function in libntp that is only used by ntpq, but not by ntpd. * The last CVE affects the driver for a hardware clock (GPS receiver), so ntpd might be vulnerable to manipulated devices of that type, but not to remote attacks. |

| [@rma-x](https://github.com/rma-x) Are you a member of ntp group? I have reported these issues to ntp group (security.ntp@rt.nwtime.org), but didn't receive any response in 1 month, if you are sure that you are right, then maybe you could submit a PR, so other researchers can obtain the correct information, maybe to fix NVD's analysis. |

| I am the maintainer of the ntp package at SUSE, but SUSE is not a member of the Network Time Foundation.  But where did you get that email address you tried to contact? According to <https://www.ntp.org/bugs/> security issues should be reported to security@ntp.org . But OTOH, yes, ntp upstream tends to be unresponsive, I've experienced that myself in the past.  In the meantime I double-checked that `mstolfp()` does not get linked into ntpd, by adding a unique string to the function, which after compilation was only found in the ntpq binary, but not in ntpd with libntp being linked statically into both binaries.  I will now also double-check to make sure the buggy code in `refclock_palisade.c` never gets called with data received from the network. |

| I'm in loose contact with the folks at ntp.org/nwtime.org. It's really bad that the email to security@ntp.org obviously wasn't handled, but now the maintainers are aware of the issues and are working on them. Since it should not be too hard to fix the issues, I guess the fix will be available really soon. |

| Thanks, [@mburnicki](https://github.com/mburnicki)  Yes, the bugs should be easy to fix for someone who is familiar with the code base, but I think it is important to state that the actual vulnerability they create is by far smaller than initially stated.  I meanwhile did a more in-depth analysis of `refclock_palisade.c`. It confirmed my former assumption that `praecis_parse()` only ever gets to see data that was received via a TTY from a certain GPS receiver, and only if such a GPS receiver is configured in `ntp.conf`, but it never gets called with data that was received over the network. |

| [@rma-x](https://github.com/rma-x)  Indeed the palisade driver is for a specific (old) GPS device, and in fact the driver is only used at all if a palisade GPS receiver has explicitly been configured in ntp.conf. I doubt that this type of GPS receiver is widely used today. |

| The palisade driver actually supports eight different GPS receiver models or protocols, but only one of them (Praecis) is affected by the bug. And even if it were used more widely, an exploit would require a manipulated GPS receiver that sends overlong lines to the driver. This means physical access or a compromised host would be needed (if the device allows firmware updates over serial), so we're not looking at an RCE vulnerability here, even on installations that do use this driver. |

| I'm the NTP Project's PM, and we never saw your reports.  To summarize, the first 4 do not affect ntpd and would *seem* to require the attacker to make malicious changes to an ntpd instance that would then send bogus data to a client ntpq process. The last item seems "mild" given [@rma-x](https://github.com/rma-x)'s comment above.  [@spwpun](https://github.com/spwpun) where did you see that you should report security bugs in NTP to security.ntp@rt.nwtime.org? If you didn't get a response to your earlier report, why didn't you reach out some other way?  We've been upgrading our email and security@ subsystems lately, and that process is not yet complete. It seems likely that as part of this upgrade is part of that problem. |

| To summarize, the first 4 do not affect ntpd and would *seem* to require the attacker to make malicious changes to an ntpd instance that would then send bogus data to a client ntpq process.  A MITM attacker sitting between ntpd and ntpq can simply craft a response containing a floating point variable which will be parsed by the problematic function. When I inject the value from the reproducer, it crashes ntpq built with the address sanitizer. valgrind doesn't report any issues.  It's not clear to me what is the difference between the four CVEs. They seem to point to the same document and reproducer. |

| [@mlichvar](https://github.com/mlichvar) The four CVEs reference different code lines within `mstolfp()` that somehow participate in the overflow, but I agree that there should have been only one CVE claiming the missing length checking at the start of that function.  How did you inject that value? At the C level like the reproducers do, or as an actual packet that goes all the way through ntpq and triggers the overflow? |

| Ok, so 3 CVEs should be marked as duplicates.  I modifed an actual response from ntpd to `ntpq -c rv` command. ntpq was not modified.  Until this is fixed and someone really needs to use ntpq over internet, a workaround is to use the `-c raw`  option to avoid reformatting the values. |

We will keep [CVE-2023-26551](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-26551) open as the "**input validation issue with the mstolfp() function**" and mark [CVE-2023-26552](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-26552), [CVE-2023-26553](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-26553) and [CVE-2023-26554](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-26554) as duplicate.  [CVE-2023-26555](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-26555) will need an update as well. I will push this as well. |

| The four CVEs reference different code lines within `mstolfp()` that somehow participate in the overflow  After looking more closely, these are lines that perform a write operation to the target location of the buffer pointer, but not all lines in the function that do so are covered. |

| MITRE sent a response and will not mark some of the already published CVEs as duplicated:  Thank you for your suggestions about the recent NTP CVE Records. We are generally not interested in changing the level of abstraction after CVE Records are already published. We have attempted to make improvements with:  <https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-26551> <https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-26552> <https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-26553> <https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-26554> <https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-26555>  The first 4 CVEs are now reflecting that we have in deed a `ntpq` issue. The last CVE is mentioning that "Any attack method would be complex, e.g., with a manipulated GPS receiver." |

| For completeness, there are five lines in the source code where the overflow can occur. The one that doesn't have a CVE assigned corresponds to the "If we have more than three digits copy the excess over" comment in the `while ((cpdec - cp) > 3)` loop. |
