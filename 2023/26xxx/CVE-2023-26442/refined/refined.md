Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2023-26442:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the Cacheservice HTTP client following redirect responses when configured to use a sproxyd object-storage backend.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) due to the Cacheservice following HTTP redirects from the sproxyd backend.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could make the Cacheservice connect to unexpected resources by intercepting/replaying HTTP requests to the sproxyd backend or by controlling the sproxyd service itself, effectively achieving a server-side request forgery attack.
- This could lead to the disclosure of internal resources or other unintended consequences as a result of the forged requests.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker with access to a local or restricted network.
- The attacker must be able to intercept and replay HTTP requests to the sproxyd service or control the sproxyd service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Access to a local or restricted network.
- The ability to intercept and replay HTTP requests to the sproxyd service or control of the sproxyd service.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was addressed by disabling the ability to follow HTTP redirects when connecting to sproxyd resources.
- There are no known public exploits for this vulnerability
