Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-26482:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing scope validation in the Nextcloud Workflow Engine. This allows users to create workflows intended for administrators, thereby bypassing intended access controls.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Missing scope validation: The core weakness lies in the lack of proper validation of the scope of workflow operations. This allows users to define workflows with an administrator scope, even when they are not administrators themselves.
- Improper Access Control: Due to the missing scope validation, regular users can create and trigger workflows that should be restricted to administrators.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): By creating workflows using apps like `workflow_scripts` and `workflow_pdf_converter`, attackers can execute arbitrary scripts on the server, leading to RCE.
- Privilege Escalation: Users gain the ability to run workflows designed for administrators, effectively elevating their privileges.
- Data manipulation/exfiltration: Depending on the workflow and available apps, an attacker could potentially read/modify/delete any file on the server accessible to the web server process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network: The attack vector is through the network, meaning a remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability.
- Workflow Creation: The vulnerability is exploited by creating a malicious workflow.
- Triggering Workflows: Attackers trigger the created workflow, initiating the associated actions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Low Privileges: The attacker needs low-level privileges on the Nextcloud instance to create workflows.
- User Interaction: The attack requires user interaction to set up the workflow.
- Access to the Nextcloud Instance: An attacker must have network access to the Nextcloud instance.

**Additional Details:**
- Affected versions: Nextcloud Server versions >= 24.0.0 and >= 25.0.0 and Nextcloud Enterprise Server versions >= 18.0.0, >= 19.0.0, >= 20.0.0, >= 21.0.0, >= 22.0.0, >= 23.0.0, >= 24.0.0, >= 25.0.0 are affected.
- Patched versions: Nextcloud Server was patched in versions 24.0.10 and 25.0.4. Nextcloud Enterprise Server was patched in versions 20.0.14.12, 21.0.9.10, 22.2.10.10, 23.0.12.5, 24.0.10, and 25.0.4
- Workarounds: The provided workaround is to disable the workflow_scripts and workflow_pdf_converter apps.
