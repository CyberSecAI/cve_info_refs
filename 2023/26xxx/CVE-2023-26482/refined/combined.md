## Description

### Impact

A missing scope validation allowed users to create workflows which are designed to be only available for administrators. Some workflows are designed to be RCE by invoking defined scripts, in order to generate PDFs, invoking webhooks or running scripts on the server. Due to this combination depending on the available apps the issue can result in a RCE at the end.

### Patches

It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 24.0.10 or 25.0.4

It is recommended that the Nextcloud Enterprise Server is upgraded to 20.0.14.12 or 21.0.9.10 or 22.2.10.10 or 23.0.12.5 or 24.0.10 or 25.0.4

It is recommended that the Nextcloud Enterprise Server 18 or Nextcloud Enterprise Server 19 is manually patched.

### Workarounds

* Disable app workflow\_scripts and workflow\_pdf\_converter

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
