The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability found in the PARK TICKETING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM by Phpgurukul.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The application stores user-provided input without proper sanitization or encoding, specifically the "Admin Name" parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored XSS vulnerability.
- Lack of input validation on the "Admin Name" field.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The attacker can inject malicious code (e.g., JavaScript) into the application.
- When an administrator views the page containing the injected code, the attacker's script will execute in their browser.
- This can lead to various consequences, including:
    - Stealing cookies/session information.
    - Redirecting the user to a malicious website.
    - Defacing the application.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the "Admin Name" field.
- The injected script is stored on the server and executed when a user views the affected page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to input data into the "Admin Name" parameter. This likely involves having admin privileges or accessing an interface where admin settings can be modified.
