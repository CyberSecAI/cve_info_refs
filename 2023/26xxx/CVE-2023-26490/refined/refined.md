{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "Root cause": "The imapsync Perl script, responsible for the Sync Job feature, constructs a shell command that includes a user-provided password without proper sanitization. This allows for the injection of arbitrary shell commands.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Shell command injection (CWE-78)"
    ],
    "Impact": "A malicious user with Sync Job creation permissions can inject shell commands into the password field, leading to arbitrary command execution within the dovecot Docker container. This can result in full compromise of the container.",
     "Attack vectors": "A user with Sync Job creation permissions creates a new sync job with a crafted password containing shell commands.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to have a mailcow account with the permission to create or modify Sync Jobs."
  },
  "additional_info": {
        "patched_version": ">= 2023-03",
        "workaround": "Remove the Syncjob ACL from all mailbox users.",
        "vulnerable_code_details": "The vulnerability is in the imapsync Perl script where it calls openssl with unsanitized user-provided parameters within the XOAUTH2 authentication flow.",
        "reproduction_steps": "1. Log in to mailcow GUI with a Sync Job permission user.\n2. Create a new sync job.\n3. Set 'Custom parameters' to '--authmech1=XOAUTH2'.\n4. In the password field input '123;bla;blub;touch /tmp/poc.txt;'.\n5. Activate the sync job and wait for it to fail.\n6. Check logs for evidence of the touch command running."
