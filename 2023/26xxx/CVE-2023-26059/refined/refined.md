Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-26059

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability exists in the "Site Configuration tool" of Nokia NetAct v20.1, specifically related to the file upload functionality. The tool does not validate the contents of uploaded files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** An attacker can upload a malicious ZIP file. When this file is processed by the NetAct system, it executes the malicious code embedded within, leading to an XSS vulnerability. The malicious code is stored on the system (hence "stored" XSS).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   The exploit enables an attacker to inject malicious client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users. This could lead to various impacts, including:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Defacement of web pages
    *   Redirection to malicious sites
    *   Unauthorized data access or modification (depending on application context)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **File Upload:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted ZIP file containing malicious code via the Site Configuration tool's upload function.
*   **Processing of Uploaded File:** The NetAct system then processes this file, which triggers the execution of the stored malicious script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Internal User:** The attack can only be performed by an authenticated internal user of the NetAct system. This indicates the attacker needs to have valid credentials to log in to the NetAct application.
*   **Access to Site Configuration Tool:** The attacker must also have access rights to utilize the "Site Configuration" tool.

**Additional Notes:**
* The provided advisory mentions that NetAct 22 SP1037 includes the fix. It was delivered on top of NetAct 22 FP2208, and a SP package is available for other versions upon request.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Vladimir Razov and Aleksandr Ustinov of Positive Technologies.
*   The vulnerability is rated as "Medium" severity with a CVSS v3.1 base score of 5.0.
