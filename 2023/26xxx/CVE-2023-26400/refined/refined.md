- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds Read
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read, which occurs when the program attempts to access memory outside the allocated buffer. This can lead to a memory leak.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to a memory leak.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, requiring user interaction.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to have local access to the system and convince a user to open a specially crafted file to trigger the vulnerability.
