Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of input validation and improper configuration of XML parsers in Nokia NetAct v20.1. Specifically, the software does not adequately sanitize or restrict the content of XML files imported by users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** The core vulnerability is an XXE injection. The application processes XML files with support for external entities enabled. This allows an attacker to define external entities that can reference local files or external URLs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Read:** An attacker can exploit the XXE vulnerability to read arbitrary files on the server where the NetAct application is running.
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The vulnerability can also be used to conduct SSRF attacks. By referencing external URLs within the XML file, an attacker can make the server initiate requests to arbitrary hosts, potentially accessing internal resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Import of Malicious XML Files:** Attackers exploit the vulnerability by importing specially crafted XML files through the Performance Manager+ page of the NetAct application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Internal User:** The attack can only be performed by an authenticated user with access to the Performance Manager+ page of the NetAct application, meaning an internal user of the application.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is identified as **CVE-2023-26058**.
- The vulnerability is considered to have a **Medium** severity level, with a CVSS v3.1 base score of 5.8.
- The vulnerability is fixed in NetAct 22 FP2211 and onwards.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Vladimir Razov and Aleksandr Ustinov of Positive Technologies.
