## [CVE-2023-26051](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-r8qr-wwg3-2r85 "CVE-2023-26051"): Staff-Authenticated Error Message Information Disclosure Vulnerability via Python Exceptions

Severity: medium

Some internal Python exceptions are not handled properly and thus are returned in API as error messages. Some messages might contain sensitive information like user email address in staff-authenticated requests.

Affected versions: Saleor ≥ 2.0.0

## [CVE-2023-26052](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3hvj-3cg9-v242 "CVE-2023-26052"): Unauthenticated Information Disclosure Vulnerability via Python Exceptions

Severity: low

Some internal Python exceptions are not handled properly and thus are returned in API as error messages. Some messages might contain sensitive information like infrastructure details in unauthenticated requests.

Affected versions: Saleor ≥ 2.0.0

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

## [CVE-2023-26051](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-r8qr-wwg3-2r85 "CVE-2023-26051"): Staff-Authenticated Error Message Information Disclosure Vulnerability via Python Exceptions

Severity: medium

Some internal Python exceptions are not handled properly and thus are returned in API as error messages. Some messages might contain sensitive information like user email address in staff-authenticated requests.

Affected versions: Saleor ≥ 2.0.0

## [CVE-2023-26052](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3hvj-3cg9-v242 "CVE-2023-26052"): Unauthenticated Information Disclosure Vulnerability via Python Exceptions

Severity: low

Some internal Python exceptions are not handled properly and thus are returned in API as error messages. Some messages might contain sensitive information like infrastructure details in unauthenticated requests.

Affected versions: Saleor ≥ 2.0.0

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
