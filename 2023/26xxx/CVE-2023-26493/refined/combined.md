## Coordinated Disclosure Timeline

* 2023-02-13: Asked maintainer for a security contact
* 2023-02-13: Security contact provided
* 2023-02-14: Report sent to maintainer
* 2023-02-17: Maintainer acknowledged the report and disabled the vulnerable workflow
* 2023-02-21: [Workflow deleted](https://github.com/cocos/cocos-engine/commit/6d06aefa2684e20da79e7ceaf41f728c1a8d7a41)

## Summary

Cocos Engine is vulnerable to a Command Injection in `web-interface-check.yml`.

## Product

Engine for Cocos Creator

## Tested Version

[3.7.0](https://github.com/cocos/cocos-engine/releases/tag/3.7.0)

## Details

### Issue: Actions Command Injection in `web-interface-check.yml` (`GHSL-2023-027`)

The [`web-interface-check.yml`](https://github.com/cocos/cocos-engine/blob/2362df28a4b3016dbda804899041279701929728/.github/workflows/web-interface-check.yml) workflow is triggered on `pull_request_target` (i.e., when a Pull Request against the base repository is created or updated), which also covers the case when the Pull Request is originated from a fork. The workflow starts with full `write` GitHub repository token since the defaults aren’t altered.

Taking the above into account, this workflow runs the following step with data controlled by said fork (`${{ github.head_ref }}` – the name of the fork’s branch), allowing an attacker to take over the GitHub Runner and run custom commands (potentially stealing **secrets** such as `GITHUB_TOKEN`) and altering the repository.

```
- name: merge HEAD branch
  working-directory: ./engine
  run: |
    git remote add HEAD_REPO https://github.com/${{ github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name }}.git
    git fetch HEAD_REPO ${{ github.head_ref }}
    git merge remotes/HEAD_REPO/${{ github.head_ref }}

```

This issue was found with CodeQL using [javascript’s Expression injection in Actions query](https://codeql.github.com/codeql-query-help/javascript/js-actions-command-injection/).

#### Proof of Concept

1. Fork the [cocos/cocos-engine](https://github.com/cocos/cocos-engine) repository, whose name we will refer as `username/cocos-engine-fork`.
2. Create a branch in `username/cocos-engine-fork` with the name `develop;echo${IFS}"hello";#`.
3. Push any change to the former branch.
4. Create a pull request from `username/cocos-engine-fork:develop;echo${IFS}"hello";#` to `cocos/cocos-engine:develop`.
5. Check the [workflow runs](https://github.com/cocos/cocos-engine/actions/workflows/web-interface-check.yml) for the new Actions run that will execute the command `echo "hello"`.

#### Impact

This issue may lead to stealing workflow secrets and modification of the repository.
