Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is due to a memory leak in the ARM Mali GPU kernel drivers. Specifically, the drivers are failing to properly release allocated memory, leading to a leak.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Leak (CWE-401):** The primary weakness is the failure of the driver to release memory after its effective lifetime, which results in a memory leak. This allows a local attacker to continuously allocate memory which is never freed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** A local application can exploit this memory leak to access sensitive information stored in the leaked memory.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Although not explicitly mentioned, a local user with low privileges could potentially use this vulnerability to gain access to higher privileged information. This is implied by the `S:C` (Scope Changed) CVSS metric.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The vulnerability can only be exploited locally, meaning the attacker must have access to the system.
- **Application Triggered:** The attacker must use a local application to force the driver to leak memory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the target system.
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have some level of authentication on the system.
- **Ability to Interact with Driver:** The attacker must be able to use an application to interact with the vulnerable GPU driver and trigger the memory leak.

**Additional Details:**
- **Active Exploitation:** The vulnerability is being actively exploited in the wild.
- **Affected Software:** The vulnerability affects multiple ARM GPU kernel drivers including:
  - Midgard GPU Kernel Driver (all versions)
  - ARM Avalon GPU Kernel Driver (r41p0 - r42p0)
  - Bifrost GPU Kernel Driver (before r43p0)
  - Valhall GPU Kernel Driver (before r43p0)
- **Mitigation:** Vendor-provided updates should be installed.
- **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSSv3.1 score of 6.2 (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N/E:H/RL:O/RC:C)
