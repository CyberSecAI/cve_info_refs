Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2023-26455:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of authentication checks in the `ChronosRMIService:setEventOrganizer` method of the RMI (Remote Method Invocation) service.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Authentication (CWE-287):** The RMI service allows unauthorized calls to the `setEventOrganizer` method, which should require authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers with local or adjacent network access could abuse the RMI service to modify calendar items.
- This includes changing the organizer of an event which could lead to unauthorized manipulation of scheduling and other calendar related functions

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** An attacker with local access to the server can directly exploit the vulnerability.
- **Adjacent Network Access:** An attacker with access to the same network segment as the server can also exploit the vulnerability. It is mentioned RMI access is restricted to localhost by default.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **High Privileges:** The attacker needs high privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Network proximity:** The attacker needs to be on the same network or localhost to access the RMI service

**Additional Notes:**
- The RMI service is restricted to localhost by default, which limits the attack surface.
- The vulnerability affects OX App Suite backend versions 7.10.6-rev48 and 8.12.
- The fix is included in OX App Suite backend versions 7.10.6-rev49 and 8.13.
