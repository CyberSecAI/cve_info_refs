RMI was not requiring authentication when calling ChronosRMIService:setEventOrganizer. Attackers with local or adjacent network access could abuse the RMI service to modify calendar items using RMI. RMI access is restricted to localhost by default. The interface has been updated to require authenticated requests. No publicly available exploits are known.
