- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Violation of Secure Design Principles (CWE-657)
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The software has a flaw in its design that allows for privilege escalation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to elevate their privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local, requiring the attacker to have local access to the system and user interaction (UI:R).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have low privileges on the target system to perform the attack.
