## How to fix?

Upgrade `tough-cookie` to version 4.1.3 or higher.

## Overview

[tough-cookie](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tough-cookie) is a RFC6265 Cookies and CookieJar module for Node.js.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution due to improper handling of Cookies when using CookieJar in `rejectPublicSuffixes=false` mode. Due to an issue with the manner in which the objects are initialized, an attacker can expose or modify a limited amount of property information on those objects. There is no impact to availability.

## PoC

```
// PoC.js
async function main(){
var tough = require("tough-cookie");
var cookiejar = new tough.CookieJar(undefined,{rejectPublicSuffixes:false});
// Exploit cookie
await cookiejar.setCookie(
  "Slonser=polluted; Domain=__proto__; Path=/notauth",
  "https://__proto__/admin"
);
// normal cookie
var cookie = await cookiejar.setCookie(
  "Auth=Lol; Domain=google.com; Path=/notauth",
  "https://google.com/"
);

//Exploit cookie
var a = {};
console.log(a["/notauth"]["Slonser"])
}
main();

```
## Details

Prototype Pollution is a vulnerability affecting JavaScript. Prototype Pollution refers to the ability to inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects. JavaScript allows all Object attributes to be altered, including their magical attributes such as `__proto__`, `constructor` and `prototype`. An attacker manipulates these attributes to overwrite, or pollute, a JavaScript application object prototype of the base object by injecting other values. Properties on the `Object.prototype` are then inherited by all the JavaScript objects through the prototype chain. When that happens, this leads to either denial of service by triggering JavaScript exceptions, or it tampers with the application source code to force the code path that the attacker injects, thereby leading to remote code execution.

There are two main ways in which the pollution of prototypes occurs:

* Unsafe `Object` recursive merge
* Property definition by path

### Unsafe Object recursive merge

The logic of a vulnerable recursive merge function follows the following high-level model:

```
merge (target, source)

foreach property of source

```
if property exists and is an object on both the target and the source

  merge(target[property], source[property])

else

  target[property] = source[property]

```

```

When the source object contains a property named `__proto__` defined with `Object.defineProperty()` , the condition that checks if the property exists and is an object on both the target and the source passes and the merge recurses with the target, being the prototype of `Object` and the source of `Object` as defined by the attacker. Properties are then copied on the `Object` prototype.

Clone operations are a special sub-class of unsafe recursive merges, which occur when a recursive merge is conducted on an empty object: `merge({},source)`.

`lodash` and `Hoek` are examples of libraries susceptible to recursive merge attacks.

### Property definition by path

There are a few JavaScript libraries that use an API to define property values on an object based on a given path. The function that is generally affected contains this signature: `theFunction(object, path, value)`

If the attacker can control the value of “path”, they can set this value to `__proto__.myValue`. `myValue` is then assigned to the prototype of the class of the object.

## Types of attacks

There are a few methods by which Prototype Pollution can be manipulated:

| Type | Origin | Short description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Denial of service (DoS)** | Client | This is the most likely attack. DoS occurs when `Object` holds generic functions that are implicitly called for various operations (for example, `toString` and `valueOf`).  The attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.someattr` and alters its state to an unexpected value such as `Int` or `Object`. In this case, the code fails and is likely to cause a denial of service. **For example:** if an attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.toString` by defining it as an integer, if the codebase at any point was reliant on `someobject.toString()` it would fail. |
| **Remote Code Execution** | Client | Remote code execution is generally only possible in cases where the codebase evaluates a specific attribute of an object, and then executes that evaluation.**For example:** `eval(someobject.someattr)`. In this case, if the attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.someattr` they are likely to be able to leverage this in order to execute code. |
| **Property Injection** | Client | The attacker pollutes properties that the codebase relies on for their informative value, including security properties such as cookies or tokens. **For example:** if a codebase checks privileges for `someuser.isAdmin`, then when the attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.isAdmin` and sets it to equal `true`, they can then achieve admin privileges. |

## Affected environments

The following environments are susceptible to a Prototype Pollution attack:

* Application server
* Web server
* Web browser
## How to prevent

1. Freeze the prototype— use `Object.freeze (Object.prototype)`.
2. Require schema validation of JSON input.
3. Avoid using unsafe recursive merge functions.
4. Consider using objects without prototypes (for example, `Object.create(null)`), breaking the prototype chain and preventing pollution.
5. As a best practice use `Map` instead of `Object`.

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

6.5 medium

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Integrity (I)

  Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Availability (A)

  There is no impact to availability within the impacted component.

  **None**

All occurrences of new object creation in `memstore.js` have been changed from `{}` (i.e.; `Object.create(Object.prototype)` to `Object.create(null)` so that we are using object instances that do not have a prototype property that can be polluted.

Security fix for Prototype Pollution discovery in [#282](https://github.com/salesforce/tough-cookie/issues/282). This is a minor release, although output from the `inspect` utility is affected by this change, we felt this change was important enough to be pushed into the next patch.

### **[Slonser](/Slonser)** commented [Jun 2, 2023](#issue-1738851269)

| Overview While researching a commercial product, I came across a vulnerability in their infrastructure caused by your library Vulnerability occurs if you use CookieJar in `rejectPublicSuffixes=false` mode. You can do Prototype Pollution when pass Domain=`__proto__` It comes from this point in the code:  ```   this.idx = {};      ...........      putCookie(cookie, cb) {     if (!this.idx[cookie.domain]) {       this.idx[cookie.domain] = {};     }     if (!this.idx[cookie.domain][cookie.path]) {       this.idx[cookie.domain][cookie.path] = {};     }     this.idx[cookie.domain][cookie.path][cookie.key] = cookie;     cb(null);   } ```  As you can see, this.idx - Object If cookie.domain equals to `__proto__` then you override global object prototype. It seems to me that this is clearly non-obvious behavior. It also carries certain risks. Fix To fix this, you need to store cookies in Map, or you can use  `this.idx = Object.create(null);` to create idx variable PoC To reproduce vulnerability, `node PoC.js`, you will see the printed string `Cookie="Slonser=polluted; Domain=__proto__; Path=/notauth; hostOnly=false; aAge=1117ms; cAge=1117ms"` in the terminal But as you can see, script didn't set `["/notauth"]["Slonser"]` property by it self.  ``` // PoC.js async function main(){ var tough = require("tough-cookie"); var cookiejar = new tough.CookieJar(undefined,{rejectPublicSuffixes:false}); // Exploit cookie await cookiejar.setCookie(   "Slonser=polluted; Domain=__proto__; Path=/notauth",   "https://__proto__/admin" ); // normal cookie var cookie = await cookiejar.setCookie(   "Auth=Lol; Domain=google.com; Path=/notauth",   "https://google.com/" );  //Exploit cookie var a = {}; console.log(a["/notauth"]["Slonser"]) } main(); ``` |

All occurrences of new object creation in `memstore.js` have been changed from `{}` (i.e.; `Object.create(Object.prototype)` to `Object.create(null)` so that we are using object instances that do not have a prototype property that can be polluted.

@fixes #282")`

| Can this fix be back ported to version 2.x of `tough-cookie` so that consumers of packages locked to that major version can pull in the fix? |

| I would upgrade if `tough-cookie` were a direct dependency of mine. Unfortunately my dependency tree contains dependencies that are locked to `tough-cookie@~2.5.0`, and I have more confidence in a fix being backported as a patch version than I do in tracking down the owners of all of those packages to make updates to them. |

| Same here. Would appreciate a back-port to 2.x and 3.x. Even though it'd be easy to achieve IMO I have little hope it'll materialize. I'm not seeing 2.x/3.x maintenance branches. |

| [@marcelstoer](https://github.com/marcelstoer) [@bhsdodo](https://github.com/bhsdodo) is the dependency on `request`? if so, you wouldn't be vulnerable to this security issue (see [#293](https://github.com/salesforce/tough-cookie/issues/293) for more details). In the meantime, we'll discuss a potential backport for 2.x/3.x. |

| [@colincasey](https://github.com/colincasey) Yes, it is `request`. Thanks for replying. Altough not being vunerable, the scans are pointing to this critical security vulnerability since it is a dependency 😟 As workaround, I am overriding the `tough-cookie` version under `request` with `overrides` npm option. |

| [@bhsdodo](https://github.com/bhsdodo) (or anyone, for that matter) can you confirm whether 4.1.3 is backwards compatible with `request` expecting v2.5.0? A lot of frustrated googling eventually landed me here 😂  I'm also interested in this, addressing similar security scans against `request` in a project.  I dug around a bit in this repo...   * Moving from 2.x to 3.0.0:   + has no official changelog, but can view the commit range here: [9ff4ba5...05b4713](https://github.com/salesforce/tough-cookie/compare/9ff4ba59eceab8f85f8104ac30d96cc0c9570d23...05b47134f8d62916c5a9f5ac0ad39a45ffd47ab4) . From what I can tell moving from 2.x to 3.0.0 is relatively safe, at a glance I am guessing the only breaking change was dropping support for older nodejs versions * Moving from 3.x to 4.0.0:   + Changelog is here: <https://github.com/salesforce/tough-cookie/releases/tag/v4.0.0> . This concerns me more than the jump to 3.x, these have some changes to the exposed API for consumers (that `request` may or may not call, I haven't dived into the `request` source to make sure)   I had been planning to add a specific pnpm override, but considering the convo in [#282 (comment)](https://github.com/salesforce/tough-cookie/issues/282#issuecomment-1647934621) , I may just defer until a 2.x backport exists |

This is the reason why I hate Node.. the over dependence upon community and expecting someone else to fix my problems.  I utilize many components which use tough-cookie and while the libraries are great but the maintainers are long gone.. thus now we are stuck with working code in production, that all of sudden has vulns and now way to fix them... or there it is, migrate to go/rust |

| [@vverma-gg](https://github.com/vverma-gg) I understand your frustration but the fact is `tough-cookie` is still maintained and we take security issues seriously. And so do many Node.js projects in the ecosystem.  The root issue for most in this thread is that they have projects that rely on unmaintained libraries that include `tough-cookie` as a transitive dependency. This makes the mitigation effort harder since you don't have direct control over the version of `tough-cookie` used. So it makes sense that folks would request a backport.  But consider this from the maintainer's perspective:   * The `2.x` release is from ~6 years ago * The `3.x` release is from ~5 years ago * The actual security vulnerability is with the in-memory store which should never be used in production since it has no ability to persist cookies   In this case, we decided not to backport because:   * The code from the `2.x` and `3.x` releases is unfamiliar to many of the current maintainer we had concerns about validating the quality of any backported changes * Exposure of the vulnerability should be zero for production usage * Modern package managers have the ability to modify transitives dependencies versions:   + [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) has [overrides](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm/package-json#overrides)   + [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) has [install hooks](https://pnpm.io/pnpmfile)   + [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) has [resolutions](https://yarnpkg.com/configuration/manifest#resolutions)   The value of Open Source is that, everyday, well-intentioned developers are volunteering their time and effort so **we all benefit**. One downside is, as you stated, *"it's unreasonable to expect someone else to fix my problems"*. But this isn't unique to the Node.js community. You could migrate to Rust or Go if you think that's your best option. Both are fine languages with vibrant communities. Just don't be surprised when you encounter the same maintenance problems if you rely on Open Source 😅 |
