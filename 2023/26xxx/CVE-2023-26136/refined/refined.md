Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-26136:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is a Prototype Pollution issue in the `node-tough-cookie` library.
- It stems from the improper handling of cookies when a `CookieJar` is used with `rejectPublicSuffixes=false`.
- Specifically, the library uses plain JavaScript objects (`{}`) to store cookies in memory. When `rejectPublicSuffixes` is set to false, the library doesn't properly sanitize the cookie domain, allowing an attacker to set a cookie with the domain `__proto__`. This pollutes the prototype of all JavaScript objects.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Prototype Pollution:** The core vulnerability is the ability to modify the `__proto__` property of JavaScript objects. This allows an attacker to inject properties into the base object prototype.
- **Improper Input Sanitization:**  The library fails to sanitize or validate cookie domains when `rejectPublicSuffixes` is disabled.
- **Use of Plain Objects:** Using plain JavaScript objects (`{}`) as a storage mechanism instead of objects without a prototype or a Map, which would have prevented the attack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Property Injection:** An attacker can pollute properties that the codebase relies on for their informative value, including security properties such as cookies or tokens.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By polluting generic functions like `toString` or `valueOf`, an attacker can cause JavaScript exceptions, leading to DoS.
- **Limited Remote Code Execution:** While not directly demonstrated in the provided materials, it's theoretically possible to achieve remote code execution if the application evaluates an attacker-controlled object attribute via `eval()` or similar, but it's less likely with the tough-cookie library directly.
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker may potentially gain access to limited property information on those objects, but the impact is limited.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The primary attack vector involves setting a cookie with a malicious `Domain` attribute.
- The attacker must be able to inject or influence the cookie setting process.
- Specifically, an attacker needs to set a cookie with `Domain=__proto__` when the `CookieJar` is configured with `rejectPublicSuffixes: false`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker does not need any specific privileges or authentication.
- They need to be able to set a cookie that the vulnerable application will process using a `CookieJar` with `rejectPublicSuffixes=false`.
- This usually involves the attacker being able to control the header or the cookie data received by the server or the application which relies on tough-cookie.
- No user interaction is required for the attack to succeed.
- The attack can be performed over the network.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

- **Proof of Concept:** A PoC is provided, demonstrating how to set a cookie with `Domain=__proto__` and then access the polluted property via a regular object.
- **Fix:** The vulnerability was fixed by changing object creation from `{}` to `Object.create(null)` in `memstore.js`, thus removing the prototype inheritance chain which was susceptible to pollution.
- **Mitigation:** The primary mitigation is to upgrade to `tough-cookie` version 4.1.3 or higher, where the fix was implemented. Other mitigations include freezing the prototype (`Object.freeze (Object.prototype)`), input schema validation and avoiding unsafe recursive merge functions.
- **CVSS Score:**
  - Snyk: 6.5 (Medium)
  - NVD: 9.8 (Critical) - This likely reflects the potential for broader impact given a prototype pollution vulnerability.
  - Red Hat: 6.5 (Medium)

**Summary of Fix:**

The fix for the issue involved changing all instances of new object creation in `memstore.js` from using `{}` (which creates an object inheriting from `Object.prototype`) to `Object.create(null)`, which creates an object without a prototype. This prevents prototype pollution attacks by ensuring that the objects used for cookie storage do not inherit from the Object prototype, thus removing the vulnerability.
