- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from improper neutralization of SQL parameters within the `faqs` module for PrestaShop. Specifically, the `faqsPost::getIdFaqsAssociatedToProductCategories()` function uses unsanitized input from the `id_category` parameter in a SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is a blind SQL injection (CWE-89). The application fails to sanitize or parameterize user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to:
    - Technical and personal data leaks.
    - Obtaining admin access.
    - Removal of all data from the linked PrestaShop instance.
    - Display of sensitive tables in the front office to unlock potential admin's ajax scripts of modules.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based, using a simple HTTP POST or GET request to the vulnerable endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires no special privileges or user interaction, and can exploit the vulnerability remotely, indicating the vulnerability can be exploited by anyone with access to the web application.

The provided content includes a proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrating the SQL injection vulnerability using a `curl` command, and a code snippet showing the fix implemented in version 3.1.6, where the `id_category` values are cast to integers before being used in SQL query using `array_map('intval'`.
