Based on the provided documents, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2023-26942:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Yale IA-210 intruder alarm uses default encryption keys for its RFID tags.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Default Encryption Keys:** The RFID tags used by the Yale IA-210 alarm utilize default encryption keys. Specifically, all sectors use the default key, making the tags easily compromised.
*   **Lack of Authentication:**  The alarm system only checks if the tag can be decrypted with the default keys and if the data in block 0 matches the stored value. No other authentication mechanisms are present.
*   **Writable Tags:** Special "magic" tags allow rewriting of the read-only block 0, facilitating duplication.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Easy Cloning:** Attackers can easily clone the RFID tags using an NFC-enabled mobile phone or a dedicated cloning tool with only brief physical access.
*   **Alarm System Disarming:** Cloned tags can be used to disarm the alarm system, compromising the security of the protected premises.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **RFID Tag Cloning:** Attackers can clone the RFID tag via an NFC-enabled phone or other cloning device.
*   **Physical Access:** The attacker requires only a few seconds of physical access to the original RFID tag.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Physical Proximity:** The attacker needs to be physically close enough to the tag to clone it, even for a brief duration.
*   **Cloning Tool:** The attacker needs a device capable of cloning RFID tags (e.g., NFC-enabled phone or dedicated cloning tool).
*   **Knowledge of "Magic Tags":** The attacker would need knowledge of "magic" RFID tags to rewrite the block 0 sector.

**Additional details:**
The provided content gives more specific technical information about the vulnerability than the standard CVE description. Specifically, it explains the use of default encryption keys, the lack of authentication, and the use of “magic tags” for cloning. It also outlines how cloning the tag allows disarming of the system.
