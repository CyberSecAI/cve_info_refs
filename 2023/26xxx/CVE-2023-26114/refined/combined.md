### Threat Intelligence

Exploit Maturity

Snyk has a proof-of-concept or detailed explanation of how to exploit this vulnerability.

Proof of conceptEPSS

The probability is the direct output of the EPSS model, and conveys an overall sense of the threat of
exploitation in the wild. The percentile measures the EPSS probability relative to all known EPSS scores.
Note: This data is updated daily, relying on the latest available EPSS model version.

[CVE-2023-26114  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-26114) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-1385  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1385.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses First added by Snyk
## How to fix?

Upgrade `code-server` to version 4.10.1 or higher.

## Overview

[code-server](https://www.npmjs.org/package/code-server) is an application that allows running VS Code on a remote server.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Missing Origin Validation in WebSockets handshakes. Exploiting this vulnerability can allow an adversary in specific scenarios to access data from and connect to the code-server instance.

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

8.2 high

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected.

  **High**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited. For example, a successful exploit may only be possible during the installation of an application by a system administrator.

  **Required**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can affect resources beyond the security scope managed by the security authority of the vulnerable component. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are different and managed by different security authorities.

  **Changed**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is a total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact. For example, an attacker steals the administrator's password, or private encryption keys of a web server.

  **High**
* Integrity (I)

  There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

  **High**
* Availability (A)

  Performance is reduced or there are interruptions in resource availability. Even if repeated exploitation of the vulnerability is possible, the attacker does not have the ability to completely deny service to legitimate users. The resources in the impacted component are either partially available all of the time, or fully available only some of the time, but overall there is no direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

  **Low**

Code v1.75.1

### Security

Added an origin check to web sockets to prevent cross-site hijacking attacks on

users using older or niche browser that do not support SameSite cookies and

attacks across sub-domains that share the same root domain.

The check requires the host header to be set so if you use a reverse proxy

ensure it forwards that information otherwise web sockets will be blocked.

|  |  | ## Unreleased |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Code v1.75.1 |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ### Security |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Add an origin check to web sockets to prevent a cross-site hijacking attack that |
|  |  | affects those who use older or niche browsers that do not support SameSite |
|  |  | cookies and those who access code-server under a shared domain with other users |
|  |  | on separate sub-domains. The check requires the host header to be set so if you |
|  |  | use a reverse proxy ensure it forwards that information. |
