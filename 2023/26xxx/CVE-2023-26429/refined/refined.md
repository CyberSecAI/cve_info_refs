Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-26429:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the improper sanitization of user feedback content during export. Specifically, control characters within the user feedback were not removed before exporting.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')**: Although described as command injection, this is more accurately an issue of improper neutralization of special elements/control characters, as it does not lead to command execution on the system but rather to data structure breakage in exported data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject unexpected content via user feedback.
- This could potentially break the exported data structure.
- This may allow for unexpected content inclusion.
- No direct command execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the user feedback mechanism of the application.
- Specifically, the control characters are injected in user feedback content.
-  Exploitation occurs when this feedback is exported.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker requires a user account with the ability to provide feedback.
-  The attacker must be able to export user feedback.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is fixed by dropping all control characters that are not whitespace during the export.
- No publicly available exploits are known.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 3.5 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N)
