Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-26454:

**CVE-2023-26454**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation and sanitization in the Imageconverter API. Specifically, requests to fetch image metadata could be manipulated to inject arbitrary SQL queries.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   SQL Injection (CWE-89): The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker could execute arbitrary SQL statements within the context of the imageconverter service's database user account. This could lead to the compromise of sensitive data (confidentiality), modification of data (integrity), or denial of service due to data corruption or deletion (availability).
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Adjacent Network Access: Exploitation requires an attacker to have access to the same network as the imageconverter service, which is not exposed to the public network by default.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be on the same or an adjacent network as the vulnerable service. No specific user privileges are required, meaning that unauthenticated requests can be exploited.
*   **Affected Products/Versions:**
    *   OX App Suite office 7.10.6-rev5
    *   OX App Suite office 8.12
*   **Fixed Products/Versions:**
    *   OX App Suite office 7.10.6-rev6
    *   OX App Suite office 8.13
*   **Additional Details:**
    *   The vulnerability is located in the `getMetadata` endpoint of the Imageconverter API.
    *   The fix involves implementing proper checks for valid content in API requests, and logging attempts to bypass these checks.

This vulnerability is rated as **CRITICAL** with a CVSS score of 9.6.
