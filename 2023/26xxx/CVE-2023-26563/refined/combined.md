# NodeJS file system providers for Essential JS 2 File Manager

This repository contains the nodeJS file system provider used for Essential JS 2 File Manager component.

## Key Features

The Node.js file system provider module allows you to work with the physical file system. It also provides the methods for performing various file actions like creating a new folder, renaming files, and deleting files.

NodeJs File System Provider Serves the file system providers support for the FileManager component with the NodeJS.

The following actions can be performed with NodeJS file system provider.

| **Actions** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| Read | Reads the files from NodeJS file system. |
| Details | Gets the file's details which consists of Type, Size, Location and Modified date. |
| Download | Downloads the selected file or folder from NodeJS file system. |
| Upload | Uploads a file in NodeJS file system. It accepts uploaded media with the following characteristics:  * Maximum file size: 30MB * Accepted Media MIME types: `*/*` |
| Create | Creates a New folder. |
| Delete | Deletes a folder or file. |
| Copy | Copys the selected files or folders from target. |
| Move | Moves the files or folders to the desired location. |
| Rename | Renames a folder or file. |
| Search | Full-text questions perform linguistic searches against text data in full-text indexes by operating on words and phrases. |

## Access Control

The EJ2 FileManager allows you to define access permissions for files and folders using a set of access rules to user(s). The rules and roles should be specified in the `accessRules.json` available in the root folder of the package. The following table represents the access rule properties available for the files and folders.

| **Properties** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| Read | Allows access to read a file or folder. |
| Write | Allows permission to edit a file or folder. |
| WriteContents | Allows permission to edit the content of folder. |
| Copy | Allows permission to copy a file or folder. |
| Download | Allows permission to download a file or folder. |
| Upload | Allows permission to upload into the folder. |
| IsFile | Specifies whether the rule is specified for folder or file. |
| Role | Specifies the role to which the rule is applied. |
| Path | Specifies the path to apply the rules which are defined. |

For Example

```
{
    "role": "Administator",
    "rules":[
        //Denies downloading the 'Videos' folder.
        {"path":"/Videos/", "isFile": false,"role": "Administator", "download": "deny"},
        //Denies uploading files in all folders under 'Pictures' by displaying a custom access denied message.
        {"path":"/Pictures/*","isFile": false, "role": "Administator","upload": "deny","message":"you don't have permission for this, Contact admisinistrator for access."  },
        //Denies deleting and renaming all files in 'Downloads' folder.
        {"path":"/Downloads/*.*","isFile":true, "role": "Administator","write": "deny", },
        //Denies opening all 'png' files in 'Employees' folder.
        {"path":"/Pictures/Employees/*.png","isFile":true, "role": "Administator","read": "deny" },
        //Denies downloading all files with name 'FileManager' in 'Documents' folder.
        {"path":"/Documents/FileManager.*","isFile":true, "role": "Administator", "download": "deny", "message":"you don't have permission for this, Contact admisinistrator for access."  },
    ]
}
```

## How to configure a web service

Follow the below set of commands to configure the nodeJS file system providers.

* To install ej2-filemanager-node-filesystem package, use the following command.

```

  npm install @syncfusion/ej2-filemanager-node-filesystem

```

* To install the depend packages for the file system provider, navigate to @syncfusion/ej2-filemanager-node-filesystem folder within the node\_modules and run the below command

```

  npm install

```

* Now, run the below command line to check the Node API service in local and will be started in `http://localhost:8090/`. By default the nodeJS directory service is configured with `C:/Users`.

### To configure the port

* To change the port use like this `set PORT=3000`

For example:

```
set PORT=3000 && node filesystem-server.js -d D:/Projects
```

### start the service

To start the service use this command,

```
npm start
```

```
  var hostUrl = http://localhost:8090/;
        ajaxSettings: {
            url: hostUrl,
        }

```

## File download AjaxSettings

To perform download operation, initialize the `downloadUrl` property in ajaxSettings of the File Manager component.

```
  var hostUrl = http://localhost:8090/;
  ajaxSettings: {
            url: hostUrl,
            downloadUrl: hostUrl + 'Download'
        },

```

## File upload AjaxSettings

To perform upload operation, initialize the `uploadUrl` property in ajaxSettings of the File Manager component.

```
  var hostUrl = http://localhost:8090/;
  ajaxSettings: {
            url: hostUrl,
            uploadUrl: hostUrl + 'Upload'
        },

```

## File image preview AjaxSettings

To perform image preview support in the File Manager component, initialize the `getImageUrl` property in ajaxSettings of the File Manager component.

# CVE-2023-26563 - Local File Read in ASPCore Filemanager

Affected repository: <https://github.com/SyncfusionExamples/ej2-aspcore-file-provider/>
Vulnerable versions before Git commit 7c8791084ff86d4a2c225756c490591f6e011a6c

The application fails to verify any of the paths provided by the user. As a result, it's possible to specify directory traversal sequences ("../") to list files in any directory, read any local file, upload any file to anywhere on the server and delete any file on the server.

In the ASP core repository, most of the actual functionality is implemented in `Models/PhysicalFileProvider.cs`.

In the case of downloading, the `names` parameter is taken directly from the user's input in the request.

```
        public virtual void Download(string path, string[] names, params FileManagerDirectoryContent[] data)
        {
            try
            {
                string physicalPath = GetPath(path);
                String extension;
                int count = 0;
                ...
                if (names.Length > 1)
                    DownloadZip(path, names);

                if (count == names.Length)
                {
                    DownloadFile(path, names);
                }
```

This path is then directly used within the Path.combine function.

```
protected virtual void DownloadFile(string path, string[] names = null)
{

    if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(path))
    {
        try
        {
            path = (Path.Combine(contentRootPath + path, names[0]));
            HttpResponse response = HttpContext.Current.Response;
            response.Buffer = true;
            response.Clear();
            response.ContentType = "APPLICATION/octet-stream";
            string extension = System.IO.Path.GetExtension(path);
            response.AddHeader("content-disposition", string.Format("attachment; filename = \"{0}\"", System.IO.Path.GetFileName(path)));
            response.WriteFile(path);
            response.Flush();
            response.End();
        }
        catch (Exception ex) { throw ex; }
    }
    else throw new ArgumentNullException("name should not be null");

}
```

In most of the endpoints, they attempted to fix this with removing `../` but this can be trivially bypassed using something like `....//`, which after `.replace("../", "")`, will result in the original `../`.

# CVE-2023-26564 - Local File Read in EJ2 Node Filemanager

Affected repository: <https://github.com/SyncfusionExamples/ej2-filemanager-node-filesystem>
Vulnerable versions before Git commit 65bc929e34aa34a3a9db0dc1cc9cba03e19ba9e6

While the application does contain a regex to block directory traversal sequences, it does this only sometimes. As a result:

* On Windows, it's possible to list files in any directory, read any local file, upload any file to anywhere on the server and delete any file on the server.
* On Linux, it is not possible to list files within a directory. However, as it is possible to download directories (which are then served as ZIP), it is possible for a user to download directories to list other files.

In the node repository, all functionality is offered within a single file:
<https://github.com/SyncfusionExamples/ej2-filemanager-node-filesystem/blob/65bc929e34aa34a3a9db0dc1cc9cba03e19ba9e6/filesystem-server.js>

For downloading files, the root cause is fairly self explanatory, with the application trusting the user's input when concatenating the file paths together:

```
/**
 * Download a file or folder
 */
app.post('/Download', function (req, res) {
    replaceRequestParams(req, res);
    var downloadObj = JSON.parse(req.body.downloadInput);
    var permission; var permissionDenied = false;
    downloadObj.data.forEach(function (item) {
        var filepath = (contentRootPath + item.filterPath).replace(/\\/g, "/");
        permission = getPermission(filepath + item.name, item.name, item.isFile, contentRootPath, item.filterPath);
        if (permission != null && (!permission.read || !permission.download)) {
            permissionDenied = true;
            var errorMsg = new Error();
            errorMsg.message = (permission.message !== "") ? permission.message : getFileName(contentRootPath + item.filterPath + item.name) + " is not accessible. You need permission to perform the download action.";
            errorMsg.code = "401";
            response = { error: errorMsg };
            response = JSON.stringify(response);
            res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');
            res.json(response);
        }
    });
    if (!permissionDenied) {
        if (downloadObj.names.length === 1 && downloadObj.data[0].isFile) {
            var file = contentRootPath + downloadObj.path + downloadObj.names[0];
            res.download(file);
        } else {
            var archive = archiver('zip', {
                gzip: true,
                zlib: { level: 9 } // Sets the compression level.
            });
            var output = fs.createWriteStream('./Files.zip');
            downloadObj.data.forEach(function (item) {
                archive.on('error', function (err) {
                    throw err;
                });
                if (item.isFile) {
                    archive.file(contentRootPath + item.filterPath + item.name, { name: item.name });
                }
                else {
                    archive.directory(contentRootPath + item.filterPath + item.name + "/", item.name);
                }
            });
```

# CVE-2023-26565 - SQL Injection in SQL Server Database File Provider

Affected repository: <https://github.com/SyncfusionExamples/sql-server-database-aspcore-file-provider>
Vulnerable versions before Git commit d671e09d0cfddb8e3c87f172d8a9ca4caf5980a6

In the SQL server repository, most of the actual functionality is implemented in `Models/SQLFileProvider.cs`.

The SQL injection is fairly standard and frequent within the affected repository and can be exploited with a simple `sqlmap` command:

```
sqlmap -u 'http://localhost:9999/api/SQLProvider/SQLGetImage?path=1/&id=9225&time=1680527844871'

# File system provider in EJ2 TypeScript File manager control

11 Oct 202424 minutes to read

The file system provider allows the File Manager component to manage the files and folders in a physical or cloud-based file system. It provides the methods for performing various file actions like creating a new folder, copying and moving of files or folders, deleting, uploading, and downloading the files or folders in the file system.

The following file providers are added in Syncfusion EJ2 File Manager component.

* [ASP.NET Core file system provider](#aspnet-core-file-system-provider)
* [ASP.NET MVC 5 file system provider](#aspnet-mvc-5-file-system-provider)
* [ASP.NET Core Azure cloud file system Provider](#aspnet-core-azure-cloud-file-system-provider)
* [ASP.NET MVC 5 Azure cloud file system Provider](#aspnet-mvc-azure-cloud-file-system-provider)
* [ASP.NET Core Amazon S3 cloud file provider](#aspnet-core-amazon-s3-cloud-file-provider)
* [ASP.NET MVC Amazon S3 cloud file provider](#aspnet-mvc-amazon-s3-cloud-file-provider)
* [ASP.NET Core SharePoint file provider](#aspnet-core-SharePoint-file-provider)
* [File Transfer Protocol file system provider](#file-transfer-protocol-file-system-provider)

* [Firebase Realtime Database file system provider](#firebase-realtime-database-file-system-provider)
* [IBM Cloud Object Storage provider](#ibm-cloud-object-storage-file-provider)

## ASP.NET Core file system provider

The ASP.NET Core file system provider allows the users to access and manage the physical file system. To get started, clone the [ej2-aspcore-file-provider](https://github.com/SyncfusionExamples/ej2-aspcore-file-provider) using the following command.

```
git clone https://github.com/SyncfusionExamples/ej2-aspcore-file-provider  ej2-aspcore-file-provider

cd ej2-aspcore-file-provider
```

After cloning, just open the project in Visual Studio and restore the NuGet packages. Now, set the root directory of the physical file system in the FileManager controller.

After setting the root directory of the file system, just build and run the project. Now, the project will be hosted in `http://localhost:{port}` and just mapping the **ajaxSettings** property of the FileManager component to the appropriate controller methods allows to manage the files in the physical file system.

```
let hostUrl = 'http://localhost:{port}/';

// Initializing File Manager ASP.NET Core service.
let filemanagerInstance: FileManager = new FileManager({
    ajaxSettings: {
        // Replace the hosted port number in the place of "{port}"
        url: hostUrl + "api/FileManager/FileOperations",
        downloadUrl: hostUrl + "api/FileManager/Download",
        uploadUrl: hostUrl + "api/FileManager/Upload",
        getImageUrl: hostUrl + "api/FileManager/GetImage"
    }
});

filemanagerInstance.appendTo('#filemanager');
```
> Note: To learn more about the file actions that can be performed with ASP.NET Core file system provider, refer to this [link](https://github.com/SyncfusionExamples/ej2-aspcore-file-provider#key-features)

## ASP.NET MVC 5 file system provider

The ASP.NET MVC 5 file system provider allows the users to access and manage the physical file system. To get started, clone the [ej2-aspmvc-file-provider](https://github.com/SyncfusionExamples/ej2-aspmvc-file-provider) using the following command.

```
git clone https://github.com/SyncfusionExamples/ej2-aspmvc-file-provider ej2-aspmvc-file-provider

cd ej2-aspmvc-file-provider
```

After cloning, just open the project in Visual Studio and restore the NuGet packages. Now, set the root directory of the physical file system in the FileManager controller using the Root Folder method.

After setting the root directory of the file system, just build and run the project. Now, the project will be hosted in `http://localhost:{port}` and just mapping the **ajaxSettings** property of the FileManager component to the appropriate controller methods allows to manage the files in the physical file system.

```
let hostUrl = 'http://localhost:{port}/';

  // Initializing File Manager ASP.NET MVC service.
let filemanagerInstance: FileManager = new FileManager({
    ajaxSettings: {
        // Replace the hosted port number in the place of "{port}"
        url: hostUrl + "FileManager/FileOperations",
        downloadUrl: hostUrl + "FileManager/Download",
        uploadUrl: hostUrl + "FileManager/Upload",
        getImageUrl: hostUrl + "FileManager/GetImage"
    }
});

filemanagerInstance.appendTo('#filemanager');
```

## ASP.NET Core Azure cloud file system provider

In ASP.NET Core, Azure file system provider allows the users to access and manage the blobs in the Azure blob storage. To get started, clone the [azure-aspcore-file-provider](https://github.com/SyncfusionExamples/azure-aspcore-file-provider) using the following command

```
git clone https://github.com/SyncfusionExamples/azure-aspcore-file-provider  azure-aspcore-file-provider
```

After cloning, just open the project in Visual Studio and restore the NuGet packages. Now, register the Azure storage by passing details like name, password, and blob name to the Register Azure method in the FileManager controller.

```
 void RegisterAzure(string accountName, string accountKey, string blobName)
```

Then, set the blob container and the root blob directory by passing the corresponding URLs as parameters in the **setBlobContainer** method as follows.

```
  void setBlobContainer(string blobPath, string filePath)
```
> **Note:** Also, assign the same *blobPath URL* and *filePath URL* in [**AzureFileOperations** and **AzureUpload**](https://github.com/SyncfusionExamples/azure-aspcore-file-provider/blob/master/Controllers/AzureProviderController.cs) methods in the FileManager controller to determine the original path of the Azure blob.

After setting the blob container references, just build and run the project. Now, the project will be hosted in `http://localhost:{port}` and just mapping the **ajaxSettings** property of the FileManager component to the appropriate controller methods allows to manage the Azure blob storage.

```
let hostUrl = 'http://localhost:{port}/';

// Initializing File Manager Azure cloud file system service.
let filemanagerInstance: FileManager = new FileManager({
    ajaxSettings: {
        // Replace the hosted port number in the place of "{port}"
        url: hostUrl + "api/AzureProvider/AzureFileOperations",
        downloadUrl: hostUrl + "api/AzureProvider/AzureDownload",
        uploadUrl: hostUrl + "api/AzureProvider/AzureUpload",
        getImageUrl: hostUrl + "api/AzureProvider/AzureGetImage"
    }
});

filemanagerInstance.appendTo('#filemanager');
```
> **NuGet:** Additionally, we have created a [**NuGet**](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Syncfusion.EJ2.FileManager.AzureFileProvider.AspNet.Core) package of **ASP.NET Core Azure file system provider**.

Please, use the following command to install the NuGet package in an application.

## ASP.NET Core Amazon S3 cloud file provider

In ASP.NET Core, Amazon ***S3*** (*Simple Storage Service*) cloud file provider allows the users to access and manage a server hosted file system as collection of objects stored in the Amazon S3 Bucket. To get started, clone the [amazon-s3-aspcore-file-provider](https://github.com/SyncfusionExamples/amazon-s3-aspcore-file-provider) using the following command

```
git clone https://github.com/SyncfusionExamples/amazon-s3-aspcore-file-provider.git  amazon-s3-aspcore-file-provider.git
```
> **Note:** To learn more about creating and configuring an Amazon S3 bucket, refer to this [link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/create-configure-bucket.html).

After cloning, open the project in Visual Studio and restore the NuGet packages. Now, register Amazon S3 client account details like *awsAccessKeyId*, *awsSecretKeyId* and *awsRegion* details in **RegisterAmazonS3** method in the FileManager controller to perform the file operations.

```
 void RegisterAmazonS3(string bucketName, string awsAccessKeyId, string awsSecretAccessKey, string bucketRegion)
```

After registering the Amazon client account details, just build and run the project. Now, the project will be hosted in `http://localhost:{port}` and just mapping the **ajaxSettings** property of the FileManager component to the appropriate controller methods allows to manage the Amazon ***S3*** (*Simple Storage Service*) bucketâs objects storage.

```
let hostUrl = 'http://localhost:{port}/';

// Initializing File Manager with Amazon S3 service configuration.
let filemanagerInstance: FileManager = new FileManager({
    // Replace the hosted port number in the place of "{port}"

## ASP.NET Core SharePoint file provider

The ASP.NET Core SharePoint file provider allows users to access and manage files within Microsoft SharePoint. To get started, clone the [SharePoint-aspcore-file-provider](https://github.com/SyncfusionExamples/sharepoint-aspcore-file-provider) using the following command.

```
git clone https://github.com/SyncfusionExamples/sharepoint-aspcore-file-provider  sharepoint-aspcore-file-provider

cd sharepoint-aspcore-file-provider
```

**Prerequisites**

To set up the SharePoint service provider, follow these steps:

1. **Create an App Registration in Azure Active Directory (AAD):**
   * Navigate to the Azure portal and create a new app registration under Azure Active Directory.
   * Note down the **Tenant ID**, **Client ID**, and **Client Secret** from the app registration.
2. **Use Microsoft Graph Instance:**
   * With the obtained Tenant ID, Client ID, and Client Secret, you can create a Microsoft Graph instance.
   * This instance will be used to interact with the SharePoint document library.
3. **Use Details from `appsettings.json`:**
   * The `SharePointController` is already configured to use the credentials provided in the `appsettings.json` file.
   * You only need to provide your `Tenant ID`, `Client ID`, `Client Secret`, `User Site Name`, and `User Drive ID` in the `appsettings.json` file, and the application will automatically initialize the SharePoint service.

**Example `appsettings.json` Configuration**

```
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Warning"
    }
  },
  "SharePointSettings": {
    "TenantId": "<--Tenant Id-->",
    "ClientId": "<--Client Id-->",
    "ClientSecret": "<--Client Secret-->",
    "UserSiteName": "<--User Site Name-->",
    "UserDriveId": "<--User Drive ID-->"
  },
  "AllowedHosts": "*"
}
```

Replace â<âUser Site Nameâ>â, â<âUser Drive IDâ>â, âtenantIdâ, âclientIdâ, and âclientSecretâ with your actual values.

After configuring the SharePoint file provider, build and run the project. Now, the project will be hosted in `http://localhost:{port}` and just mapping the **ajaxSettings** property of the File Manager component to the appropriate controller methods allows to manage the files in the Microsoft SharePoint.

```
let hostUrl = 'http://localhost:{port}/';

// Initializing File Manager ASP.NET Core service.
let filemanagerInstance: FileManager = new FileManager({
    ajaxSettings: {
        // Replace the hosted port number in the place of "{port}"
        url: hostUrl + 'api/SharePointProvider/SharePointFileOperations',
        downloadUrl: hostUrl + 'api/SharePointProvider/SharePointDownload',
        uploadUrl: hostUrl + 'api/SharePointProvider/SharePointUpload',
        getImageUrl: hostUrl + 'api/SharePointProvider/SharePointGetImage'
    }
});

filemanagerInstance.appendTo('#filemanager');
```

## File Transfer Protocol file system provider

In ASP.NET Core, File Transfer Protocol file system provider allows the users to access to the hosted file system as collection of objects stored in the file storage using File Transfer Protocol. To get started, clone the [ftp-aspcore-file-provider](https://github.com/SyncfusionExamples/ftp-aspcore-file-provider) using the following command

```
git clone https://github.com/SyncfusionExamples/ftp-aspcore-file-provider.git  ftp-aspcore-file-provider.git
```

After cloning, open the project in Visual Studio and restore the NuGet packages. Now, register File Transfer Protocol details like *hostName*, *userName* and *password* in **SetFTPConnection** method in the FileManager controller to perform the file operations.

```
void SetFTPConnection(string hostName, string userName, string password)
```

After registering the File Transfer Protocol details, just build and run the project. Now, the project will be hosted in `http://localhost:{port}` and just mapping the **ajaxSettings** property of the FileManager component to the appropriate controller methods allows to manage the FTPâs objects storage.

```
let hostUrl = 'http://localhost:{port}/';

// Initializing File Manager with file transfer protocol service configuration.
let filemanagerInstance: FileManager = new FileManager({

## SQL database file system provider

In ASP.NET Core, SQL database file system provider in ASP.NET Core allows the users to manage the file system being maintained in a SQL database table. Unlike the other file system providers, the SQL database file system provider works on ID basis. Here, each file and folder have a unique ID based on which all the file operations will be performed. To get started, clone the [sql-server-database-aspcore-file-provider](https://github.com/SyncfusionExamples/sql-server-database-aspcore-file-provider) using the following command.

```
<add name="FileExplorerConnection" connectionString="Data Source=(LocalDB)\v11.0;AttachDbFilename=|DataDirectory|\FileManager.mdf;Integrated Security=True;Trusted_Connection=true" />
```

After cloning, just open the project in Visual Studio and restore the NuGet packages. To establish the SQL server connection with the database file (for eg: FileManager.mdf), specify the connection string in the web config file as follows.

```
<add name="FileExplorerConnection" connectionString="Data Source=(LocalDB)\v11.0;AttachDbFilename=|DataDirectory|\FileManager.mdf;Integrated Security=True;Trusted_Connection=true" />
```

Then, make an entry for the connection string in `appsettings.json` file as follows.

```
"ConnectionStrings": {
    "FileManagerConnection": "Data Source=(LocalDB)\\MSSQLLocalDB;AttachDbFilename=|DataDirectory|\\App_Data\\FileManager.mdf;Integrated Security=True;Connect Timeout=30"
}
```

Now, to configure the database connection, set the connection name, table name and root folder ID value by passing these values to the SetSQLConnection method.

```
void SetSQLConnection(string name, string tableName, string tableID)
```
> Refer to this [FileManager.mdf](https://github.com/SyncfusionExamples/sql-server-database-aspcore-file-provider/blob/master/App_Data/FileManager.mdf), to learn about the pre-defined file system SQL database for the EJ2 File Manager.

After configuring the connection, just build and run the project. Now, the project will be hosted in `http://localhost:{port}` and just mapping the **ajaxSettings** property of the FileManager component to the appropriate controller methods allows to manage the files in the SQL database table.

```
let hostUrl = 'http://localhost:{port}/';

// Initializing File Manager with SQL Server Database service configuration.
let filemanagerInstance: FileManager = new FileManager({
    ajaxSettings: {
        // Replace the hosted port number in the place of "{port}"
        url: hostUrl + "api/SQLProvider/SQLFileOperations",
        downloadUrl: hostUrl + "api/SQLProvider/SQLDownload",
        uploadUrl: hostUrl + "api/SQLProvider/SQLUpload",
        getImageUrl: hostUrl + "api/SQLProvider/SQLGetImage"
    }
});

filemanagerInstance.appendTo('#filemanager');
```

## Node file system provider

The Node file system provider allows the users to manage the files and folders in a physical file system. It provides methods for performing all basic file operations like creating a folder, copy, move, delete, and download files and folders in the file system. We can use of the Node file system provider either by installing the [ej2-filemanager-node-filesystem](https://www.npmjs.com/package/%40syncfusion/ej2-filemanager-node-filesystem) package or by cloning the [file system provider](https://github.com/SyncfusionExamples/ej2-filemanager-node-filesystem) from the GitHub.

### Using ej2-filemanager-node-filesystem package

* Install the ej2-filemanager-node-filesystem package by running the below command.

```
npm install @syncfusion/ej2-filemanager-node-filesystem
```

* After installing the package, navigate to the ej2-filemanager-node-filesystem package folder within the node-modules.
* Run the command **npm install** command.

### Cloning the ej2-filemanager-node-filesystem from GitHub

* Clone the ej2-filemanager-node-filesystem using the following command.

```
git clone  https://github.com/SyncfusionExamples/ej2-filemanager-node-filesystem.git node-filesystem-provider
```

* After cloning, open the root folder and run the command **npm install** command.

After installing the packages, set the root folder directory of the physical file system in the package JSON under scripts sections as follows.

```
"start": "node filesystem-server.js -d D:/Projects"
```
> **Note:** By default, the root directory will be configured to set `C:/Users` as the root directory.

To set the port in which the project to be hosted and the root directory of the file system. Run the following command.

```
set PORT=3000 && node filesystem-server.js -d D:/Projects
```
> **Note:** By default, the service will run `8090` port.

Now, just mapping the **ajaxSettings** property of the FileManager component to the appropriate file operation methods in the filesystem-server.js file will allows to manage the physical file system with Node file system provider.

```
let hostUrl = 'http://localhost:{port}/';

// Initializing File Manager with NodeJS service.
let filemanagerInstance: FileManager = new FileManager({
    // Replace the hosted port number in the place of "{port}"
    ajaxSettings: {
        url: hostUrl,
        downloadUrl: hostUrl + "Download",
        uploadUrl: hostUrl + "Upload",
        getImageUrl: hostUrl + "GetImage"
    }
});

filemanagerInstance.appendTo('#filemanager');
```

## Google Drive file system provider

In ASP.NET Core, Google Drive file system provider in ASP.NET Core allows the users to manage the files and folders in a Google Drive account. The Google Drive file system provider works on ID basis where each file and folder have a unique ID. To get started, clone the [google-drive-aspcore-file-provider](https://github.com/SyncfusionExamples/google-drive-aspcore-file-provider) using the following command.

```
git clone https://github.com/SyncfusionExamples/google-drive-aspcore-file-provider  google-drive-aspcore-file-provider

cd google-drive-aspcore-file-provider
```

Google Drive file system provider use the [Google Drive APIs](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/reference/) to read the file in the file system and uses the [OAuth 2.0](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2) protocol for authentication and authorization. To authenticate from the client end, obtain OAuth 2.0 client credentials from the `Google API Console`. To learn more about generating the client credentials from the from Google API Console, refer to this [link](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/javascript-implicit-flow).

After generating the client secret data, copy the JSON data to the following specified JSON files in the cloned location.

* EJ2GoogleDriveFileProvider > credentials > client\_secret.json
* GoogleOAuth2.0Base > credentials > client\_secret.json

After updating the credentials, just build and run the project. Now, the project will be hosted in `http://localhost:{port}`, and it will ask to log on to the Gmail account created for the client secret credentials. Then, provide permission to access the Google Drive files by clicking the allow access button in the page. Now, just mapping the **ajaxSettings** property of the FileManager component to the appropriate controller methods will allows to manage the files from the Google Drive.

```
 let hostUrl = 'http://localhost:{port}/';

// Initializing File Manager with Google drive service configuration.
let filemanagerInstance: FileManager = new FileManager({
    ajaxSettings: {
        // Replace the hosted port number in the place of "{port}"
        url: hostUrl + "api/GoogleDriveProvider/GoogleDriveFileOperations",
        downloadUrl: hostUrl + "api/GoogleDriveProvider/GoogleDriveDownload",
        uploadUrl: hostUrl + "api/GoogleDriveProvider/GoogleDriveUpload",
        getImageUrl: hostUrl + "api/GoogleDriveProvider/GoogleDriveGetImage"
    }
});

filemanagerInstance.appendTo('#filemanager');

## Firebase Realtime Database file system provider

The [Firebase Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/) file system provider in **ASP.NET Core** provides the efficient way to store the File Manager file system in a cloud database as JSON representation.

### Generate Secret access key from service account

Follow the given steps to generate the secret access key:

* To access the Firebase console, please click on this [link](https://console.firebase.google.com/). Once you have accessed the console, you can create a new project by filling in the necessary fields and clicking on the relevant buttons.

![create-project](images/create-project.png)

* Within the Firebase console, navigate to the **Build** tab. Under this tab, select the option for **Realtime Database**. From there, you can create a new database by clicking on the **Create Database** button.

![database-creation](images/database-creation.png)

* To get started, create a root node and add any desired children to it. Please refer to the following code snippet for guidance on the structure of the JSON:

```
{
  "Files" : [ {
    "caseSensitive" : false,
    "dateCreated" : "8/22/2019 5:17:55 PM",
    "dateModified" : "8/22/2019 5:17:55 PM",
    "filterId" : "0/",
    "filterPath" : "/",
    "hasChild" : false,
    "id" : "5",
    "isFile" : false,
    "isRoot" : true,
    "name" : "Music",
    "parentId" : "0",
    "selected" : false,
    "showHiddenItems" : false,
    "size" : 0,
    "type" : "folder"
  },
   {
    "caseSensitive" : false,
    "dateCreated" : "8/22/2019 5:18:03 PM",
    "dateModified" : "8/22/2019 5:18:03 PM",
    "filterId" : "0/",
    "filterPath" : "/",
    "hasChild" : false,
    "id" : "6",
    "isFile" : false,
    "isRoot" : true,
    "name" : "videos",
    "parentId" : "0",
    "selected" : false,
    "showHiddenItems" : false,
    "size" : 0,
    "type" : ""
  }]
 }
```

Here, the `Files` denotes the `rootNode` and the subsequent object refers to the children of the root node. `rootNode` will be taken as the root folder of the file system loaded which will be loaded in File Manager component.

* To import a JSON file into the Firebase Realtime Database, navigate to the **Data** tab and click on the action icon shown in the accompanying image. From there, select the **Import JSON** option and upload the JSON file that was created using the code provided above.

![import-json](images/import-json.png)

* To interact with the Firebase Realtime Database through your application, it is necessary to grant read and write permissions by defining appropriate rules in the Firebase projectâs **Rules tab**, as shown in the following code snippet. Once you have specified the rules, you can publish them by clicking the **Publish** button to enable the necessary authentication.

```
{
  /* Visit https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/security to learn more about security rules. */
  "rules": {
    ".read": "auth!=null",
    ".write": "auth!=null"
  }
}
```
> **Note:** By default, rules of a Firebase project will be **false**. To read and write the data, configure the **Rules** as given in the following code snippet in the *Rules* tab in the Firebase Realtime Database project.

* Navigate to the project settings as instructed and then click on the **Service Account** tab.

![service](images/service.png)

* To obtain the access key JSON file, simply click on the `Generate new private key` button and then confirm by clicking the `Generate key` button in the pop-up window that appears.

![generate_key](images/generate_key.png)

* Next, you will need to clone the [`firebase-realtime-database-aspcore-file-provider`](https://github.com/SyncfusionExamples/firebase-realtime-database-aspcore-file-provider) repository. Once cloned, simply open the project in Visual Studio and restore the NuGet package.
* Once you have generated the secret key, you will need to replace the JSON in the `access_key.json` file in the Firebase Realtime Database provider project with the newly generated key. This will enable authentication and allow you to perform read and write operations.
* In the **Data** tab, locate the project API URL and then paste it into the below mentioned section.

![api_url](images/api_url.png)

Register the Firebase Realtime Database by assigning *Firebase Realtime Database REST API link*, *rootNode*, and *serviceAccountKeyPath* parameters in the `RegisterFirebaseRealtimeDB` method of class `FirebaseRealtimeDBFileProvider` in the controller part of the ASP.NET Core application.

```
this.operation.RegisterFirebaseRealtimeDB(string apiUrl, string rootNode, string serviceAccountKeyPath)
```

**Example:**

```
this.operation.RegisterFirebaseRealtimeDB("{copy your API URL here}", "Files", hostingEnvironment.ContentRootPath + \\FirebaseRealtimeDBHelper\\access_key.json);
```

In the above code,

* `{copy your API URL here}` denotes Firebase Realtime Database REST API link.
* `Files` denotes newly created root node in Firebase Realtime Database.
* `hostingEnvironment.ContentRootPath + \\FirebaseRealtimeDBHelper\\access_key.json` denotes service account key path which has authentication key for the Firebase Realtime Database data.

After configuring the Firebase Realtime Database service link, build and run the project. Now, the project will be hosted in `http://localhost:{port}` and just mapping the **ajaxSettings** property of the File Manager component to the appropriate controller methods allows to manage the files in the Firebase Realtime Database.

```
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
    selector: 'app-root',
    styleUrls: ['app/app.component.css'],
    templateUrl: 'app/app.component.html'
})
export class AppComponent {
    public ajaxSettings: object;
    public hostUrl: string = 'http://localhost:{port}/';
    public ngOnInit(): void {
        // Initializing File Manager with Firebase Realtime Database service.
        this.ajaxSettings = {
            // Replace the hosted port number in the place of "{port}"
            url = this.hostUrl + "api/FirebaseProvider/FirebaseRealtimeFileOperations",
            downloadUrl = this.hostUrl + "api/FirebaseProvider/FirebaseRealtimeDownload",
            uploadUrl = this.hostUrl + "api/FirebaseProvider/FirebaseRealtimeUpload",
            getImageUrl = this.hostUrl + "api/FirebaseProvider/FirebaseRealtimeGetImage"
        };
    }
}
```
