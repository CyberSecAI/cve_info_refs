- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input sanitization in the `module.exports` function of the `n158` package.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command injection vulnerability due to lack of sanitization of user-provided input.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the system hosting the Node.js environment where the vulnerable package is used. This can lead to total loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the impacted component.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, exploiting read/write/execute capabilities. Specifically, by providing a malicious payload in the `name` parameter to the `init` command of the `n158` binary.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Attackers require low privileges that provide basic user capabilities and the ability to run Node.js code within the target environment. This typically requires some level of access to the system or application hosting the Node.js environment.
