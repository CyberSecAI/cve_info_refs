    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to prototype pollution through improper input sanitization within the safe-eval package.",

      "Prototype pollution",
      "Improper input sanitization"

     "attack_vectors": [
       "Exploiting vulnerable functions like `__defineGetter__`, `stack()`, `toLocaleString()`, `propertyIsEnumerable.call()`, and `valueOf()` within the safe-eval sandbox.",
        "Using `import()` to access the constructor and from there to the process module to execute code"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to execute code within the `safe-eval` sandbox. No user interaction is required for exploitation."
