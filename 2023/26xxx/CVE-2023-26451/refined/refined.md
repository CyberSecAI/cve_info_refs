Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2023-26451:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the use of insufficient randomness in the generation of authorization tokens for the integrated OAuth Authorization Service.

**Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values:** The core issue is that the functions used to generate authorization tokens did not produce sufficiently random values, making them predictable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Authorization Code Prediction:** The predictable nature of the authorization codes allowed third parties to potentially intercept and take over the client authorization process.
*   **Account Compromise:**  Exploitation could lead to the compromise of other user accounts by hijacking their OAuth sessions.
*   **Confidentiality Impact:** Successful exploitation leads to a high impact on confidentiality because unauthorized access to user accounts is possible.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack can be carried out over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Privileges Required:** An attacker does not need any specific user privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **No User Interaction:**  No user interaction is needed to conduct this attack.
*   **Network Access**: The attacker needs network access to reach the vulnerable service.
*   The OAuth Authorization Service, while not enabled by default, needs to be active for the exploit to be viable.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in OX App Suite backend version 8.11. It was fixed in version 8.12.
*   There were no publicly available exploits known for this vulnerability at the time of disclosure.
*   The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 7.5, with a severity rating of "HIGH."
