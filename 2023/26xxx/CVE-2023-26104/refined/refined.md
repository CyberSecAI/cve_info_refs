Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `decodeURIComponent()` function within the `lite-web-server` package. When the function encounters control characters that it cannot parse within a URL, it throws an exception. This exception is not properly handled, causing the server to crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Improper Input Handling:** The `lite-web-server` does not validate or sanitize user-provided URLs before passing them to `decodeURIComponent()`.
- **Lack of Exception Handling:** The code does not catch the exception thrown by `decodeURIComponent()`, leading to an unhandled exception and a server crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful attack renders the server unavailable to legitimate users due to the crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP request to the server.
- **Malicious URL:** The crafted request includes a URL with control characters that cannot be decoded by the `decodeURIComponent()` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- **No Authentication Required:** No user authentication or special privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code is located in `src/WebServer.js` at line 274: `var _url = decodeURIComponent(req.url).slice(1);`
- The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a request that includes unicode characters outside of the ASCII scope of URLs, such as `curl http://<host>:<port>/..%c0%2fetc%c0%2fhosts`.
- The `decodeURIComponent()` function will throw an error when processing the control characters (`%c0`), leading to the crash.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in `lite-web-server` version 1.2.2.
- There is no fixed version of the package.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 7.5 (High) according to both Snyk and NVD.
- Snyk has a proof-of-concept (PoC) for this vulnerability, and it is considered mature.
- The EPSS score of 0.16% (53rd percentile) suggests a relatively low probability of exploitation in the wild.
