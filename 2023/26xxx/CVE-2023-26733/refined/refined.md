**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Global buffer overflow
- Null pointer dereference

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS) via program abortion/crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- By providing a crafted TIFF file, an attacker can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to provide a malicious TIFF file to be processed by the vulnerable application.
- No special privileges are required.
