Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE-2023-26544**

*   **Root Cause:** A missing bounds check in the `run_unpack` function of the `ntfs3` filesystem driver. Specifically, when parsing an attribute record, the kernel does not validate if the `run_off` field, which indicates the offset to packed runs within the attribute, is within the bounds of the attribute's size.
*   **Vulnerability:** Integer overflow leading to slab-out-of-bounds read. If `attr->nres.run_off` is larger than `attr->size`, an invalid `run_buf_size` argument is passed to `run_unpack_ex()`.
*   **Impact:** A slab-out-of-bounds read can lead to a kernel crash (Denial of Service), and potentially other memory corruption issues.
*   **Attack Vector:** A specially crafted NTFS filesystem image containing a malformed attribute record with a `run_off` field greater than the attribute size. This could be triggered via mounting the malicious NTFS image.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to mount a specially crafted NTFS filesystem image on the vulnerable system. Local access is required for this.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability occurs in the `fs/ntfs3/run.c` file, specifically in the `run_unpack` function.
*   The fix involves adding a sanity check to ensure that the offset to the packed runs (`roff`) is not greater than the attribute size (`asize`) within the `ntfs_read_mft` function in `fs/ntfs3/inode.c`.
*   The provided patch adds this check: `if (roff > asize) { err = -EINVAL; goto out; }`
*   This vulnerability was reported by syzkaller.
*   The NetApp advisory NTAP-20230316-0010 also lists this CVE as affecting certain NetApp HCI Baseboard Management Controllers due to the inclusion of vulnerable Linux Kernel 6.0.8.
*   The SUSE bug report indicates that the fix has been backported to stable kernel branches.
