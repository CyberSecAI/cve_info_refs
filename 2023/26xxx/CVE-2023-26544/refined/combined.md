==================================================================
Kernel will tries to read record and parse MFT from disk in
ntfs\_read\_mft().
Yet the problem is that during enumerating attributes in record,
kernel doesn't check whether run\_off field loading from the disk
is a valid value.
To be more specific, if attr->nres.run\_off is larger than attr->size,
kernel will passes an invalid argument run\_buf\_size in
run\_unpack\_ex(), which having an integer overflow. Then this invalid
argument will triggers the slab-out-of-bounds Read bug as above.
This patch solves it by adding the sanity check between
the offset to packed runs and attribute size.

No upstream patch yet it seems. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1208694#c2)  Petr Mladek   2023-02-28 09:44:15 UTC  ``` Goldwyn, do we actually want to have CONFIG_NTFS3_FS enabled? Who of your team could could take care of this bug, please? ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1208694#c3)  Goldwyn Rodrigues   2023-02-28 19:07:54 UTC  ``` NTFS in kernel is only enabled in opensuse products.

The cause of this is using a loop termination condition that compares     window index (iw) with wnd->nbits instead of wnd->nwnd, due to which the     index used for wnd->free_bits exceeds the size of the array allocated.          Fix the loop condition.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1208697#c0)  Carlos López   2023-02-27 12:31:00 UTC  ``` CVE-2023-26544  In the Linux kernel 6.0.8, there is a use-after-free in run_unpack in fs/ntfs3/run.c, related to a difference between NTFS sector size and media sector size.  References: <http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-26544> <https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-26544> <https://lkml.org/lkml/2023/2/20/128> ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1208697#c1)  Carlos López   2023-02-27 12:31:27 UTC  ``` CONFIG_NTFS3_FS is only enabled in stable and master, so only relevant for Leap and Tumbleweed. No upstream patch yet it seems. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1208697#c2)  Petr Mladek   2023-02-28 09:45:23 UTC  ``` Goldwyn, do we actually want to have CONFIG_NTFS3_FS enabled? Who of your team could could take care of this bug, please? ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1208697#c3)  Petr Mladek   2023-03-01 13:16:05 UTC  ``` The same question was answered in the [bug #1208694](show_bug.cgi?id=1208694 "RESOLVED FIXED - VUL-0: CVE-2023-26606: kernel-source-rt,kernel-source,kernel-source-azure: use-after-free in ntfs_trim_fs in fs/ntfs3/bitmap.c."). Assigning this bug to Goldwyn as well for now. ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1208697#c4)  Vasant Karasulli   2023-03-16 13:35:45 UTC  ``` David, Goldwyn, any updates on this issue? ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1208697#c5)  David Disseldorp   2023-03-16 15:04:54 UTC  ``` (In reply to Karasulli from [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=1208697#c4)) > David, Goldwyn, any updates on this issue?  Yes, I think this also a bogus report against a known (fixed) bug, similar to [https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1208694](show_bug.cgi?id=1208694 "RESOLVED FIXED - VUL-0: CVE-2023-26606: kernel-source-rt,kernel-source,kernel-source-azure: use-after-free in ntfs_trim_fs in fs/ntfs3/bitmap.c.") . I'm in the process of confirming this via the syzkaller reproducer. ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1208697#c6)  David Disseldorp   2023-03-17 11:43:57 UTC  ``` (In reply to David Disseldorp from [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=1208697#c5)) > (In reply to Karasulli from [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=1208697#c4)) > > David, Goldwyn, any updates on this issue? >  > Yes, I think this also a bogus report against a known (fixed) bug, similar > to [https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1208694](show_bug.cgi?id=1208694 "RESOLVED FIXED - VUL-0: CVE-2023-26606: kernel-source-rt,kernel-source,kernel-source-azure: use-after-free in ntfs_trim_fs in fs/ntfs3/bitmap.c.") .

I'm convinced this is another report against an old kernel, which was already fixed via:  commit 887bfc546097fbe8071dac13b2fef73b77920899 Author: Hawkins Jiawei <yin31149@gmail.com> Date:   Fri Sep 23 19:09:04 2022 +0800      fs/ntfs3: Fix slab-out-of-bounds read in run_unpack          Syzkaller reports slab-out-of-bounds bug as follows:     ==================================================================     BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in run_unpack+0x8b7/0x970 fs/ntfs3/run.c:944     Read of size 1 at addr ffff88801bbdff02 by task syz-executor131/3611          [...]     Call Trace:      <TASK>      __dump_stack lib/dump_stack.c:88 [inline]      dump_stack_lvl+0xcd/0x134 lib/dump_stack.c:106      print_address_description mm/kasan/report.c:317 [inline]      print_report.cold+0x2ba/0x719 mm/kasan/report.c:433      kasan_report+0xb1/0x1e0 mm/kasan/report.c:495      run_unpack+0x8b7/0x970 fs/ntfs3/run.c:944      run_unpack_ex+0xb0/0x7c0 fs/ntfs3/run.c:1057      ntfs_read_mft fs/ntfs3/inode.c:368 [inline]      ntfs_iget5+0xc20/0x3280 fs/ntfs3/inode.c:501      ntfs_loadlog_and_replay+0x124/0x5d0 fs/ntfs3/fsntfs.c:272      ntfs_fill_super+0x1eff/0x37f0 fs/ntfs3/super.c:1018      get_tree_bdev+0x440/0x760 fs/super.c:1323      vfs_get_tree+0x89/0x2f0 fs/super.c:1530      do_new_mount fs/namespace.c:3040 [inline]      path_mount+0x1326/0x1e20 fs/namespace.c:3370      do_mount fs/namespace.c:3383 [inline]      __do_sys_mount fs/namespace.c:3591 [inline]      __se_sys_mount fs/namespace.c:3568 [inline]      __x64_sys_mount+0x27f/0x300 fs/namespace.c:3568      do_syscall_x64 arch/x86/entry/common.c:50 [inline]      do_syscall_64+0x35/0xb0 arch/x86/entry/common.c:80      entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x63/0xcd      [...]  The fix is present in mainline v6.2+ and backported for many stable branches (including v6.0.17+, which the reporter should have been able to test against).
