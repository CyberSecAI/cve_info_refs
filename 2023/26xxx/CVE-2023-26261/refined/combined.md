CVE-2023-26261 - WAAP Gateway/Cloud - Authentication bypass via blind XPath injection

 [Raw](/Jakick/7d1635b886654ddd0e476b3c79a7ba9f/raw/a4e28636c2f3c01a06c8a78ecbb12d202a209dc7/gistfile1.txt)

|  | In UBIKA WAAP Gateway/Cloud through 6.10, a blind XPath injection leads to an authentication bypass by stealing the session of another connected user. |
| --- | --- |
|  | As a basic security requirement and also to prevent this attack, we strongly recommend that the administration interface (running on port 3001/tcp) is restricted to administrators only (by source IP fire-walling or admin VLAN segregation). |
|  | The fixed versions are WAAP Gateway & Cloud 6.11.0 and 6.5.6-patch15. |
|  | A patch (cpt) is available for versions prior to 6.11 and 6.5.6-patch15. |
