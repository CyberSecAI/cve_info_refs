Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2023-26445:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the way frontend themes are handled in OX App Suite. These themes are defined by user-controllable `jslob` settings. The application did not sanitize the theme values. This allows a malicious user to point to a malicious resource, which is then processed during login.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a persistent XSS vulnerability (CWE-79). By setting a malicious theme resource, an attacker can inject and execute arbitrary script code within the victim's browser context. The theme value was not sanitized.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Session Hijacking:** Successful exploitation can lead to session hijacking.
*   **Triggering Unwanted Actions:** Malicious code can trigger unwanted actions via the web interface and API.
*   **Account Compromise:** An attacker could potentially compromise user accounts through session hijacking or other malicious actions triggered by the injected script.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is performed over the network.
*  **User-Controllable Setting**: The theme value is controlled via `jslob` settings which can be modified by an attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs low privileges to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker needs temporary access to a user account.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker can also lure a user to a compromised account which will trigger the malicious code when the user logs in.
*   **Access to User Account:** To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would require temporary access to a user's account or the ability to lure a user to a compromised account.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered on 2023-03-20.
*   A fix was implemented and released on 2023-04-20.
*   The fix involves sanitizing the theme value and using a default fallback if no theme matches.
*   No publicly available exploits are known at the time of the advisory.
*   The vulnerability affects OX App Suite frontend versions up to 7.10.6-rev27, and it is fixed in version 7.10.6-rev28.
