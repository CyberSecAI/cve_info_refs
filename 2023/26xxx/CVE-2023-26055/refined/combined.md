#### Description

**Steps to reproduce**

1. As a user with programming rights, create a new AWM application with a field of type short text.
2. As a user with just edit rights, create a new entry in the AWM application with content
   ```
   {{async async="true" cached="false" context="doc.reference"}}{{groovy}}println("Hello from groovy!"){{/groovy}}{{/async}}

   ```

   in the short text field

**Expected result**

The value

```
{{async async="true" cached="false" context="doc.reference"}}{{groovy}}println("Hello from groovy!"){{/groovy}}{{/async}}

```

is displayed in the text field.

**Actual result**

The value Hello from groovy! is displayed.

This demonstrates a privilege escalation attack from edit to programming rights. This can be exploited on any AWM application that has been created by a user with programming rights and contains a text field that is not the title. I haven't checked if other fields are exploitable, too. From what I've seen, the demo applications don't contain such a field. As this should be a common situation, I don't see that this limits the applicability of the attack.

The affects version is only the version I reproduced this on, this should also affect much older versions of XWiki.

# Privilege escalation to programming rights via user's first name

Critical

[tmortagne](/tmortagne)
published
GHSA-8cw6-4r32-6r3h
Mar 1, 2023

## Package

maven

org.xwiki.commons:xwiki-commons-xml
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

>= 3.1-milestone-1

## Patched versions

14.7-rc-1, 13.10.9, 14.4.4

## Description

### Impact

Any user can edit his own profile and inject code which is going to be executed with programming right.

Steps to reproduce:

* Set your first name to

```
    {{cache id="userProfile"}}{{groovy}}println("Hello from groovy!"){{/groovy}}{{/cache}}

```

The first name appears as interpreted "`Hello from groovy`" instead of the expected fully escaped "`{{cache id="userProfile"}}{{groovy}}println("Hello from groovy!"){{/groovy}}{{/cache}}`".

The same vulnerability can also be exploited in all other places where short text properties are displayed, e.g., in apps created using [Apps Within Minutes](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/App%20Within%20Minutes%20Application) that use a short text field.

### Patches

The problem has been patched on versions 13.10.9, 14.4.4, 14.7RC1.

### Workarounds

There are no other workarounds than upgrading XWiki or patching the xwiki-commons-xml JAR file.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

#### Description

**Steps to reproduce**

1. Log in as a user without script rights.
2. Set your first name to

```
{{cache id="userProfile"}}{{groovy}}println("Hello from groovy!"){{/groovy}}{{/cache}}

```

**Expected result:**

```
{{cache id="userProfile"}}{{groovy}}println("Hello from groovy!"){{/groovy}}{{/cache}}

```

is displayed as first name.

**Actual result:**

The username in the profile is Hello from groovy!

This demonstrates a privilege escalation attack to programming rights. I don't know yet why or how this works as this was primarily a surprise result while trying to reproduce another vulnerability.

I've also verified that you can actually do dangerous stuff, for example

```
{{async async="true" cached="false" context="doc.reference"}}{{velocity}}#set($descriptor = $services.wiki.currentWikiDescriptor)) #set($void = $descriptor.setOwnerId("XWiki.NewOwner")) #set($void = $services.wiki.saveDescriptor($descriptor)){{/velocity}}{{/async}}

```

sets the wiki's owner to the given user id.

The affects version is only the version I reproduced the issue on, this is quite likely much older.
