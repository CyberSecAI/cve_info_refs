Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-26055:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient escaping of curly braces `{` within the `XWikiUtils#escapeElementText` function. This allows users to inject XWiki script code into short text fields, such as user profile first name fields or custom application fields, which are then executed with programming rights.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Sanitization:** The core issue is the lack of proper escaping of special characters (specifically, curly braces) in user-provided input before it is rendered. This allows for code injection.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By injecting and executing malicious script code within these fields, a user with only edit rights can gain programming rights, which they are not intended to have. This is a privilege escalation vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary code on the server with the privileges of the XWiki application, leading to potential data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.
*   **Data Modification:** The attacker can modify data, potentially including sensitive information, as demonstrated in the example of changing the wiki's owner.
*  **System Compromise:** Through arbitrary code execution, the attacker could gain complete control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **User Profile Fields:**  An attacker can inject malicious code by modifying their own first name field.
*   **AWM Applications:** The vulnerability is also exploitable within applications created using the "App Within Minutes" (AWM) feature if they include short text fields.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs only basic user-level privileges that allow them to edit their own profile or create entries in AWM applications.
*   **No User Interaction:** The vulnerability does not require any specific user interaction beyond saving the malicious input in the targeted text field.
*   **Network Access:** The attack requires only network access to the vulnerable XWiki instance to make the HTTP requests to save the crafted input.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects versions of XWiki from at least 3.1 M1 up to the patched versions.
*   The fix involves modifying `XWikiUtils#escapeElementText` to also escape `{`, and is included in versions 13.10.9, 14.4.4, and 14.7-rc-1.
*   The vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS v3 score of 10.0, with an attack vector of "Network," low attack complexity, low privileges required, no user interaction required, a scope change, and high impacts to confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
*   The vulnerability has a CWE of 150.

This vulnerability allows an attacker with basic user privileges to inject and execute arbitrary code with programming rights by injecting a crafted payload into a text field that is not properly escaped, leading to privilege escalation and potential full system compromise.
