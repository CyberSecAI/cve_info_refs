Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-26846:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue.
- It stems from the lack of proper input sanitization when handling the `city` parameter in the `opencats/index.php?m=candidates` URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Specifically, a stored XSS vulnerability is present. This means the malicious script is stored on the server and executed when a user accesses the vulnerable part of the application.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize the user-supplied `city` parameter, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Web Script or HTML Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary web scripts or HTML in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to:
    - Stealing sensitive information, such as cookies and session tokens.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Defacing the web page.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted HTTP GET request containing the malicious payload within the `city` parameter at `opencats/index.php?m=candidates`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL** containing the payload.
- **No specific privileges** are needed to inject the malicious payload, making it accessible to a broad range of users.
- The attacker would need to get the victim to access the malicious link.

**Additional Information:**
- **Affected Versions:** OpenCATS version 0.9.7 and earlier are vulnerable.
- **Remediation:** The vulnerability is fixed in version 0.9.7.2. Users are advised to upgrade to this version or later.
- **Vendor Confirmation:** The vendor was notified on February 14, 2023, and confirmed the vulnerability on February 15, 2023. A fix was released on March 7, 2023.
- **Disclosure:** The public disclosure of the vulnerability was on April 8, 2023.
