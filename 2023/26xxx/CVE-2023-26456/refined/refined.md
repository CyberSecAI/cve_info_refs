Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2023-26456:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of the "product name" property within the OX Guard component. This allows users to set an arbitrary product name that is not properly processed before being displayed in the user interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The lack of sanitization allows for the injection of malicious script code within the "product name." This script could then be executed when the product name is displayed in the user interface, leading to a cross-site scripting vulnerability.
    *   Specifically this is an indirect XSS vulnerability, because the user defined value is stored in the database and is later displayed in the user interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Persistent Code Execution:** An attacker could potentially use this vulnerability to gain a foothold by configuring a malicious "product name" that triggers code execution. This could lead to unauthorized access and actions on the affected accounts.
*   **Account Takeover:** Temporary account takeovers could be turned into persistent compromises by injecting malicious script that is executed later.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, as a malicious actor would need to interact with the OX Guard system.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack requires user interaction in that the user interface is required to trigger the script execution.
*   **Privilege Required:** Attackers need to have low privileges to set the malicious "product name."

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker would need to be a user with the capability to set a product name for OX Guard.
*   The attacker also needs to be able to convince a user to view the malicious "product name" in the user interface, to trigger the cross-site scripting attack.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is categorized as a Medium severity with a CVSS base score of 5.4.
*   The vulnerability affects OX App Suite guard versions up to 2.10.7-rev6 and is fixed in 2.10.7-rev7.
*   There are no known public exploits.
