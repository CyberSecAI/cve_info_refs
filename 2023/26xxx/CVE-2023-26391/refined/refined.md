- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds Read.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software reads data past the end of a buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access is required and user interaction is needed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs local access to the vulnerable machine and needs to trick the user into opening a malicious file.
