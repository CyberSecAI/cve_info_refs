## Pega Security Advisory - B23 Robotics and Workforce Intelligence: Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability

* [Report](/user/login?destination=/anonymous-report-callback/idea/586656)
* [Download](/user/login?destination=/support-doc/pega-security-advisory-b23-robotics-and-workforce-intelligence-local-privilege/print)

**Urgent Action Required:Â  Pega** **Robotic Process Automation [RPA] and Workforce Intelligence Clients ONLY**

Pega continually works to implement security controls designed to protect client environments. With this focus Pega has issued remediation updates for the following security vulnerabilities, rated High on the CVSS scale.Â  We would like to thank **Skyler Knecht** and **William Martin** for finding these vulnerabilities.

| **CVE** | **Vulnerability** | **Description** | **CVSS Rating** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CVE-2023-26466 | Modifiable Configuration Files | A user with non-Admin access can change a configuration file on the client to modify the Server URL (This is the original CVE which was identified) | 7.8 |
|
|
|
| CVE-2023-26467 | Lack of Repository Authenticity Validation | A malicious server will be trusted by the client | 8.1 |
| CVE-2023-28093 | Lack of Certificate Validation | A client can start an unsigned binary as a service | 7.5 |

TheseÂ vulnerabilitiesÂ affectÂ RPAÂ and Workforce Intelligence desktop clients withÂ Pega Synchronization Engine version 3.1.1 through 3.1.27. Only desktops with Pega Synchronization Engine installed are impacted by this issue.

A bad actor with non-admin user access to a client desktop, with Pega Synchronization Engine, could modify configuration files and execute malicious code on the client desktop that could provide them with Administrative access.

We are not aware of any of our clients being compromised as a result of this vulnerability.

The remediation for this issue is to update client desktops to Pega Synchronization Engine version 3.1.30 or higher. Pega Synchronization Server can be used to complete the update.

When upgrading to Synchronization Engine version 3.1.30 or higher, you must first upgrade Pega Synchronization Sever to version 3.1.22.

Synchronization Server (3.1.22) and Synchronization Engine (3.1.30) have been released, and can be found within the Robot Runtime 22.1.8 download that is available from [My.Pega.com](https://My.Pega.com). These new versions offer additional logging and other security benefits.

Note that this software must be applied together, the new Synchronization Engine will not work without the new Synchronization Server. For best results install the Synchronization Server and use it to migrate Robot Runtime systems to Synchronization Engine 3.1.30.

We are not usingÂ RPAÂ and Workforce Intelligence features but yes while installing pega robotics studio/runtime, pega synchronization engine is getting installed.

So in case we are planning to remove this component alone from all our machines, there wont be any impact to our existing RDA automation, is this understanding correct ?

HiÂ [[@AdityaS02](/users/AdityaS02)](https://support.pega.com/users/AdityaS02),

RPA refers to all Attended and Unattended automation. RDA is an older term that is equivalent to (the newer term) Attended automation. So yes, this does apply to you.

If you are using Synchronization Server, you should upgrade both the Synchronization Server & Engine to the latest. If you are not using Synchronization Server, then you can upgrade the Synchronization Engine to the latest version OR disable the Pega. UpdaterService.exe service on the client machines. By doing this, the vulnerability will not be exposed.

If you have any further concerns please do not hesitate to raise a Support ticket to work with one of our engineers for assistance.

Thanks
