Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-26021:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a specially crafted SQL query using a `LIMIT` clause that can cause the IBM Db2 server to crash.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary weakness is the lack of proper input validation or handling when processing a SQL query with a `LIMIT` clause leading to a denial of service.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation results in a denial of service (DoS) condition, as the Db2 server crashes. This would interrupt the availability of the database and potentially other applications reliant on it.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through a specially crafted SQL query sent to the IBM DB2 server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to submit SQL queries to the Db2 server. This could be an internal user with direct access to the database interface or an external attacker that has compromised access to an application that is permitted to perform SQL queries on the server.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects all fix pack levels of IBM Db2 V11.1 and V11.5 server editions on all platforms.
- IBM Db2 V10.5 is not affected.
-  Special builds are available to address the vulnerability and are based on the most recent fixpack level for each impacted release: V11.1.4 FP7, V11.5.7, and V11.5.8
