The provided content relates to CVE-2023-26266.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `cmplog` component of AFL++ incorrectly searches for the target application in the current working directory (PWD) instead of using the PATH environment variable when an unprefixed target name is provided (e.g., `-- targetapp`).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect path resolution for target applications within `cmplog`.
- Reliance on the current working directory (PWD) instead of PATH for locating executables.
- The possibility of a malicious actor placing a crafted executable in the user's working directory with the same name as the intended target, leading to the execution of the malicious executable instead.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Potential execution of malicious code if a user inadvertently runs AFL++ from a directory containing a malicious executable named the same as the intended target. This could lead to arbitrary code execution.
- Confusing error messages when the target application is not found in the current working directory.

**Attack vectors:**
- Placing a malicious executable in a directory where the user intends to run AFL++ using an unprefixed target name.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to write a file to a directory that the victim might use as their working directory when running `afl-fuzz`.
- The attacker needs to be able to name this file with the same name as the target binary the victim is intending to fuzz with AFL++.
