- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `sketchsvg` package is vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Injection because it uses `shell.exec` without sanitizing or parameterizing the command string. It concatenates the current directory as part of the command, making it vulnerable to malicious directory names.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Arbitrary Code Injection (CWE-94), lack of input sanitization, use of `shell.exec` with unsanitized input.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can execute arbitrary code on the system running `sketchsvg`. This can lead to a complete loss of confidentiality and integrity, as well as a reduction in availability.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local and requires read/write/execute capabilities. An attacker can craft a malicious directory name that contains shell commands which will be executed when `sketchsvg` processes it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have the ability to create directories and execute the `sketchsvg` command. No prior access to the system is required. They need to be able to place files in the current working directory.
