**IMPORTANT NOTICE**: DO NOT REPORT VULNERABILITIES SOLELY TO THE AUTHOR OR MARKETPLACE.

We urge you to report any vulnerabilities directly to us. Our mission is to ensure the safety and security of the PrestaShop ecosystem. Unfortunately, many module developers may not always recognize or acknowledge the vulnerabilities in their code, whether due to lack of awareness, or inability to properly evaluate the associated risk, or other reasons.

Given the rise in professional cybercrime networks actively seeking out these vulnerabilities, it's crucial that any potential threats are promptly addressed and the community is informed. The most effective method to do this is by publishing a CVE, like the one provided below.

Should you discover any vulnerabilities, **please report them to us at: report[@]security-presta.org** or visit [https://security-presta.org](https://security-presta.org/) for more information.

Every vulnerability report helps make the community more secure, and we are profoundly grateful for any information shared with us.

In the module “Save your carts and buy later” (lgbudget) for PrestaShop, an authenticated user can perform a blind SQL injection up to 1.0.3. Release 1.0.4 fixed this security issue.

## Summary

* **CVE ID**: [CVE-2023-26860](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-26860)
* **Published at**: 2023-04-04
* **Advisory source**: Friends-Of-Presta.org
* **Platform**: PrestaShop
* **Product**: lgbudget
* **Impacted release**: < 1.0.4
* **Product author**: Línea Gráfica
* **Weakness**: [CWE-89](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html)
* **Severity**: critical (9.8)

## Description

Up to 1.0.3, a sensitive SQL call in class `LgBudgetBudgetModuleFrontController::displayAjaxGenerateBudget()` can be exploited with a trivial http call to forge a blind SQL injection through the POST or GET submitted “name” variable.

## CVSS base metrics

* **Attack vector**: network
* **Attack complexity**: low
* **Privilege required**: none
* **User interaction**: none
* **Scope**: unchanged
* **Confidentiality**: high
* **Integrity**: high
* **Availability**: high

**Vector string**: [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

## Possible malicious usage

* Technical and personal data leaks
* Obtain admin access
* Remove all data of the linked PrestaShop
* Display sensitives tables to front-office to unlock potential admin’s ajax scripts of modules protected by token on the ecosystem

## Proof of concept

```
curl -v --cookie-jar cookie.txt -X POST -d 'token=<predictable_token>&id_product=123&qty=1&add=1&action=update' 'https://domain.tld/cart'
&& curl -v --cookie cookie.txt 'https://domain.tld/module/lgbudget/budget?ajax=1&action=generateBudget&name=test%22,%20%222022-01-01%22%20%29%3BSELECT%20SLEEP%2825%29%3B--'

```
## Patch

To fix this issue, in file controllers/front/budget.php line 42, you need to escape $name in `LgBudgetBudgetModuleFrontController::displayAjaxGenerateBudget()`.

```
## Other recommendations

* It’s recommended to upgrade the module beyond 1.0.3. Release 1.0.4 fixed this security issue.
* To help improve the security of your PrestaShop installation, we recommend upgrading to the latest version. One of the benefits of upgrading is that it will disable the use of multiquery executions (separated by semicolons). However, please be aware that this **will not protect** your shop against SQL injection attacks that use the UNION clause to steal data. Additionally, it’s important to note that PrestaShop includes a function called pSQL, which includes a strip\_tags function. This helps protect your shop against [Stored XSS (also known as XSS T2) of Category 1](https://security.friendsofpresta.org/modules/2023/02/07/stored-xss.html). If a pSQL function is missing, it could potentially expose your project to critical Stored XSS vulnerabilities due to edge cases. Therefore, it’s crucial to ensure that all relevant functions are properly implemented and used consistently throughout your project.
* Change the default database prefix ps\_ by a new longer arbitrary prefix. Nevertheless, be warned that this is useless against blackhats with DBA senior skill because of a design vulnerability in DBMS
* Activate OWASP 942’s rules on your WAF (Web application firewall), be warned that you will probably break your backoffice and you will need to pre-configure some bypasses against these set of rules.
