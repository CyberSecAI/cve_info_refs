Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper neutralization of SQL parameter in the `lgbudget` module for PrestaShop. Specifically, the `name` variable in the `LgBudgetBudgetModuleFrontController::displayAjaxGenerateBudget()` function is not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Blind SQL Injection (CWE-89)
*   **Impact of exploitation**:
    *   Technical and personal data leaks
    *   Potential to gain admin access
    *   Removal of all data of the linked PrestaShop
    *   Display sensitive tables to the front office, potentially revealing admin ajax scripts protected by tokens.
*   **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack via HTTP GET or POST requests
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No special privileges or user interaction is required. An attacker can send a crafted HTTP request to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in versions of the `lgbudget` module prior to 1.0.4.
*   The vulnerable code is in the `controllers/front/budget.php` file, specifically within the `displayAjaxGenerateBudget()` function.
*   The fix involves using the `pSQL()` function to properly escape the `$name` variable before it's used in the SQL query.
*   The provided proof-of-concept demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability using `curl` to perform a blind SQL injection.
* The advisory also provides recommendations to help improve overall PrestaShop security like upgrading to the latest version and using a Web Application Firewall (WAF).
