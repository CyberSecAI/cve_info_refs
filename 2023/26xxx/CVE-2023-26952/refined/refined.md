Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization when adding menu items in the `onekeyadmin` application. Specifically, the `title` field of a menu item is not properly sanitized before being stored and later rendered on the page.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application stores the unsanitized input in its database or storage mechanism. When the application renders the stored data on a page viewed by a user, the malicious script is executed in the user's browser.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the menu title. When a user visits a page displaying the menu, this injected JavaScript code will execute within the user's browser.
    *   **Account Hijacking/Data Theft:** The attacker could use this XSS vulnerability to steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information from the user's browser, leading to potential account compromise or data breaches.
    *   **Malicious Redirects/Page Manipulation:** The attacker can use the injected script to redirect users to malicious websites, modify the page's content, or perform other unauthorized actions within the application's context.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a malicious POST request to the `/admin1/adminMenu/save` endpoint, injecting the XSS payload within the `title` parameter in a JSON payload.
    *   **Admin Panel:**  The vulnerability exists within the admin panel of the `onekeyadmin` application, likely requiring an authenticated user with privileges to modify the menu settings.
    *   **Viewing the Menu:** The XSS payload is triggered when a user visits the `/admin1#adminMenu/index` URL (or any page that renders this stored menu data).

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Access to Admin Panel:** The attacker must have access to the admin panel and possess the necessary permissions to modify menu settings.
    *   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker must be capable of crafting and sending HTTP POST requests to the specified endpoint.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Affected Product:** `onekeyadmin`
