Attackers can successfully request arbitrary snippet IDs, including E-Mail signatures of other users within the same context. Signatures of other users could be read even though they are not explicitly shared. We improved permission handling when requesting snippets that are not explicitly shared with other users. No publicly available exploits are known.
