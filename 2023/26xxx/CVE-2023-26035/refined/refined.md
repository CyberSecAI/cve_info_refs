{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a lack of permission checks in `web/includes/actions/snapshot.php`. Specifically, the code expects a monitor ID to fetch an existing monitor. However, it's possible to provide an object that creates a new monitor instead. This new monitor is then passed to the `TriggerOn` function which then calls `shell_exec` using the supplied monitor ID. The `shell_exec` allows for command injection via the passed in monitor ID.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of permission checks on snapshot action",
      "Insecure object handling allowing arbitrary object creation.",
      "Unsanitized input passed to `shell_exec` leading to command injection"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server, potentially leading to a full compromise.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is network-based, exploiting the vulnerable `snapshot.php` endpoint through HTTP requests.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker requires no privileges or user interaction to exploit this vulnerability. They only need to send a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable endpoint."
