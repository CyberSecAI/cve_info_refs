Business recommendation:
------------------------
The vendor provides a patch which should be installed immediately.

SEC Consult highly recommends to perform a thorough security review of the product
conducted by security professionals to identify and resolve potential further
security issues.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Authenticated OS Command Injection (CVE-2023-26213)
Barracuda CloudGen WAN provides a private edge appliance for hybrid deployments.

An authenticated user in the administration interface for the private edge
virtual appliance can inject arbitrary OS commands via the
/ajax/update_certificate endpoint.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Authenticated OS Command Injection (CVE-2023-26213)
The affected PHP application running on the appliance implements a custom
wrapper for securely executing OS commands. The wrapper is inspired by SQL
prepared statements and uses placeholders.

Unfortunately an attacker can inject new placeholder strings within arguments.
In the case where two or more arguments are controlled by the user, this allows
an attacker to craft a placeholder which executes arbitrary commands.

Example of a vulnerable call:
```php
             // Extract the cert with the password
             $extract_cert_status = BN_Shell::exec(
                 "openssl pkcs12 -in :tmp_cert -out :dst -clcerts -nokeys -passin pass::password",
                 array(
                     'tmp_cert' => $cert_folder . $name . '.base64',
                     'dst' => $cert_folder . $name,
                     'password' => $password
                 )
             );
```

Excerpt from BN_Shell::exec():
```php
        // Execute a full command.
        // If you need to escape arguments, replace them with bind params, similar to sql binds.
        // Example: exec('ls /tmp/')
        // Example: exec('cp :source :dest', array('source' => '/src/dir/', 'dest' => '/dest/dir'))
        public static function exec($command, array $params = array()) {
                // escape and replace binds with values
                foreach($params as $param => $value) {
                        $value = static::escape($value); // --- SEC Consult: this internally calls escapeshellargs() on
the argument
                        $command = str_replace(":$param", $value, $command);
                }
                static::$_last_command = $command;

                $return = array();

                // use proc_open to get stdout and stderr
                $descriptorspec = array(
                        0 => array("pipe", "r"), // stdin is a pipe that the child will read from
                        1 => array("pipe", "w"), // stdout is a pipe that the child will write to
                        2 => array("pipe", "w")  // stderr is a file to write to
                );
```

The following HTTP request exploits the issue.

The "name" argument contains the placeholder string ":password". At runtime,
this is replaced by the argument "password", which in this case executes a
reverse shell.

## Vulnerability overview/description

### 1) Authenticated OS Command Injection (CVE-2023-26213)

Barracuda CloudGen WAN provides a private edge appliance for hybrid deployments. An authenticated user in the administration interface for the private edge virtual appliance can inject arbitrary OS commands via the

```

/ajax/update_certificate
```

endpoint.

**WHAT IT DOES**

### SASE at a glance.

IT professionals need a solution that combines network protection functions with WAN capabilities and supports the dynamic secure access needs of organizations. SASE is an integrated service that provides comprehensive secure access for modern computing environments, reduces complexity and costs by consolidating technology stacks, lowers operational overhead, and speeds up new technology adoption. According to Gartner, security and risk management leaders should build a migration plan from legacy perimeter and hardware-based offerings to a SASE model.1 With SASE, enterprises save management time, ensure business continuity, improve performance for latency-sensitive apps, and simplify the access experience for users by removing operational friction.

1 Gartner “2021 Strategic Roadmap for SASE Convergence” by Neil MacDonald, Nat Smith, Lawrence Orans, Joe Skorupa, Published 25 March 2021.

**GO FOR A CLOUD-FIRST SASE SOLUTION**

### Benefit from the industry’s most flexible SASE platform.

Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) is the future of networks, but what is the best fit for your network infrastructure? Today, most organizations are leveraging a hybrid approach with applications hosted anywhere – in datacenters, on-site, in the public cloud, and consumed as software-as-a-service. Other SASE providers require sending all application traffic via their own cloud services. But many IT professionals would rather consider a SASE solution with the ability to adapt to the company's specific requirements. Barracuda takes this into account and offers solutions ranging from on-premises deployments to SaaS offerings.

![SecureEdge-benefit-section-illus3](/products/network-protection/secureedge/_jcr_content/root/container/container/text_image_copy_517622404/image.coreimg.svg/1732227448682/secureedge-benefit-section-illus3.svg)

**SECURE YOUR CLOUD NETWORK**

### Don’t give cybercriminals a chance.

In today’s rapidly evolving threat landscape, protecting your network infrastructure is key. Cybercriminals are getting increasingly sophisticated. New malware strains like ransomware are designed to evade traditional detection techniques and are often propagated through targeted zero-hour attacks. These advanced attack methods can cause severe damage to affected organizations, in terms of both financial loss and reputation. Barracuda SecureEdge is a cloud-native Firewall-as-a-Service with tightly integrated next-generation technologies, including application profiling, intrusion prevention, advanced threat and malware protection, antispam, and full-fledged network access control. Cloud-based web security and Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) are integral components of Barracuda SecureEdge.

![SecureEdge-benefit-section-illus4](/products/network-protection/secureedge/_jcr_content/root/container/container/text_image_copy_copy/image.coreimg.svg/1732227448724/secureedge-benefit-section-illus4.svg)

**KEEP USERS CONNECTED AND PRODUCTIVE**

### Boost application performance and reduce costs.

As your workloads move to the cloud and SaaS applications, it is critical to ensure reliable, fast, and secure connectivity for all your sites and remote users. Gone are the days when you could backhaul SaaS and internet-bound traffic to a central location. These days you need a faster, more agile network architecture to handle increased traffic from cloud apps, distributed sites, and off-network users. Barracuda SecureEdge uses application steering to automatically choose the most suitable physical path and makes dynamic, on-the-fly adjustments to QoS and application usage policies depending on real-time bandwidth and latency measurements, ensuring that users get the performance they need to be productive. Because it brings together Secure SD-WAN and next-generation security, Barracuda SecureEdge is more than just another SD-WAN product.

![SecureEdge-benefit-section-illus5](/products/network-protection/secureedge/_jcr_content/root/container/container/text_image_copy_5176/image.coreimg.svg/1732227448767/secureedge-benefit-section-illus5.svg)

**SIMPLIFY AND SECURE YOUR NETWORK ACCESS**

### Establish the Zero Trust model for secure access.

Remote work is here to stay, cloud migrations are accelerating, and secure access is critical. Enterprises need Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) to verify every access attempt to data and resources. Secure your team’s devices and reduce your attack surface by allowing only the right user to access the right corporate resources. Reduce breach risk while improving remote access performance and employee productivity. Barracuda SecureEdge grants least-privileged access to authorized apps without exposing your private network and helps enforce granular policy controls. Gain valuable insights and full visibility into your enterprise resource access flows to mitigate security and compliance risks.

### Which challenges do you need to address?

Future-proof your network with Barracuda’s cloud-based SASE offering that provides multi‑layered next-generation security, comprehensive Secure SD-WAN capabilities, easy to use Zero Trust Access, and web security.
