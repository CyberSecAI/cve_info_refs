The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in Sme.UP ERP, including CVE-2023-26758.

**CVE-2023-26758**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Path Traversal vulnerability in the `/ResourceService` component.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when requesting files, allowing the use of `../` or `..\` sequences to access files outside the web root.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker can read arbitrary files on the server, potentially including source code and sensitive configuration files.
*   **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/ResourceService` endpoint, manipulating the `customer` parameter with path traversal sequences.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need any authentication to exploit this vulnerability and needs network access to the application.
