{
  "CVE-2023-26098": {
    "root_cause": "The application's \"Open Document\" feature uses the `Process.Start` function, which allows execution of arbitrary code if an executable file is uploaded and then opened.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unrestricted file upload",
      "Improper use of `Process.Start`",
	  "Lack of server-side validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution on the local system where the application is installed.",
    "attack_vectors": "A local attacker with access to the application can upload a malicious executable file and then open it using the \"Open Document\" feature.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have local access to the vulnerable application and be able to upload files."

 "CVE-2022-45167":{
    "root_cause": "A service exposed by the application allows a basic user to access the profile information of all connected users.",
    "weaknesses": [
        "Information Exposure",
		"Insufficient access control"
