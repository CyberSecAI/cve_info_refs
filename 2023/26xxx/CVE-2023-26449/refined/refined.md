Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-26449:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The "OX Chat" web service in the frontend did not specify a media-type when processing responses from external resources. This allowed a user-defined content-type to be returned, which could be exploited to inject script code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation - Cross-site Scripting):** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization or encoding of the content-type returned by the Chat service. This allows the injection of arbitrary script code into the web page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Malicious script code can be executed within the victim's browser context.
*   This can lead to:
    *   Session hijacking.
    *   Triggering unwanted actions via the web interface and API.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is **network-based**.
*   An attacker would need to manipulate the content-type returned by the external resource accessed by the OX Chat service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs temporary access to a user's account. Alternatively, they can lure a user to a compromised account.
*  The attacker also needs to have the ability to control the external resource that the OX Chat service uses.
*   The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the content type of the response.
    
**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered on 2023-03-20 and fixed on 2023-04-19.
*   The fix involves defining the accepted media-type to avoid code execution.
*   The affected versions are OX App Suite frontend 7.10.6-rev27, and the fix is in 7.10.6-rev28.
*   The CVSS score is 5.4 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N), indicating a medium severity vulnerability.
*   No publicly available exploits are known.
