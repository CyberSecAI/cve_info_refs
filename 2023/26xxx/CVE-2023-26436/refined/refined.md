Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2023-26436:

**Root Cause:** Insecure deserialization of Java objects within the `documentconverterws` API.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   The `documentconverterws` API did not properly validate serialized Java objects during deserialization. This allowed the injection of arbitrary serialized Java objects.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Remote code execution on the server. An attacker could inject malicious code that would be executed when the server processes the request.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Network access to the `documentconverterws` API is required. The API endpoint is typically restricted to local networks by default, requiring an attacker to be on the same network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   Attacker needs network access to the `documentconverterws` API.
*   Attacker needs to be able to send a specially crafted serialized Java object to the API.

**Additional details:**
*   The vulnerability is present in OX App Suite office versions up to 7.10.6-rev7 and is fixed in 7.10.6-rev8.
*   A check was introduced to restrict the processing of legal and expected classes for the API, and a warning is now logged for attempts to inject illegal classes.
*   The vulnerability is classified as a code injection vulnerability (CWE-94).
*   The CVSS score is 8.3, indicating a high severity.
