Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from broken access controls in the Ghost CMS. Specifically, the API endpoints for retrieving posts (`/ghost/api/admin/posts/`) and pages (`/ghost/api/admin/pages/`) do not properly restrict access based on user roles.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Broken Access Control:** A user with "Contributor" privileges can access and view draft or private posts and pages which should be restricted to higher-level users or not accessible at all to contributors.
*   **Insecure API endpoints:** The `/ghost/api/admin/posts/` and `/ghost/api/admin/pages/` endpoints are not enforcing proper authorization for users with different roles.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** A user with low-level ("Contributor") privileges can view unpublished content (drafts, private posts, hidden pages) that they are not meant to see. This could lead to premature disclosure of sensitive information or content intended to remain private, causing potential damage.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **API Request:** An attacker, or a malicious contributor user, makes an HTTP GET request to the vulnerable API endpoints `/ghost/api/admin/posts/` or `/ghost/api/admin/pages/` using their valid contributor session cookie.
*  **Specific Post/Page Request**: An attacker can also request a specific post or page by adding the post or page ID, such as `/ghost/api/admin/posts/[:postId]` or `/ghost/api/admin/pages/[:pageId]`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have a user account with the "Contributor" role within the Ghost CMS.
*   The attacker needs network access to the Ghost CMS.
*   The attacker needs to know the API endpoints to make the requests.
* The attacker requires a valid session cookie of an authorized contributor account.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is reported to be present in Ghost version 5.35.0 but also seems to affect version 5.25, based on the `X-Ghost-Version` header in the PoC requests.
* The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) includes the specific HTTP requests used to exploit the vulnerability.

This vulnerability is more specific than the general description of Broken Access Controls.
