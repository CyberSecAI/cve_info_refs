## Description

A stored Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in ChurchCRM 4.5.3 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the OptionManager.php endpoint.

## Proof of Concept

1. Navigate to the `/churchcrm/OptionManager.php?mode=classes` endpoint. Then input something inside the `Name for New Classification` field. Once done, enable a proxy, such as Burp Suite, and click on `Add New Person Classification`.

2. Now, in the intercepted request, put `" onfocus=alert(document.cookie) autofocus="` and send the request.

3. Going back to the browser, we can see the Javascript was successfully executed.
