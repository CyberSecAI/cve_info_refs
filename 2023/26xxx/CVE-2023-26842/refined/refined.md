- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input when adding a new person classification, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the "Name for New Classification" field, leading to stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the "Name for New Classification" field via the `/churchcrm/OptionManager.php?mode=classes` endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have an account with the ability to add person classifications. They must also intercept the request using a proxy to insert the malicious payload.
