## FAQs

Is it ready to download and run now with all the features?
Yes! Some features will require customisation after installation - for example full-text resume search and ACL role setup can be amended after the fact, but the initial installation delivers the base functionality.
When will the new version be available?
Continuous development occurs on the project, and we will snapshot releases when it improves stability or adds new features.
What operating systems will be supported?
All current Linux distributions will continue to be supported, as are current WAMP/XAMP installations.
How are new Vulnerabilities tracked and closed?
Vulnerability announcements are made in the news section, however increased code scanning has resulted in more vulnerability detections in recent months, which have been closed through code updates.
