Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a combination of insufficient restrictions on file uploads and the ability to modify these restrictions via the application's configuration. Specifically, the `app\admin\controller\File#upload` method has some restrictions on file extensions, but these restrictions can be bypassed by modifying the upload configuration through the `app\admin\controller\Config#update` method.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The core vulnerability is the ability to upload arbitrary files, including executable ones (e.g., PHP), by manipulating configuration settings.
    *   **Insecure Configuration Management:** The configuration update mechanism (`app\admin\controller\Config#update`) allows modifying upload file extension restrictions, creating a pathway for malicious uploads.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows for Remote Code Execution (RCE). An attacker can upload and execute malicious files (e.g., PHP webshell), gaining control over the server and potentially the entire system.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through HTTP requests to the following endpoints:
    1.  `POST /admin1/config/update`: This endpoint is used to modify the file upload extension restrictions. An attacker sends a crafted JSON payload to this endpoint to allow the upload of malicious file types (e.g. `.php`).
    2.  `POST /admin1/file/upload`: After modifying the configuration, this endpoint is used to upload a malicious file.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have administrator access to the application to be able to modify the configuration.
    *   The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the application.
    *   No other specific capabilities seem to be required other than basic web interaction knowledge.
