CRLF Injection in drogon@v1.8.4

 [Raw](/dellalibera/d2abd809f32ec6c61be1f41d80edf61b/raw/50a8acfa23e8b16867352199a924ca4c839ec084/01_CRLF_Injection_drogon%40v1.8.4.md)

[**01\_CRLF\_Injection\_drogon@v1.8.4.md**](#file-01_crlf_injection_drogon-v1-8-4-md)

# Information

**Project:** `drogon`

**Tested Version:** `v1.8.4`

**Github Repository:** [`https://github.com/drogonframework/drogon`](https://github.com/drogonframework/drogon)

## Details

`drogon` is vulnerable to **CRLF Injection** when untrusted user input is used to set request headers in the `addHeader` function. An attacker can add the `\r\n` (carriage return line feeds) characters and inject additional headers in the request sent.

More reference about this vulnerability and its impact:

* <https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/CRLF_Injection>
* <https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/113.html>

Reference to similar issues affecting other projects:

* <https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-SWIFT-SWIFTSERVERASYNCHTTPCLIENT-3237994>
* <https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-UNDICI-2980276>

## Setup

* install dependencies (tested on Ubuntu): <https://github.com/drogonframework/drogon/wiki/ENG-02-Installation#system-preparation-examples>
* install the project: <https://github.com/drogonframework/drogon/wiki/ENG-02-Installation#drogon-installation>

## PoC

The PoC demonstrates how it's possible to add arbitrary headers and perform `2` requests in a single API call.

* create a web server to log incoming requests:

```
drogon_ctl --version
A utility for drogon
Version: 1.8.4
Git commit: 87a3132fd1c0da1a88e080c879a9e55af71586be

drogon_ctl create project server
```

* paste the server code in `main.cc`
* build and run the server

```
cd build
cmake ..
make
./server
```

* create a client that sends requests with headers contains CRLF characters

```
drogon_ctl create project client
```

* paste the client code in `main.cc` (inspired by <https://github.com/drogonframework/drogon/blob/master/examples/client_example/main.cc>)
* build and run the client

```
cd build
cmake ..
make
./client
```

Server Logs:

```
test1 request received
HEADERS
evil=hello1
myheader=A
connection=Keep-Alive
host=localhost:8081
user-agent=DrogonClient

test2 request received
HEADERS
evil=hello2
```

## Impact

If untrusted user input is placed in header values, a malicious user could inject additional headers. It can lead to logical errors and other misbehaviours.

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

5.4 medium

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited. For example, a successful exploit may only be possible during the installation of an application by a system administrator.

  **Required**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Integrity (I)

  Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Availability (A)

  There is no impact to availability within the impacted component.

  **None**
