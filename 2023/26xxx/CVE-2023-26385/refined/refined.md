- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds Read
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software reads data past the end of a buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Memory leak. The vulnerability allows for unauthorized access to sensitive memory locations.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, requiring user interaction.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to convince a user to open a malicious file, which would trigger the vulnerability in the software.
