- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Out-of-bounds Write (CWE-787)
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write, which can occur when the program writes data beyond the allocated memory buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local (AV:L), requiring low attack complexity (AC:L), no privileges (PR:N) and user interaction (UI:R).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trigger the vulnerability by having the user open a malicious file or perform a specific action within the application.
