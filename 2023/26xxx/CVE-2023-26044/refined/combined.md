# ReactPHP's HTTP server continues parsing unused multipart parts after reaching limits

Moderate

[clue](/clue)
published
GHSA-95x4-j7vc-h8mf
May 17, 2023

## Package

composer

react/http
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

>= 0.8.0, < 1.9.0

## Patched versions

1.9.0

## Description

### Summary

Previous versions of ReactPHP's HTTP server component contain a potential DoS vulnerability that can cause high CPU load when processing large HTTP request bodies. This vulnerability has little to no impact on the default configuration, but can be exploited when explicitly using the `RequestBodyBufferMiddleware` with very large settings. This might lead to consuming large amounts of CPU time for processing requests and significantly delay or slow down the processing of legitimate user requests.

### Patches

The supplied patch resolves this vulnerability for ReactPHP.

### Workarounds

* Keeping the request body limit using `RequestBodyBufferMiddleware` sensible will mitigate it.
* Infrastructure or DevOps can place a reverse proxy in front of the ReactPHP HTTP server to filter out any excessive HTTP request bodies.

### References

A similar vulnerability was discovered in PHP recently, see also [PHP's security advisory](https://github.com/php/php-src/security/advisories/GHSA-54hq-v5wp-fqgv) (CVE-2023-0662). The fix is based on the [PHP-FPM fix](https://github.com/php/php-src/commit/716de0cff539f46294ef70fe75d548cd66766370#diff-81d659aa9e83177ac08151f99cebf21ab331d22462c72a1039f59947e66f5a35).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L

### CVE ID
