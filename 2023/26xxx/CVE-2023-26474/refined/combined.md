# Privilege escalation via properties with wiki syntax that are executed with the wrong author

Critical

[tmortagne](/tmortagne)
published
GHSA-3738-p9x3-mv9r
Mar 1, 2023

## Package

maven

org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-oldcore, org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-legacy-oldcore
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

>= 13.10

## Patched versions

13.10.11, 14.4.7, 14.10

## Description

### Impact

It's possible to use the right of an existing document content author to execute a text area property.

To reproduce:

* As an admin with programming rights, create a new user without script or programming right.
* Login with the freshly created user.
* Insert the following text in source mode in the about section:

```
    {{groovy}}println("hello from groovy!"){{/groovy}}

```

* Click "Save & View"

### Patches

This has been patched in XWiki 14.10, 14.4.7, and 13.10.11.

### Workarounds

No known workaround.

### References

<https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-20373>

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

#### Description

**Steps to reproduce:**

1. As an admin with programming rights, create a new user without script or programming right.
2. Login with the freshly created user.
3. Insert the following text in source mode in the about section:
   ```
   {{groovy}}println("hello from groovy!"){{/groovy}}
   ```
4. Click "Save & View"

**Expected result:**

An error is displayed in the about section that the script macro couldn't be executed.

**Actual result:**

The text "hello from groovy!" is displayed.

This works with any TextAreaClass property that has wiki syntax enabled and is displayed using the regular displayer, e.g., using $doc.display in a document where the content author is a user with programming right. The reason seems to be that `TextAreaClass` overrides the security document which is explicitly set by $doc.display to ensure that not the content author but the displayed object's author is used.
