- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds read
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software reads data past the end of a buffer. This is a classic out-of-bounds read vulnerability (CWE-125).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation leads to a memory leak.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, and the user needs to be tricked into opening a malicious file or performing a malicious operation that triggers the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have the user execute a malicious operation that triggers the out-of-bounds read.
