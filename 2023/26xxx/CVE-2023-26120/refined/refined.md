- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user inputs, allowing for HTML injection. Specifically, the `/xxl-job-admin/user/add` and `/xxl-job-admin/user/update` endpoints are vulnerable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization. Specifically, HTML injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious HTML/JavaScript code, which can be executed by the user's browser. This could lead to session hijacking, stealing cookies, accessing sensitive information, gaining access to privileged services, and/or delivering malware.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker can inject malicious HTML payloads through the `/xxl-job-admin/user/add` and `/xxl-job-admin/user/update` endpoints. This is a stored XSS vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need any specific privileges to perform the attack, however some user interaction is required. The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted request to the vulnerable endpoints.
