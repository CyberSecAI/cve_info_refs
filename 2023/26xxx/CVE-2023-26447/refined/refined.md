Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in **CVE-2023-26447**:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input sanitization in the "upsell" widget of the OX App Suite portal. Specifically, the product description, which is taken from a user-controllable jslob, is not escaped before being added to the Document Object Model (DOM).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core weakness is a persistent XSS vulnerability due to the lack of input sanitization, classified as CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Malicious Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary script code within the victim's browser context.
- **Session Hijacking:** This can lead to session hijacking, potentially granting the attacker unauthorized access to the victim's account.
- **Unwanted Actions:** Attackers could trigger unwanted actions via the web interface and API, leading to unauthorized changes or data manipulation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited over the network.
- **User-Controlled Input:** The attack vector involves user-controllable jslob settings within the "upsell" portal widget that allows for the injection of malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to a User Account:** An attacker requires temporary access to a user account or needs to lure a user to a compromised account to modify the vulnerable jslob settings.
- **Low Privileges:** The attacker requires low privileges, as the vulnerability is triggered through the portal widget settings accessible by standard users.
- **User Interaction:** The user must interact with the compromised page or application to trigger the malicious script.
