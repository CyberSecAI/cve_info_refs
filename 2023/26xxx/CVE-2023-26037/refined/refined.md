- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper validation of the `minTime` and `maxTime` request parameters in the `report_event_audit` function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection vulnerability due to lack of proper input sanitization of the `minTime` and `maxTime` parameters.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or complete system compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited by crafting malicious `minTime` and `maxTime` parameters in HTTP requests to the affected `report_event_audit` function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the ZoneMinder instance. No specific privileges are mentioned.
