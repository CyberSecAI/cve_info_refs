  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The consultation permission allows the users to view, add, modify, and delete data instead of just viewing it.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper access control, insufficient permission restrictions",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Users with 'consultation' permission can modify or delete data, leading to unauthorized data manipulation.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local access to the application",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have 'consultation' privileges within the APSAL application."
