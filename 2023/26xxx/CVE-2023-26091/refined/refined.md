Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2023-26091:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The "Forms Export" (frp_form_answers) TYPO3 extension fails to properly encode user input when saving form submissions, specifically in the context of emails intended for HTML output.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core weakness is a persistent XSS vulnerability. User-supplied data isn't sanitized or encoded correctly, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts that get stored and then executed in the context of other users' browsers when they view the exported data (e.g., within an email).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Malicious Script Execution:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code.
*   **Data Theft:** Exploitation could lead to the theft of sensitive information, like session cookies, or other data handled by the web application.
*   **Account Takeover:** In some scenarios, XSS vulnerabilities could be leveraged to perform actions on behalf of an unsuspecting user, potentially leading to complete account compromise or more broad system compromise.
*   **Defacement:** Attackers can also modify content or redirect users to phishing sites.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Form Input:**  The primary attack vector involves submitting malicious script within a form field via the vulnerable TYPO3 extension.
*   **Stored XSS:** The injected script is stored, meaning that it will be delivered every time the affected data is viewed or processed in HTML context.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Website Access:** Attackers need to be able to submit form data to a website running the vulnerable TYPO3 extension. They don't need to be authenticated, as the attack works through user-provided input.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Extension:** They must know which fields are vulnerable.

**Additional Notes:**

*   **Affected Versions:**  The vulnerability affects "Forms Export" extension versions 3.1.1 and below, as well as versions 4.0.0 - 4.0.1.
*   **Severity:** The vulnerability is rated as high severity.
*   **Solution:** The vulnerability is resolved in versions 3.1.2 and 4.0.2 of the extension. Users should update immediately.
