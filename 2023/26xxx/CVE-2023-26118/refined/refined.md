Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the use of an insecure regular expression within the `input[url]` functionality of the `angular` package. Specifically, the regular expression used to validate URLs in the `<input type="url">` element is susceptible to catastrophic backtracking.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS):** The core weakness is that a specially crafted input string can cause the regular expression engine to enter a state of excessive backtracking, consuming significant CPU resources and leading to a denial of service.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By providing a malicious input to the `<input type="url">` element, an attacker can force the application to consume excessive CPU time, potentially making the service unavailable to legitimate users. This is due to the regex engine getting stuck in catastrophic backtracking when processing invalid URL inputs.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Input Manipulation:** The primary attack vector is through the manipulation of the `<input type="url">` element. An attacker can inject a malicious URL string, designed to trigger the catastrophic backtracking within the regex engine used by the Angular framework.
- **Network:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable. Attackers can exploit the vulnerability over the network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **No special access needed:** The attacker does not need any prior access to the system and can exploit the vulnerability without any user interaction.
- **Ability to submit crafted input:** The attacker needs to be able to provide input to the vulnerable `<input type="url">` element. This could be via a web form or any method that allows user-provided input.
- **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests over the network.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by providing a URL with a large number of slashes after the scheme (e.g. `http://///...////`).
- The provided example regex `/A(B|C+)+D/` helps illustrate how catastrophic backtracking can occur.  It highlights how multiple ways of matching the same characters can cause the regex engine to take an exponentially increasing number of steps to determine if a string matches.
- There is no fixed version for this vulnerability at the time this information was published.

**Affected packages:**
- `angular` npm package versions >=1.4.9
- `org.webjars.bowergithub.angular:angular` maven package versions [0,]
- `org.webjars.npm:angular` maven package versions [1.4.9,]
- `org.webjars.bower:angular` maven package versions [1.4.9,]

**CVSS Score:**
- 5.3 Medium, with attack vector being network, low attack complexity, no privileges required, no user interaction, and low availability impact.
