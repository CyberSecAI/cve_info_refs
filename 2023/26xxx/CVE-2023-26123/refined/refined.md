Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The `SetClipboardText` function in `rcore.c`, when compiled for `PLATFORM_WEB`, uses `emscripten_run_script` to execute JavaScript in the browser.
- This function does not properly sanitize the input text before embedding it in a JavaScript string, specifically the single quote character (`'`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Cross-site Scripting (XSS):** The lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code by crafting a malicious string that breaks out of the intended string context in the `emscripten_run_script` call.
- The vulnerable code snippet is: `emscripten_run_script(TextFormat("navigator.clipboard.writeText('%s')", text));`

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the web application using the `SetClipboardText` API.
- This can lead to a variety of malicious activities such as:
    - Stealing cookies and session hijacking.
    - Accessing sensitive information.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Delivering malware.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker needs to control the `text` parameter passed to the `SetClipboardText` function when the code is compiled for web (`PLATFORM_WEB`).
- The attacker injects a payload with a single quote character, along with malicious javascript to execute, such as `');alert('fizz');//`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a way to control or influence the clipboard content passed to the `SetClipboardText` API, such as via user input.
- The attacker must target a web application that is using a vulnerable version of the raylib library compiled for the web platform.
- The vulnerability is specific to the `PLATFORM_WEB` environment. Other platforms are not affected.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix implemented by the developers is to check for the existence of a single quote within the clipboard input, and throw a warning. This solution does not remove or escape the single quote character, but is designed to block execution of user-supplied javascript.
- The vulnerability was reported by "spaceraccoon" and fixed by "raysan5".
- The vulnerability is present in versions of the `raysan5/raylib` package prior to `4.5.0`.
- The issue was tracked under GitHub issue #2954.
