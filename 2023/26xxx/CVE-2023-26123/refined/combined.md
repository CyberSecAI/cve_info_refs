[![raylib_release_promo_450](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5766837/226331474-61ebe2b2-dbe4-46e7-8ab5-7ffb4a6d5fae.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5766837/226331474-61ebe2b2-dbe4-46e7-8ab5-7ffb4a6d5fae.png)

It's been **7 months** since latest raylib release. As usual, **many parts of the library have been reviewed and improved** along those months. Many issues have been closed, staying under 10 open issues at the moment of this writting and also many PRs from contributors have been received, reviewed and merged into raylib library. Some new functions have been added and some others have been removed to improve library coherence and avoid moving too high level, giving the users the tools to implement advance functionality themselfs over raylib. Again, this is a big release with a considerable amount of changes and improvements. Here it is a small summary highlighting this new **rayib 4.5**.

Some numbers for this release:

* **+100** closed issues (for a TOTAL of **+1340**!)
* **+350** commits since previous RELEASE (for a TOTAL of **+6350**!)
* **+25** functions ADDED to raylib API (for a TOTAL of **516**!)
* **+40** functions REVIEWED/REDESIGNED
* **+40** new contributors (for a TOTAL of **405**!)

Highlights for `raylib 4.5`:

* **`NEW` Improved ANGLE support on Desktop platforms**: Support for OpenGL ES 2.0 on Desktop platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS) has been reviewed by [@wtnbgo](https://github.com/wtnbgo) GitHub user. Now raylib can be compiled on desktop for OpenGL ES 2.0 and linked against [`ANGLE`](https://github.com/google/angle). This *small* addition open the door to building raylib for all **ANGLE supported backends: Direct3D 11, Vulkan and Metal**. Please note that this new feature is still experimental and requires further testing!
* **`NEW` Camera module**: A brand new implementation from scratch for `rcamera` module, contributed by [@Crydsch](https://github.com/Crydsch) GitHub user! **New camera system is simpler, more flexible, more granular and more extendable**. Specific camera math transformations (movement/rotation) have been moved to individual functions, exposing them to users if required. Global state has been removed from the module and standalone usage has been greatly improved; now `rcamera.h` single-file header-only library can be used externally, independently of raylib. A new `UpdateCameraPro()` function has been added to address input-dependency of `UpdateCamera()`, now advance users have **full control over camera inputs and movement/rotation speeds**!
* **`NEW` Support for M3D models and M3D/GLTF animations**: 3d models animations support has been a limited aspect of raylib for long time, some versions ago IQM animations were supported but raylib 4.5 also adds support for the brand new [M3D file format](https://bztsrc.gitlab.io/model3d/), including animations and the long expected support for **GLTF animations**! The new M3D file format is **simple, portable, feature complete, extensible and open source**. It also provides a complete set of tools to export/visualize M3D models from/to Blender! Now raylib supports up to **3 model file-formats with animations**: `IQM`, `GLTF` and `M3D`.
* **`NEW` Support QOA audio format (import/export)**: Just a couple of months ago the new [QOA file format](https://qoaformat.org/) was published, a very simple, portable and open source quite-ok-audio file format. raylib already supports it, added to `raudio` module and including audio loading from file, loading from memory, streaming from file, streaming from memory and **exporting to QOA** audio format. **Because simplicity really matters to raylib!**
* **`NEW` Module for compressed textures loading**: [`rl_gputex`](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/blob/master/src/external/rl_gputex.h), a portable single-file header-only small library to load compressed texture file-formats (DDS, PKM, KTX, PVR, ASTC). Provided functionality is not new to raylib but it was part of the raylib `rtextures` module, now it has been moved into a separate self-contained library, **improving portability**. Note that this module is only intended to **load compressed data from files, ready to be uploaded to GPU**, no compression/decompression functionality is provided. This change is a first step towards a better modularization of raylib library.
* **Reviewed `rlgl` module for automatic limits checking**: Again, [`rlgl`](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/blob/master/src/rlgl.h) has been reviewed to simplify usage. Now users do not need to worry about reaching the internal render-batch limits when they send their triangles to draw 2d/3d, `rlgl` manages it automatically! This change allows a **great simplification for other modules** like `rshapes`, `rtextures` and `rmodels` that do not need to worry about bufffer overflows and can just define as many vertex as desired!
* **Reviewed `rshapes` module to minimize the rlgl dependency**: Now `rshapes` 2d shapes drawing functions **only depend on 6 low-level functions**: `rlBegin()`, `rlEnd()`, `rlVertex3f()`, `rlTexCoord2f()`, `rlNormal3f()`, `rlSetTexture()`. With only those pseudo-OpenGl 1.1 minimal functionality, everything can be drawn! This improvement converts `rshapes` module in a **self-contained, portable shapes-drawing library that can be used independently of raylib**, as far as entry points for those 6 functions are provided by the user. It even allows to be used for software rendering, with the proper backend!
* **Added data structures validation functions**: Multiple functions have been added by [@RobLoach](https://github.com/RobLoach) GitHub user to ease the validation of raylib data structures: `IsImageReady()`, `IsTextureReady()`, `IsSoundReady()`... Now users have a simple mechanism to **make sure data has been correctly loaded**, instead of checking internal structure values by themselfs.

As usual, those are only some highlights but there is much more! New image generators, new color transformation functionality, improved blending support for color/alpha, etc... Make sure to check raylib [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/blob/master/CHANGELOG) for a detailed list of changes! Please, note that all breaking changes have been flagged with a `WARNING` in the CHANGELOG, specially useful for binding creators!

**raylib keeps improving one more version** with a special focus on maintainability and sustainability. Always working towards making the library more **simple and easy-to-use**.

Let's keep **enjoying games/tools/graphics programming!** :)

## How to fix?

Upgrade `raysan5/raylib` to version 4.5.0 or higher.

## Overview

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) such that the `SetClipboardText` API does not properly escape the `'` character, allowing attacker-controlled input to break out of the string and execute arbitrary JavaScript via `emscripten_run_script` function.

**Note:** This vulnerability is present only when compiling raylib for PLATFORM\_WEB. All the other Desktop/Mobile/Embedded platforms are not affected.

## PoC

```
SetClipboardText("asd');alert('fizz');//");

```
## Details

A cross-site scripting attack occurs when the attacker tricks a legitimate web-based application or site to accept a request as originating from a trusted source.

This is done by escaping the context of the web application; the web application then delivers that data to its users along with other trusted dynamic content, without validating it. The browser unknowingly executes malicious script on the client side (through client-side languages; usually JavaScript or HTML) in order to perform actions that are otherwise typically blocked by the browser’s Same Origin Policy.

Injecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS is exploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this manipulation is the top method for securing code against this vulnerability.

Escaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example, in HTML, `<` can be coded as `&lt`; and `>` can be coded as `&gt`; in order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags. If malicious content is injected into an application that escapes special characters and that malicious content uses `<` and `>` as HTML tags, those characters are nonetheless not interpreted as HTML tags by the browser if they’ve been correctly escaped in the application code and in this way the attempted attack is diverted.

The most prominent use of XSS is to steal cookies (source: OWASP HttpOnly) and hijack user sessions, but XSS exploits have been used to expose sensitive information, enable access to privileged services and functionality and deliver malware.

### Types of attacks

There are a few methods by which XSS can be manipulated:

| Type | Origin | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Stored** | Server | The malicious code is inserted in the application (usually as a link) by the attacker. The code is activated every time a user clicks the link. |
| **Reflected** | Server | The attacker delivers a malicious link externally from the vulnerable web site application to a user. When clicked, malicious code is sent to the vulnerable web site, which reflects the attack back to the user’s browser. |
| **DOM-based** | Client | The attacker forces the user’s browser to render a malicious page. The data in the page itself delivers the cross-site scripting data. |
| **Mutated** |  | The attacker injects code that appears safe, but is then rewritten and modified by the browser, while parsing the markup. An example is rebalancing unclosed quotation marks or even adding quotation marks to unquoted parameters. |

### Affected environments

The following environments are susceptible to an XSS attack:

* Web servers
* Application servers
* Web application environments

### How to prevent

This section describes the top best practices designed to specifically protect your code:

* Sanitize data input in an HTTP request before reflecting it back, ensuring all data is validated, filtered or escaped before echoing anything back to the user, such as the values of query parameters during searches.
* Convert special characters such as `?`, `&`, `/`, `<`, `>` and spaces to their respective HTML or URL encoded equivalents.
* Give users the option to disable client-side scripts.
* Redirect invalid requests.
* Detect simultaneous logins, including those from two separate IP addresses, and invalidate those sessions.
* Use and enforce a Content Security Policy (source: Wikipedia) to disable any features that might be manipulated for an XSS attack.
* Read the documentation for any of the libraries referenced in your code to understand which elements allow for embedded HTML.

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

6.1 medium

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited. For example, a successful exploit may only be possible during the installation of an application by a system administrator.

  **Required**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can affect resources beyond the security scope managed by the security authority of the vulnerable component. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are different and managed by different security authorities.

  **Changed**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Integrity (I)

  Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Availability (A)

  There is no impact to availability within the impacted component.

  **None**

| **WARNING: Please, read this note carefully before submitting a new issue:**  It is important to realise that **this is NOT A SUPPORT FORUM**, this is for reproducible BUGS with raylib ONLY.  There are lots of generous and helpful people ready to help you out on [raylib Discord forum](https://discord.gg/raylib) or [raylib reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/raylib/).  Remember that asking for support questi Uploading raylib-game-template.zip… ons here actively takes developer time away from improving raylib.   ---   Please, before submitting a new issue verify and check:   * I tested it on latest raylib version from master branch * I checked there is no similar issue already reported * My code has no errors or misuse of raylib  Issue description The `SetClipboardText` API is vulnerable to JavaScript injection/cross-site scripting for the web platform because it does not properly escape the `'` character, allowing attacker-controlled input to break out of the string and execute arbitrary JavaScript via `emscripten_run_script`.  ``` // Set clipboard text content void SetClipboardText(const char *text) { #if defined(PLATFORM_DESKTOP)     glfwSetClipboardString(CORE.Window.handle, text); #endif #if defined(PLATFORM_WEB)     emscripten_run_script(TextFormat("navigator.clipboard.writeText('%s')", text)); #endif }  ```  If `text` contains something like `');alert()//`, the browser would also execute the `alert()` function.  I noticed that `OpenUrl` already implements a check for this but it is missing for `SetClipboardText`.  ``` // Small security check trying to avoid (partially) malicious code...     // sorry for the inconvenience when you hit this point...     if (strchr(url, '\'') != NULL)     {         TRACELOG(LOG_WARNING, "SYSTEM: Provided URL is not valid");     }  ```  This is a good start and prevented `OpenUrl` from being exploited. I recommend adding a sanitization function to escape any `'` characters instead for all 5 calls to `emscripten_run_script`: <https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Araysan5%2Fraylib+emscripten_run_script&type=code>. Environment *Provide your Platform, Operating System, OpenGL version, GPU details where you experienced the issue.*  Web Issue Screenshot *If possible, provide a screenshot that illustrates the issue. Usually an image is better than a thousand words.* Code Example Uploading raylib-game-template.zip…  *Provide minimal reproduction code to test the issue. Please, format the code properly and try to keep it as simple as possible, just focusing on the experienced issue.*   1. Using the source code at <https://github.com/raysan5/raylib-game-template>, add the line `SetClipboardText("asd');alert('fizz');//");` in `int main(void)` in `raylib-game-template/src/raylib_game.c` to simulate `SetClipboardText` being called with malicious user input. 2. Build using `make PLATFORM=PLATFORM_WEB` then browse to the hosted `raylib_game.html`. The alert box will pop. |

| That's a good catch with respect to URLs. Will %-encoding get around this protection though? |

| Hi [@orcmid](https://github.com/orcmid) , not so much %-encoding; the problem is in breaking out of the `'%s'` using the `'` character, but a newline character could do the trick as well. One way to sanitize it reliably may be to hex-encode the resulting string e.g. convert `ABC'` to `\\x41\\x42\\x43\\x27` before adding it to the format string template. Then the resulting JavaScript code that is executed would be `navigator.clipboard.writeText('\x41\x42\x43\x27')`. |

| [@spaceraccoon](https://github.com/spaceraccoon) thank you very much for reporting! I'm reviewing it right now, at least a basic solution not implying generating new string data, like in `OpenURL()`. |
