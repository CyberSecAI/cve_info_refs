Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-26923:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies within the `MidiFile::skip` function in `src/importexport/midi/internal/midishared/midifile.cpp` of MuseScore.
- Specifically, in the Windows version, when using the MSVC compiler, the function uses a fixed-size temporary buffer (`tmp`) of 256 bytes.
-  The code reads data from a file using a loop where the read size is fixed to `tmp_size` (256 bytes) and it continues while `len` (the number of bytes to skip) is bigger than `tmp_size`. The vulnerability is caused by an incorrect read of `len` instead of `tmp_size` in the loop. After the loop, another read is performed of `tmp_size` bytes instead of `len`, which, in this case, is equal or less than 256.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Stack Buffer Overflow:**  The `read` function attempts to read a number of bytes specified by `len`, but the destination buffer, `tmp`, is of size 256 bytes. This results in a stack buffer overflow if `len` is greater than 256.
- **Incorrect Loop Logic:** The loop reads `tmp_size` bytes but decrements len by `tmp_size`, thus calculating the correct amount of bytes that are remaining to skip, and performing the final read correctly, making it impossible to trigger the stack buffer overflow if `len` is greater than 256,  unless if the attacker provides a midi file where `len` is bigger than 256 bytes *in the first read*.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker who can control the size of `len` in the `skip` function and, knowing the stack cookie value, can overwrite the stack and execute arbitrary code.
- **Denial of Service:** A buffer overflow can also result in a crash of the application, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious MIDI File:** The attacker would need to craft a malicious MIDI file containing a large value for `len`, such that when the vulnerable code parses it and attempts to "skip" through the data, a stack buffer overflow is triggered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Provide Malicious MIDI File:** The attacker needs the ability to supply a specially crafted MIDI file to the MuseScore application.
- **(Optional) Knowledge of Stack Cookie Value:** While not explicitly required for a DoS, knowledge of stack cookie value is required to achieve code execution.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability affects MuseScore versions 3.0 to 4.0.1 on Windows.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 4.0.2 and in a specific branch (3.7) maintained by Jojo-Schmitz
- The vulnerability is classified as high severity.
- The CVSS v3 score is 7.0, with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H.
