Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-26134

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `gitCommitInfo()` method in the `git-commit-info` package fails to sanitize the `commit` parameter. This unsanitized parameter is then passed to a command execution API.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The lack of sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the system where the vulnerable package is used, potentially leading to:
    -  Data breaches
    -  System compromise
    -  Denial of service

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker needs to control the value of the `commit` parameter passed to the `gitCommitInfo()` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to influence the `commit` parameter. This could be through:
    -  Directly manipulating the input to the vulnerable application.
    -  Compromising a component that provides input to the application.

**Technical Details:**
- The proof of concept (PoC) demonstrates the vulnerability by injecting a command to create a file named `ci`.
- The fix involves validating the commit hash to ensure it matches the expected format.
- The vulnerable code does not validate the commit parameter before passing it to the git command, allowing for injection.
- The fix implemented uses the regex `/^[0-9a-f]{7,40}$/` to validate the commit hash parameter.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in `git-commit-info` versions prior to `2.0.2`.
- Snyk provides a CVSS score of 9.8 (Critical) for this vulnerability.
- The attack vector is network based, and the attack complexity is low.
- No privileges or user interaction are required for successful exploitation.
