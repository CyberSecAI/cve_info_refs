{
  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2023-26154",
    "details": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient entropy in the `getKey` function when using the `AES-256-CBC` algorithm. The encryption key is derived by hashing a user-provided key string with SHA-256, then hex encoding it, and finally trimming it to 32 bytes. The hex encoding and trimming process results in half of the key bits being the same for every encoded message or file, thus significantly reducing the key's entropy and making it more vulnerable to brute-force attacks. This issue affects multiple pubnub packages across various platforms.",
