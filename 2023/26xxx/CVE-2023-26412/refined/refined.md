- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Stack-based buffer overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of the vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local (AV:L).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not require any privileges (PR:N), but user interaction is required (UI:R). The attack does not require the attacker to have special access or privileges on the target system other than the ability to interact with the application.
