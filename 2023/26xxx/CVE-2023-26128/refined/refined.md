- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing input sanitization in the `installModule` function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Total loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. An attacker can gain complete control over the affected system.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker injects malicious commands through the `moduleName` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to run Node.js code within the target environment and to pass a malicious string to the vulnerable function. This often implies some access to the system or application hosting the Node.js environment.
