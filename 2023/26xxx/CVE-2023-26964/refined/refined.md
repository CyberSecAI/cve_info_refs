{
  "CVE-2023-26964": {
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The h2 library incorrectly processes HTTP2 `RST_STREAM` frames by not always releasing memory immediately upon receiving a reset frame, leading to stream stacking.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Resource exhaustion",
        "Denial of Service (DoS)"
      ],
      "impact": "High memory and CPU usage, potentially leading to a Denial of Service (DoS).",
      "attack_vectors": "Sending a flood of HTTP2 `HEADERS` frames followed by `RST_STREAM` frames.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP2 frames faster than the server's accept loop can process them. This is easier to achieve on localhost, due to low latency."
    },
    "affected_components": [
      {
        "name": "h2",
        "versions": [
          "< 0.3.17"
        ]
      }
    ],
      "additional_notes": "The vulnerability is present in the `h2` crate and affects applications using HTTP/2 connections. The issue was addressed in [hyperium/h2#668](https://github.com/hyperium/h2/pull/668) by limiting the number of pending-accept reset streams. The initial report [hyperium/hyper#2877](https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/issues/2877) indicated a stream stacking issue. The fix introduces a maximum count for streams in the pending-accept but remotely-reset state, and sends a GOAWAY frame when the limit is reached."
